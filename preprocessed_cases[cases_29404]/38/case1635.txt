appellants are retired public employees and members of the fresno county employees retirement association fcera.from to,if a member of fcera qualified for a disability retirement,the amount of his or her monthly retirement allowance was calculated based on an enhanced benefits formula that exceeded the formula provided in the statutes governing such matters as found in the county employees retirement law of,et.cerl the rationale for using the enhanced benefits formula was an interoffice letter by the chief deputy county counsel stating that,in his opinion,a settlement agreement the settlement agreement,which resolved certain claims against the county of fresno the county,fcera,and others,relating to retirement benefits,was intended to include an enhancement of disability retirement benefits.the letter advised that disability retirement allowances should be increased according to a formula attached to the letter.fcera followed that advice,even though the settlement agreement had enhanced only service retirement benefits and was silent as to disability retirement benefits.in,the governing board of fcera,known as the board of retirement the board,reexamined the issue and concluded that it had been erroneously using the enhanced benefits formula to calculate disability retirement,and it voted to discontinue that practice.appellants then filed the present action against the board,fcera,the county,and other plan sponsors collectively respondents,to require them to resume the use of the enhanced benefits formula.respondents demurred.after allowing several opportunities to amend,the trial court sustained respondents demurrer to appellants third amended petition without leave to amend on the ground that,as a matter of law,the settlement agreement did not include the enhanced benefits formula for disability retirement.appellants appeal from the resulting judgment,arguing that under the recent supreme court case of retired employees of orange county,county of orange cal th retired employees,the enhanced benefits formula for disability retirement was arguably an implied term of the settlement agreement.we disagree and will affirm the judgment of the trial court.
background and procedural history 
cerl the statutory backdrop 
fcera is a public retirement trust that exists to administer benefits for active and retired public employees in fresno county.it operates under the provisions of cerl.stillman board of retirement of fresno county employees retirement th.upon satisfying age and service requirements,members of a county retirement system governed by cerl such as fcera qualify to receive a service retirement allowance.a member service retirement allowance is determined under one of the statutory formulas set forth in cerl,upon adoption thereof by a county board of supervisors.
when a member of fcera is incapacitated due to a disability,he or she may be entitled to receive a disability retirement allowance from fcera.see et if the disability was not in the course of or caused by the member employment,the member may be entitled to what is called a disability retirement allowance.see general members,safety members.if a member qualifies for a disability retirement,the monthly allowance is calculated under a formula that appears in the applicable section of cerl.see general members,safety members.a separate statutory formula is used for disability.service is not at issue in this case.
the ventura decision and its aftermath 
as noted,appellants contend that monthly retirement allowances paid by fcera for disabilities must be calculated under an enhanced benefits formula that is greater than the cerl formula.appellants argue they acquired such rights as an implied term of the settlement agreement.before we discuss the settlement agreement itself,it is necessary as background to briefly note the supreme court decision of ventura county deputy sheriffs board of retirement cal th ventura,since that decision was the basis for the class action claims that were settled in the settlement agreement.
in ventura,the supreme court engaged in extensive statutory analysis of certain sections of cerl to interpret the meaning of compensation and compensation earnable in order to ascertain what must be included in an employee final compensation for purposes of calculating his or her retirement pension under cerl.ventura,supra,cal th at.the supreme court held that in addition to an employee base salary,other forms of cash remuneration excluding overtime had to be included in calculating his or her final compensation for purposes of a cerl retirement pension,such as educational pay,bilingual pay,payments in lieu of accrued vacation time,uniform maintenance allowances.ibid.in so holding,the supreme court disapproved a longstanding court of appeal decision upon which ventura county,among many other counties,had relied in making actuarial calculations.id.at.the supreme court concluded its opinion in ventura with the following remedial directives there may be unanticipated costs to ventura county if the pensions of the individual plaintiffs and the employees the association represents must be recalculated and adjusted upward.if so,to comply with the financial provisions of cerl citation and accommodate future increases,the county may have to make a supplemental appropriation and adjust the future annual appropriation for its contribution to the pension fund to cover the increase in future retiree pensions that results from inclusion of additional items of compensation in compensation earnable.id.at.
in the aftermath of ventura,a number of class action lawsuits were filed in various counties,alleging noncompliance with ventura in the computation of retirement benefits and seeking to make the ventura decision retroactive.several such class action lawsuits were filed in fresno county superior court against fcera the county,which cases were consolidated and coordinated to san francisco county superior court.these cases were and are collectively referred to as ventura ii litigation.the parties to the fresno county ventura ii litigation reached a final settlement pursuant to a settlement agreement that is described below.
the settlement agreement 
the settlement of the fresno county ventura ii litigation entailed two consecutive settlement agreements,the first of which was executed in july august the first agreement,but it was.the first agreement provided,among other things,that a ll parties agree to an enhanced formula for service retirement benefits for both general and safety members in accordance with an attachment thereto.it also required the parties to cooperate in facilitating the passage of enabling amendment of cerl necessary to provide the enhanced formula.a notice was sent to all class members to advise them of the terms of the settlement,and san francisco county superior court approved the class action settlement.however,when the proposed enabling legislation was vetoed by the governor,it rendered the first agreement null and void.
in october,the parties negotiated and executed a second settlement agreement that was later approved by san francisco superior court.this became the operative settlement agreement between the parties and is referred to herein as the settlement agreement.section of the settlement agreement provided that a ll parties agree that the county board of supervisors will adopt by resolution the service retirement formula for general members provided by section,to be effective january,and adopt a resolution provided by section effective january,to make the section formula retroactive for all service credit earned by employees retiring on or after january.section further provided that only class members retiring on or after january,would be entitled to the benefits provided in section.additionally,in section of the settlement agreement,the parties agreed to cooperate in facilitating passage of an enabling amendment of cerl to provide an enhanced formula for service retirement benefits equal to two and one half percent at age for general members and two and one half percent at age for safety members.u pon the effective date of such amendment,benefits for employees retiring on and after january,shall be provided under that enhanced formula rather than as provided in section.persons who retired before january,would not be entitled to the benefits indicated in sections or,but would receive an increase of per month service benefit for each full year of service subject to a maximum of years service,a maximum of.as with the first agreement,the settlement agreement expressly mentioned and enhanced only service retirement benefits it was completely silent as to disability retirement.
by its terms,the settlement agreement purported to be a compromise that was meant to fully resolve and settle all of the fresno county ventura ii lawsuits and all issues between the parties therein,and it included mutual waivers and releases,along with a promise to forbear from any future lawsuit or claim relating to the scope of the ventura supreme court opinion or to the items of compensation to be included for purposes of cerl.not only was the settlement agreement intended to settle all issues among the p arties,but it was expressly agreed that it was complete and final with respect to those issues.
moreover,section of the settlement agreement stated as follows this settlement agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the p arties.the p arties expressly acknowledge that no other agreements,arrangements,or understandings exist among them that are not expressed in this settlement agreement.italics added.in section,the parties acknowledged that the settlement agreement was clear and unambiguous,was reviewed by all counsel,and it was agreed that no parol or other evidence outside this agreement may be used to explain,construe,contradict,or clarify the terms of the settlement agreement,the intent of the p arties or their counsel,or the circumstances under which the settlement agreement was made or executed.in section,the parties further agreed the settlement agreement could only be amended,modified or expanded by written agreement of those parties affected by the particular amendment sought.
after all members of the class action were notified of the terms of the settlement agreement,the trial court approved it and a judgment was entered thereon.approximately signatures were affixed to the settlement agreement,most of which were the signatures of attorneys who had reviewed the document on behalf of their respective client or clients,and by signing indicated approval and acceptance thereof.among the attorneys who signed the settlement agreement was wesley merritt of the fresno county counsel office.he had also signed the first agreement.
the opinion letter 
on october,in response to a request from the fresno county auditor controller for a legal opinion on the issue of computing disability retirement benefits following the settlement of the ventura ii class action litigation,chief deputy county counsel wesley merritt wrote a confidential letter stating as follows 
we conclude that disability retirement benefits should be computed based on an enhanced formula commensurate with the enhanced benefits extended to service retirees under the settlement agreement.
in ventura,supra,cal th,the california supreme court expanded what must be included in an employee compensation for purposes of computing retirement benefits.successor ventura ii lawsuits were then filed seeking to make the ventura decision retroactive and add additional items to an employee compensation for purposes of computing retirement benefits.
we first attempted settlement of these fresno county ventura ii cases by an agreement executed in july and august.that initial agreement called for enhanced service retirement benefits at at age for general members and at age for safety members,to be accomplished by amendment of cerl.at the time of that initial agreement,the retirement system actuaries also drafted proposed amendments to cerl for enhanced disability retirement benefits copy attached.the proposed amendments prescribed a disability retirement benefits formula commensurate with the enhanced retirement benefits extended to service retirees under the settlement agreement.however,contrary to enhanced service retirement benefits,the proposed statutory amendments for enhanced disability retirement benefits were never finalized for submission to the governor.
the governor vetoed the enabling service retirement legislation proposed under the initial settlement agreement.the parties then negotiated and executed a second settlement agreement.under that second agreement,the same enhanced service retirement benefits were provided however,the second agreement is silent on disability retirement benefits.
it was obviously the intent of the parties to the second settlement agreement to include enhanced disability retirement benefits equal to those proposed under the initial agreement.we therefore advise that you compute disability retirement benefits under the attached enhanced formula drafted by the actuaries for the initial agreement,disability retirement benefits commensurate with the enhanced benefits for service retirees.we also advise that you pursue enactment of the disability formula into cerl just as we are pursuing statutory enactment of the service retirement benefit tables.
merritt letter indicated he was under the impression that the first agreement included an enhancement of disability benefits.we note that,in reality,neither the first agreement nor the settlement agreement did so at least not expressly.the attachment to merritt letter appears to be a photocopy of section of cerl with some handwritten notations on it.where the photocopy of the existing statute set forth the formula as n inety percent of of his final compensation multiplied by the number of years of service credited to him,the word was crossed out where it appeared in the statute and was replaced by a handwritten insertion of the word.this was the enhanced benefits formula that merritt advised should be used in computing disability retirement.in reliance on the advice of county counsel,fcera paid disability benefits in accordance with this enhanced benefits formula from approximately to.
in late,new counsel for the board reviewed the matter and advised the board that it could no longer use the enhanced formula for paying disability retirement.after a series of public meetings were held concerning the issue,the board elected to discontinue use of the enhanced benefits formula for disability,effective as of june.as of that date,the board would pay a retirement allowance for disability in accordance with the provisions of cerl.the board also decided it would waive any recovery of past overpayments.
proceedings in the trial court 
appellants then filed the present lawsuit,seeking to compel respondents to resume the use of the enhanced formula for calculating disability retirement benefits.after a series of demurrers and opportunities to amend,appellants filed their third amended petition on july.the attachments to the third amended petition included the first agreement,the court order approving it,the settlement agreement,the court order approving it,and merritt opinion letter.
the third amended petition set forth five causes of action a first and second cause of action for writ of mandate,a third cause of action for reformation of contract,a fourth cause of action for breach of contract,and a fifth cause of action for rights under the ventura case.the first through fourth causes of action claimed that appellants were entitled to the enhanced benefits formula for disability retirement based on the settlement agreement.in essence,the first through fourth causes of action were premised on appellants assertion that the right to receive the enhanced disability benefits was an implied term of the settlement agreement.the fifth cause of action claimed,in the alternative,that if the settlement agreement did not create such rights,then appellants were entitled to such rights under the principles of the ventura case.
respondents demurred to the third amended petition on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action because the settlement agreement did not include disability retirement benefits and because the clear terms of the settlement agreement foreclosed all of appellant claims.the trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
the trial court order explained the manifest intent of the parties to the contract was to have an agreement that would not be subject to attack.they included every waiver and finding known to the law at the time to avoid future litigating of any ventura issues.it was clearly the intent to have this agreement be the end.permitting count four to proceed would be ignoring this intent and depriving defendants of the benefit of the bargain.through two court hearings and agreements the connected disability nscd retirees were not included in the agreement.fresno county chief deputy county counsel wesley merritt signed this contract that contains waivers and asserts there are no ambiguities.the terms of his later letter to the fresno county auditor controller make clear that he realized that the agreement he signed did not cover the nscd retirees and that a change in the law was necessary for them to be covered there is nothing in the legal record that warrants a finding of ambiguity in the terms of the contract and the contract clearly waives future modifications for omitted terms.
after the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend,the third amended petition was dismissed with prejudice and judgment entered for respondents.appellants appealed from the judgment.

ii.the demurrer was correctly sustained 
appellants do not deny that the settlement agreement was silent about disability benefits.they do not claim to state a cause of action for breach of an express term of a contract.rather,appellants argue the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend because,under the principles set forth in the recent supreme court case of retired employees,supra,cal th,they stated a cause of action for an implied contract term to provide disability retirement under the enhanced benefits formula.in order to assess the merits of appellants argument,we begin our discussion with an overview of the retired employees decision.
retired employees,supra,cal th 
in retired employees,the supreme court was asked by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit to address the abstract question of w hether,as a matter of california law,a california county and its employees can form an implied contract that confers vested rights to health benefits on retired county employees.retired employees,supra,cal th at.the supreme court concluded that under certain circumstances and as long as no statute or ordinance would prohibit such arrangements,a county may be bound by an implied contract.id.at.
however,a county ability to enter an implied contract regarding issues of employee compensation is limited by the constraints of section.retired employees,supra,cal th at.that statute provides as follows the board of supervisors shall prescribe the compensation of all county officers and shall provide for the number,compensation,tenure,appointment and conditions of employment of county employees s uch action may be taken by resolution of the board of supervisors as well as by ordinance.the supreme court explained the implications of this statute on implied contracts although section does require that compensation of county employees be addressed in an ordinance or resolution,the statute does not prohibit a county from forming a contract with implied terms,inasmuch as contractual rights may be implied from an ordinance or resolution when the language or circumstances accompanying its passage clearly evince a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the county.retired employees,supra,at.to summarize,the supreme court held that while it is possible that contractual rights regarding employee compensation may be implied from a resolution,the applicable resolution remains the essential source of the parties contractual rights and obligations.id.at a court must look to resolutions to determine contract rights.
in retired employees,the facts of the underlying ninth circuit case provided a backdrop for some of the supreme court discussion of this issue.we briefly summarize those underlying facts.orange county began in to combine active and retired employees into a single,unified pool for purposes of calculating health insurance premiums.that practice resulted in lower premiums for retirees,higher premiums for active employees and increased total contributions by the county.orange county continued the pooling arrangement each year from through.retired employees,supra,cal th at.in doing so,it relied on the annual motions and resolutions of the board of supervisors setting health premiums during the relevant period,each of which specified health insurance rates only for that plan year.id.at.in,due to budgetary concerns,orange county passed a resolution splitting the pool of active and retired employees,effective january.the retired employees association of orange county reaoc filed suit in federal court to compel orange county to continue the health insurance pooling.reaoc conceded that the express provisions of the various memoranda of understanding mou and the orange county board of supervisors resolutions approving the mou were silent as to the duration of the unified pool.nevertheless,reaoc argued that the county and consistent practice of pooling active and retired employees,along with the county representations to employees regarding a unified pool,evidenced an implied provision that the single,unified pool was a vested right.id.at.in other words,reaoc asserted that a vested right to the pooling arrangement was an implied term of the existing contract approved by the orange county board of supervisors by resolution.this argument for an implied term was an important distinction noted by the supreme court reaoc sought recognition only of an implied term of an existing contract and not the recognition of an implied contract.that matters of compensation must be addressed by resolution does not necessarily bar recognition of implied terms concerning compensation.under california law,contractual rights may be implied from legislative enactments,resolutions under limited circumstances id.at.
the supreme court then proceeded to explain why contractual rights may only be implied from a legislative enactment in limited circumstances.a resolution by a county board does not only or even primarily establish contract rights.a re
