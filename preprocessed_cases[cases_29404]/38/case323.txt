willie boyd appeals the district court judgment affirming the commissioner decision to deny him disability benefits.boyd asserts that the administrative law judge alj applied an incorrect legal standard in assessing the extent of boyd ability to work,and that the alj decision was unsupported by the evidence.this court finds that the alj did apply the correct legal standard,but that the evidence was not sufficient to satisfy the commissioner burden to show that despite his impairments,boyd was able to perform available work.this court vacates the alj ruling and remands this case to the commission for further consideration.
background 
willie boyd was born in and attended school through the tenth grade.he later obtained a ged.boyd worked as a welder for eleven years,until april,when he lost his job after missing thirty of his last ninety days of work due to illness.in april,boyd received hospital treatment for complaints of pain and high blood pressure.he was given a prescription for antidepressant medication and instructed to decrease his alcohol consumption.he briefly attempted to work as a general laborer in june and has not worked since.boyd asserts that he has been completely disabled since that date.
in october,boyd returned to the hospital for another examination.on that visit,he was diagnosed with liver damage and was again instructed to stop drinking.on december,boyd filed for disability benefits under the social security act,alleging that the combined effects of hepatitis,hypertension,dizziness,leg and back pain,and fatigue made him unable to work.
in february,boyd was again hospitalized.doctors diagnosed him as suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis and mild to moderate pancreatitis.doctors removed his gall bladder through laparoscopic surgery.boyd initial claim for disability benefits was denied on march.he requested a hearing before an administrative law judge,but his illnesses delayed the hearing until june.
in october,boyd treating internist referred him to a psychiatric clinic.in january,juanaelena garcia examined boyd.garcia report of the january examination described symptoms of weekly anxiety attacks,which she diagnosed as the result of m ajor depressive disorder,single episode,moderate,and an adjustment disorder involving anxiety and depression,for which she prescribed an antidepressant,prozac.garcia determined that boyd had a global assessment of functioning gaf score of,a score reflecting moderate symptoms flat affect and circumstantial speech,occasional panic attacks or any moderate difficulty in social,occupational,or school function,few friends,conflicts with peers or.garcia also observed that boyd was and told him that the antidepressant medication would not be effective unless he stopped drinking.on june,during one of boyd return visits,garcia increased boyd prozac dose to treat a relapse of depressive symptoms.garcia notes of the june examination state her opinion that boyd would be unable to work for a year and that he had a poor prognosis.in june,boyd was hospitalized for a complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath and discharged with medication to treat his hypertension.
the alj held a hearing on boyd disability claim on june.the alj heard testimony from boyd his wife,diana boyd a medical expert,william daily and a vocational expert,susan brooks.the alj had garcia records relating to boyd,but heard no testimony from garcia.the only medical testimony at the hearing pertained to boyd exertional impairments 
at the hearing,boyd testified that he suffered from liver problems,diabetes,high blood pressure,pain,panic attacks,depression,suicidal thoughts,and hallucinations.boyd testified that he could lift ten pounds and stand for fifteen to twenty minutes.although boyd had completed the tenth grade and later obtained a ged,his spelling and arithmetic skills were significantly below high school level.boyd testified that he had been fired from his last job as a certified class a welder in april,after missing a total one month of work time out of the previous three months.he testified that he tried to return to work as a general laborer in june,but again missed many days of work and was unable to continue.

the commissioner called daily,a specialist in internal medicine,to testify.daily did not review the psychiatric records or provide any information as to boyd nonexertional impairments.daily testified that the medical records showed that boyd suffered from controllable hypertension diabetes mellitus,in temporary complete remission chronic hepatitis b and hepatitis c infections chest pain pain in his extremities possibly caused by diabetic neuropathy and cirrhosis.daily testified that the combination of boyd physical problems had totally incapacitated him on an intermittent basis since april.
susan brooks,the vocational expert,testified that boyd previous work as a welder was classified as medium,skilled labor,and that his work as a laborer was classified as medium,unskilled labor.the alj asked brooks a series of hypothetical questions about the kinds of work a person with assumed impairments would be able to perform 
q all right.assume that i find that he can do a full range,that a person years of age,with that past work history,tenth grade education,can do a full range of light work 
a i sorry,you said a tenth grade education 
q tenth grade education,can do a full range of light work i know i can take the grids on that,but i want to ask you if you could assume that i find that this man has such disturbance to the extent that his maybe,his concentration or memory is limited,so that if he does work,he got to work in a simple,one or jobs.i do know if his skills or like sic transferable to the simple job like that,or just any kind of a job,where he does not have to remember complex instructions,but can understand simple instructions,and where he can carry out,does not have stay on task a full eight hours,but he does not have to think about things too much,just work 
a in my opinion,it kind of a misconception about the one to jobs,that most of the jobs,they have several steps.that is an unskilled level.they not complex steps.
q okay.no that the flush out sic.
a so,at an unskilled level,i think that primary sic what you looking at,is jobs that are not complex,that require less than days of training.
hearing transcript.
based on this hypothetical question,brooks testified that boyd would be able to work as a production line welder,as a coin collector,or in hardware assembly.brooks classified each of these occupations as light,unskilled work that occurred in significant numbers in the local and national economies.
after the hearing ended,the alj ordered boyd examined by a consulting psychologist.boyd was examined by diana garrison,under the supervision of joanna ellis,and by pepermintwala,a psychiatrist at parkland hospital.the results of their evaluations were a psychological report prepared by diana garrison a medical assessment of ability to do activities prepared by ellis and an affective disorders form and a severity of impairment form completed by pepermintwala.
in her psychological report,garrison diagnosed boyd as suffering from psychotic disorder,chronic alcohol dependence,and an cognitive disorder.garrison administered a number of tests to measure intellectual and other functioning levels she assessed boyd as,within the borderline intellectual functioning range under the activities of daily living section of the psychological report,garrison reported,based on boyd representations,that boyd could tend to basic tasks,but was unable to drive due to panic attacks and could not manage his own finances.garrison reported that boyd had a tendency to avoid others and that his concentration,persistence,and pace were good garrison concluded that boyd had a gaf of.a gaf score of to is classified as reflecting serious symptoms,suicidal ideation,severe obsessional rituals,frequent shoplifting or any serious impairment in social,occupational,or school functioning,no friends,unable to keep a job.
ellis assessed boyd ability to perform mental tasks.in her report,ellis stated that boyd exhibits few adaptive coping skills or adequate social skills and that his ability to deal with work stresses and function independently was.these limitations resulted in the need for close supervision and considerable as concerns taking on job responsibilities,as well as an inclination to avoid situations in which he is expected to interact with the public.
in his assessments,pepermintwala,an examining psychiatrist,concluded that boyd had major depressive disorder with psychotic features,with slight restriction of activities in daily living marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning and frequent deficiencies in concentration,persistence,or pace.
the alj issued his decision denying boyd benefits on january.the alj found that boyd physical,exertional impairments did not limit his ability to sit,stand,or lift,and did not preclude him from performing a full range of light work.to analyze boyd nonexertional impairments,the alj completed a psychiatric review technique form prt,in which he found that boyd had an affective disorder,but that it did not meet or equal the impairments listed in listing,pt,subpt.p,app.the alj entries on the prt form specifically stated that boyd had moderate restrictions of activities of daily living,moderate difficulties in maintain ing social functioning,with never any deficiencies of concentration,persistence or pace and only once or twice having episodes of deterioration or decompensation in work or activities.the alj concluded that while these nonexertional impairments were not non severe,they did not meet or equal the requirements of listing.the alj proceeded to apply a residual functional limitation assessment,called for when a severe impairment is present but not in a degree that meets or equals a listed impairment the alj concluded that boyd could not perform his past work as a welder and construction worker.however,the alj found that boyd had a residual functional capacity for a full range of light work,not reduced by his nonexertional limitations.
in denying disability benefits,the alj concluded that boyd was able to work in employment positions existing in significant numbers in the national economy.the alj based this ruling on the testimony of the vocational expert,given in response to hypothetical questions intended to account for boyd abilities and impairments.
the appeals council denied review on july.boyd timely appealed the denial of benefits to the district court for the northern district of texas under g.the district court referred boyd case to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge found that substantial evidence supported the findings of the alj and that the alj did not apply an improper legal standard.the district court adopted the findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge,without comment.
boyd now appeals the district judge judgment affirming the commissioner decision to deny benefits,arguing that the alj applied an improper legal standard and that there was no substantial evidence to support the alj decision to deny benefits.
ii.the standard of review 
any individual,after any final decision of the commissioner of social security made after a hearing to which he was a party may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action in a district court.g.judicial review of the commissioner decision to deny benefits 
is limited to determining whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards are applied.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a responsible mind might accept to support a conclusion.it is more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.a finding of no substantial evidence is appropriate only if no credible evidentiary choices or medical findings support the decision.in applying this standard,we may not the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the commissioner.
harris apfel,cir quoting ripley chater,cir and citing johnson bowen,cir footnotes and quotation marks omitted.
this court must affirm the commissioner determination unless this court finds that the alj applied an incorrect legal standard,or that the alj determination is not supported by substantial evidence.boyd asserts that both defects are present.the commissioner defends the denial of benefits and asserts that even if the alj erred,remand would not lead to a different result.
iii.analysis 
a.the legal standard applied by the alj 
where a claimant attempts to show an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months,d a,the alj must follow a sequential process,the first four steps of which place the burden on the claimant.muse sullivan,cir.the five steps are 
an individual who is working and engaging in substantial gainful activity will not be found disabled regardless of medical findings.
an individual who does not have a severe impairment will not be found to be disabled.
an individual who meets or equals a listed impairment in pt,subpt.p,app.will be considered disabled without the consideration of vocational factors.
if an individual is capable of performing the work he has done in the past,a finding of not disabled will be made.
if an individual impairment precludes him from performing his past work,other factors including age,education,past work experience,and residual functional capacity must be considered to determine if other work can be performed.

in the fifth step,the burden is on the commissioner to show that the claimant can perform relevant work.if the commissioner meets this burden,the claimant must then prove that he can not in fact perform the work suggested.muse,at.a finding that a claimant is disabled or is not disabled at any point in the review is conclusive and terminates the analysis.greenspan,at quoting lovelace bowen,cir.
the commissioner has instituted a corollary procedure for determining the merits of mental disability claims.under the procedure in effect at the time of boyd hearing before the alj the examiner of the mental disability claim in this case,the alj must first record the pertinent signs,symptoms,findings,functional limitations and effects of treatment contained in the case record,in order to determine if a mental impairment exists.a b.if an impairment is found,the alj must determine whether certain medical findings relevant to a claimant ability to work are present or absent.a b.the alj must then evaluate the degree of functional loss resulting from the impairment in four separate areas deemed essential for work.a b.if the degree of functional loss falls below a specified level in each of the four areas,the alj must find the impairment not severe,which generally concludes the analysis and terminates the proceedings.a c.if the mental impairment is severe under a c,the alj must then determine if it meets or equals a listed mental disorder under pt,subpt.p,app.a c.if the impairment is severe,but does not reach the level of a listed disorder,then the alj must conduct a residual functional capacity assessment.a c.the alj must also append a standard document outlining the steps of the a procedure to the decision.a d.
boyd argues that the alj did not apply the proper legal standard in evaluating his claim.boyd appears to contend that finding eight,in which the alj states that t he claimant residual functional capacity for the full range of light work is not reduced by nonexertional limitations tr,conflicts with language elsewhere in the alj findings indicating that boyd impairments were severe boyd also appears to contend that the alj did not proceed beyond the finding that boyd impairments did not meet the requirements of listings,and did not cond
