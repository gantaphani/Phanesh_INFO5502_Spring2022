elizabeth bonner appeals the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court affirmance of the board of veterans appeals board determination that she was not entitled to an effective date earlier than november,for dependency and indemnity compensation dic.bonner nicholson.because we conclude that the veterans court neither misinterpreted moody principi,nor committed harmful error,we affirm the veterans court judgment.
rear admiral emmett bonner admiral bonner died on august,following a distinguished career in the united states navy.shortly thereafter,his wife,elizabeth bonner,filed a claim for dic with the veterans administration regional office ro listing cancer as the cause of admiral bonner death.the supporting evidence filed with this claim included an autopsy report from the national naval medical center nnmc listing hodgkin disease as cause of death and a death certificate listing hodgkin disease as the immediate cause of death.the ro determined the cause of death as hodgkin disease,a form of cancer,which had been diagnosed during admiral bonner hospitalization from january to april.the ro denied the claim for dic because there was no evidence of service connection.the decision was not appealed and,therefore,became final.
thereafter,was issued in to address service connection for injuries caused by exposure to herbicides during military service in vietnam.it provided,in pertinent part,that s ervice in vietnam during the vietnam era together with the development of lymphoma nhl manifested subsequent to such service is sufficient to establish service connection for that disease.b.this regulation was made retroactive to august.
the following year the agent orange act of was enacted.this act directed the secretary,in certain circumstances,to establish presumptions of service connection for other diseases found to be associated with herbicide exposure while serving in the military.any presumption afforded by this statute was to be effective only prospectively from the date the final regulations were issued.c.in,pursuant to the agent orange act,the va added hodgkin disease to the list of diseases presumptively associated with exposure to herbicides in vietnam,in relevant part amending and.
in,pursuant to a claim by bonner under the radiation exposure compensation act,stat,tissue samples from admiral bonner were examined by the national institutes of health nih.the findings of this examination reported that immunohistochemical studies favor the diagnosis of nonhodgkin lymphoma.based on this conclusion and,presumably,the above regulations promulgated in the,bonner submitted a letter to the va stating that admiral bonner death was likely related to nhl that admiral bonner had been exposed to radiation during his military service and that she was,therefore,entitled to dic effective as of the date of her claim.
the ro treated this letter as a request to reopen bonner previously denied claim on the basis of new and material evidence under.the ro awarded bonner dic effective november,the date of receipt by the va of her letter,based on the finding that hodgkin disease caused admiral bonner death but applying the presumption of service connection for such disease under the agent orange act.bonner filed a notice of disagreement contending that because she filed a claim for service connection for the cause of admiral bonner death shortly after his death,the effective date for dic should be the date on which he died,august.the ro subsequently issued a statement of the case which granted an earlier effective date for dic benefits of november,one year prior to the november,application to reopen the claim.this award was based upon the regulation that provides that if a claim is reviewed more than one year after the effective date of a change in the law,as was the case here,benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of receipt of such request.see a.
following several more exchanges between bonner and the va,in august,the ro issued a supplemental statement of the case noting bonner assertion that nhl was the cause of admiral bonner death.this supplemental statement of the case clarified the bases for the ro determination that the cause of admiral bonner death was hodgkin disease.specifically,the ro stated that the nih biopsy and medical records did not provide a definitive diagnosis of nhl.the ro noted that the presence of cells and variants found in the biopsy was consistent with a diagnosis of hodgkin disease.the ro also indicated that the final diagnosis in the report of malignant lymphoma,large cell,immunoblastic type,with necrosis involving the lymph nodes and liver,was similarly consistent with hodgkin lymphoma.
bonner appealed this decision to the board.the board first noted that in order for bonner to receive benefits under a,the denial of her claim had to have been a denial of a claim for service connection for nhl,not a denial of service connection for another disease.based on this conclusion,the board opined that it did not need to reach the issue of whether an effective date for an award of dic based on bonner claim would have been warranted if the ro had awarded dic in based on a cause of death from nhl,as opposed to hodgkin disease.this was because the denial of bonner original claim in was a denial based on a claim for cause of death from hodgkin disease,not nhl.in other words,bonner was ineligible for retroactive benefits under because her claim was for hodgkin disease and not nhl having made this determination,the board explained that for the reasons posited by the ro,the earliest effective date bonner could receive was november.
bonner appealed the board decision to the veterans court.affirming the board action,the veterans court concluded that the evidence established that bonner claim was one for hodgkin disease as the cause of her husband death,and,therefore,we can not conclude that the evidence reasonably raised any claims for the cause of death by types of cancer other than hodgkin disease.bonner.at.the veterans court also noted that the board did not disturb the ro finding that the evidence of record revealed hodgkin disease as the cause of admiral bonner death and therefore the finding remained hodgkin disease.the veteran court then concluded that the board had a plausible basis to find that the cause of bonner death was hodgkin disease.id.at.
bonner challenges the veterans court determinations.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we have limited jurisdiction to review a decision of the veterans court.we may review the validity of a rule of law or of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof that was relied on by the veterans court in making the decision.a.included within this review is whether the veterans court exceeded its jurisdiction,wanner principi,explaining that the veterans court compliance with its jurisdictional statute is a question of law,reviewed de novo by this court,and whether the veterans court misinterpreted our rulings in earlier decisions on an issue of law,moody principi.we review de novo a claim that the veterans court committed legal error.id.however,absent a constitutional issue,we lack jurisdiction to review factual findings of the veterans court or that court application of law to fact.id.
bonner alleges two errors in the veterans court decision.first,bonner asserts the veterans court misconstrued our decision in moody principi moody when it did not read her claim for cancer as encompassing a claim for nhl.this position is grounded in the assertion that the clinical findings contained in the autopsy report also supported a determination that admiral bonner death was caused by nhl.second,bonner contends the veterans court exceeded its jurisdiction when it decided a factual issue,the cause of admiral bonner death,that the board did not reach in the first instance.bonner concedes that in order for her to prevail ultimately in receiving dic as of the date of her original claim,she will have to establish that her husband died of lymphoma,and that her original claim was broad enough to encompass lymphoma.
the government argues that we lack jurisdiction
