on august,scott leeds,counsel for charles barnett,sent a letter by certified mail to department of veterans affairs,office of regional counsel,expressing barnett intent to initiate negligence litigation against the veterans administration medical center of miami for allegedly negligent treatment in july that led to the amputation of barnett lower right leg leeds indicated in his letter that it was being sent pursuant to the requirements of florida statute and rule of the florida rules of civil procedure.in a response letter dated september,steve mccormack,a staff attorney with the office of regional counsel,informed leeds,however,that any and all claims of negligence involving medical care or treatment provided by employees of the department of veterans affairs va,part of the executive branch of the united states government,are governed by the federal tort claims act ftca rather than state law.consequently,with his letter,mccormack enclosed a standard form which he described as the appropriate method of filing an administrative tort claim against the va with his letter.
barnett filled out the and mailed it,along with a cover letter from leeds dated september,to department of veteran affairs,va medical center using a business reply mail envelope that mccormack had mailed to leeds along with the.then,in october a year after the was filed a complaint in the circuit court of okeechobee county,florida against okeechobee hospital,bernard kruskel,and the va,in which he certified that he had complied fully with all of the requirements of the federal tort claims act defendant va prior to filing this action.the case was removed to the district court on november.
on january,the va filed a motion to dismiss,in which it asserted first,that a tort claim against the united states is barred unless an administrative claim,in writing,was presented to the appropriate agency within two years of the date the claim accrued,and second,that barnett failed to file such a claim.as support for the latter assertion,the va submitted affidavits from sue meyer,the va regional counsel in bay pines,florida,and steve mccormack and margaret adams,two members of her staff.all three claimed that,other than the initial letter leeds mailed to the office of regional counsel on august,their office never received any other written communication from barnett regarding an ftca administrative the he purportedly mailed in september.consequently,the va asked the district court to dismiss barnett suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
on april,the district court granted the va motion and dismissed barnett complaint without prejudice the court granted barnett ten days in which to file an amended complaint together with documentation sufficient to support a finding that the appropriate notification of claim and sum certain was mailed to and received by the appropriate federal agency within the two year statute of limitations as required by a.barnett filed an amended complaint on april,in which he once again contended that he complied with all of the conditions precedent and notice requirements set forth in the federal tort claims act necessary to bring this cause of action against defendant he posited two separate theories for this conclusion first,that leeds august,notice of intent letter to the va sufficed as administrative notice of his claim under a,and second,that barnett did send to defendant va a completed form prior to the expiration of the two year limitation.to support this second contention,barnett attached to his amended complaint the completed that he mailed,dated september,a cover letter that leeds included with the,dated september,and a copy of the business reply mail envelope that barnett used to mail the 
on may,the va moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the va argued that barnett,in his amended complaint,merely rel ied on the same arguments for subject matter jurisdiction previously stated in his memorandum of law in opposition to its original motion to dismiss the complaint.the district court agreed.it found that barnett failed in his august,notice of intent to initiate litigation to place a value on his claim and to provide sufficient information from which the va could establish the value of his claim and failed to attach any new documentation to his amended complaint to verify that a was ever actually mailed to and received by the va.consequently,on june,the district court dismissed barnett ftca claim against the va and remanded his remaining state law claims against okeechobee hospital and kruszel to the state circuit court.
as we have noted elsewhere,t he ftca is a specific,congressional exception to the general rule of sovereign immunity that allows the government to be sued by certain parties under certain circumstances for particular tortious acts committed by employees of the government.suarez united states,cir.as a result,courts must be careful to observe scrupulously the circumstances and conditions of this waiver.see id.one such condition,set forth in a,requires that the administrative agency being sued receive notice and an opportunity to resolve the dispute without litigation 
an action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the united states for money damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail.the failure of an agency to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall,at the option of the claimant any time thereafter,be deemed a final denial of the claim for purposes of this section.
a.if the claim is not presented in writing to the agency within two years after it accrues,it is forever barred.b.
a claim is deemed to be presented when a federal agency receives from a claimant,his duly authorized agent or legal representative,an executed standard form or other written notification of an incident,accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain for injury to or loss of property,personal injury,or death alleged to have occurred by reason of the accident.accordingly,barnett must show either that his notice of intent letter met these two notification and a claim for a sum that the va received the he filled out.as we shall discuss,we find that barnett fulfilled the prerequisites of via the latter,by creating a presumption,which the va has failed to rebut,that the agency received his completed 
we can not review the actions taken by barnett to satisfy with a tabula rasa we must first consider what deference,if any,we must give the order issued by the district court.as an initial step towards determining the order weight,it is important to note that the district court must have dismissed barnett amended complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,and not pursuant to rule b,because the administrative notice requirement of is jurisdictional and can not be waived.lykins pointer,cir employees welfare comm.daws,cir.this distinction is important.when a defendant moves under b to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim,the plaintiff is safeguarded by a presumption that the allegations in his complaint are true.a plaintiff does not necessarily have this same protection from a b motion.
if the b motion represents a facial attack on is,the facts as stated supposedly do not provide cause for federal the facts alleged by the plaintiff are given the same presumption of truthfulness as they would receive under a b motion.see williamson tucker,cir.if,however,the b motion raises a factual attack on very facts providing cause for jurisdiction are themselves no such presumption exists and the district court is allowed to consider the facts as it sees fit.in essence,the district court conducts a bench trial on the facts that give rise to its subject matter jurisdiction.consequently,no presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiff allegations,and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional claims.id.at quoting mortensen first fed.sav.and loan ass n,cir.
in the present case,the va challenged the district court jurisdiction from both a facial and a factual standpoint.it claimed that barnett could not facially present his claim by simply asserting that he mailed a completed to its office of regional counsel according to the va,only actual receipt of the by that office legally sufficed as presentation of the claim.moreover,the va also disputed key underlying facts,specifically whether barnett actually mailed a completed to the va and whether the va received it.
because of the mixed nature of the va jurisdictional attack,we must use two different standards to review the district court order on subject matter jurisdiction.when the court confronted the va facial jurisdictional challenge and decided that a claim is presented when it is received by a federal agency so there must be evidence of actual receipt,it was merely construing law,so we review the court decision de novo.on the other hand,when the court held that barnett failed to verify that a was ever actually mailed to and received by the va,it was issuing a factual finding,which we can only overturn if it is clearly erroneous.see lawrence dunbar,cir.
as we have just noted,we can only overturn the district court factual finding that barnett did not mail a completed to the va if it is clearly erroneous.in other words,we should only reverse if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states hogan,cir quoting united states roy,cir,cert.denied,d.here,however,we believe that such a mistake has occurred.
in his amended complaint,barnett asserted that he mailed a completed to the va and attached copies of it,the accompanying cover letter,and a copy of the business reply mail envelope in which he allegedly mailed it.while barnett statement and supporting documentation does not provide conclusive proof that he mailed a completed to the,perhaps,a certified mail receipt would does raise an inference that he did so.admittedly,the district court was under no obligation to assume that barnett claims were presumptively true.there is,however,no evidence before the court that suggests that they are false and thus that the inference drawn from he mailed a completed to the inaccurate.
to rebut barnett claim that he mailed a to its office of regional counsel,the va submitted statements by meyer,mccormack,and adams that the va never received an from barnett.assuming that they are reliable,these comments,at most,indicate that the did not reach the va office of regional counsel they provide no proof whatsoever that barnett did not deposit the completed in the mail.consequently,there was no reason for the district court to conclude that barnett did not mail the completed to the va,and we therefore find this conclusion to be clearly erroneous.
whether barnett actually mailed the completed to the va may seem irrelevant in light of the district court conclusion that actual receipt of the by the va was the only fact that was material.specifically,the district court ruling on the,as aforementioned,we review de that a claim is presented when it is received by a federal agency.therefore,in the view of the district court,m ailing alone is not enough there must be evidence of actual receipt.while we agree with the fundamental premise that a claim is presented upon its receipt,we can not go so far as to say that affirmative evidence of such receipt is required.
as we noted in a previous case,konst florida coast ry,cir,t he common law has long recognized a rebuttable presumption that an item properly mailed was received by the addressee.id.at.in konst,we extended this common law principle to claims filed against a common carrier pursuant to that is,we held that konst,who allegedly mailed such a claim to florida east coast railway company,was entitled to a presumption that the railway company had received the claim.id.at.we see no reason why we should not act similarly in the case at hand and allow barnett the benefit of this traditional means of weighing evidence in order to determine whether receipt occurred.id.at.
admittedly,unlike the instant case,konst did not involve the filing of documents with a government agency.this distinction was noted in konst in dicta,it was mentioned that t here is a presumption that officers of the government perform their duties,and we cited cases like chrysler motors corporation schneiderman,cir,and smith fidelity casualty,cir,where the rebuttable presumption of receipt was not applied to filing requirements.konst,at.there is a crucial difference between those cases and the one currently before the court.in chrysler motors corporation and smith,the plaintiffs filed claims with courts or governmental agencies,who were not otherwise involved in the litigation.see chrysler motors,at reviewing whether the clerk of the bankruptcy court received a claim chrysler allegedly filed against scheniderman smith,at considering whether smith filed a claim with the texas industrial accident board,as required by state law.consequently,the governmental entities in the cases had no apparent pecuniary interest in denying that they received the documents allegedly filed with them.konst,at.here,however,the government agency with which barnett filed his the defendant.as a result,it has a strong interest in denying that it received barnett and having his suit dismissed.
all that we have said should not imply that we think that the va lied to the district court as to whether it received barnett.rather,we simply believe that the va should not be accorded any special presumption of believability because it is a branch of the united states government and should be treated no differently than a private defendant like the one in konst.in konst,after we determined that contemplate d receipt as the trigger for processing a claim,we ultimately held that the presumption of receipt should apply to claims filed under that federal regulation.id.at.likewise,we hold today that the same presumption should apply to administrative claims made pursuant to,which promulgates that an ftca claim is only presented in accordance with when the appropriate federal agency receives it from the claimant.
in the instant case,barnett only needed to demonstrate three facts to create a presumption that the va received his completed the document was properly addressed the document was stamped and the document was mailed.gonzales packing coast brokers and packers,in re coast brokers and packers,cir.as we discussed in part,barnett has provided uncontradicted evidence that he mailed the.moreover,he allegedly used the business reply mail envelope that mccormack sent to him,so we can assume that it was properly addressed.the envelope did not need to be stamped,because,as was clearly marked on it,the postage would be paid by the department of veteran affairs.in sum,barnett established the three elements necessary to create a presumption of receipt,and we therefore must presume that the va received his completed.
having determined both that barnett mailed a completed to the va and that this fact raises a presumption that the va received the,we now must consider whether the va has rebutted this presumption.even though barnett assertions that he mailed the to the va have not been controverted,the va can still put forth evidence to overcome the presumption that it was received.see bailey united states,cir t he presumption that the plaintiff ftca claim was received,assuming that it exists,was rebutted by proof of.after all,the presumption of receipt is not a conclusive presumption of law,but a
