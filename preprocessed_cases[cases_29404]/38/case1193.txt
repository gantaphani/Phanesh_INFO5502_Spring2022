in related petitions the american legion american legion,the national organization of veterans advocates,nova,and the veterans justice group,llc vjg collectively,petitioners,challenge the validity of regulations issued in by the department of veterans affairs va or secretary pursuant to its rulemaking authority.see standard claims and appeals forms.dep t of veterans affairs,final rule the final rule amends the va adjudication and appellate regulations to require that all claims and appeals originate on standard va forms.see id.at.for the reasons set forth below,we deny the petitions and hold the final rule valid because it accords with applicable rulemaking procedures and is not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise contrary to law.
background 
to understand the issues relevant to this appeal,we discuss,in turn,the va prior regulation,the final rule,and the general arguments in the petitions for review.
prior regulation 
claim initiation 
veterans are entitled to compensation f or disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty,or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty during a period of war.for veterans to receive compensation under the laws administered by the va,a specific claim in the form prescribed by the secretary must be filed.id.a.the va prior regulation implemented this authority by providing that a ny communication or action,indicating an intent to apply for benefits,may be considered an informal claim.a emphasis added prior regulation.under the prior regulation,a veteran could establish a claim effective date,when the claimant begins to receive compensation by filing an informal claim,so long as a formal application was received by the va within one year from the date the formal application form was sent to the claimant.id.
if a claimant perfected an informal claim by filing a formal application within the time period,a va agency of original jurisdiction,typically a va regional office ro,considered the claim,gave notice to the claimant of its decision,and informed the claimant of his or her right to appeal.see b.an appeal could be initiated by filing a notice of disagreement nod,see a,and unless the requested benefit was granted or the nod withdrawn,the va would issue a statement of the case soc summarizing the reasons for the va decision on each issue,id.d.following issuance of the soc,the claimant would be afforded a period of sixty days from the date of the soc to file a formal appeal with the board of veterans appeals veterans board.id.d.the statute provides that the appeal should set out specific allegations of error of fact or law,such allegations related to specific items in the soc.id.
the nod is required to be filed within one year of the mailing of notice of the ro decision and in writing.id.b.in addition to these statutory requirements,the va required an nod to be in terms which could be reasonably construed as disagreement with the ro decision and a desire for appellate review,although special wording was not required.however,if the ro notice of decision decided multiple issues,under the prior regulation the claimant was required to specify which agency determinations he or she sought to appeal.id.
ii.final rule 
in september,the va promulgated the final rule,which sought to strike a balance between standardizing,modernizing,and streamlining the claim initiation and appellate process,while providing claimants with a process that remains and informal.final rule.at.
although the final rule incorporated a majority of the amendments originally proposed by the va in,it altered the proposed rule in one important respect.see standard claims and appeals forms,dep t of veterans affairs,proposed rule.under the proposed rule,submission of an informal claim,a narrative submission would no longer serve as an effective date placeholder that could later be perfected by the filing of a formal claim.see id.at altering the prior regulation definition of claim under p to exclude informal communications.instead,an incomplete claim would provide the effective date placeholder function formerly provided by an informal claim,if perfected by the filing of a standard application form within one year.id.at.however,in contrast to the flexible nature of the prior informal claim system,under the proposed rule,a submission would be considered an incomplete claim only if a claimant filled out,completely or incompletely,an online application via the va electronic claims application system,but d id not transmit the online application for processing.id.otherwise,claims would be considered received as of the date they were filed on a standard paper application form.
when it published the proposed rule in,the va explained it was facing an unprecedented volume of compensation claims resulting in unacceptable delays at every phase of the process for adjudicating claims and appeals.id.at.the va received comments in response to the proposed rule.while some commenters expressed approval of the agency attempt to bring increased clarity and efficiency,others expressed concern with certain aspects of the proposed rule,including the va proposed interpretation of incomplete claim,which some perceived as unnecessarily parochial.
in lieu of the proposed rule incomplete claim concept,the final rule establishes an intent to file process,which allows claimants to establish the effective date of an award in any of three ways.first,under the final rule,an intent to file may be established by saving an electronic application within a va electronic claims application system before submitting it for actual processing.b i.second,a claimant may submit a va standard form vaf in either paper or electronic form.id.b ii final rule.at.third,a claimant may establish intent to file by communicating orally with certain designated va personnel either in person or by telephone,who will document the claimant intent.final rule.at see b iii.so long as a formal application is filed within one year of the submission,the va will deem the effective date to be the date the intent to file submission was received.
lastly,the final rule specifies that,where the ro provides,in connection with its decision,a form identified as being for the purpose of initiating an appeal,an nod would consist of a completed and timely submitted copy of that form.final rule.at see a.the final rule further clarifies the va will not accept as an nod an expression of dissatisfaction that is submitted in any other format,including on a different va form.final rule.at see a.

standard of review 
petitions under are reviewed under the administrative procedure act apa,as codified in.see nyeholt sec y of veterans affairs.under,we must hold unlawful and set aside agency action we find arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.this review is highly deferential to the actions of the agency.org.of veterans advocates,sec y of veterans affairs,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
ii.the final rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule 
the apa rulemaking provisions generally require that notice of proposed rules be published in the federal register and that interested persons be given the opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data,views,or arguments.afl cio chao,d,quoting c.although the apa does not explicitly address the relationship the notice of proposed rulemaking must have to the final rule,it provides some guidance when it states that agencies must publish in their notice of proposed rulemaking either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.b.
under this standard,an agency final rule need not be identical to the proposed rule.indeed,t he whole rationale of notice and comment rests on the expectation that the final rules will be somewhat different and improved from the rules originally proposed by the agency.trans pac.freight conference of fed.comm n.
where a proposed rule is modified in light of public comment,the modified rule may be promulgated as a final rule without additional notice and opportunity for comment,so long as the final rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule.csx,surface transp,see also long island care at home,coke,d courts of appeals have generally interpreted certain language in to mean that the final rule must be a logical outgrowth of the rule proposed.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a final rule is a logical outgrowth of a proposed rule only if interested parties should have anticipated that the change was possible,and thus reasonably should have filed their comments on the subject during the period.int l union,united mine workers of am.mine safety health,quoting int l union,united mine workers of am.mine safety health.
american legion contends t he final rule provision should be set aside because it is not a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule.american legion br.citation omitted.according to american legion,the proposed rule did not propose the creat ion of a new i ntent to f ile form for initiating claims.id.at.instead,american legion asserts the va proposed rule sought to modify the informal claims process and replace it with a system where i existing application forms are designated as complete or incomplete and ii electronic claims receive preferential treatment over paper claims.id.citing proposed rule.at,final rule.at.accordingly,american legion contends that,because t he final rule replaces the proposed rule with something very different,namely,a new concept based on a new form that was never mentioned in the proposed rule,id.quoting final rule.at,it could not have anticipated that the change was possible,id.at quoting united mine workers of,at.
in response,the va argues it has not switched direction from the substance of the p roposed r ule,but has declined to go as far as originally proposed,following consideration of the public comments.va br.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the va asserts the potential results of the proposed rule that could have been anticipated include declin ing to totally eliminate effective date placeholders for paper claims,and attempt ing to reconcile the effective date placeholder policy with its need for standard inputs.id.at.accordingly,the va asserts that,although t he f inal r ule uses different terminology and structure,it effects a policy urged to reconcile these issues.id.
we conclude that,under the circumstances of this case,interested parties should have anticipated that the change reflected in the intent to file provision of the final rule was possible in light of the notice provided in the proposed rule.united mine workers of,at.in lieu of the proposed rule introduction of the incomplete claim concept,the va adopted an intent to file process.final rule.at.in addition to allowing a claimant to establish a claim effective date through the submission of an application on a va electronic application system,as under the proposed rule,the final rule expanded a claimant options by also allowing an effective date to be established by the submission of a written intent to file a claim on a standard va form,see b ii,or via a telephone call or in person,see id.b iii.final rule.at.
contrary to american legion contention,the va substitution of the intent to file process for the proposed incomplete claim concept does not constitute a change in the basic approach of the proposed rule the standardization of the claim initiation process.see griffin,united states,the approach adopted by the agency,while different from the p roposed r egulation,was a logical outgrowth of the original proposal because t he f inal r ule changed neither the substance nor the approach of the proposed regulation.what is more,not only were the changes in character with the original scheme,they were additionally foreshadowed in proposals and comments advanced during the rulemaking and public comment period.terminal epa,cir see also final rule.at many commenters expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed rule elimination of an effective date placeholder for paper claims.i t would be antithetical to the purposes of the notice and comment provisions of the apa to tax an agency with inconsistency whenever it circulates a proposal that it has not firmly decided to put into effect and that it subsequently reconsiders in response to public comment.commodity futures trading comm schor,d.
lastly,we find american legion assertion puzzling because it is incongruent with the contentions it proffers regarding the substantive validity of the final rule.unlike the proposed rule,the final rule introduces multiple avenues by which claimants may establish an effective date placeholder,thereby creating increased opportunities for claimants to establish a claim effective date.the final rule does not go as far as the proposed rule because it does not limit the intent to file process to a va electronic claims application system.see final rule.at.however,o ne logical outgrowth of a proposal is surely to refrain from taking the proposed step.am.iron steel inst.epa.accordingly,we find that the final rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule.
iii.validity of the amended regulations 
petitioners challenge to the final rule may be analytically divided into three categories claim initiation appeals and duty to develop claims.
as to claim initiation,petitioners assert that the amendment of p,the prior regulation informal claims provision,is arbitrary and capricious.
with respect to appeals,petitioners challenge amended a and a,requiring that,when the ro provides an appeal form to a claimant in connection with the ro decision,an nod initiating appellate review can be effected only by completing that form.
lastly,petitioners argue the final rule abrogates the va duty to develop veterans claims because it i mpermissibly r estricts t he c laims d eemed r aised b y v eterans,american legion br,and therefore does not allow the va to adjudicate claims reasonably raised by the record,id.at.specifically,petitioners point to new b,which requires claimants to enumerate the issues or conditions for which appellate review is sought,and new a,under which claimants must identify the benefit sought and provide a description of symptom s or medical condition s on which the benefit is based,respectively.we address each of these contentions in turn.
claim initiation part 
our review of an agency interpretation of a statute that it administers is governed by the framework articulated in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see disabled am.veterans gober.under chevron step one,we ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.if we conclude that it has,that is the end of the matter.id.
however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.alternatively,if a statute is silent,but congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.id.at.the resulting regulations are afforded controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at footnote omitted.
american legion challenges the final rule requirement that claims must originate on standard va forms,asserting congress has enacted legislation that affirmatively contradicts va attempts to eliminate informal submissions as placeholders for effective dates.american legion br.it first argues that congress,via the veterans benefits act of,stat.act,codified the version of the informal claims regulation,thus precluding the va from eliminating the informal claims concept.it next argues that l egislative developments since the act confirm congress s intent to allow veterans to claim their earliest informal written request to the va as the effective date for benefits.american legion br.we address each of these contentions in turn.
congress did not codify the informal claims provision of 
a.in adopting the va effective date regulation,the act did not also adopt the informal claims regulation 
in an effort to expedite the adjudication of claims and render the system more comprehensible to veterans and the public,at,reprinted in,capitalization omitted,the act consolidated into a single act the subject matter of the extensive body of existing legislation authorizing and governing the payment of compensation for disability or death to persons who served in the military,naval,or air force of the united states,id.at capitalization omitted.in addition to the consolidation of existing legislation,the act also consolidated all the administrative provisions relating to pension,medical,and other va benefits.id.at emphasis added.
american legion contends that when congress enacted the current effective date provision in codified as amended at a b,it also made statutory the va longstanding rule that informal submissions can establish a claimant effective date.thus,american legion asserts that the va can not amend the regulations to exclude informal submissions.
before the act,the va effective date provision was codified at.that regulation stated 
initial awards of disability compensation will be payable provided an appropriate claim therefor has been filed and,if incomplete,the necessary evidence to complete such claim is submitted within one year from the date of request therefor the claim must be filed within one year from date of discharge from such period of service in order to benefit from an earlier effective date 
emphases added.during this period,the va defined the term informal claim as a ny communication from or action by a claimant which clearly indicates an intent to apply for disability or death compensation or pension.section further provided that an informal claim would serve to establish an effective date if a formal application which would be considered as evidence necessary to complete the initial application was received by the va within one year from the date it was transmitted for execution by the claimant.id.emphasis added.
without addressing claim completeness or informality,the act codified the one year provision 
b the effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran shall be the date of his discharge or release if application therefor is received within one year from such date of discharge or release.
act,b,stat.at emphasis added.
american legion asserts that,because informal claims were considered sufficient to establish a claim effective date under the va prior regulation,the elevation of the effective date regulation to statute also codified the means,the filing of an informal claim by which claimants may establish the effective date of their awards.
american legion contention effectively raises a chevron step one question because it requires us to address whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.that is,we must determine whether,in codifying the va pre effective date award regulation,congress also codified the va prior regulation that informal claims were sufficient to establish the effective date of an award thus foreclosing the va attempt to substitute the informal claims regulation with new b intent to file process.
while congress modeled the effective date provision on pre va regulations,the provision is only indirectly tied to the informal claims definition.it does not define informal claim,or even include that term.it does not include any of the regulation operative terms,such as that an effective date will be established by a ny communication from or action by a claimant clearly indicat ing an intent to apply for disability.see act,a b,stat.at.there is no reason to presume that when congress codified the effective date regulation,it also legislatively adopted,sub silentio,the informal claims regulation.see nlrb plasterers local union,d it is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted groff united states,because congress did not define the relevant term,the statute is silent as to its meaning.accordingly,the effective date provision does not speak to what action or conduct by the claimant constitutes an informal claim.
what is more,congress chose not to codify the informal claims provision of at the same time that it did codify a number of other pre va regulations related to a veteran application for disability benefits.see codifying a,which provided that a properly completed,form constitutes an application for benefits id.codifying a,which provided that where n ew and material evidence is submitted after a claim is finally disallowed,the new evidence will constitute a new claim and have all the attributes thereof id.b codifying,which allowed an earlier effective date for claims filed within one year from date of discharge.t he legislature silence with respect to one aspect of a regulatory scheme,in light of its codification of administrative rules governing other aspects of that scheme,indicates that congress left the former matter where it was before the statute was enacted.kucana holder,d see also prestol espinal attorney of the,cir where congress codif ies some regulations while ignoring others,its nuanced consideration of which limitations and regulations to codify offers stronger evidence of congress s intent than does congress s silence internal quotation marks omitted.
legislative history is also relevant under the chevron framework,and may foreclose an agency preferred interpretation if it makes clear what the statute text leaves opaque.catawba,epa.here,the statute legislative history is also silent on the precise issue before us.chevron,at.neither the act nor the house conference report accompanying the act,see,discuss the informal claims regulation or any of its operative terms.
congress did not codify via post legislation 
in further support of its contention that congress codified the informal claims regulation,american legion next argues that l egislative developments since the act confirm congress s intent to allow veterans to claim their earliest informal written request to the va as the effective date for benefits.american legion br.specifically,according to american legion,b etween and,congress took action in connection with the statute provisions,more than a dozen times.on at least three of these occasions,congress amended,reenacted,or renumbered the very subsections that had first been signed into statutory law in id.footnote omitted.
however,there is nothing to indicate that the informal claims regulation was ever called to the attention of congress,and the reenactment of was not accompanied by any congressional discussion which throws light on its intended scope.united states calamaro,d see also comm r glenshaw glass.reenactment of a statute particularly without the slightest affirmative indication that congress ever had a particular decision before it is an unreliable indicium at best.helvering reynolds.legislative ratification is no more than an aid in statutory construction and does not mean that the prior construction has become so embedded in the law that only congress can effect a change citation omitted.accordingly,we reject american legion contention that congress reenactment of the effective date provision between and evidences an intent to codify the informal claims regulation.
c.the incomplete application provision of b c does not indicate congress intended to codify the informal claims regulation 
finally,american legion asserts that s ince,congress has not merely acquiesced with va position it has also enacted legislation that affirmatively contradicts va attempts to eliminate informal submissions as placeholders for effective dates.american legion br.american legion first points to b,which provides that i f a claimant application is incomplete,the secretary shall notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application.b.an adjacent subsection further states that if a claimant has been notified under section b and the claimant fails to furnish necessary information to complete the application,no benefit may be paid or furnished.id.c emphasis added.american legion argues that these subsections,when read in conjunction,require a claim effective date to be tied to the date on which the veteran initiates the application not the date of ultimate compliance with the formal application procedures.american legion br.accordingly,american legion asserts that when congress enacted section c in,because the va had long defined the term application to mean a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement,to a benefit,the va can not eviscerate what congress plainly understood it was accomplishing when it enacted c.id.quoting p.
american legion contention is predicated solely on the fact that congress possessed knowledge of the va definition of application.this begs the question.it is of little import that congress was aware of the va previous definition of application as including an informal written communication.as the supreme court has stated 
the statement that administrative construction receives legislative approval by reenactment of a statutory provision,without material change,covers the situation where the validity of administrative action standing by itself may be dubious or where ambiguities in a statute or rules are resolved by reference to administrative practice prior to reenactment of a statute and where it does not appear that the rule or practice has been changed by the administrative agency through exercise of its continuing power.it does not mean that a regulation interpreting a provision of one act becomes frozen into another act merely by reenactment of that provision,so that that administrative interpretation can not be changed prospectively through exercise of appropriate powers.the contrary conclusion would not only drastically curtail the scope and materially impair the flexibility of administrative action it would produce a most awkward situation.outstanding regulations which had survived one act could be changed only after a by the congress.
helvering wilshire oil.emphasis added citation omitted see also cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d an initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone.on the contrary,the agency must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.quoting chevron,at.
the relevant inquiry is not whether congress was aware of the prior regulations,but whether it intended to bind the va to its existing definition via the enactment of b and c.in this case,congress has not given any indication of whether it intended to bind the va to its previous definition.ve holding johnson gas appliance,citation omitted see providing definitions,but leaving claim and application undefined.in light of this congressional silence,the enactment of b and c do not limit the va discretion in the manner american legion asserts.see,united states home concrete supply,llc,d plurality opinion a statute silence or ambiguity as to a particular issue means that congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue thus likely delegating power to the agency.internal quotation marks and citation omitted entergy riverkeeper,d it is eminently reasonable to conclude that a statute silence is meant to convey nothing more than a refusal to tie the agency hands.
amended part,requiring that claims be initiated via a standard va form is consistent with a and a 
the statute is not only silent as to the definition of application,but affirmatively grants t he secretary authority to prescribe all rules and regulations including the forms of application by claimants under such laws.see also id.a a specific claim in the form prescribed by the secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid emphasis added mansfield peake,congress has provided the va with authority to establish the requirements for claims for veterans benefits.where congress has express ly delegat ed authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,those legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at footnote omitted.
american legion contends the va elimination of informal placeholders runs contrary to congress s overarching purpose in enacting the veterans benefit laws maintaining a,process for providing benefits to veterans and their families.american legion br.accordingly,it asserts that the new and amended regulations under part are arbitrary and capricious because the va has failed to establish a rational connection between its requirement that initial submissions be on standard forms and its asserted objectives and has not adequately considered the final rule impact on the veteran population.id.at footnote omitted see also id.at asserting the final rule is likely to disproportionately impact veterans for whom it will be impossible to access the va electronic platform or understand the requirements the va is imposing.
the va stated reason for favoring standard claims forms is sufficient to show that the final rule standard form requirement is rational.we note that the va is in a better position than this court to evaluate inefficiencies in its system.see heckler chaney,d the agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.see also hettleman bergland,cir t he government has an interest in seeing that the program it administers runs efficiently and the secretary,as head of the responsible agency,is in the best position to promulgate uniform procedures.internal quotation marks omitted.the va explained that,by standardizing the claim initiation process,it will be able to cut processing time in identifying and developing claims,which will result in faster delivery of benefits to all veterans.final rule.at see also id.the rulemaking will allow the va to decrease the processing time in identifying,clarifying,and processing submissions as claims or appeals since the va will be able to easily target and identify these claims or initiations of appeals based on the submitted form va br.by controlling the possibility that any document might contain an overlooked claim,adjudicators can focus on developing and deciding the claims before them instead of devoting time to interpret ing the correct procedural identity of every claimant submission.we decline to second guess the agency where,as here,its action has not been shown to be arbitrary or capricious.see.yankee nuclear power nat.res.def.council,d asserting that courts generally will defer to an agency construction of the statute it is charged with implementing and to the procedures adopted to implement the statute.
we also conclude the va has adequately considered and addressed the impact on the veteran population.in issuing the final rule,the va noted that approximately half of the claimant population already file s claims on a prescribed form.final rule.at.to mitigate adverse effects on those in the remaining half who are not familiar with the standard form,the va delay ed the effective date of the final rule by days in order to perform robust outreach to inform and educate claimants and authorized representatives of this new standardized procedure.id.
additionally,it unlikely that the amended regulations,and in particular the intent to file provisions codified at b i iii,will unduly burden veterans seeking to initiate claims.although the final rule may disproportionately impact some of the nation veterans who either do not have or possess limited internet access,see,this issue is attenuated because new b iii allows claimants to initiate their claims with a phone call.thus,practically speaking,the increase in burden on claimants is de minimis.if anything,the final rule is more because it increases the menu of options available to the initiating claimant.accordingly,we find that the va amendment and new provisions to part,requiring claimants to originate their claims on a standard va form is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to statute.favreau united states,asserting that the court will defer to the agency interpretation of a statute if the regulation is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to statute.
lastly,as to american legion contention that the final rule does not accord with the overarching purpose of the veterans benefit laws,we agree with the va that c onsistency with the statutory framework plainly can not be reduced to the test of whether the regulation is uniformly.va br.quoting sears principi.as we explained in sears,we must take care not to invalidate otherwise reasonable agency regulations simply because they do not provide for a outcome in every imaginable case.at.
appeals a and a 
is not exhaustive 
when an ro makes a decision that impacts the payment of benefits or the granting of relief,the ro typically provides claimants with a notice of the decision and of the procedure for appeal.see b.claimants have one year to initiate review of the ro decision with the veterans board by filing an nod with the ro.b.as with the claim initiation process,the final rule requires claimants to initiate an appeal on a standard nod form.a.where multiple determinations are at issue,the final rule requires the claimant to identify the specific determinations with which the claimant disagrees.id.a.
petitioners challenge a both as to its standard form requirement and its requirement that claimants identify specific determinations of the notice of disagreement with which they disagree.petitioners contend that we need only look at chevron step one because congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,namely,whether the va may add to the statutory requirements established in when determining what constitutes an nod.at.
specifically,nova argues that congressional intent requires that an nod only contain two elements expression of intent to appeal and disagreement with a determination,and that the statute therefore clearly excludes imposing the use of a standardized form.nova br.capitalization modified.vjg similarly argues nothing in authorize s the secretary to require detailed technical pleading in order to obtain appellate review of an adverse decision.vjg br.it adds that requiring specification of the issues on appeal in an nod and a formal appeal is redundant.id.at comparing a requiring identification of the specific determinations with which the claimant disagrees,with d the appeal should set out specific allegations of error of fact or law,such allegations related to specific items in the statement of the case.nova also argues that congress use of the term notice of disagreement in,instead of the term forms of application,which is used elsewhere in title,directly addresses and precludes the va ability to require a claimant to file a standardized form to initiate the appeal process.nova br.
our decision in gallegos principi squarely addresses this issue.see.in gallegos,we determined that 
does not define nod or suggest sufficient expressions to make a writing an nod.the statute also does not suggest that its specifications for an nod writing,time limit from notice,are the only requirements for a valid nod in a general sense,the statute does not define an nod therefore,under chevron,contains a gap for an agency to fill with regard to the definition of a legally valid nod.
at quoting chevron,at emphasis added.
consistent with our decision in gallegos,we conclude b is not exhaustive and does not restrict the va authority to fashion or articulate additional requirements claimants must satisfy in order to complete an nod.see gallegos,at section does not preclude other requirements for an nod.
lastly,with respect to nova assertion that congress use of the term notice of disagreement instead of forms of application necessarily precludes the va from mandating that nods be completed on standard forms,we find nothing inherent in the term notice that precludes the va from requiring such notice to be communicated on a standard va form.see notice,black law dictionary ed providing many definitions,due notice,implied notice,notice filing of the term notice.
the final rule imposition of a mandatory nod identifying specific issues of disagreement is not arbitrary 
a regulation is not arbitrary and capricious as long as there is a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.org.of veterans advocates,sec y of veterans affairs,quoting motor vehicles mfrs.ass of the state farm mut.auto.ins,d.petitioners assert that,by requiring standardized nod forms in which claimants must enumerate specific points of disagreement,t he secretary has improperly burdened veterans with an adversarial benefits claims process an act which is arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to congressional mandate.vjg br.nova similarly argues that,by imposing additional requirements for the nod,the va is exercising more authority than congress delegated.nova br.
vjg further argues that under the prior regulation,the form required to perfect a formal appeal contain ed a box for claimants to check if he or she want ed to appeal all of the issues listed on the soc.vjg reply br.quoting va form.internal quotation marks omitted.according to vjg,the designation of all of the issues contained in the decision document has long been sufficiently detailed for the secretary to accept as specific allegations of error of fact or law pursuant to d.see also id.at asserting that the va acceptance of a blanket designation of all of the issues in a substantive appeal form,va form necessarily means the va must also accept at least that level of generality in an nod.
we conclude that the requirement to use a standard form to identify the specific issues of disagreement,see,a,is rationally related to the adjudication of veterans appeals.while we are not unsympathetic to petitioners contentions,those contentions are primarily derivative of the fact that the va seeks to change the appeal initiation process,and do not persuasively explain why the change constitutes an unreasonable exercise of the va authority.the va has adequately explained why its regulations are rational.the va notes that under its prior regulations,broad and unclear requirements led to delays in appeals processing,proposed rule.at,and that use of the standardized nod enables agency personnel to more quickly conduct targeted development and consideration of a veteran appeal,id.at.the va further points out that e rrors in identifying nods can complicate otherwise straightforward claims.id.at.it asserts that the form must be mandatory because a standardized form positive impact would be greatly diluted if even a few claimants did not make use of the form,because the va would then still be required to scour all claimant submissions and engage in the interpretative exercise of determining whether a given document could be reasonably construed as an nod.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.and it stresses that timely consideration of appeals is facilitated by the specification of disagreements as early as possible.final rule.at.
the va efficiency rationale is sufficient the va possesses a duty not only to individual claimants,but to the effective functioning of the veterans compensation system as a whole.moreover,because the va possesses limited resources,these dual obligations may sometimes compel it to make necessary tradeoffs.see massachusetts epa,d a n agency has broad discretion to choose how best to marshal its limited resources and personnel to carry out its delegated responsibilities.citation omitted.although the va mandatory standard form increases the burden to some claimants when initiating the appeals process,to the extent standardization augments the overall efficiency of the appeals process,individual claimants also reap its benef
