on march,plaintiffs arakaki et collectively plaintiffs filed a civil action against the state of hawaii and various state agencies,challenging the constitutionality of privileges.this suit follows closely on the heels of the supreme court recent rice cayetano decision,which held that limiting voter eligibility to elect the trustees to the oha to members of the racial classifications hawaiian and native hawaiian violated the fifteenth amendment.at.
plaintiffs challenge the exclusive benefits given to hawaiians and native hawaiians by the oha,the hhc,and the dhhl.plaintiffs allege the provision of such benefits is racially discriminatory and violates the equal protection clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.they also allege that,as beneficiaries of f of the hawaii admission act public land trust,the state and discriminate against them,which constitutes a breach of trust.pub,stat,f admission act.plaintiffs asserted standing as taxpayers,and as beneficiaries of the public land trust established by congress in f.

on march,hoohuli filed its motion to intervene.hoohuli alleged two interests justifying intervention to ensure continued receipt of benefits for native hawaiians and to limit the class of eligible beneficiaries to only native hawaiians,at the exclusion of the broader hawaiian class.additionally,hoohuli sought to raise as a defense to its receipt of benefits that,absent discrimination by the united states,it should be entitled to tribal status,and its benefits scrutinized under rational basis review pursuant to morton mancari,d.a magistrate judge denied this motion on may.hoohuli timely appealed to the district court.
on may,the district court dismissed for lack of standing plaintiffs breach of the public land trust claims.it ruled that plaintiffs claim for relief,invalidating the stated purpose of f,rather than alleging an actual breach of the trust created by f,amounted to a generalized grievance.since plaintiffs were not proceeding on the basis of any direct injury,they lacked standing to complain.the district court held that the only claims remaining were plaintiffs equal protection challenges asserted as taxpayers against the direct expenditures of tax revenues by the legislature.plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of this order was denied on june.plaintiffs have not appealed this order to the ninth circuit.
on june,the district court denied hoohuli motion to intervene,both as a matter of right and permissively.the district court first held that since plaintiffs public land trust claims were dismissed,hoohuli had no significantly protectable interest in those claims at this time.the district court ruled that hoohuli intervention to assert additional claims of breaches of public land trusts,specifically that benefits should be limited to only native hawaiians,was not raised by existing parties and clearly separable from plaintiffs remaining equal protection challenge.the district court also noted that nothing prevented hoohuli from filing its own breach of trust suit against the state to claim benefits should be allocated to only native hawaiians.
next,the district court addressed hoohuli motion to intervene in plaintiffs equal protection claims.the district court observed that hoohuli had a significantly protectable interest in the manner in which its tax dollars are used.a ruling in plaintiffs favor would impair hoohuli interest in the continued receipt of homestead leases.hoohuli interest in limiting benefits to native hawaiians,however,was not encompassed by the issues before the court.additionally,hoohuli failed to demonstrate that the state defendants would not adequately represent their interests.the court ruled that defendants and hoohuli have the same ultimate objective,and that to date,defendants have demonstrated that they will vigorously oppose plaintiffs challenges to the provision of benefits to native hawaiians.the court rejected hoohuli proffered justification that defendants are inadequate because they will not argue as a defense that the department of the interior is engaging in unconstitutional race discrimination by excluding native hawaiians in the definition of indian tribe.
the district court denied hoohuli request for permissive intervention because it sought to interject new issues into this action beyond the scope of plaintiffs claims.hoohuli participation would unnecessarily complicate the litigation,and existing defendants,including native hawaiian lessees,would vigorously seek to uphold the provision of these benefits

public land trust beneficiary claim 
hoohuli seeks to intervene to support in part and to challenge in part plaintiffs public land trust beneficiary claim created by f of the admission act.hoohuli joins in the view that provision of leasehold benefits to hawaiians is illegal,but believes that providing benefits to native hawaiians does not breach f of the act.
assuming hoohuli timely filed its motion to intervene,intervention is nevertheless inappropriate for the public land trust beneficiary claim.rule a requires an applicant to demonstrate a significantly protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action.donnelly,at.here,plaintiffs f public trust claim has been dismissed by the district court and not subsequently appealed before this court.because this trust claim is no longer the subject of plaintiffs action,intervention is inappropriate as a matter of right.
we offer no comment on hoohuli option of filing its own f breach of trust suit against the state to raise the claim that benefits should be restricted to native hawaiians.
