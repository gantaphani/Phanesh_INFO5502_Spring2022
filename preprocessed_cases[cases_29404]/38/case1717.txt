pursuant to an agreement,plaintiff hospital is reimbursed by the state for medical services it provides to beneficiaries of the program.the agreement called for the state to reimburse plaintiff for providing inpatient care in its neonatal intensive care unit at a rate which was greater than the rate agreed upon for other services.the state determined plaintiff had wrongfully sought reimbursement for services which did not qualify as neonatal intensive care services.plaintiff unsuccessfully challenged the state decision administratively,then challenged the decision by means of a petition for writ of administrative mandate.the trial court denied the petition and entered judgment in favor of the state.we affirm the judgment.
statutory background 
provider agreements 
through the program,the legislature intended to provide health care to the aged and other persons who lacked sufficient income to meet the costs of health care.welf.in,the legislature established a system by which the state department of health services department could contract with individual hospitals for the provision and payment of health care services through the program.welf.
during the times relevant here,this new system required the california medical assistance commission cmac to negotiate selective provider agreements with hospitals.these contracts would establish the rates,terms,and conditions under which the department would reimburse hospitals for providing inpatient services to beneficiaries.welf.the cmac had the maximum discretion and flexibility in order to select among various methods of arranging for the provision of health services while achieving significant cost savings.welf.
regulations to implement the program are found at california code of regulations,title,division et regulations.to participate as a provider of health services in the program,a hospital must,among other things,be licensed as required by the health safety code,tit,subd.a.
hospital licensing requirements 
no person or organization may operate a health facility in california without first obtaining a license from the department.health.a general acute care hospital is a type of health facility having a duly constituted governing body with overall administrative and professional responsibility and an organized medical staff that provides inpatient care,including the following basic services medical,nursing,surgical,anesthesia,laboratory,radiology,pharmacy,and dietary services.health,subd.a.
if the management of a hospital desires its facility to provide certain special services beyond the basic services authorized in the license,it must obtain a special permit to do so.health.an intensive care newborn nursery is such a special service.health,subd.f.
the department may not grant a license or a special permit unless the applicant demonstrates its hospital is operated in the manner required by statute and by department regulations.health.the department licensing regulations are published in the california code of regulations,title,division et licensing regulations.
plaintiff sierra vista regional medical center sierra vista is licensed to be operated as a general acute care hospital.sierra vista is also authorized to provide intensive care newborn nursery services.its nursery may have intensive care bassinets.as authority to conduct this service,sierra vista license simply reads nicu,ten bassinets.
one of the licensing regulations regarding the provision of intensive care newborn nursery services plays a pivotal role here.the contested regulation reads a ratio of one registered nurse to two or fewer intensive care infants shall be maintained,tit,subd.d.sierra vista did not maintain this ratio.
the parties adopt the statement of facts in the final administrative decision issued in this case.we will quote from it in relevant part.the department and sierra vista entered into a selective provider agreement effective may.sierra vista agreed to render inpatient services to any eligible beneficiary and to be reimbursed for its services according to the rates set forth in the agreement.during the majority of time relevant to this appeal,the agreement established the following reimbursement rates 
d f or inpatient services provided to beneficiaries,the rate per patient per day of except that 
e for obstetrical inpatient services provided to beneficiaries in provider obstetrics unit the rate per patient per discharge of and 
f for inpatient services provided to beneficiaries in provider neonatal intensive care unit nicu,the rate per patient per day of.these rates subsequently changed to,and,respectively.
the agreement also required sierra vista to maintain complete records regarding its direct and indirect costs of whatever nature incurred in rendering inpatient services,even though sierra vista was not reimbursed based on those costs.it was reimbursed based solely on the rates established in the provider agreement.
on february,the department completed an audit of sierra vista contract payments and cost reports for the fiscal year ending july.the audit included reviewing the number of patient days incurred in sierra vista nicu and the department reimbursement for all of those days at the higher reimbursement rate established in the provider agreement.
the auditor wrote under sierra vista policies and procedures in effect during the audit period,newborns,including newborns,admitted to sierra vista nicu could receive services at four different acuity levels of care,designated levels through.the levels of nursing care afforded to newborns assigned to these acuity levels were as follows level ratio four newborns per one nurse level ratio level ratio and level ratio.
based on sierra vista staffing policies,the auditor determined some of the patients sierra vista had admitted into its nicu received inpatient services at the and nursing ratios,below the ratio required by the licensing regulations to be maintained when caring for intensive care infants,tit,subd.d.the auditor determined levels ratio and ratio were subintensive care units as defined in what she referenced as hcfa pub,section iib.according to the auditor,levels and are considered part of general routine care,not intensive care or nicu under the licensing regulations,and services provided at that level of care can be reimbursed only at the general rate.
the auditor asked sierra vista to provide information by which she could specifically determine which nicu patients received nursing care at levels and,and which received care at levels and.sierra vista was unable to provide sufficient information to make this determination.
as a result,t he auditor reduced all nicu days billed by sierra vista to to the general rate in effect on the dates of service.sierra vista was unable to provide logs,staff assignment sheets,or other reliable,auditable data which would have permitted identification of those neonatal intensive care days where care at acuity levels and was provided.the total disallowance related to the nicu was.the accuracy of the mathematical computation of this amount was not contested.
procedural history 
sierra vista challenged the auditor determination in an administrative appeal.it contended the level of care provided to all of its nicu patients,including that provided at the ratio of and,was allowed under health and safety code section it also argued the level of care was consistent with the plain language of the contract requiring the department to reimburse it at the higher rate for all inpatient services rendered in its nicu,and the reduction in payments was therefore invalid.
the administrative law judge denied the appeal.he first determined the department had adopted a regulatory procedure called program flexibility,by which the department could authorize exceptions to the licensing regulation requirements.see,tit.because sierra vista made no showing it had been granted program flexibility,the judge concluded the only services approved to be offered in its nicu are those which meet the requirements set forth in the applicable licensing provision,section,services where the nursing ratio is.the administrative law judge also determined the language in the contract was subject to the definitions provided in the licensing regulations.the department adopted the administrative law judge ruling as its final ruling.
sierra vista challenged the adverse audit adjustment and the department final ruling by filing a petition for writ of administrative mandate.in its petition and points and authorities,sierra vista claimed the terms of the provider agreement were was to be reimbursed at the higher rate for all inpatient services provided to patients in its nicu,regardless of the level of nursing staff provided to those patients.
because this language was unambiguous,sierra vista argued,the court was not obligated to review pertinent statutes and regulations.even if it did so,sierra vista practice of providing different levels of nursing care in its nicu was consistent with health and safety code section definition of intensive care newborn nursery services for purposes of its license and special permit.sierra vista claimed this statute controlled to the extent it conflicted with requirements in the licensing regulations.
the trial court denied the petition.the court acknowledged the contract was silent on the issue of nurse staffing ratios,but ruled the contract had to be interpreted in conjunction with the licensing regulations prescribed ratios.since these regulations existed when the parties entered into the contract,sierra vista was deemed to contract with reference to them.also,the contract specifically incorporated the licensing regulations as governing authority for construing its terms.
the court recognized health and safety code section defined intensive care newborn nursery services to include intensive,intermediate,and continuing care without reference to staffing ratios.however,the statute incorporated the standards of the american academy of pediatrics guidelines for perinatal care that identified intensive care at the ratios of and,consistent with the licensing regulations.taken together,the contract,the licensing regulations and the statutes indicated the parties intended to reimburse sierra vista for nicu services provided only to infants cared at a ratio of and.the trial court did not address the concept of program flexibility relied upon by the administrative law judge.
the trial court entered judgment against sierra vista on april.sierra vista timely appealed.

generally,on appeal,even where the trial court was required to review the challenged administrative decision under the independent judgment standard which is not the case here,the standard of review of the trial court determination remains the substantial evidence test.fukuda city of angels cal th,d.however,on appellate review,to the extent pure questions of law,jurisdiction were decided at the trial court upon undisputed facts,a de novo standard will apply at the appellate level.citations.anserv ins.services,kelso th,d.

interpretation of the service provider agreement 
sierra vista argues the plain language of the agreement entitled it to the higher rate of reimbursement for all inpatient services provided in its nicu when those services were provided at a ratio of and as well as and.it asserts the trial court erred by looking beyond the contract language to apply the licensing regulations to interpret the contract otherwise.we disagree.
interpretation of a contract consists in ascertaining the meaning to be given to the expression of the parties.see,et other citations omitted.

terms of the agreement 
this appeal turns on the meaning of the phrase inpatient services provided to beneficiaries in sierra vista neonatal intensive care unit.we look first to the language of the agreement.the agreement defines inpatient services broadly to include m edical,nursing,surgical,pharmacy and dietary services,physicians services,u se of hospital facilities,and a ll other services provided to hospital inpatients not specifically excluded by the contract.
the agreement did not define neonatal intensive care unit,or,the phrase used in the licensing regulations,newborn intensive care nursery service.however,the agreement did not specifically exclude such services from its definition of inpatient services.
the parties expressly intended the words and terms used in the agreement would have their usual meanings unless a particular or more limited meaning is associated with their usage in sections,et of the welfare and institutions code,or title of the california code of regulations pertaining to the rendition of health care agreement,italics added.
the parties further agreed the contract would be governed and construed in accordance with part,division of the welfare and institutions code the statutes and divisions the regulations and the licensing regulations of title of the california code of regulations they also agreed the contract would be governed and construed in accordance with title of the code of federal regulations.
we may not decide this case simply by resting on the agreement definition of inpatient services,as sierra vista would have us do.otherwise,we would be interpreting the agreement to require the department to reimburse sierra vista at the higher rate no matter what type of service is provided to newborns in the nicu and whether or not the services were provided in conformance with the laws governing the operation of a nicu.although the cmac had broad discretion to negotiate provider agreements,it had no discretion or authority to agree to a hospital providing inpatient services in a manner contrary to that required by law.
moreover,the agreement itself requires us to interpret the phrase according to a particular or more limited meaning if such exists in the regulations,the licensing regulations,or regulations governing the federal medicare program.indeed,the parties agreed any provision of the contract in conflict with the laws or regulations mentioned above is hereby amended to conform to the provisions of those laws and regulations.such amendment of the contract shall be effective on the effective date of the statute or regulation necessitating it,and shall be binding on the parties even though such amendment may not have been made according to the contract provisions regarding amendments.
