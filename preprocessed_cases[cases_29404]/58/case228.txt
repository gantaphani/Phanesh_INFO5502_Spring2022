the superior court issued a writ of mandate that precludes appellant city of los angeles the city from enforcing an affordable housing ordinance against a mixed use project that is being developed by respondents street properties,and geoffrey palmer jointly,palmer.the superior court concluded that,as applied to palmer proposed project,the affordable housing ordinance conflicts with and is preempted by the vacancy decontrol provisions of the rental housing act,et the act or the act,which allows residential landlords to set the initial rent levels at the commencement of a tenancy.the city has appealed from the judgment,which we affirm.
background 
in,the city adopted a specific plan the plan for development projects within the area located immediately west of the harbor freeway near downtown los angeles called central city west the area.in relevant part,section of the plan section.c imposes affordable housing requirements on residential and mixed use projects of more than dwelling units per lot according to section.d of the plan,the city adopted these requirements in order to protect the area existing residential community from further displacement,replace dwelling units previously removed from the specific plan area,and provide new housing in proportion to the need,by household size and income,associated with the existing community and new jobs generated in the plan area.
this litigation concerns the city conditional approval of a mixed use project piero ii or the project that palmer plans to build within the area.the site is currently used as a parking lot,but it previously contained a low income apartment hotel that was demolished in.the city conditionally approved the project subject to palmer compliance with section affordable housing requirements,but palmer contends the requirements conflict with and are preempted by the act.as previously mentioned,the act vacancy decontrol provisions allow residential landlords to set the initial rent levels at the commencement of a tenancy.the plan,on the other hand,requires either the construction of affordable housing units that are subject to rent restrictions for the life of the units or for years,whichever is greater,or the payment of an in lieu fee that the city will use to build affordable housing units elsewhere.the dispositive issue,both below and on appeal,is whether the city application of section affordable housing requirements to the piero ii project conflicts with and is preempted by the act.
section affordable housing requirements 
section.a requires applicants for residential or mixed use projects to comply with whichever of the following will result in the greater number of affordable dwelling units document and replace,on a basis in the form of new dwelling unit construction,low and very low income dwelling units guest rooms demolished on the lot or lots on or after february,or if no dwelling units were demolished on the lot or lots on or after february,a project applicant shall designate and reserve a total of of the dwelling unit s within the project as low i ncome dwelling units.
alternatively,if a multiple family residential project applicant does not wish to comply with the plan replacement and inclusionary dwelling requirements,section provides for the payment of an in lieu fee.section describes the in lieu fee as follows in lieu of the requirements of this subdivision,a residential project applicant may pay a fee.the in lieu fee for a required very low income dwelling unit shall be per unit.the in lieu fee for a required low income dwelling unit shall be per unit.
the plan limits the monthly rents that may be charged for any required affordable housing unit that is built under section.according to section.e of the plan,the monthly rent for low income dwelling units shall not exceed of of the median monthly income for persons or families residing in the los angeles standard metropolitan statistical area,and for very low income dwelling units,the monthly rent shall not exceed of of the median monthly income.section.e further provides that these rent restrictions shall remain in place,through the use of deed restrictions,for the life of the dwelling units or for years,whichever is greater.
ii.palmer project application and waiver request 
in,palmer applied for approval of the piero ii project,which will include residential units and square feet of commercial space on acres,consisting of separate,contiguous lots.because the project site formerly contained a low income apartment hotel that was demolished in july,the city concluded that the project falls within the scope of section replacement dwelling requirements.
palmer requested a waiver of section affordable housing requirements.in support of its waiver request,palmer pointed out that the cost of providing replacement low income dwelling units would reduce the amount of loan proceeds otherwise available to the project by approximately million,which would render the project economically infeasable.palmer also stated that because the site is currently being used as a parking lot,no existing dwelling units will be demolished or removed as a result of the project.instead,the project will provide an additional units to the existing supply of rental housing in the area,which will enhance the housing opportunities for people who work in downtown.
palmer objected that applying section affordable housing requirements to the project would violate the act.palmer argued that the act the area of rental control regulation and provides,among other things,that an owner of residential real property may establish the initial and all subsequent rental rates for a dwelling or a unit which has a certificate of occupancy issued after february,subd.a.palmer contended that section affordable housing requirements are exactly the type of local regulation that the act was designed to prohibit,as it would reduce,if not entirely eliminate,the economic motivation to produce the very rental housing that the act seeks to encourage,as it would interfere with applicant right to set initial rents on all of the new apartments produced,and all future rental increases for the property.
palmer further argued that because it was not applying for any additional incentives or receiving any form of any government support,the project should be exempted from section affordable housing requirements.see,subd.b the act does not apply where the owner has otherwise agreed by contract with a public entity in consideration for a direct financial contribution or any other forms of assistance specified in chapter commencing with section of division of title of the government code.although both the act and section permit developers to obtain density bonuses palmer pointed out that it has no need for a density bonus,because the project involves approximately fewer units than are allowed by the zoning ordinances.
iii.the city administrative rulings 
the local planning commission,the planning and land use management committee,and the city council reviewed palmer waiver request.at each level,the waiver was denied on the ground that the site formerly contained a low income apartment hotel that was destroyed within the time period covered by the plan.
the planning commission conditionally approved the project subject to section affordable housing requirements,as stated in condition of the project approval.under condition,palmer must provide replacement low income dwelling units,either on or,or pay an fee of per unit for units,for a total of and execute a covenant and agreement to maintain the rent restrictions set forth in section.e of the plan for at least years after the project certificate of occupancy is issued 
the city planning and land use management committee reviewed the administrative record and,after conducting a public hearing,sustained condition of the project approval.the city council also considered the matter and,after conducting a hearing,adopted the committee recommendation and denied the administrative appeal.
iv.this judicial action 
following the denial of its administrative appeal,palmer filed the present complaint for administrative writ of mandate,damages,and declaratory and injunctive relief in the mandamus claim,which is the only claim at issue on appeal,palmer alleged that the application of section affordable housing requirements to the project violated both the act and the mitigation fee act,et the superior court stayed the other causes of action pending a hearing on the mandamus claim.
prior to the mandamus hearing,leave to intervene in the action was requested by associations of affordable housing tenants the association of community organizations for reform now acorn and nonprofit developers the southern california association for housing scanph.palmer argued that the request should be denied as moot because,regardless of the outcome of the mandamus proceeding,it would not be building any low income housing units,either within the project or elsewhere.to clarify this point,palmer filed an amended complaint stating that if it did not obtain relief from condition of the project approval,it would pay the in lieu fee rather than build the required affordable housing units.the trial court denied the intervention request,which is the subject of a related appeal by acorn and scanph street properties,city of los angeles.
in the mandamus proceeding,palmer argued that applying section affordable housing requirements to the project would violate the act.palmer stated below that the act indicates a clear intent on the part of the state legislature to preempt all local rent control laws.see apartment ass of los angeles county,city of los angeles th,d holding that the act preempts local rent control by permitting landlords to set the initial rent for vacant units.as such,the replacement dwelling requirements of the specific plan,which impose restrictions on the initial and subsequent rents petitioner may charge for piero ii units,violates and is preempted by act.
the superior court concluded that applying section affordable housing requirements to the project would be fatally inconsistent with the act.the superior court rejected the city alternative argument to enforce section in lieu fee provision as a fee provision,while striking the preempted provisions from the rest of the ordinance.the superior court concluded that the fee provision was so inextricably intertwined with the preempted provisions of the ordinance that severing the fee provision was not a viable option.
following palmer dismissal of the claims,the superior court entered a judgment requiring the city to set aside,eliminate,and not enforce condition of the project approval and prohibiting the city from applying section affordable housing requirements to the piero ii project.the city has appealed from the judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
although the parties disagree as to whether the mandamus claim is properly characterized as a claim for traditional code civ,or administrative,mandamus,in either case the standard of review would be the same because there are no disputed issues of fact.bostean los angeles unified school dist.th,d.as the issues regarding the act present pure questions of law,we will review the trial court decision de novo.pellerin kern county employees retirement th,d.
ii.preemption by the act 
the act,which was enacted in august,established what is known among specialists as vacancy decontrol,declaring that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,all residential landlords may,except in specified situations,establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit,subd.a.dezerega meggs th,d.the effect of this provision was to permit landlords to impose whatever rent they choose at the commencement of a tenancy.cobb san francisco residential rent stabilization arbitration bd.th,d.action apartment,city of santa monica cal th,d.
the city contends that the judgment must be reversed because the affordable housing requirements that were imposed in condition of the project approval do not conflict with the act.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
general preemption principles 
in city of los angeles cal th,d,our supreme court stated the following general principles governing preemption analysis 
under article xi,section of the california constitution,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.fn.omitted.
if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.candid enterprises,grossmont union high school dist.cal d,accord,it solano county bd.of supervisors cal th,d,people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino cal d,lancaster municipal court cal d.
a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.candid enterprises,grossmont union high school,supra,cal d at,which quotes,without citations,people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino,supra,cal d at,which in turn quotes,with citations,lancaster municipal court,supra,cal d at,accord,it solano county bd.of supervisors,supra,cal th at,d,western oil gas monterey bay unified air pollution control dist.cal d,cohen board of supervisors cal d.
local legislation is duplicative of general law when it is coextensive therewith.see in re portnoy cal d,finding duplication where local legislation purported to impose the same criminal prohibition that general law imposed.
similarly,local legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.see ex parte daniels cal,finding contradiction where local legislation purported to fix a lower maximum speed limit for motor vehicles than that which general law fixed.
finally,local legislation enters an area that is fully occupied by general law when the legislature has expressly manifested its intent to fully occupy the area see,candid enterprises,grossmont union high school,supra,cal d at,or when it has impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality in re hubbard cal d,overruled on another point,bishop city of san jose cal d,fn,accord,it solano county bd.of supervisors,supra,cal th at d,western oil gas monterey bay unified air pollution control,supra,cal d at,cohen board of supervisors,supra,cal d at,candid enterprises,grossmont union high school,supra,cal d at,people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino,supra,cal d at.
b.the preemption issue was not rendered moot in this case 
the city contends that the preemption issue was rendered moot when palmer amended the complaint to allege that if condition is upheld,palmer will pay the in lieu fee rather than build the required affordable housing units.the city argues that palmer can not take the issue of section rental limitations out of the litigation in order to deprive proposed intervenors of standing,and then reinsert the issue in the case when litigating against the city.once palmer irrevocably elected to pay the fees,there was no longer even the potential danger that section.c would have any impact on the initial rents at the piero ii.as such,palmer claim became moot,and the trial court should have declined to entertain it.platt wells fargo bank am.tr,d.equity does not call for the determination of conjectural or premature matters which do not constitute actual or present controversies branick downey sav.loan ass n,cal th,d,rendering of advisory opinions falls within neither the functions nor the jurisdiction of this court.c itations and quotations omitted.
we disagree that the issue was rendered moot by the amended pleading.the amendment simply clarified that an adverse ruling on the complaint would result in the payment of the in lieu fee rather than the construction of low income housing units.this clarification did not constitute a waiver or forfeiture of any of the complaint substantive allegations.accordingly,we reject the city argument.
c.other preemption cases 
although we have found no case directly on point,we note that other courts have invalidated other rent control provisions that conflicted with the act.for example,in bullard san francisco residential rent stabilization bd.th,d bullard,the appellate court overturned a provision that permitted evictions if the landlord was reclaiming a apartment as the landlord principal residence,provided the landlord offered the displaced tenant another unit at a regulated rent.the appellate court rejected the tenant argument that the rent restriction was a permissible form of local eviction control under the act,which allows public entities to regulate and monitor the grounds for eviction,subd.e nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any authority of a public entity that may otherwise exist to regulate or monitor the grounds for eviction.the appellate court concluded that because a rent restriction is not a ground for eviction,it could not be justified as a form of eviction control had the legislature intended to preserve local authority to control rent following evictions,we do not believe it would have spoken in terms of the grounds for eviction,which simply do not include the amount of rent a landlord may charge after evicting a tenant.the san francisco rent control ordinance,by purporting to limit the amount of rent a landlord may charge for a replacement unit following an owner eviction,directly contradicts state law providing notwithstanding any other provision of law,an owner of residential real property may establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit,subd.a.therefore,the challenged provision is preempted.birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d,city of los angeles,supra,cal th,d.bullard,supra,th at,d.
in apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles,supra,th,d apartment,the appellate court overturned a los angeles rent control ordinance that preserved certain rent restrictions indefinitely.the ordinance required landlords,following the termination of their section housing contract with the city housing authority,to continue charging the restricted rent under the former contract,without any limitation as to time.id.at,d.the act,on the other hand,provides only a period during which the tenant may continue paying the prior restricted rent.the appellate court concluded that the ordinance unlimited rent restriction conflicted with and was preempted by the act,stating the legislature,in civil code section,specified the period of time a tenant rent payment is frozen following termination or nonrenewal of a section days following receipt of notice of termination or nonrenewal.because the legislature has fully occupied the field in this area,municipal code section,the ordinance,which purports to confer greater protections upon the tenant by freezing the tenant payment beyond days,and apparently indefinitely,is preempted.apartment,at,d.
in contrast with the above cases,division three of this district recently concluded that the act did not preempt the city rent recontrol ordinance,which provides that if a landlord demolishes residential property subject to city rent control law,and builds new residential rental units on the same property within five years,the newly constructed units are also subject to the rent control law.apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles th,d.the ordinance was authorized by the ellis act,et,which predates the act.the ellis act,which allows residential landlords to evict their tenants and go out of business if they comply with certain procedural requirements,was amended to include recontrol provisions that prevent landlords from evicting tenants under the pretext of going out of business and then the units at an unregulated rental rate within the next five years,subd.d.division three concluded that the act neither impliedly repealed the ellis act,subd.d,nor preempted the ordinance.apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.in this case,however,the ellis act does not apply because more than five years have elapsed since the former residential rental units were demolished on the site.
d.as applied to the project in condition,section requirements conflict with and are preempted by the act 
the legislature in the act clearly stated that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,all residential landlords may,except in specified situations,establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit,subd.a.section,on the other hand,requires palmer to provide affordable housing units at regulated rent levels that must be preserved for the life of the dwelling units or years,whichever is greater.
a local ordinance is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.we find section affordable housing requirements to be hostile or inimical to civil code section by denying palmer the right to establish the initial rental rates for the affordable housing units that are required to be built under section,and by preserving their regulated rent levels for years or the life of the units,whichever is greater.
although the act does not apply when t he owner has otherwise agreed by contract with a public entity to build affordable housing in consideration for a direct financial contribution or any other forms of assistance specified in chapter commencing with section of division of title of the government code,subd.a,there is no such agreement in this case.because palmer has refused to build affordable housing units under any circumstances,the issue is whether requiring palmer involuntary compliance with section affordable housing requirements is hostile or inimical to palmer right under the act to establish the initial rental rates for the project dwelling units.we conclude that it is.
under the plain meaning rule of statutory construction,if the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous our inquiry ends.there is no need for judicial construction and a court may not indulge in it.citation.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.el dorado palm springs,city of palm springs th,d.applying this rule to civil code section,subdivision a,we find that it is clear and unambiguous.according to its plain language,the act provides in relevant part that,n otwithstanding any other provision of law,all residential landlords may,except in specified situations,establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit,subd.a.forcing palmer to provide affordable housing units at regulated rents in order to obtain project approval is clearly hostile to the right afforded under the act to establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit.
the city argues that section does not conflict with the act because section is not a rent control statute that governs the entire rental housing market.according to the city,section does not violate the act because it simply mandates either the replacement of the affordable units that were demolished on the project site in,or the payment of an in lieu fee.we are not persuaded.section must be read in conjunction with section.e,which directly conflicts with the act vacancy decontrol provisions by imposing rent restrictions on the units required to be built under section.not only does section.e clearly restrict the initial rents for those units,but it imposes deed restrictions to control the rents for the life of the dwelling units or for years,whichever is greater.accordingly,it is plain that the plan imposes rent restrictions that conflict with and are inimical to the act,even if those restrictions apply only to a portion of the residential units within the project and does not control the rents for the entire project.
the city further argues that section in lieu fee provision does not conflict with the act,which does n
