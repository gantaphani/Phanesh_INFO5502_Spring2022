after carol bolt fell on snow and ice in the common parking area of the army apartment complex where she lived,in fort wainwright,alaska,she brought a negligence claim against the united states pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca.the district court held that the discretionary function exception to the ftca grant of jurisdiction,see a,did not apply because army policies set forth specific and mandatory rules for snow and ice removal from parking areas.it granted the government motion for summary judgment,however,concluding that the army was similar to a municipality and therefore,in light of hale city of anchorage,alaska,not liable for injuries due to natural accumulations of snow and ice.
we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.we affirm the district court jurisdictional ruling that the ftca discretionary function exception does not apply,but we reverse the grant of summary judgment pursuant to hale because the relevant question here is whether a private landlord,not a municipality,would be liable for negligence under similar circumstances.lastly,we deny bolt request for reassignment to a different district court judge on remand.
in april,bolt slipped on snow and ice near a dumpster in a public parking area of her apartment complex,which is located on the fort wainwright military base.as a result of the accident bolt suffered a broken ankle.because bolt was pregnant at the time of the fall,she underwent necessary surgery on her ankle without general anesthesia.despite the surgery,her ankle never completely healed and poses a permanent disability.
bolt brought a civil suit against the united states in the united states district court for the district of alaska,alleging negligence under and seeking money damages.the district court concluded that it had jurisdiction over her claim but granted the government motion for summary judgment,relying on a case by the alaska supreme court,which held that municipalities are not liable for injuries sustained by persons due to ice and snow on sidewalks.hale,at.bolt timely appealed.
as we will explain,the district court correctly exercised jurisdiction over bolt claim under b we have jurisdiction over her timely appeal under.we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.delta sav.bank united states,cir.
section b establishes federal jurisdiction over civil suits for money damages against the united states 
for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
even when the injury occurs on federal property,the finding of negligence must be based upon state law.lutz united states,cir.as the party seeking federal jurisdiction,bolt must therefore demonstrate that alaska law would recognize a cause of action in negligence against a private individual for like conduct.
alaska imposes a statutory duty on civilian landlords to keep all common areas of the premises in a clean and safe condition,alaska stat.a,a duty that includes an obligation to remove snow and ice,see coburn burton,alaska applying alaska stat.a.pursuant to,the government is liable for its employees negligence in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.because an alaska landlord would be liable to a private individual under like circumstances,bolt adequately alleged a claim under the ftca based on the army failure to clear the common parking area of snow and ice.
it is immaterial to this jurisdictional analysis that the army snow removal policy is more specific than the analogous state law duty.see indian towing united states.rejecting argument that ftca liability is predicated on the presence of identical private activity lutz,at finding a state law duty enforceable under the ftca,where the federal regulation at issue was more specific than the state law duty.as we explained in lutz the federal statute or regulation under which the employee acted only becomes pertinent when a state law duty is found to exist.the federal statute or regulation may then provide the standard for reasonable care in exercising the state law duty.at.here,alaska law imposes a duty on private landlords to keep common areas clear of snow and ice for the safety of tenants.pursuant to the army snow removal policy,the standard of reasonable care in exercising that state law duty was to remove snow and ice from family housing parking areas once per year,in late february or march.
the government argues,however,that bolt claim falls under the discretionary function exception to waiver of sovereign immunity and that the district court therefore improperly exercised jurisdiction.
section a provides that no liability shall lie for claims based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government.pursuant to the test announced in united states gaubert,d,to determine the applicability of this exception 
we ask whether the alleged wrongful conduct violated a specific and mandatory regulation or statute.if so,the conduct is outside the realm of discretion.if there is no mandatory regulation or statute involved,we then ask whether the conduct was susceptible to being based upon social,economic,or political policy.

the army snow removal policy requires snow removal from family housing parking areas once per year in late february or march.its housing handbook additionally imposed specific duties on the senior occupant,sergeant khan,to insure all common areas are free of trash,snow and ice and to report conditions beyond his capability to handle to the mayor of the complex.
the district court correctly concluded that these requirements were specific and mandatory such that the discretionary function exception did not apply.see gaubert,at.rejecting application of the exception when the federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,because the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive internal quotation marks omitted summers united states,cir explaining that a government official failure to take a required action would not be covered under the ftca discretionary function exception to liability.
the fact that clearing snow and ice from family housing parking areas ranks fifth in the snow removal policy sequential priority system for snow removal operations does not render the obligation to perform this removal once a year,by the end of march,discretionary.while snow and ice removal from some other areas takes precedence over family housing parking areas,nothing in the snow removal policy authorizes the army not to meet its yearly deadline to clear such areas once per year in late february or march.at most,the sequential priority a provision that this system is subject to change during emergency situations gives the army discretion to change dates within the expressly mandated february to march.nor does the special notice set forth later in the policy that a reas in which vehicles have not been removed will be bypassed and moved to bottom of the list give the army discretion not to clear snow from these areas until after the deadline see navarette united states,cir concluding that army obligation to properly mark or fence dangerous conditions was mandatory and explaining that it retained discretion as to how to mark or fence,but that does not mean it retained discretion whether to do so soldano united states,cir holding that flexibility in park service standards for establishing s
