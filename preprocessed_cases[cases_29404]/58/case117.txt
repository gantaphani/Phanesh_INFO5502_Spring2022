alfred lapeter and sharon lapeter,as trustees for the lapeter living trust referred to collectively as lapeter,appeal the district court order appointing a receiver to manage the parkcenter mall in boise,idaho the mall we have jurisdiction under a,and we affirm.
in,lapeter purchased the mall for million,made a million down payment,and financed the rest through a promissory note the loan issued by crown life insurance company crown life.the loan was secured by a deed of trust,security agreement and fixture filing deed of trust and an assignment of leases and cash collateral.
in,crown life assigned the loan to canada life assurance company canada life.in early,lapeter began negotiating with canada life to refinance the loan at a lower interest rate.the loan was set to mature in september,at which time a balloon payment on the remaining principal was due,and the leases of important mall bank and set to expire around the same time.during the refinancing negotiations,lapeter made various representations to canada life about the mall current and projected lease income.on june,canada life agreed to refinance the loan at a lower interest rate based,in part,on lapeter representations that keybank would only renew its lease for reduced rent and that talbots would not renew its lease at all.three days later,lapeter entered into a new lease agreement with key bank,which resulted in a significant increase in rental payments to lapeter.lapeter did not disclose this modification to canada life.furthermore,lapeter failed to inform canada life that talbots decided to extend its lease for two years.
canada life learned of the talbots and key bank modifications between october and november,and cancelled its refinancing commitment on november,following canada life cancellation,lapeter was unable to obtain alternative financing,and defaulted on the loan.he made a monthly loan payment on june,in the amount of,but failed to make the july and august payments.he also missed the balloon payment on september,and failed to pay over in property taxes that were due in december and june.the failure to pay taxes resulted in late charges and penalty interest.during this time,lapeter continued to collect rents from the mall tenants and deposited those proceeds,minus operating expenses,in a segregated account.
the missed payments and failure to pay property taxes constituted defaults under the terms of the loan.pursuant to the terms of the deed of trust and the assignment of leases and cash collateral,these defaults entitled canada life to take possession of and manage the mall,collect its rents,and apply for the appointment of a receiver.
on march,canada life took steps to foreclose on the deed of trust by filing a notice of default and a notice of trustee sale days later,it filed an action in state court seeking to appoint a receiver pursuant to idaho code in order to assume possession,management,and control of the mall its motion to appoint a receiver included a request that lapeter be ordered to turn over to the receiver any rents collected from the date of the motion onward.lapeter removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,and the district court held an evidentiary hearing on july.in connection with the hearing,canada life submitted an appraisal reflecting the mall capitalized value of.brian schwartz,canada life commercial mortgage manager in charge of the refinancing negotiations,testified that this figure should be adjusted downward because the leases had come closer to expiration in the year and a half since the appraisal was made 
although schwartz testified that he did not know the exact value of the mall today,he opined that it would be insufficient to discharge the debt.he testified that lapeter currently owed canada life,an estimate based on the principal balance of,plus contractual interest,default interest,late charges,attorneys and trustee fees,and unpaid taxes.lapeter offered no formal appraisal to contradict these estimates,and conceded in briefing on appeal the existence of a small shortfall.at the evidentiary hearing,lapeter simply testified that he believe d,based on the future potential,that the mall was worth million,and that it would be filled up or released in the next three to four years,although he also admitted that the demand for office or retail space is not very high currently.
by order dated july,the district court appointed a receiver.that order specified the receiver duties and obligations,and ordered lapeter to turn over any rents collected from the date of lapeter default onward past rents.the district court did not indicate whether it was applying state or federal law in making the appointment,but its findings tracked the idaho statute specifically,the court found that the appointment was necessary because the mall and the rents associated therewith,constituting the collateral were in danger of substantial waste and risk of loss because income from the mall was being diverted and not applied to servicing the debt encumbering the mall and the real estate taxes on it.the district court also found that the mall is or may become insufficient to discharge the debt which it secures.
lapeter timely appealed the appointment of the receiver,challenging the district court apparent application of state law,and the portion of the order requiring lapeter to relinquish the past rents.both parties requested attorneys fees on appeal.
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to review an appeal from an order appointing a receiver pursuant to a.section a vests this court with jurisdiction over i nterlocutory orders appointing receivers,or refusing orders to wind up receiverships or to take steps to accomplish the purposes thereof,such as directing sales or other disposals of property.we have adopted a policy of strict construction that has confined appeals to the three categories clearly specified in the statute.ftc overseas unlimited agency,cir citations and quotations omitted.here,the order appointing the receiver clearly falls within the first category and therefore is properly before the court.however,the parties dispute whether the portion of the order requiring lapeter to turn over past rents is appealable under a.
we have previously held that orders requiring funds to be turned over to a receiver are nonappealable under a.overseas unlimited agency,at.however,in overseas,the turnover order at issue was not included in the order appointing the receiver,as it is here.id.at see also sec am.principals holdings,cir separate turnover order not appealable under a united states chelsea towers,cir separate order requiring the delivery of certain deposits to the receiver not appealable but see cftc topworth int l,cir holding that a separate order requiring funds to be turned over to a receiver was appealable under,because it finally determined the appellant rights in the disputed receivership assets 
the parties do not point to,and we can find no,cases addressing the appealability of a turnover order that is included in the order appointing a receiver.the unique posture of the turnover order in this case distinguishes it from the discrete orders at issue in overseas and american principals holdings.based on this distinction,we conclude that because we have jurisdiction pursuant to a to review the appointment order,we may review provisions of that order which would not by themselves be immediately reviewable 
law governing appointment of a receiver in diversity action 
next,we consider whether state or federal law governs the appointment of a receiver in a diversity action such as this one.we conclude that federal law governs,and that appointment orders are reviewed for abuse of discretion.
federal law governs 
we have never squarely addressed the issue of whether federal or state law governs the appointment of a receiver by a district court where federal jurisdiction is based on diversity.those circuits that have considered the issue have held that federal law governs.inv.hous.dev,cir federal law governs appointment of a receiver in diversity case aviation supply aerospace,cir same 
in national partnership,the eleventh circuit concluded that federal rule of civil procedure assert ed the primacy of federal law in the practice of federal receiverships.at.rule provides 
these rules govern an action in which the appointment of a receiver is sought or a receiver sues or is sued.but the practice in administering an estate by a receiver or a similar officer must accord with the historical practice in federal courts or with a local rule.
emphasis added.
not only does rule require application of the federal rules in an action where the appointment of a receiver is sought,it specifically indicates a normative standard for uniform administration of receiverships in accordance with the historical practice in federal courts.see also charles alan wright,arthur miller richard marcus wright,miller marcus,federal practice and procedure,at ed.
the primacy of the federal rules in diversity actions is.see hanna plumer,d when a situation is covered by one of the federal rules,the question facing the court is a far cry from the typical,relatively unguided erie choice the court has been instructed to apply the federal rule,and can refuse to do so only if the advisory committee,this court,and congress erred in their prima facie judgment that the rule in question transgresses neither the terms of the enabling act nor constitutional restrictions.indeed,as the eleventh circuit reasoned in national partnership,to the extent rule dictates what principles should be applied to federal receiverships,courts must comply with the rule even in the face of differing state law.at citing hanna,at.
the dispute here hinges on lapeter contention that federal law differs greatly from idaho law,and that federal law would not permit the appointment of a receiver in this case.we disagree that the two bodies of law differ so substantially even if they did,any divergences between the two bodies of law would not implicate the erie doctrine,as canada life suggests,because the appointment of a receiver does not directly affect the outcome of the underlying action.new york life ins.watt west inv,citing pusey jones hanssen.see also hanna,at.eschewing traditional or distinction s and holding that the proper inquiry under erie is whether a state rule significantly affect s the result of a litigation.as the eleventh circuit noted,the appointment of a receiver in equity is not a substantive right rather,it is an ancillary remedy which does not affect the ultimate outcome of the action.inv,at citing pusey,at.in this case,the receivership has allowed canada life to manage the mall pending resolution of the parties litigation of their rights and obligations with regard to the refinancing agreement and canada life ability to proceed with the trustee sale.the receivership action is tangential to those disputes.
finally,although a state statute may provide a vehicle for the appointment of a receiver,such a statute does not change the nature of the federal courts equitable powers.indeed,a federal court sitting in diversity may exercise equitable powers independent of state law.see wright,miller marcus citing guaranty trust of new york york,which affirmed the independent vitality of federal equitable powers.in york,the court acknowledged that a federal court sitting in equity is not constrained by what remedies are available under state law.at.thus,regardless of whether state law provides a vehicle by which to appoint a receiver,the federal courts are free to provide that remedy solely by virtue of their equitable powers.based on the foregoing,we join the eleventh and eighth circuits in holding that federal law governs the issue of whether to appoint a receiver in a diversity action 
standard of review 
although it appears that we have never explicitly articulated the standard for reviewing a district court order appointing a receiver,we have consistently applied an abuse of discretion standard.see sec wallenbrock,cir applying abuse of discretion standard where defendant challenged the district court injunction and appointment of receiver sec hardy,cir reinhardt,concurring and dissenting power inherent in the district court to create a receivership is an equitable one that should not be overturned absent compelling justification demonstrating abuse of discretion view crest garden apartments,united states view crest,cir court acted well within its broad discretionary powers in appointing a receiver.
this is in accord with other federal authorities.see,inv,at a court of appeals should review a district court decision to appoint a receiver for an abuse of discretion.aviation supply,at we review the decision to appoint a receiver for abuse of discretion.lyman spain,abuse of discretion is the standard of review.accordingly,we affirm that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard by which to review a district court order appointing a receiver.
application 
under federal law,appointing a receiver is an extraordinary equitable remedy,which should be applied with caution.aviation supply,at wright,miller marcus,at.however,there is no precise formula for determining when a receiver may be appointed.aviation supply,at.rather,federal courts consider a variety of factors in making this determination,including,for example whether the party seeking the appointment has a valid claim whether there is fraudulent conduct or the probability of fraudulent conduct,by the defendant whether the property is in imminent danger of being lost,concealed,injured,diminished in value,or squandered whether legal remedies are inadequate whether the harm to plaintiff by denial of the appointment would outweigh injury to the party opposing appointment the plaintiff probable success in the action and the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff interest in the property and,whether the plaintiff interests sought to be protected will in fact be by receivership.moore,b new york life ins.at citing wright,miller marcus.
we have previously applied similar factors,foremost among them being whether the property was of insufficient value to insure payment,and whether the defendant was of doubtful financial standing see view crest,at.while our holding in view crest appears to be limited to actions brought to foreclose a mortgage insured under title ix of the national housing act,it is nonetheless instructive.id.at.
there,we indicated that we were adhering to the distinction drawn by the first circuit in garden homes united states,cir,between a receiver with the power to collect rents during the pendency of a foreclosure action,and a receiver with the additional power to manage the mortgaged property.view crest,at.we stated that in order to have the added managerial power,the plaintiff must not only show the doubtful financial standing of the defendant and the insufficient value of the property,but also something more.id.we wrote that t he additiona
