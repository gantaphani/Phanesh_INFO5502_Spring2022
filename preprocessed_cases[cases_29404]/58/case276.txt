introduction 
plaintiff celia ambriz appeals from a judgment of the trial court entered after the court ruled in favor of defendants mark kelegian,thomas morgan,and kelegian,reed white,llp on their motion for summary judgment.ambriz hired kelegian to represent her in a premises liability action she filed against the owners and managers of ambriz apartment complex,after she was raped by an intruder in a storage room of the complex.the trial court in ambriz premises liability case granted the defendants summary judgment motion.ambriz then filed a legal malpractice action against kelegian and the other respondents,alleging that they failed to conduct a sufficient investigation,failed to propound necessary discovery,and failed to prosecute ambriz claims.respondents brought a motion for summary judgment,contending that even if they did breach a duty of care owed to ambriz,she could not demonstrate prejudice because she would not have been able to establish landowner duty or causation in the underlying premises liability action.the trial court granted the respondents motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in their favor.
on appeal,ambriz asserts that the trial court erred in improperly excluding a substantial portion of her evidence,and in applying incorrect legal principles to the case.we conclude that the trial court erred in granting respondents motion for summary judgment because the court incorrectly determined that ambriz could not,as a matter of law,establish causation in the premises liability case.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
the rape at casa escondida 
on january,ambriz was assaulted and raped by an intruder at casa escondida,the apartment complex in escondido,california where ambriz lived.
casa escondida comprises rental units.the apartment complex received a variance from the city of escondido,allowing it to exceed typical density limits for a property of its size.as a condition of being granted the variance,casa escondida is required to rent to senior citizens or disabled individuals.casa escondida tenant population consists of lower income,elderly individuals,many of whom are female 
ambriz had been told that casa escondida was a secured community,and she had seen it marketed as a controlled access community,in that the complex claimed that it maintained a locked entry gate and that the doors to the buildings were secured.however,the entry gate was often chained open.an security guard had reported to casa escondida management that male intruders were gaining access to the building interiors.at the time of ambriz rape,three of the four entrances to ambriz building did not close and lock properly because the mechanisms on the entrance doors were broken.residents had complained,but the doors were not repaired.
the rapist was a transient who had been seen around the complex on a number of occasions over a period of more than eight months prior to the rape.he was often found sleeping on benches within the casa escondida complex.the transient regularly asked the residents,including ambriz,for money.in december,he became more aggressive and began to frighten ambriz and other tenants.that month,ambriz complained to the management that the doors to the buildings would not lock and that this transient was scaring her.ambriz was told that management would take care of it.
a police detective who investigated ambriz rape testified that the lack of evidence of a forced entry indicated that it was more likely than not that the rapist had entered the building through an open door.
ambriz underlying civil action 
after the assault,ambriz began seeing a rape counselor.the counselor recommended that ambriz discuss her case with attorney kelegian.ambriz met with kelegian,who told her that he would personally handle her case and that he was the best lawyer she could get to help her.according to ambriz,kelegian did not inform her that another attorney would be working on her case.ambriz saw kelegian on only one other occasion,when he attended her deposition.
ambriz received a letter from attorney kelegian office instructing her to appear for trial.ambriz went to court and waited for three hours,but kelegian never arrived.ambriz later learned that by this time,the court had already granted the defendants summary judgment motion in the premises liability case,and the case had been dismissed.
procedural background 
ambriz filed suit against the respondents alleging that their representation in the underlying premises liability action fell below the applicable standard of care.ambriz filed the operative complaint,a second amended complaint,on november.after answering the complaint on december,respondents filed a motion for summary judgment,or in the alternative,summary adjudication.
ambriz moved ex parte to strike the motion for summary judgment on the ground that it had not been served days prior to the hearing date.the trial court denied ambriz motion and kept the original hearing date for the motion.
in support of her opposition to respondents motion for summary judgment,ambriz lodged evidentiary exhibits and a number of declarations with the court.respondents objected to nearly all of the evidence ambriz offered.
after full briefing by the parties,on march,the trial court issued a tentative ruling on respondents objections to ambriz evidence and issued a tentative order granting the motion for summary judgment.on that same day,the court heard arguments from the parties,and took the matter under submission so that it could review its evidentiary rulings prior to issuing a final order.
on march,the court issued a second order in which it amended portions of its tentative order and confirmed the remainder.the trial court revisited and changed some of its previous evidentiary rulings.however,the court reaffirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of respondents.respondents filed and served a notice of entry of order granting summary judgment and of judgment on march.on april,respondents filed and served a judgment and a memorandum of costs.four days later,respondents filed a second notice of entry of judgment.
ambriz filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussiona.the trial court erred in excluding certain evidence ambriz submitted in opposition to respondents summary judgment motion 
before addressing whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment,we first resolve ambriz contention that the trial court should not have excluded many of the declarations and other exhibits ambriz submitted in support of her opposition to the motion for summary judgment.as we discuss,the trial court erroneously sustained a number of respondents objections to certain evidence ambriz presented.
on appeal,ambriz challenges the trial court exclusion of all or part of exhibits and five declarations.although it appears that the trial court should not have excluded a number of these exhibits and declarations,for purposes of this appeal we limit our discussion to the evidence that was excluded but should have been considered,and that was sufficient to establish triable issues of fact as to the issue of causation in ambriz legal malpractice action.
portions of the deposition of detective dianna lynn pitcher 
ambriz submitted a single page from the transcript of the deposition of escondido police detective dianna lynn pitcher in support of her opposition to respondents motion for summary judgment.the excerpt included pitcher statement that police had found no evidence of forced entry during their investigation of the rape,and that the department had concluded that it was more likely than not that the rapist entered ambriz building through an open door.
respondents made general objections to ambriz lodgment of the excerpt from the pitcher deposition on the grounds that ambriz failed to include a reporter certificate demonstrating the authenticity of the deposition testimony,and that ambriz attorney failed to state that she had personal knowledge of the deposition excerpt,failed to lay a foundation for the deposition excerpt,failed to authenticate the deposition excerpts and failed to present any basis for contending that the excerpt was what it purport s to be.respondents also asserted that because ambriz attorney failed to declare that the deposition excerpt was true and correct and that she had personal knowledge of the deposition,the excerpt was inadmissible.
respondents made more specific objections to the testimony included in the excerpt,claiming that the testimony constituted improper opinion,lacked foundation,called for speculation,and was irrelevant.
the trial court originally sustained all of respondents objections to the excerpt from pitcher deposition except as to the relevancy objection.after oral argument,the trial court overruled the objection that the excerpts were inadmissible due to the failure to include a reporter certificate.
there are a number of reasons why the court should have overruled respondents other objections to this evidence.first,the objections based on ambriz attorney failure to attest to personal knowledge of the deposition excerpts,lay a foundation,or authenticate the excerpts are without merit.respondents presented excerpts from the same deposition in support of their motion for summary judgment,a writing may be authenticated by evidence that a the party against whom it is offered has at any time admitted its authenticity or b the writing has been acted upon as authentic by the party against whom it is offered.respondents admitted the authenticity of the transcript of detective pitcher deposition by seeking to use portions of that deposition in support of their motion for summary judgment.raising an objection as to lack of authentication of an excerpt from the same deposition defendants themselves relied upon in their motion is disingenuous,unless defendants can establish that the excerpt ambriz offered was not part of the deposition transcript.respondents made no such allegation further,ambriz attorney attested,under penalty of perjury,that the copies of the documents lodged constituted true and correct copies of what they purport to be.this was sufficient to overcome respondents generic objections to this evidence.
additionally,ambriz attorney could have easily cured these perceived problems if given the opportunity to do so.at oral argument,ambriz attorney offered to do just that,but the court denied her request.the court responses to ambriz counsel during oral argument on the tentative evidentiary rulings indicate that the court was growing impatient with counsel attempt to address all of respondents objections and did not want to spend more time on the evidentiary issues the court should have allowed ambriz counsel to attempt to remedy the perceived failings before ruling against ambriz on a dispositive motion.
as to respondents objections on the grounds of improper opinion,lack of foundation and speculation,at least some portion of the proffered deposition testimony did not constitute improper opinion,did not lack foundation,and did not call for speculation.detective pitcher stated,we found no evidence of a forced entry.this information does not constitute detective pitcher opinion,nor is it speculation.rather,it is a fact about which pitcher,as a detective investigating the case,had personal knowledge.further,respondents provided a foundation for detective pitcher statements as to the findings of the police department in their own evidence in support of the summary judgment motion.respondents and the court were clearly aware that detective pitcher had both personal knowledge and background information sufficient to make such a statement.the court should not have excluded this evidence.
portions of the deposition of david henry mykytuik,a casa escondida security guard 
ambriz submitted a number of pages from the transcript of the deposition of david henry mykytuik,who was employed as an security guard for casa escondida at the time of ambriz rape.the deposition excerpts included mykytuik observations as to a number of matters,including the age and other characteristics of the residents,the defective doors and locks,security matters at casa escondida,complaints he had received from residents,and complaints he had made to management.
respondents objected to the proffered portions of the mykytuik deposition on the same grounds as the pitcher deposition.they also made specific objections to particular portions of the mykytuik deposition.
for the same reasons that the court should not have sustained the general objections to ambriz offer of excerpts of the pitcher deposition,the court should not have sustained the general objections to the excerpts of the mykytuik deposition.not only did respondents offer portions of the mykytuik deposition in support of their motion for summary judgment,but they relied on the mykytuik deposition extensively in their separate statement of undisputed material facts.there is simply no basis for respondents general challenges to the introduction of other portions of the same deposition.the court abused its discretion in failing to consider the portions of the mykytuik deposition that ambriz offered.
respondents separately objected to mykytuik statements that the residents at casa escondida were elderly and disabled,and predominately female,on the grounds of lack of foundation,speculation,improper opinion,and relevance.the court sustained only the relevance objection.however,evidence establishing that the residents of casa escondida are particularly vulnerable as a group because of their age and health is relevant to whether an attack on one of those residents was reasonably foreseeable.the evidence was relevant and should not have been excluded on this ground.
city of escondido ordinance and the declaration of restrictions imposed on the casa escondida property 
ambriz offered a copy of escondido city ordinance,showing that senior housing projects in escondido are required to provide i nternal perimeter security measures as necessary to meet the special security needs of senior residents.she also offered a copy of the declaration of restrictions imposed on the casa escondida development and recorded by the city of escondido,which shows that casa escondida was required to rent to persons aged or older,and to set aside no less than percent of its rental units for low or moderate income seniors.
respondents objected to both documents on the grounds that ambriz attorney failed to state that she had personal knowledge of the documents,and failed to lay any foundation or provide a basis for her statement that the documents are what they purport to be.acknowledging that someone from the city of escondido apparently attempted to authenticate these documents,respondents nevertheless challenged the documents on the basis of ambriz attorney perceived failure to provide sufficient authentication and foundation.
the court sustained respondents authentication objections to both documents.this was an abuse of discretion.ambriz included on both documents a certification by robert zoronado,deputy clerk of the city of escondido,attesting to the authenticity of the documents.there was thus a presumption that the documents were what they purported to be.see,a purported copy of a writing in the custody of a public entity is prima facie evidence of existence and content of writing if it purports to be published by the authority of the public entity in which the writing is kept,when a copy of a writing is attested or certified,the attestation or certificate must state in substance that the copy is a correct copy of the original or of a specified part thereof,official record of a writing is prima facie evidence of the existence and content of the original recorded writing if the record is a record of an office of a public entity and a statute authorized the writing to be recorded in that office.respondents offered nothing to overcome the presumption that these copies of official records were true and correct copies,as certified by a city official there was thus no basis for excluding this evidence.the court should have considered it in determining respondents motion for summary judgment.
b.the trial court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of respondents 
we review an appeal from the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,independently examining the record to determine whether triable issues of material fact exist and considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections were made and sustained.johnson city of loma linda cal th,d,see also saelzler advanced group cal th,d,saelzler.in conducting this independent review we must view the evidence in a light favorable to plaintiff as the losing party citation,liberally construing her evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing the defendants own showing,and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in plaintiff favor.id.at,d.
in order to prevail in an action based upon a defendant alleged negligence,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty,that the defendant breached the duty,and that the breach was a proximate or legal cause of his or her injuries.citation.we have recently observed that amendments to code of civil procedure section place the initial burden on the defendant moving for summary judgment and shift it to the plaintiff upon a showing that the plaintiff can not establish one or more elements of the action.citation.morris de la torre cal th,d.
standards for establishing legal malpractice 
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents on ambriz legal malpractice and related claims.the elements of a legal malpractice cause of action are the duty of the attorney to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.citation.coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,d.in a legal malpractice claim,the method for proving the element of causation has been likened to a trial within a trial or a case within a case.see viner sweet cal th,fn,d,viner see also mattco forge,arthur young th,d comparing standards of proof in accounting malpractice with those in legal malpractice.the or approach applied in legal malpractice cases is an objective approach to decide what should have been the result in the underlying proceeding or matter.citation.church jamison th,d.
causation in the legal malpractice case 
in moving for summary judgment in the trial court,respondents maintained that ambriz could not establish the element of causation in her legal malpractice case.specifically,respondents claimed that ambriz could not show that their alleged breach caused the resulting injury,the dismissal of the underlying premises liability case on summary judgment.according to respondents,ambriz would have been unable to prove the elements of duty causation in the underlying premises liability action,and thus could not establish that any presumed breach of the standard of care by her attorneys in litigating the premises liability case was what caused her to lose the premises liability case on summary judgment.
c ausation is ordinarily a question of fact which can not be resolved by summary judgment.the issue of causation may be decided as a question of law only if,under undisputed facts,there is no room for a reasonable difference of opinion.citation.citation.the question about what would have happened had the lawyer acted otherwise is one of fact unless reasonable minds could not differ as to the legal effect of the evidence presented.citation.citation.kurinij hanna morton th,d see also dawson toledano th,d instances in which breach of duty and proximate cause can be resolved as matters of law are rare.
using the case within a case method,the trial court concluded as a matter of law that ambriz would have lost the underlying premises liability action even if her attorneys had provided adequate representation,because she could not have survived summary judgment on the causation element.specifically,the court concluded that there is no triable issue of fact whether it was more probable than not that additional security precautions would have prevented the subject attack.
the underlying premises liability action a case within a case 
an action in negligence requires a showing that the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty,that the defendant breached that duty,and that the breach was a proximate or legal cause of injuries suffered by the plaintiff.see ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,d,ann.in this case,respondents assert that ambriz could not have established in the premises liability action that the management of casa escondida owed her a duty to take additional security measures,or that any breach of a presumed duty was the proximate cause of her injuries.ambriz asserts that she offered sufficient evidence to raise triable issues of fact regarding the duty and the causation elements of her premises liability cause of action.we conclude that ambriz presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to the issues of duty and causation in her premises liability case against casa escondida,and thus,that the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law that ambriz could not have survived summary judgment in that action.
ambriz could have established that casa escondida management owed her a duty 
respondents contend that ambriz could not have established that casa escondida owed her a duty to better secure the property from intruders,and thus,that she would have lost on summary judgment for this reason,regardless of her attorneys actions.we disagree.
the question whether a duty exists is to be resolved by the court,not a jury.ann,supra,cal th at,d.courts have determined that an actor has no legal duty to avoid harm that is not foreseeable.id.at,d.the duty of a proprietor of a business establishment to business invitees generally includes a duty to take affirmative action to control the wrongful acts of third persons that threaten invitees where the occupant has reasonable cause to anticipate such acts and the probability of injury resulting therefrom.citation.kentucky fried chicken of california,superior court cal th,d.
out of the generic obligations owed by landowners to maintain property in a reasonably safe condition,the law of negligence in the context has evolved to impose a duty of reasonable care on the owner of an apartment building to protect its tenants from foreseeable third party criminal assaults.vasquez residential investments,th,d vasquez.with respect to a landowner duty to provide invitees with protection from third party crime,the scope of the duty is determined in part by balancing the foreseeability of the harm against the burden of the duty to be imposed.citation.i n cases where the burden of preventing future harm is great,a high degree of foreseeability may be required.citation.on the other hand,in cases where there are strong policy reasons for preventing the harm,or the harm can be prevented by simple means,a lesser degree of foreseeability may be required.citation.citation.d uty in such circumstances is determined by a balancing of foreseeability of the criminal acts against the burdensomeness,vagueness,and efficacy of the proposed security measures.citation.ann,supra,cal th at,d,see also sharon arman,cal th,d,sharon,disapproved of by aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,applying balancing test to assertion that security guards should have been provided.
