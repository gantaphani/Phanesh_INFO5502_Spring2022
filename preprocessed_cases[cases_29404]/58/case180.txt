in this case,we determine whether and to what extent the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b,conflicts with and thus preempts a section of the city of santa monica tenant harassment ordinance.in relevant part,the ordinance authorizes civil and criminal penalties against a landlord who maliciously serves a notice of eviction or brings any action to recover possession of a rental unit without a reasonable factual or legal basis.the court of appeal held that the litigation privilege conflicts with and thus preempts the entirety of this section of the city of santa monica tenant harassment ordinance.we conclude,however,that while the litigation privilege preempts entirely the second provision of this section regarding filing an action to recover possession of a rental unit,it preempts only partially the first provision regarding serving a notice of eviction.
i.the city tenant harassment ordinance 
in,the city of santa monica city adopted a rent control charter amendment,which established a rent control board to regulate rentals so that rents will not be increased unreasonably and so that landlords will receive no more than a fair return.santa monica city charter,art.xviii.pursuant to this charter amendment,the rent control board adopted regulations that established a maximum percentage by which rental rates could increase each year.kavanau santa monica rent control bd.th,d.
in august,california enacted the rental housing act,which established what is known among specialists as vacancy decontrol,declaring that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,all residential landlords may,except in specified situations,establish the initial rental rate for a dwelling or unit,subd.a.dezerega meggs th,d.the effect of this provision was to permit landlords to impose whatever rent they choose at the commencement of a tenancy.cobb san francisco residential rent stabilization and arbitration bd.th,d.the legislature was well aware,however,that such vacancy decontrol gave landlords an incentive to evict tenants that were paying rents below market rates.bullard san francisco residential rent stabilization bd.th,d bullard.accordingly,the statute expressly preserves the authority of local governments to regulate or monitor the grounds for eviction,subd.e.
a month later,in october,the city enacted its tenant harassment ordinance.santa monica.when the santa monica city council amended the ordinance in,residents testified that instances of tenant harassment had been increasing in the city since the passage of the statewide vacancy decontrol measure.santa monica ord,subd.a.in addition,s tatistical information supplied by the rent control board staff show ed that since the passage of,controlled rental units were being vacated at substantially higher rates.santa monica ord,subd.b.
the city tenant harassment ordinance prohibits a variety of malicious acts by landlords directed at tenants in rental housing units,including prohibiting a landlord from,for example,abusing a tenant with offensive words,threatening a tenant with physical harm,or interfering with a tenant right to quiet use and enjoyment of a rental housing unit.santa monica.at issue in the instant case is santa monica municipal code section,subdivision i hereafter section i,which prohibits a landlord from maliciously serving a notice of eviction or bringing any action to recover possession of a rental unit without a reasonable factual or legal basis.
the ordinance provides for both criminal and civil penalties.any person convicted of violating the ordinance is guilty of a misdemeanor and may be fined in an amount not exceeding,imprisoned for not more than six months,or both.santa monica,subd.a.a civil enforcement action may be brought under the ordinance by a ny person,including the city,subd.b.civil penalties may include the greater of statutory damages in the amount of or actual damages,attorney fees and costs,and punitive damages,subd.d.the ordinance also provides that a court may enjoin a ny person who commits an act,proposes to commit an act,or engages in any pattern and practice which violates section,subd.c.
ii.factual allegations and procedural background 
in october,plaintiffs action apartment association,and doreen dennis,an owner and manager of multiunit apartment buildings in santa monica,filed an amended class action complaint against the city,challenging section i,which,as noted above,provides no landlord shall do any of the following with malice i take action to terminate any tenancy including service of any notice to quit or other eviction notice or bring any action to recover possession of a rental housing unit based upon facts which the landlord has no reasonable cause to believe to be true or upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to the landlord.
plaintiffs alleged that the city had engaged in a custom and practice of threatening housing provider class members with criminal and civil prosecution for simply talking to their tenants,serving their tenants or having their attorneys serve their tenants with a notice to cure or quit or notice to terminate tenancy filing an unlawful detainer complaint or having their attorneys file an unlawful detainer complaint against their tenants.they further alleged that the city had threatened dennis with criminal and civil prosecution for speaking to her tenant,and for directing her attorney to serve her tenant with a notice to quit and to file an unlawful detainer lawsuit for the purpose of allowing the owner to retake possession of the rental unit.plaintiffs contended that section i abridges a landlord rights to free speech,to petition the government for redress of grievances,and to due process under the federal constitution violates a landlord civil rights under title united states code section and is preempted by code of civil procedure section and the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b.with respect to their claim that the litigation privilege preempts section i,plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate directing the city to vacate and annul section i as preempted by the litigation privilege.the city demurred as to each cause of action,contending that plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to state a cause of action.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment for the city.
the court of appeal reversed.without reaching any of plaintiffs alternative claims,it held that the entirety of section i is preempted because it conflicts with the litigation privilege it reasoned that under the litigation privilege,a landlord serving an eviction notice or filing an unlawful detainer is immune from suit based on those notices or filings,and can not be enjoined from that conduct,even if the motivation is malicious,the factual allegations known to be untrue,and the legal theory untenable under the true facts.under the ordinance,that same landlord,with that same lawsuit,is subject to criminal penalties,a civil lawsuit,and an injunction.the ordinance thus punishes what the civil code protects,is contradictory to state law,and is preempted.the court of appeal concluded that the litigation privilege would bar every application of section i.it concluded also that the litigation privilege bars criminal prosecutions brought to enforce section i,reasoning that the fact that the legislature may create exemptions to a statutory privilege does not mean that the city may also do so.additionally,the court of appeal directed the trial court to enter a judgment declaring that santa monica municipal code section,subdivision i is preempted by state law.
we granted the city petition for review to determine whether and to what extent section i conflicts with and is preempted by the litigation privilege.the court of appeal decision that the litigation privilege preempts section i was correct only in part.the litigation privilege preempts entirely the second provision of section i,but preempts only partially the first provision of this section.
iii.discussion 
the litigation privilege,codified at civil code section,subdivision b,provides that a publication or broadcast made as part of a judicial proceeding is privileged.this privilege is absolute in nature,applying to all publications,irrespective of their maliciousness.silberg anderson cal d,silberg.the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that has some connection or logical relation to the action.id.at.the privilege is not limited to statements made during a trial or other proceedings,but may extend to steps taken prior thereto,or afterwards.rusheen cohen cal th,d,rusheen.
the principal purpose of the litigation privilege is to afford litigants and witnesses citation the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.citations.silberg,supra,cal d at.in order to achieve this purpose of curtailing derivative lawsuits,we have given the litigation privilege a broad interpretation.the litigation privilege derives from common law principles establishing a defense to the tort of defamation.oren royal oaks venture greenberg,bernhard,weiss karma,cal d.its placement in the civil code immediately following the statutory provisions defining the elements of the twin defamation torts of libel and slander citations makes clear that,at least historically,the section was primarily designed to limit an individual potential liability for defamation.ibid.beginning with albertson raboff,which involved an action for defamation of title,we first extended the litigation privilege to apply to torts other than defamation.albertson raboff cal d,albertson.as we observed in silberg,the litigation privilege has since been held to immunize defendants from tort liability based on theories of abuse of process citations,intentional infliction of emotional distress citations,intentional inducement of breach of contract citations,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage citation,negligent misrepresentation citation,invasion of privacy citation,negligence citation and fraud citations.silberg,supra,cal d at.
the litigation privilege,however,is not without limit.for example,in albertson,we did not extend the privilege to actions for malicious prosecution,explaining that t he policy of encouraging free access to the courts that underlies the absolute privilege applicable in defamation actions is outweighed by the policy of affording redress for individual wrongs when the requirements of favorable termination,lack of probable cause,and malice are satisfied.albertson,supra,cal d at.
we review the court of appeal determination that the litigation privilege preempts the entirety of section i.if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.city of los angeles cal th,d,quoting candid enterprises,grossmont union high school dist.cal d,candid enterprises.a bsent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the legislature,we presume that local regulation in an area over which the local government traditionally has exercised control is not preempted by state law.big creek lumber county of santa cruz cal th,d.the party claiming that general state law preempts a local ordinance has the burden of demonstrating preemption.ibid.
state preemption of local legislation is established by article xi,section of the california constitution,which provides that a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.in,this court identified three types of conflict that cause preemption a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication,supra,cal th at,d,quoting candid enterprises,supra,cal d at.local legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto,at,d,ex parte daniels cal,a city ordinance that set a lower maximum speed than the maximum speed permitted by state law was preempted.a local ordinance is preempted by a state statute only to the extent that the two conflict.cohen board of supervisors cal d,cohen see also peatros bank of am.cal th,d,fn.peatros.
plaintiffs argue that the litigation privilege is inimical to and thus preempts the provision of section i authorizing a suit based on a defendant bringing an action to recover possession of a rental housing unit based upon facts which the landlord had no reasonable cause to believe to be true or upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to the landlord and the provision of this section authorizing a suit based on serving any notice to quit or other eviction notice without a reasonable factual or legal basis.
a.an action to recover possession of a rental unit 
plaintiffs allege that the city has threatened action against dennis pursuant to section i based on her direction to her attorney to file an unlawful detainer lawsuit for the purpose of allowing her to retake possession of a rental unit.this alleged threatened action would arise under the second provision of section i,which provides no landlord shall do any of the following with malice i take action to terminate any tenancy including bring any action to recover possession of a rental housing unit based upon facts which the landlord has no reasonable cause to believe to be true or upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to the landlord.italics added.when considering whether this provision of section i is preempted,we ask whether it conflicts with the litigation privilege,supra,cal th at,d.
this provision of section i is inimical to the important purposes of the litigation privilege.first among these is afford ing litigants and witnesses citation the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.citations.silberg,supra,cal d at.whether actions pursuant to this provision of section i are brought by the city,a third party,or a tenant,such actions alleging that a landlord had improperly filed an action to recover possession of rental housing would severely restrict landlords freedom of access to the courts.
we recognize that the city enacted its tenant harassment ordinance for the legitimate government purpose of protecting the city residents from abuse by landlords.as described above,the city was motivated by the then recently enacted,which provided an incentive for landlords improperly to cause tenants to vacate rental units,and evidence that,after the passage of,instances of tenant harassment increased and units were vacated at higher rates.santa monica ord,subds.a and b.however,that the city was motivated by a legitimate government purpose does not justify its enforcement of a law that discourages all landlords,including those motivated by honest intentions,from initiating unlawful detainer actions.the city enforcement of the provision of section i that creates a civil and criminal cause of action based on the act of initiating litigation would cut against the litigation privilege core policy of protecting access to the courts.rubin green cal th,d,rubin.knowing that the city or any other person could bring an action under section i,even against a landlord who prevailed in an unlawful detainer action,would have a chilling effect on landlords pursuing evictions through the courts.
this and other courts have emphasized the importance of the litigation privilege absolute protection of access to the courts,while recognizing that this absolute protection has its costs.it is desirable to create an absolute privilege not because we desire to protect the shady practitioner,but because we do not want the honest one to have to be concerned with subsequent derivative actions silberg,supra,cal d at,quoting thornton rhoden d.w hen there is a good faith intention to bring a suit,even malicious publications are protected as part of the price paid for affording litigants the utmost freedom of access to the courts.mattco forge,arthur young th,d.additionally,in immunizing participants from liability for torts arising from communications made during judicial proceedings,the law places upon litigants the burden of exposing during trial the bias of witnesses and the falsity of evidence,thereby enhancing the finality of judgments and avoiding an unending roundelay of litigation,an evil far worse than an occasional unfair result.silberg,supra,cal d at.
in arguing that section i is not preempted by the litigation privilege,the city first would have us evaluate section i as if it had been enacted by the legislature,noting that relations is an area of the law in which the legislature expressly allows local governments to act.the city is correct only insofar as it observes that this and other courts have held that state law allows municipal governments the authority to enact and enforce particular local laws governing relations,including those related to evictions and rent control.see,santa monica beach,superior court cal th,d,fisher city of berkeley cal d,birkenfeld berkeley cal d,bullard,supra,th,d.that state legislation allows local governments to adopt laws regulating evictions,however,does not give those local laws the force of state law.
the legislature also has included savings clauses in rental housing legislation,preserving the authority of local governments to regulate in this area.these clauses are not intended to give local ordinances additional force or to expand the authority of local governments,but instead are intended only to preserve their existing authority.provides that n othing in this section shall be construed to affect any authority of a public entity that may otherwise exist to regulate or monitor the grounds for eviction,subd.e,italics added.this section is a strong statement that the state law establishing vacancy decontrol is not meant to affect the authority of local governments to monitor and regulate the grounds for eviction,in order to prevent pretextual evictions.bullard,supra,th at,d,italics added.legislation enacted in that prohibits a landlord from engaging in specified conduct in order to encourage a tenant to vacate a dwelling includes a similar savings clause,subd.d.however,we see nothing in these narrowly focused savings clauses that is designed to give local governments the new and additional authority to adopt ordinances limiting state laws of general application,including the litigation privilege.
second,the city contends that the privilege does not apply to criminal prosecutions,whether brought pursuant to state statute or local ordinance.we disagree.the city correctly notes that on more than one occasion we have treated it as obvious that the litigation privilege does not bar certain government actions,including criminal prosecutions and regulatory actions brought pursuant to state statutes.hagberg california federal bank cal th,d,hagberg rubin,supra,cal th at,d,silberg,supra,cal d at.however,these exceptions to the privilege have all involved suits brought under state laws,each of which makes clear that the legislature did not intend its enforcement to be barred by the litigation privilege.local governments do not have the same authority to create exceptions to the litigation privilege.
we have observed that the litigation privilege does not apply to the following crimes perjury,et subornation of perjury,criminal prosecution under business and professions code section false report of a criminal offense,and attorney solicitation through the use of runners or cappers rubin,supra,cal th at,d,quoting bus.silberg,supra,cal d at,hagberg,supra,cal th at,d.state bar discipline of attorneys who engage in solicitation and enforcement of the antisolicitation statute is also excepted from the litigation privilege.rubin,supra,cal th at,d.our recognition that prosecutions of these crimes and specified state bar actions are not barred by the litigation privilege does not reflect that an exception for criminal prosecutions is inherent in the litigation privilege itself.instead,our recognition of these exceptions to the litigation privilege has been guided by the rule of statutory construction that particular provisions will prevail over general provisions.in re james cal d,code civ.
each of the above mentioned statutes is more specific than the litigation privilege and would be significantly or wholly inoperable if its enforcement were barred when in conflict with the privilege.the crimes of perjury and subornation of perjury would be almost without meaning if statements made during the course of litigation were protected from prosecution for perjury by the litigation privilege.the misdemeanors established by business and professions code section evince a legislative intent that certain attorney conduct not be protected from prosecution by the litigation privilege every attorney is guilty of a misdemeanor who either a is guilty of any deceit or collusion,or consents to any deceit or collusion,with intent to deceive the court or any party.b willfully delays his client suit with a view to his own gain.c willfully receives any money or allowance for or on account of any money which he has not laid out or become answerable for.although tort liability may not be imposed when a person contacts law enforcement to report suspected criminal activity,the legislature has provided that a person may be prosecuted for a misdemeanor for reporting to a peace officer,deputy attorney general,district attorney,or other specified official that a felony or misdemeanor has been committed,knowing the report to be false,subd.a hagberg,supra,cal th at,d.similarly,while attorney solicitation may not be the basis for tort liability,the legislature has specified that certain attorney solicitation in or near prisons,hospitals,courts and other designated locations is a crime.bus,rubin,supra,cal th at,d.as we observed in rubin,the legislature has also charged the state bar with disciplining attorneys who engage in solicitation and enforcement of the antisolicitation statute.rubin,supra,cal th at,d.
in all of the above examples,we found exceptions to the litigation privilege based on irreconcilable conflicts between the privilege and other state laws.fundamental to the doctrine of preemption is the distinction between state and local laws local governments lack the authority to craft their own exceptions to general state laws.cal,art.xi.
third,the city suggests that any claims brought by parties not involved in the underlying litigation,including government entities,are not barred by the privilege.the city relies on rubin,supra,cal th,d,in which we held that claims brought by a of a mobilehome park against a park resident and her attorney for soliciting other residents as clients in anticipated litigation against the regarding park conditions were barred by the litigation privilege,including a claim for injunctive relief under the unfair competition law bus,et.rubin,supra,cal th at,d.we stated in dictum that the policy underlying the unfair competition statute can be vindicated by multiple parties other than plaintiff,including the attorney general,district attorneys,certain city attorneys,and members of the public who,unlike plaintiff,are not adversaries in collateral litigation involving the same attorneys.id.at,d.this dictum does not support the city argument that parties not involved in the underlying litigation are not barred by the litigation privilege from bringing actions pursuant to section i.in rubin,we considered the application of the litigation privilege to actions brought pursuant to the unfair competition law,a state statute,whereas here we consider its application to actions brought pursuant to a local ordinance.as stated above,local governments may not create their own exceptions to the litigation privilege.
while the legislature remains free to create exceptions to the litigation privilege,for parties to the underlying litigation and others,we decline to recognize a broad exception to the litigation privilege for any party who did not participate in the underlying litigation.an exception to the litigation privilege for all suits brought by parties who were not involved in the underlying litigation would be antithetical to the privilege purposes.the litigation privilege has been referred to as the backbone to an effective and smoothly operating judicial system.silberg,supra,cal d at,quoting mcclatchy newspapers,superior court d.it promotes the effectiveness of judicial proceedings by encouraging open channels of communication and the presentation of evidence in judicial proceedings.silberg,supra,cal d at.we have observed that an external threat of liability is destructive of the fundamental right of access to judicial and proceedings and inconsistent with the effective administration of justice.ibid.the litigation privilege is meant to protect more than the parties to a lawsuit from derivative suits that they might later bring against each other.derivative litigation brought by parties who did not participate in the underlying litigation,like litigation brought by parties who did participate,would pose an external threat of liability that would deter potential litigants,witnesses,and others from participating in judicial proceedings.
fourth,the city contends that the litigation privilege does not apply to an action brought under the ordinance because eviction notices and actions are noncommunicative conduct.a threshold issue in determining if the litigation privilege applies is whether the alleged injury arises from a communicative act or noncommunicative conduct.kimmel goland cal d.the distinction between communicative and noncommunicative conduct hinges on the gravamen of the action.citations.that is,the key in determining whether the privilege applies is whether the injury allegedly resulted from an act that was communicative in its essential nature.citations.the following acts have been deemed communicative and thus protected by the litigation privilege attorney prelitigation solicitations of potential clients and subsequent filing of pleadings in the litigation citation,and testimonial use of the contents of illegally overheard conversation citation.the following acts have been deemed noncommunicative and thus unprivileged prelitigation illegal recording of confidential telephone conversations citation eavesdropping on a telephone conversation citation and physician negligent examination of patient causing physical injury citation.rusheen,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the city argues that the gravamen of initiating an eviction action is improperly terminating a tenancy because such initiations,without more,frequently cause tenants to terminate their tenancies.it argues that a landlord who violates section i engages in a course of conduct designed to wrest a tenant from his or her home without complying with legal requirements.we have drawn a careful distinction between a cause of action based squarely on a privileged communication,such as an action for defamation,and one based upon an underlying course of conduct evidenced by the communication.white western title ins.cal d.as a general rule,the privilege applies only to communicative acts and does not privilege tortious courses of conduct.olszewski scripps health cal th,d,quoting limandri judkins th,d.for example,in limandri,the court of appeal held that the litigation privilege did not bar plaintiff cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations because it was based upon an alleged tortious course of conduct,including the preparation and execution of documents creating a security interest in a portion of settlement proceeds and the refusal to concede the superiority of plaintiff contractual lien.limandri,supra,th at,d.
the gravamen of the city alleged action arising under the provision of section i that prohibits a landlord from bringing an action to recover possession of a rental unit,is not a course of conduct.an action brought pursuant to this provision of the ordinance is necessarily based on the filing of a legal action,which by its very nature is a communicative act.the filing of a legal action is not an independent,noncommunicative,wrongful act.rusheen,supra,cal th at,d.we contemplate no communication that is more clearly protected by the litigation privilege than the filing of a legal action.
finally,the city suggests that in cases brought under section i where the tenant has already prevailed in a groundless and malicious unlawful detainer lawsuit,the three conditions required to bring a malicious prosecution action are satisfied and thus the litigation privilege does not apply.as noted above,we have recognized an exception to the litigation privilege for the tort of malicious prosecution because the requirements of favorable termination,lack of probable cause,and malice are satisfied.albertson,supra,cal d at.however,section i does not require that all three of the conditions of malicious prosecution be met.favorable termination is not an element of a cause of action under section i,and we need not address whether a similar ordinance that included this element would be excepted from the litigation privilege.a tenant who has successfully defended against an eviction action may,of course,bring an action for malicious prosecution.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the litigation privilege conflicts with and,thus,preempts the provision of section i authorizing a suit based on a defendant bringing an action to recover possession of a rental housing unit based upon facts which the landlord had no reasonable cause to believe to be true or upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to the landlord.
notice of eviction in order to recover possession of a rental unit 
plaintiffs also allege that the city has threatened action against dennis pursuant to section i for directing her attorney to serve her tenant with a notice to quit for the purpose of allowing the owner to retake possession of the rental unit.this alleged threatened action is authorized by the first provision of section i,which provides no landlord shall do any of the following with malice i take action to terminate any tenancy including service of any notice to quit or other eviction notice based upon facts which the landlord has no reasonable cause to believe to be true or upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to the landlord.italics added.when considering whether this provision of section i also is preempted,we ask whether it,too,conflicts with the litigation privilege,supra,cal th at,d.
this provision of section i conflicts only in part with the litigation privilege.the privilege applies only to a publication or broadcast made as part of a judicial proceeding,subd.b.a notice of eviction is a communication regarding prospective litigation,and,as such,it is not necessarily part of a judicial proceeding.see,edwards centex real estate th,d edwards.as described below,courts have developed a test for determining when a communication regarding prospective litigation is subject to the litigation privilege.because this test involves a question of fact,it is impossible to conclude,as the court of appeal did,that every action brought pursuant to the notice provision necessarily would be barred by the litigation privilege.
to be protected by the litigation privilege,a communication must be in furtherance of the objects of the litigation.silberg,supra,cal d at.this is part of the requirement that the communication be connected with,or have some logical relation to,the action,that it not be extraneous to the action.id.at.a prelitigation communication is privileged only when it relates to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.eisenberg alameda newspapers,th,d eisenberg edwards,supra,th at,d laffer levinson th,d laffer fuhrman california satellite systems d.fuhrman,disapproved on other grounds in silberg,supra,cal d at,rest d torts,com.e.
the policy supporting the litigation privilege is furthered only if litigation is seriously considered it is important to distinguish between the lack of a good faith intention to bring a suit and publications which are made without a good faith belief in their truth,malicious publications.the latter,when made in good faith anticipation of litigation,are protected as part of the price paid for affording litigants the utmost freedom of access to the courts.this policy consideration is not advanced,however,when the person publishing an injurious falsehood is not seriously considering litigation.in such a case,the publication has no connection or logical relation to an action and is not made to achieve the objects of any litigation citation.no public policy supports extending a privilege to persons who attempt to profit from hollow threats of litigation.fuhrman,supra,d at,fn.accord,edwards,supra,th at,d laffer,supra,th at,d.
whether a prelitigation communication relates to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration is an issue of fact.for example,in eisenberg,the court of appeal held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis of the litigation privilege because i t remain ed a triable issue of fact whether imminent litigation was seriously proposed and actually contemplated in good faith as a means of resolving the dispute between the parties.eisenberg,supra,th at,d see also edwards,supra,th at fn,d fuhrman,supra,d at.because a factual inquiry is required in order to determine whether a particular eviction notice is privileged,it is impossible to conclude that the litigation privilege would bar every action arising under the provision of section i authorizing suits based on unfounded notices of eviction.here,plaintiffs complaint offers very little description of the city threatened action or the notice of eviction that dennis allegedly served on her tenant.
because a factual inquiry is required in order to determine whether a particular eviction notice is privileged,the court of appeal erred in its holding that this provision of section i is entirely preempted by the litigation privilege.this provision is preempted only to the extent that it actually conflicts with the litigation privilege.cohen,supra,cal d at,peatros,supra,cal th at,fn,d.that is,this provision of section i conflicts with,and is preempted by,the litigation privilege to the extent it prohibits,criminalizes,and establishes civil penalties for eviction notices where litigation is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration accordingly,we reverse the court of appeal judgment to the extent that it directs the superior court to enter a judgment declaring that section i is preempted by the litigation privilege.
iv.disposition 
we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal to the extent that it reverses the superior court order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend and reverses the resulting judgment of dismissal,but reverse the court of appeal judgment to the extent that it directs the superior court to enter a judgment declaring that section i is preempted by the litigation privilege.we remand the matter to the court of appeal for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.
i respectfully dissent from the opinion of my colleagues.there is no conflict between the litigation privilege and the city of santa monica tenant harassment ordinance.had the city attempted to create some version of a privilege at odds with civil code section,subdivision b,that law would have been preempted.but the ordinance before us does not interfere with the operation of the litigation privilege.it is not inimical to the privilege in the relevant sense it does not prohibit what the statute commands or command what it prohibits.city of los angeles cal th,d.landlords are free to raise the litigation privilege in actions brought under the ordinance,and in such cases the scope of the defense could properly be explored and established.the majority,however,wields the defense not as the shield it was intended to be but as a sword against the legislative authority of local government.doing so,it distorts both the doctrine of preemption and the privilege itself.
the majority states the rule we recently reaffirmed in big creek lumber county of santa cruz cal th,d,a bsent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the legislature,we presume that local regulation in an area over which the local government traditionally has exercised control is not preempted by state law.id.at,d,ante,d at,at.however,the majority does not follow this rule.by no stretch of logic or language can it be said that when the legislature enacted the litigation privilege,it intended to invalidate local regulations penalizing landlords for bad faith conduct in legal disputes with their tenants.compare cacho boudreau cal th,d.
as the majority explains,the privilege was enacted as a limitation on defamation liability,and has been expanded by judicial decision to apply to a wide range of tort actions other than malicious prosecution,ante,d at,at.now,the majority further extends the privilege to apply to causes of action brought under santa monica tenant harassment ordinance.i would be sympathetic to such an extension were the privilege raised as a defense in an appropriate case.i agree with the majority that the policies underlying the privilege tend to support its application in this context.however,the privilege merely provides immunity from liability.it does not operate to abolish the underlying cause of action it simply limits the availability of the remedy in particular circumstances.see,rusheen cohen cal th,d,the litigation privilege narrows the scope of the tort of abuse of process in the judgment enforcement context.
thus,there are two separate reasons why it can not logically be said that the litigation privilege was intended by the legislature to preempt local legislation.first,the privilege was enacted as a defense to defamation claims,and while its scope has been enlarged by the courts,it has thus far not been applied beyond the tort liability context.the legislature failure to limit the reach of civil code section,subdivision b may be taken as an indication that it approves a broad application of the privilege in tort cases see hagberg california federal bank cal th,d,but no such implication may be indulged,as yet,with regard to causes of action arising under local ordinances.
second,the legislature plainly intended to provide immunity for communications made in connection with judicial proceedings,not to invalidate any particular causes of action.the majority cites no case in which a statute providing a defense has been held to preempt an ordinance providing a remedy.there is no reason for such a holding the defense may simply be raised in an enforcement action and given its appropriate application,without violating the presumption favoring the validity of the ordinance against an attack of state preemption.see big creek lumber county of santa cruz,supra,cal th at,d,for a discussion of the analogous federal preemption doctrine,see viva international voice for animals adidas promotional retail operations cal th,d.
the majority opinion is not only inconsistent with the principles of preemption and privilege it is also internally inconsistent.insofar as the ordinance applies to actions to recover possession,the majority holds it is flatly preempted.in response to the city argument that the privilege would not apply to actions that meet the requirements for a malicious prosecution claim,the majority notes that the ordinance is not limited to the circumstances in which a malicious prosecution action would lie,and the tenant is free to bring a malicious prosecution action if the requisite elements are satisfied,ante,d at,at.however,insofar as the ordinance applies to eviction notices,the majority takes a different tack.because the courts have limited the scope of the litigation privilege in tort actions arising from prelitigation communications,the majority reasons that the privilege is similarly limited in actions brought under the ordinance,resulting in only partial preemption.
if the policy considerations supporting the maintenance of some tort claims based on prelitigation communications are sufficient to permit some claims under the ordinance to go forward,would not the policy considerations supporting the maintenance of malicious prosecution actions also justify permitting claims under the ordinance by tenants who can establish the eleme
