charging that the district of columbia targeted hispanic neighborhoods when it decided to close certain apartment buildings for housing code violations,several tenants groups brought both disparate treatment and disparate impact discrimination claims against the city under the fair housing act fha and human rights act dchra.the district court allowed only the fha disparate impact claim to go to the jury,which then returned a verdict favoring the tenants with regard to one building.the city now appeals that verdict,while the tenants the district court order granting judgment as a matter of law to the city on their fha disparate treatment claim,and refusal to instruct the jury on their dchra claim.because we agree with the city that the tenants failed to demonstrate that its actions had a disproportionate impact on hispanics,we reverse and remand with instructions to set aside the jury verdict and grant judgment to the district on the fha disparate impact claim.but because the tenants offered sufficient evidence of intentional discrimination to support their fha disparate treatment claim,and because the district court should have instructed the jury on their dchra claim,we remand those claims for a new trial.
located just west of the border between northwest and northeast washington,columbia heights is,by all accounts,a neighborhood in transition.a and disproportionately hispanic community for many years,columbia heights became the focus of multimillion dollar redevelopment efforts after a metro station opened there in september.in april,the tenants of several columbia heights apartment buildings sued the district of columbia in district court alleging that in attempting to gentrify the effort that culminated in the closing or attempted closing of their city violated federal and local fair housing laws.both the tenants and the district filed against the landlords.in april,the tenants claims regarding three park road,columbia road,and sherman to trial.the following evidence was presented 
in early,district officials launched a program,known as the hot properties initiative,to enforce the housing code aggressively in the city worst apartment buildings.administered by the district neighborhood stabilization program nsp,the initiative,according to district witnesses,was intended to protect the health and safety of building tenants.nsp officials began the initiative by directing district housing inspectors to identify apartment buildings with the most dangerous and persistent housing code violations.this effort produced a list of approximately buildings distributed evenly throughout the city with the exception of its wealthiest neighborhoods,dupont circle,georgetown,and upper northwest.after paring the list down,id.at,the nsp director passed it along to officials at nsp overseeing agency,the department of consumer and regulatory affairs dcra.dcra officials then made additional alterations to the list,removing many buildings and adding others.soon after,nsp released a final hot properties list identifying what it said were the city worst buildings.on average,these buildings were located in neighborhoods where the percentage of hispanic residents was times the percentage of hispanics in the city as a whole.not one city witness was able to explain why the list concentrated so heavily on hispanic neighborhoods.
after dcra director informed nsp officials that he wanted the hot properties buildings closed,nsp posted closure notices at five buildings in and around columbia heights,where the percentage of hispanic residents was times the percentage of hispanics in the city as whole.the tenants of several buildings,including sherman avenue and columbia road,filed a motion for a temporary restraining order.the district then postponed the closure dates and eventually abandoned its efforts to close the buildings.
several months later,however,the district targeted another hot properties building,park road,for closure.although almost a year earlier an inspector had reported electrical problems and a missing fire escape at the park road building,the district not only failed to make any effort to remedy these code violations,but also gave the tenants just a few minutes notice before evacuating the building.the city declined to provide any relocation assistance,leaving the tenants homeless.
the tenants also presented evidence that in closing park road and attempting to close sherman avenue and columbia road,the district strayed from its general practice of considering alternatives to closure,such as using a specially designated fund,the fund,to abate the violations and seeking civil penalties against or criminal prosecution of the landlords.
in their lawsuit,the tenants argued that the district actions violated the fair housing act,which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of among other things race or national origin.see id.although the tenants articulated two theories of discrimination,disparate impact and disparate shall say more about the difference district court concluded at the close of the tenants that they had failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish disparate treatment.accordingly,the district court granted judgment to the city on that claim.the tenants also claimed that the city actions amounted to place of residence discrimination in violation of the human rights act,a.but the district court,finding the dchra inapplicable to the form of discrimination the tenants alleged,refused to instruct the jury with respect to that claim.
thus allowed to consider only the tenants fha disparate impact claim,the jury found the district liable for closing park road,but not for posting closure notices at either sherman avenue or columbia road.after hearing additional testimony regarding damages,the jury awarded a total of to twelve former park road occupants,only two of whom were hispanic.
the district now appeals the park road verdict,while the tenants the district court refusal to instruct the jury on their dchra claim and its order granting judgment as a matter of law to the city on their fha disparate treatment claim.the landlord of columbia road,andrew serafin,also appeals,arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the district against him.
we begin with the tenants fha claims.as relevant here,the fha makes it unlawful 
a to make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any person because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.
b to discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status or national origin.
a b.as noted above,the tenants rest their fha claim on two distinct theories.first,they argue that the record reveals evidence of disparate treatment,that in adopting the hot properties initiative and selecting their buildings for closure,the district intentionally discriminated against hispanics.second,they argue that even if unable to prove intentional discrimination,they can nonetheless prevail because the hot properties initiative had a disparate impact on hispanics.see palmer shultz,describing the difference between disparate treatment and disparate impact.
although the supreme court has barred constitutional disparate impact claims,see washington davis,d,it has permitted such claims when brought pursuant to federal law.in the seminal case on this issue,griggs duke power,d,the supreme court considered whether,absent evidence of discriminatory intent,an employment test that had a disproportionate impact on black workers could violate title vii of the civil rights act of,which bars employment discrimination because of race or national origin.answering yes,the court explained that congress intended title vii to prohibit,in addition to intentional discrimination,certain practices having an unintended discriminatory impact 
the act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form,but discriminatory in operation.the touchstone is business necessity.if an employment practice which operates to exclude negroes can not be shown to be related to job performance,the practice is prohibited.
griggs,at.in other words,to prove a disparate impact claim in the employment context,a plaintiff must first demonstrate that the challenged policy or practice has a disproportionate effect on a protected class.if the plaintiff makes this showing,the employer can prevail only by demonstrating that its practice was consistent with business necessity.see,arnold postal,see also k a c expressly extending title vii to disparate impact claims.
the supreme court has yet to consider the availability of disparate impact claims under the fha.significantly,however,the fha language prohibiting discrimination because of race or national origin is identical to title vii,and since griggs,every one of the eleven circuits to have considered the issue has held that the fha similarly prohibits not only intentional housing discrimination,but also housing actions having a disparate impact.see john stanton,the fair housing act and insurance an update and the question of disability discrimination,hofstra,listing cases.the tenants urge us to take the same approach here.expressing no view on the issue,the district assume s arguendo that a violation of the fha may be found based on evidence of disparate effect alone.district br.given that only one side of the issue has been briefed,however,instead of simply adopting the approach of our respected sister circuits,we think it more appropriate to assume without deciding that the tenants may bring a disparate impact claim under the fha.
disparate impact 
recall that the district court allowed the jury to hear the tenants fha disparate impact claim,and that the tenants prevailed with respect to one building,park road.on appeal,the district argues that the record contains insufficient evidence of disparate impact and that the district court therefore erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law.as always,we review de novo a trial court denial of judgment as a matter of law,setting aside the jury verdict only if the evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom are so that reasonable men and women could not disagree that the verdict is in error.duncan.metro.area transit,internal quotation marks omitted.
in one of the first cases to permit an fha disparate impact claim,metropolitan housing development village of arlington heights,cir,the seventh circuit emphasized that not every action which produces discriminatory effects is illegal,id.at.the court identified four factors for determining whether conduct that produces a disparate impact violates the fha the strength of the plaintiff showing of discriminatory effect whether any evidence indicates discriminatory intent the defendant interest in taking the challenged action and whether the plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant to affirmatively provide housing to a protected class or merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with individual property owners who wish to provide such housing.id.
believing it would place too onerous a burden on plaintiffs to treat these four factors as steps necessary to make out a prima facie case of discriminatory effect,the second circuit developed a framework once the plaintiff demonstrates that the challenged practice has a disproportionate impact,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that its actions furthered,in theory and in practice,a legitimate,bona fide governmental interest and that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.huntington branch,naacp town of huntington,cir,aff on other grounds,d.several circuits have adopted this framework.see,tenant ass bd.louis hous,cir langlois abington hous,cir.
in this case,the tenants emphasize the second circuit framework,while the city relies primarily on the seventh circuit inquiry.we need not adopt one approach over the other,however,for under either approach the tenants claim fails.both approaches require proof of disproportionate impact,and as we explain below,the tenants produced no such evidence.
pointing out that only two of the twelve tenants awarded damages were hispanic,the district argues that the tenants lose as a matter of law because they failed to satisfy their burden of establishing that the closing of park road had a disproportionate impact on hispanics.this argument misstates the tenants claim.as the district court explained,the policy the tenants disparate impact claim challenges is not the closing of park a policy,in any the hot properties initiative,specifically the use of the hot properties list to determine which buildings to close.see.under the tenants theory of the case,the closing of park road is significant because it constitutes the injury they suffered as a result of the hot properties initiative.to analogize again to the employment context,the city closing of park road pursuant to the hot properties initiative is similar to an employer refusal to hire a single individual based on the results of an allegedly discriminatory test.to prevail,such an individual would need to show not that her failure to obtain the job disproportionately affected her protected class such an inquiry would make little sense where the employer action affected only one person,but rather that the test itself had a disproportionate effect on the protected class.here,then,the question is whether the tenants satisfied their burden of establishing that the buildings listed as hot properties had a disproportionate number of hispanic residents.
in finding sufficient evidence of disparate impact,the district court relied on the testimony of the tenants statistical expert,who explained that the buildings on the hot properties list were located,on average,in census block groups whose percentage of hispanic residents was times the percentage of hispanics in the district as a whole.see id.at.seeing no bright line rule to guide courts or juries,or experts in deciding whether plaintiffs evidence has shown a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact,the district court held that the tenants had presented enough analytical information tending to show that the district policies had a disproportionate impact on hispanics to allow the jury to consider the question.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we disagree.
to prevail on a disparate impact claim,a plaintiff must offer sufficient evidence to support a finding that the challenged policy actually disproportionately affected a protected class.for example,in allen seidman,cir,a employment discrimination case,the seventh circuit held that plaintiffs satisfied this burden by demonstrating that percent of white candidates passed the challenged employment test as compared to only percent of black candidates,see id.at.likewise,in huntington branch,where the second circuit allowed an fha disparate impact challenge to a town public housing policy to proceed to trial,plaintiffs presented evidence that although only percent of the town population was minority,each of the town three housing projects had between and percent minority residents.see at.
in this case,by contrast,the tenants provided no evidence that the specific buildings on the hot properties list were disproportionately hispanic.instead,their statistical expert merely described the ethnic composition of all district neighborhoods,leaving it to the jury to infer the ethnic composition of the buildings from the ethnic composition of their respective neighborhoods.to be sure,under some circumstances a reasonable jury could infer a building ethnic composition from the ethnic composition of its neighborhood.for example,if the city population was percent hispanic and the neighborhood percent hispanic,one could reasonably assume that each individual building in the neighborhood was also disproportionately hispanic.in this case,however,a reasonable jury could make no such assumption because the percentage of hispanics in the relevant neighborhoods,while disproportionate to the percent found in the city as a whole,averaged only percent.see.without evidence that the hispanic population was evenly distributed throughout the buildings in the tenants neighborhoods,a jury could not reasonably assume that any particular building was disproportionately hispanic.indeed,absent such evidence,it seems just as likely that the neighborhood averages were high because some buildings were heavily hispanic while many others were not.
given this conclusion,we need not consider the district argument that the tenants disparate impact claim fails for lack of evidence of a relevant comparison,persons unaffected by the policy who were not in the protected group and who were similarly situated.district br.as we have explained,absent evidence of the actual ethnic composition of the buildings on the hot properties list,no jury could reasonably conclude that the initiative had a disproportionate impact on hispanics.accordingly,the district court should have granted the district motion for judgment as a matter of law on the tenants disparate impact claim.
disparate treatment 
the next issue before us is whether the district court erred in granting judgment to the city on the tenants fha disparate treatment claim.reviewing the district court order de novo,we affirm only if no reasonable jury could find in the tenants favor.see sparshott feld entm t.
in contrast to disparate impact plaintiffs,plaintiffs alleging disparate treatment must establish not that a facially neutral policy disproportionately affected a protected class,but that the defendant intentionally discriminated against them on the basis of race or ethnicity.accordingly,the specific question we face here is whether the tenants offered sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the district intentionally targeted their buildings for closure because the buildings were located in disproportionately hispanic neighborhoods.although we have no circuit precedent addressing intentional housing discrimination under the fha,plaintiffs urge us to follow the approach taken by many circuits and apply the framework adopted by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green,d,for use in employment discrimination cases.see,sanghvi city of claremont,cir reg l econ.cmty.action program,city of middletown,cir kormoczy hud,cir all applying mcdonnell douglas to fha claims.under that framework,plaintiffs must first present sufficient evidence to permit an inference of discrimination.if they succeed,the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.if the defendant meets that burden,plaintiffs may prevail by showing that the defendant proffered reason was pretext for discrimination.see mcdonnell douglas,at.because this approach makes sense,and because the district does not urge otherwise,we too shall apply the mcdonnell douglas framework.
according to the tenants,the evidence presented at trial suffices to permit an inference that the district intentionally discriminated against hispanics in deciding which buildings to close and allow the jury to conclude that the district asserted the health and safety of tenants living in buildings with the worst housing code pretext for discrimination.we agree.
with regard to the initial inference of discrimination,record evidence demonstrates that although the buildings first recommended for inclusion on the hot properties list were evenly distributed throughout most of the city,the buildings ultimately placed on the list were located in neighborhoods with an average percentage of hispanic residents times as great as the percentage of hispanics in the city as a whole.the five buildings posted for closure were located in even more heavily hispanic having an average hispanic population times the percentage of hispanics in the city.
the district insists that nothing in the record demonstrates that most of the buildings initially listed but then excluded from the final hot properties list were in neighborhoods.this is untrue.the tenants introduced maps illustrating the percentage of hispanic residents by census block group for the entire city,the location of the listed buildings,and the location of the five properties placarded for closure.a reasonable jury could rely on these maps,together with the evidence that the buildings were evenly distributed throughout most of the city,see supra,to conclude that although the initial list had not targeted hispanic neighborhoods,the final list did.
at trial,moreover,the district offered little explanation for how or why city officials decided to eliminate from the initial list over fifty buildings recommended by the housing inspectors,or add several buildings which the inspectors never identified as problem properties.as the tenants observe 
not a single district official could explain the sudden transformation of the list from one including buildings from every quadrant in the city,to a list almost exclusively comprised of buildings in disproportionately hispanic neighborhoods the absence of objective justification for the district subjective choices is strongly suggestive of an intent to discriminate.
tenants reply br.
at trial,district officials asserted that in listing the tenants buildings as hot properties and then targeting them for closure,their intention was to protect the tenants health and safety.the tenants,however,presented evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to disbelieve this claim.to begin with,they demonstrated that in deciding to close their buildings,the district deviated from its usual practice of considering alternative measures that would have protected the tenants while causing less disruption,such as using funds to abate the violations or seeking civil penalties against the landlords.according to record evidence,at the time the district targeted the tenants buildings for closure,it was spending funds at an annual rate of between and million dollars.although housing inspectors testified that they repeatedly recommended the use of such funds to abate violations at the tenants buildings,record evidence indicates that city officials refused to consider this option.when asked why,one official explained that if the city had allocated money to repairing code violations at the tenants buildings,it would have jeopardize d the availability of such funds for other areas of the city.in closing park road,moreover,the district departed from its usual procedure of providing relocation assistance when closing buildings,leaving the tenants homeless with only a few minutes notice.
indeed,record evidence reveals instances in which city officials treated buildings with serious code violations in neighborhoods differently than it treated the tenants buildings.one housing inspector testified about a set of apartment buildings on ayers place,southeast,where she observed code violations involving smoke detectors,a defective hot water system,and mold contamination.rather than closing the entire complex,the district used roughly of funds to abate the violations.another inspector described a building on ames street,southeast,which was not among the buildings targeted for immediate closure even though it had been included on the hot properties list and was,according to the inspector,in equally bad condition when compared to columbia road.id.at.the district asserts that the tenants failed to demonstrate that the ayers place and ames street buildings were located in neighborhoods,but the maps the tenants introduced at trial illustrate that every census block in the city southeast quadrant has a lower percentage of hispanic residents than the city as a whole.the district also asserts that the violations at the ayers place and ames street buildings were less serious than those at the tenants buildings,particularly park road,which had electrical problems and lacked an adequate fire escape.but making such judgments is the jury responsibility,and especially given the inspector testimony that the ames street building was in equally bad condition,we think a reasonable jury could find the violations at the ayers place and ames street buildings sufficiently comparable to those at the tenants buildings to undermine the district claim of intent.see gunning cooley.explaining that it is for the jury to decide the
