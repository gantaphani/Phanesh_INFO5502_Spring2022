at issue in this case is whether mobilehome park owners in a rent control jurisdiction may charge their individual mobilehome residents for a proportional share of the costs of a particular governmental assessment real property taxes assessed on the park as a whole,by way of a monthly charge that is excluded from rent,as defined by the municipal ordinance requiring mobilehome park space rent review.chula vista municipal code,chapter the ordinance,subs.a,h.we hold this portion of the ordinance,apparently allowing such charges for real property taxes,is in direct conflict with certain provisions of the mobilehome residency law mrl codified at et and is therefore preempted.mobilehome park owners in this jurisdiction are precluded from requiring such property tax payments from their residents under the definitions of rent and fee as used in section as read together with section mandating rent control jurisdictions to allow owners to charge certain fees,but excluding others specifically,subd.d of expressly excludes from the separately chargeable fees any tax imposed upon the property by a local governmental entity italics added.
on de novo review,our reading of the statutory scheme and its terminology requires us to confirm the trial court rejection of the park owners novel contention that the ordinance may permit what state law forbids.this argument by the park owners may be generally summarized as follows since,under the express terms of the ordinance,the municipal rent review commission can consider a park owner property tax increase when it adjusts a resident space rent in administrative procedures,the park owners and residents should also be able to pass on or share in the cost of a park owner property tax increase,outside of the ordinance rent review procedure,by entering into lease agreements which effectively pass on such a property tax increase,through the technique of incorporating local rent review law into the lease.
we therefore disagree with the park owners that this charge for property tax may be considered to be either a permissible component of rent or a rent adjustment that would be permitted by the mrl,by ordinance,or by the terms of the lease itself.moreover,we find no error in the trial court interpretation of this statutory scheme to assess statutory penalties on these park owners for willful violation of the mrl under,nor in the trial court decision that making express rulings on certain evidentiary objections was not essential to its reasoning process in arriving at its summary judgment order and the amended judgment.
we accordingly affirm the amended judgment,which is adverse to luis cacho et and don luis estates llc the successor to a family general partnership,who are the subject mobilehome park owners referred to here as owners.like other property holders,owners are subject to the usual property taxes and reassessment of taxes upon the park real property parcel.the are individual residents in their park,don luis estates the park the park is located in the city of chula vista the city,where the ordinance requires mobilehome park space rent review.
this conflict arose in,when owners imposed upon residents a charge to recoup recent increases in owners property taxes,as part of the residents overall monthly bill for rent and expenses.in,residents responded with a small claims action against owners,and the matter was transferred to superior court,where owners filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief regarding the application of the ordinance permitting such charges for real property taxes,subs.a,h.owners claimed they could properly recover proportional property tax payments from residents under the mrl definition of rent in section,as read together with section mandating rent control jurisdictions to allow certain charges,but excluding others.residents then filed a contending the ordinance language permitting the monthly property tax was in direct conflict with state law and was preempted by sections and,subdivision d.
owners brought a summary judgment motion and residents filed a.code civ.the trial court granted summary judgment for residents in the amount of actual damages,as recovery for the property taxes they paid.the judgment as amended after further proceedings also found willful violation of the mrl and imposed as statutory penalties under section per residence involved,as well as attorney fees and costs.
in owners appeal,they chiefly contend the trial court erred as a matter of law in its statutory construction of the mrl on the preemption question and in its statutory penalties ruling.we affirm for the reasons stated above and explained below.
factual and procedural background 
anature of action 
owners lease spaces in the park to residents who live in their own mobilehomes located there.owners provide a standardized lease which includes a paragraph referencing a base monthly rent,which can be changed upon notice pursuant to the mrl,which is incorporated by reference.this paragraph further provides the amount of rent and any increases in rent are governed by the city of chula vista.
in,one of the partners in owners family general partnership died,triggering a significant increase over in owners county property taxes on the parcel as a whole.in,owners inquired of staff members of the housing department at the city,who were charged with administering the city rent control ordinance,whether they could recover property tax payments from residents on a monthly basis.the city director of housing consulted the city attorney office and wrote to owners stating that the proposed property tax charge did not appear to be in violation of the city rent control ordinance,but should be listed separately from the base rent on the bill,subs.a,h.
beginning january,owners added to the monthly space rent charge a separate automatic property tax charge of per month for each resident.this additional monthly charge increased slightly over the next two years,and was separately designated in various ways on the bill rent tax,rent adjustment,adjustment,or other.although city officials advised owners to obtain their own legal counsel to analyze the propriety of the property tax,owners did not do so.following further dealings with the city,beginning in,owners notified residents the monthly rent would still include the property tax adjustment dating from,but it would no longer be separately billed.in may,the city rent review commission the commission notified owners they should no longer bill residents for increased property taxes,as those amounts had already been considered in the rent review procedure.
in august,individual residents representing spaces sued owners in small claims court requesting refund of this monthly charge.those matters were transferred to superior court to be heard with owners declaratory relief action.residents were contending that the city ordinance permitting automatic real property tax was in direct conflict with and was therefore preempted by section,subdivision d.residents also argued this monthly charge was not rent as defined in section.
in contrast,owners requested that the court declare these amendments to the ordinance relating to mobilehome park space rent review were valid and not in violation of section,subdivision d,subs.a,h.owners amended their complaint to add an additional party,don luis estates,llc,the successor to the family partnership which had originally imposed the property tax charges.
residents,as amended,requested relief for damages for statutory violations,injunction,declaratory relief,and breach of contract,alleging the contract was unenforceable as contrary to law.
owners brought a demurrer to the,which was overruled.the april,ruling stated that the relevant portions of the mrl did not allow the of real property taxes and preempted the city ordinance definition of allowable charges in its section,subsection h.the court ruled that these charges could not be classified as rent and were therefore an impermissible fee.
and evidentiary objections 
owners brought their motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues,contending that city ordinance section,subsection h was not preempted by the mrl,specifically,section,subdivision d.owners requested judicial notice of the legislative history of section,which was granted.see fn,post.owners also sought a ruling that these property tax charges should not be deemed to be willful for purposes of imposition of civil penalties under section.
residents brought a for summary judgment seeking a ruling that the property tax violated the mrl,and that the subject leases were accordingly unenforceable.residents also sought a ruling that owners violations of the mrl were willful within the meaning of section.residents filed a number of substantially similar declarations stating that they were of limited means and physical abilities,and did not understand the nature of the charges imposed,and believed that they should not be enforced.owners brought evidentiary objections to these declarations,contending they did not accurately reflect the individual circumstances of each and every resident 
substantive ruling preemption 
following oral argument,the trial court issued its order july.owners motion for summary judgment or adjudication was denied,while residents was granted.regarding owners request for declaratory relief,the court first applied the plain meaning rule,dealing with statutory construction,to find that the language of section,subdivision d is clear and unambiguous with respect to the impropriety of charging residents for property taxes,and that the legislative history was consistent with that language.the court ruled,the legislature expression that mobilehome park owners should be entitled to government mandated costs in rent control jurisdictions is not to say that the legislature in any way intended to sanction the of taxes.
with respect to residents,the court denied owners motion for summary adjudication for the above reasons.additionally,as to the fourth cause of action for breach of contract,the court reasoned as follows 
insofar as the fourth cause of action for breach of contract is based,in part,on allegations that the subject leases contained a provision whereby the parties agreed to adhere to the terms and provisions of the mrl citation,and insofar as the court has found that plaintiffs actions did,in fact,violate the mrl citation,summary adjudication of that cause of action is inappropriate and owners motion for summary adjudication is denied.
next,the court granted residents motion for summary judgment,noting that the same reasoning above also applied,that owners had violated the mrl by charging unauthorized property taxes.the court additionally found,inter alia,the leases were unenforceable because the subject leases were both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.additionally,because owners opposition memorandum addressed neither the factual nor legal arguments on this issue,the court deems this argument to have been conceded.
separate proceedings were scheduled for residents request for statutory penalties,and the amount thereof,under section for willful violations of the mrl.however,the court made a finding that owners violations were willful within the meaning of the statute.the court issued a judgment awarding damages reimbursement of payments made in the sum of,without specifying the costs of suit,attorney fees or statutory penalties.a petition for writ of mandate filed by owners,challenging that procedure,was denied by this court of appeal on the basis that there was an adequate remedy by way of appeal.cacho superior court,no.
statutory penalties ruling and judgment 
in its original ruling,the trial court denied owners motion for summary adjudication that their conduct was not willful for purposes of any civil penalties being assessed in connection with section,and ruled as follows 
while owners contend that there is no evidence that they performed a willful act as contemplated by that section,the undisputed facts do not support that position.in patarak williams th d patarak,the appellate court,noting that no published case had yet construed the term willful for purposes of the mrl,nevertheless rejected the defendant position that the term be defined consistent with civil code section respecting punitive damages under the standard suggested by patarak,the court finds ample evidence of willful conduct in owners act of initiating the for property taxes.need not show that in so doing,owners intended to violate the law,but rather that their conduct in charging for the increased property taxes was neither negligent nor accidental and was violative of the mrl.
in further proceedings held on the penalty issue,the court outlined as circumstances in mitigation that owners had consulted city officials,who obtained the city attorney opinion at the time that the for property tax was not in violation of statute.the trial court did not find it appropriate to award the maximum dollar amount or multiple penalties per occurrence,finding there was in essence a single violation flowing from owners initial determination to the property tax,which reflected their interpretation of statutes and the ordinance.the court further noted it would be inappropriate to penalize owners for the time period pending a judicial determination on their interpretation of the applicable rules.
accordingly,the trial court assessed statutory penalties against owners of per residence.additionally,the court awarded attorney fees in the sum of and costs of litigation of.an amended judgment was entered accordingly.owners timely filed their notice of appeal of the amended judgment also having appealed the original judgment.
discussion 
we first discuss the preemption issues under sections and,then consider whether owners conduct was willful within the meaning of section,and finally,address the evidentiary objections argument.
applicable standards 
owners appeal the judgment representing the rulings on the for summary judgment,which resolved solely issues of law on a factually undisputed record.because the issues before us are purely questions of law,we are not bound by the trial court judgment.citation.we independently evaluate the meaning of the ordinance and the california mobilehome residency law which are involved here.citation.karrin mobile home estates th,d karrin robinson city of yucaipa th,d robinson vance,supra,th,d distefano forester th,d.unconscionability of an agreement is also a question of law for the court.vance,supra,th at,d.
the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.e very statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.citation.if possible,significance should be given to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citations.citation.karrin,supra,th,d.
if local legislation is in conflict with general state law,it is preempted and void.karrin,supra,th at,d.conflicts exist if the ordinance duplicates citations,contradicts citations,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication citations citation.conflicts also exist if the subject matter of the ordinance is partially covered by a general law which is couched in terms indicating that the state will not tolerate further or additional local action on the particular matter.citation.we look to the language of the state law,its purpose and scope to see whether it indicates an intent to preempt local regulations on particular phases of the subject.citation.ibid.
scope of mrl and preemptive effectastatutory scheme rent fees 
it is well established that the mrl is not a rent control scheme,but leaves that determination to local entities.the court in vance,supra,th,d explained that the mrl clearly distinguishes between rent and fees.it regulates fees but not rent.section is one such fee regulation,providing in pertinent part a homeowner shall not be charged a fee for other than rent,utilities,and incidental reasonable charges for services actually rendered.
as explained in dills redwoods associates,th,d dills,this legislative scheme,including section,shows the intent of the legislature to prevent a proliferation of service charges above and beyond rent or utilities.the unscrupulous park owner could lure mobilehome owners with a competitive rent,then this relatively captive market with an array of unanticipated charges which when aggregated could render the tenant unable to afford to continue the tenancy.the legislature first ensured that the charges must be for services actually rendered it then required advance disclosure of the existence and amount of service charges in the rental agreement,proscribed particular fees it found odious,and required a notice period for any new charges for current tenants.dills,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
accordingly,some fees and charges above and beyond rent are allowed by the mrl.as relevant here,section,subdivision a authorizes a park owner to separately charge residents with certain fees,assessments,or other costs,in addition to rent such as governmental fees or increases imposed upon a particular space.where such separate charges are statutorily permitted,they may be implemented through the use of,as recognized by the city ordinance at issue here.however,by the terms of section,certain other items are expressly excluded from the coverage of the statute regarding any separately chargeable fees,any tax imposed upon the property by a local governmental entity,subd.d italics added.to avoid having the ordinance impermissibly duplicate,contradict,or enter an area fully occupied by general law karrin,supra,th at,d,we read this ordinance as primarily creating a procedural mechanism for those fees and charges otherwise allowed by the substantive scope of the mrl.we seek to determine the propriety of the property tax under state law,which in this case requires us to examine the coverage and exclusions in sections and.
accordingly,we consider owners contention that this charge for property tax is a permissible component of rent or a rent adjustment under section.owners alternatively claim this property tax is consistent with the nature of the inclusions of section,subdivision a the separate charges owners are allowed to assess,because they all represent operating costs for the park.
if,however,residents are correct that the nature of this charge squarely falls within the scope of the exclusions of section,subdivision d,the ordinance seeking to allow it will be preempted by state law,and the lease incorporating the terms of the ordinance will similarly be ineffective to create such an obligation upon residents.
our task is first,to define our terms,and then to read the applicable statutes,ordinance,and lease provisions together in order to determine the preemption question.
definitions of terms 
a traditional definition of rent was set forth by the court in vance,supra,th,d,as follows rent is the consideration paid by the tenant for the use,possession,and enjoyment of the demised premises.rent does not include other payments of money by a tenant for other purposes citation.id.at,d.
in vance,supra,th,footnote,d,the court further outlined the use of the term rent within the statutory context of the mrl 
the term rent is not specifically defined in the mobilehome residency law.in the mobilehome parks act,rent is defined as money or other consideration given for the right of use,possession,and occupation of property.citation.the mobilehome residency law contains the following additional definitions rental agreement is an agreement between the management and the homeowner establishing the terms and conditions of a park tenancy.a lease is a rental agreement.citation.homeowner is a person who has a tenancy in a mobilehome park under a rental agreement.citation.tenancy is the right of a homeowner to the use of a site within a mobilehome park on which to locate,maintain,and occupy a mobilehome,site improvements,and accessory structures for human habitation,including the use of the services and facilities of the park.citation.
for purposes of defining rent within the statutory context of the mrl,it is important to read the case law with attention to whether it arose in a jurisdiction or in a jurisdiction.where there is no local rent control regulation on mobile home residency,the amount of rent is left up to the agreement of the parties,in their lease agreement.vance,supra,th at,d.for example,in vance,the leases were interpreted as using a charge as a convenient label to describe increased operating costs,and i n the absence of rent control,the parties may agree on future rent increases based on increased operating expenses.in the leases,the operate as rent,not as fees.id.at,d.similarly,in dills,the lease agreement provided for a capital improvement charge to residents as part of the annual rent adjustment component of rent.dills,supra,th at,d.thus,the breakdown of rent into separately calculated and capital improvement components does not invalidate the capital component with respect to a challenge under section.id.at,d.
however,pursuant to the mrl,in rent control jurisdictions such as the city in this case,the permissible components of rent are limited by their local ordinances,rather than being subject to open negotiation in the leases.vance,supra,th at,d mrl regulates fees,not rent,and lease agreements are negotiable regarding rent rates when not otherwise regulated.fees other than those authorized by section,rent,utilities,and incidental reasonable charges for services actually rendered can not be permitted by a local ordinance.for example,the court decision in robinson,supra,th,d,arose in the procedural context of mandamus review of an administrative decision.there,it was dispositive that the relevant parts of that city ordinance did not distinguish between rent and assessments for capital improvements thus,it was permissible to treat capital improvement adjustments as one of the components of the rental rate formula.id.at,d.this was accomplished by the local rent administrator and commission as part of the rent review procedure.it was also important that that city ordinance defines rent to include the consideration paid not only for use of a space on which to place a mobile home but also for related housing services.citation.reading the ordinance as a whole,it is clear that a capital improvement adjustment is a rent adjustment,not a fee.we conclude that civil code section does not preempt the ordinance.robinson,supra,th at,d.
however,in karrin,supra,th,d,an owner monthly capital assessment for road improvements was held to violate section.the city of oxnard rent control ordinance defined rent as being exclusive of for capital expenditures.karrin,supra,th at,d.the court concluded that to the extent the ordinance purported to authorize such a,it was invalid as conflicting with section.karrin,supra,th at,d.by enacting section,the legislature intended to limit strictly the ability of park management to collect fees from any source except for services performed.citation.the assessment at issue was neither a charge for utilities nor for services rendered.citation.karrin,supra,th,d,as cited in dills,supra,th at,d.as such,the ordinance could not permit these capital assessment provisions due to state preemption under section.karrin,supra,th at,d.
contentions 
owners primarily contend that the city ordinance apparently permitting automatic of property tax charges was not preempted by section,because such should not be considered to be prohibited fees in excess of rent.their position is that they are not charging a fee other than rent,because rent is an elastic concept which can include items other than the base or space rent owing by a homeowner,and that the local ordinance,as incorporated into the leases,recognizes this.
owners further contend the trial court erred in determining that the ordinance was preempted by section,subdivision d,in its finding based on that language stating,taxes imposed by a city or county are excluded from the amount management may separately charge a tenant.owners claim that the purpose of section as a whole to protect the right of owners to pass on certain locally imposed governmental costs to residents demonstrates that local entities should be allowed to enact ordinances permitting such property tax,and the lease agreements involved here should be so interpreted.owners would interpret the exclusion in section,subdivision d,regarding property tax,as permitting the city to take this affirmative action to delete that item from the rent review procedure,because this exclusion merely indicates that property tax can not,under this section,amount to the kind of mandatory allowable outlined by this statute,which may be assessed outside of the base rent amount.owners theory seems to be that if this particular charge is not outside the base rent,it must be deemed to be included within the rent definition.
further,owners argue it is persuasive that the commission can,under the ordinance,consider property tax as one of the many factors that can be taken into account in allowing a rent increase pursuant to an owner application to the commission.for example,under the ordinance,the commission can consider an owner other operating and maintenance costs when deciding on a rent increase application.ibid.it is not disputed that owners never went through this administrative procedure regarding this charge for the property taxes,as they did not believe it was necessary.owners would extend this reasoning to say that property tax can be a permissible component of rent,as an other operating and maintenance cost,even outside this rent review procedure.
in other words,owners rely on the terms of the ordinance to argue that property tax charges outside of space rent are authorized here.on the other hand,they rely on the lease terms to argue that the property tax charge is a proper component of rent or a proper rent adjustment,because the lease incorporates the terms of the city ordinance which in turn allows for a property tax charge.specifically,the lease includes a paragraph referencing a base monthly rent,and further provides,the amount of rent and any increases in rent are governed by the city.see,sub.h.this is a somewhat circular argument.in any case,owners have taken inconsistent positions between and the present on whether the property tax should properly be considered part of the aggregate rent or as an excluded charge.similarly,the position of city officials has also changed over the years.see fn,post.
residents defend the trial court ruling,arguing this property tax charge represents the kind of fee barred by section,and which does not fall within the scope of the exceptions to this bar found in section,for governmental assessments upon an individual space.they contend that when section is read in its entirety,rather than allowing local entities to permit this type of,it instead ensures that the enumerated mandatory allowable guaranteed by this state law shall not include property tax,subd.a,only governmental fees assessed upon a space are allowed as separate charges see fn,ante.residents therefore argue,appellant argument that section d means that a local government has the option of allowing the of real property taxes is disingenuous and not supported by the legislative history or common sense.further,they contend it is irrelevant that the lease specifically references the power of the city to control rent increases,if the city does not have any such power to authorize the property tax item in the first place.
to determine if this local legislation is in conflict with general state law,we look to whether the ordinance duplicates citations,contradicts citations,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication citations citation.conflicts also exist if the subject matter of the ordinance is partially covered by a general law which is couched in terms indicating that the state will not tolerate further or additional local action on the particular matter.citation.karrin,supra,th,d.we will first outline the terms of the ordinance,as incorporated into the lease,and read it in light of the mrl statutory language and legislative history.other considerations raised by the parties include owners correspondence with the city about whether this was an allowable charge to residents 
owners would read the ordinance as allowing rent to be composed of a number of discrete components,some applicable to each space and some applicable to the park as a whole,this property tax charge.the ordinance at section,subsection a defines space rent as including a number of types of charges,although the ordinance states that its definition of space rent is exclusive of other allowable as defined in subsection h below.section,subsection h lists among these other allowable,some governmental assessments such as real property taxes the leases,at paragraph,include a reference to the city ordinance as governing the amount of rent and any increases in rent.
we have indicated above that we read this ordinance as creating a procedural mechanism for allowing fees or charges that are otherwise permitted by statute.there are several reasons why this property tax is not allowed by the statutory scheme.first,the traditional definitions of rent and the ordinance definition of space rent indicate that residents obligation to pay rent stems from their use and occupancy of their particular spaces and the common areas.this is equivalent to a local assessment for local purposes.for example,in vance,supra,th,d,which arose in a jurisdiction that did not have rent control,the lease allowed the owners to charge fees in addition to rent that were payment for ancillary services related to occupancy and service needs for the tenants.id.at,d see,defining tenancy as the use of a site within a park.
this distinction between the purpose of a local assessment upon a particular space and an overall property tax assessment for an entire parcel is outlined in cases such as city of sacramento drew d,as follows the distinction between a property tax and a special localized assessment is that the former is levied to pay for general expenditures deemed to benefit all property owners within the taxing district while the latter is a charge imposed on particular real property for a local public improvement of direct benefit to that property citations.id.at,fn.as this principle is applied here,the very nature of this expense,a property tax that is assessed upon the park as a whole,points toward holding the park owners solely responsible for it as property owners.in contrast,the park residents are tenants who benefit from the use and occupancy of their spaces at the property and common areas,but not from the ownership of the property itself.
next,owners can not rely on the terms of the lease to authorize these property tax,merely through the lease incorporation of city provisions for rent increases.owners are not justified in their heavy reliance on vance for the proposition that the amount of rent is left up to the agreement of the parties,in their lease agreement.vance,supra,th at,d.that is true where there is no rent control ordinance in effect in a jurisdiction,but where there is a rent review procedure set up by the local entity,it includes a definition of rent to be administered by the responsible agency.here,the commission is delegated the power to apply the terms of that ordinance,such as by considering property taxes and operating costs and expenses when conducting rent review of space rents.from a review of this ordinance as a whole,it does not appear that the intention of the city was to allow owners and residents to negotiate lease terms and rents with respect to the creation of property tax,since that issue was specifically delegated to the commission.
for example,under the ordinance,section,subsection h,it is expressly provided that separately billed utility service fees and charges excluded from rent in accordance with the provisions of civil code section and such rate increases are proper allowable separate charges under the ordinance.this indicates a recognition the statutory scheme as a whole allows those particular expenses to be specifically exempted from the bar of section,because they pertain to the residents individualized use of their own rental premises.similarly,assessments for municipal services or improvements,as mentioned in the ordinance,subsection h,also pertain to the individuals rights to use and occupancy of the premises,sub.h.however,governmental assessments such as real property taxes ibid.are not specific to the individual spaces and the tenant individual use and enjoyment of the park premises and common areas.as such,we do not believe that the local entity in this rent control jurisdiction,under this ordinance,has the power to authorize a charge for property tax,either as a rent component or as an additional fee.
this conclusion is consistent with the reasoning of robinson,supra,th,d.in that case,the rent control ordinance defined rent as including operating expenses above space rent,for purposes of administrative determination of rent by the city administrator and commission.therefore,the owners charge to residents for capital improvements as operating expenses street improvements was allowable as a rent adjustment and part of the related housing services provided to the residents.id.at,d.it was not an impermissible fee within the meaning of section.ibid.in contrast,here,owners seek to impose a separate charge,not for a housing service,independent of the rent review procedure.thus,robinson does not support the owners position on the applicability of section.
in karrin,supra,th,d,the subject rent control ordinance defined rent as excluding operating expenses.id.at,d.it was therefore improper under section for those owners to create a charge for capital assessments as operating expenses as part of the rent charge.in dills,supra,th,d,which arose in a jurisdiction,the lease was interpreted as allowing certain charges as part of rent,for capital assessments.however,the court in that case did not have to consider a rent control scheme which contains definitions of space rent and procedures for raising it in light of certain enumerated factors.the ordinance in this case,provides just such procedures.
these cases teach us that the terms of any applicable rent control ordinance must be considered in deciding what charges may appropriately be included in an aggregate rent amount.here,the ordinance seeks to create a charge for property tax that is separate from rent.it does so,however,within the context of defining space rent and permitting other allowable that specifically pertain to the residents use and occupancy of their spaces.the court in robinson allowed a new rent component to be charged through the administrative rent adjustment procedure.robinson,supra,th at,d.here,however,owners imposed the extra charge,unauthorized by the ordinance or the statute.it is not justifiable for the owners to impose a property tax attributable to the entire park parcel upon the residents,even on a proportional space basis,because the obligations of the residents to pay rent are traceable to their individual local occupancy interests,not to any collective ownership interests.
moreover,the ordinance can be interpreted two ways with respect to property tax first,it treats it as excluded from space rent,which indicates that it is more like an additional fee or assessment than like rent.second,the commission is empowered to consider property tax increases when setting space rent during the application process.this also indicates that property tax is not meant to be a component of rent subject to independent agreement by owners and residents in their leases,since it is treated differently in the ordinance.both of these interpretations indicate that owners can not pass on their own property tax liabilities to residents as their tenants,either as rent or as a separate fee or charge permitted by the ordinance.
further,a plain reading of sections and together does not support the position taken by owners.section,subdivision a allows only certain enumerated charges and fees to be passed through to residents,over and above the terms of section.the express exemption in section,subdivision d of property taxes from the coverage of this section can not be interpreted,alternatively,as an enabling section to the local entity to allow an additional for property taxes.owners believe that,because the commission can consider property taxes when it adjusts space rent,the parties should also be able to do so outside of the rent review procedure.however,this is not a reasonable reading of the ordinance or the statutes.
the legislative history of section is in accordance with the above conclusions.this section was introduced to the legislature in as senate bill.the author of the bill,senator tim leslie,sent a letter to the governor dated july,stating that the bill was intended to address an inequity in present rent control law,to relieve mobile home park owners from being liable for costs imposed by local governments on a per space basis for benefits enjoyed by park residents.the author of the bill represented that the bill was not intended to allow park owners to pass through increased local taxes.similarly,the analysis prepared for the senate committee on judiciary states that the bill was intended to continue to hold the park owner responsible for any increase in local taxes or rent control administration fees.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.owners have not presented any persuasive legislative history to the contrary.
in conclusion,the provision in the ordinance,section,subsection h,purporting to allow park owners to pass on governmental assessments such as real property taxes to residents,in addition to charging the space rent as defined in the ordinance,is preempted by the mrl specifically,subd.d.the trial court correctly granted summary judgment to residents on the preemption issue.
willful conduct 
section,subdivision a provides if a homeowner or former homeowner of a park is the prevailing party in a civil action,including a small claims court action,against the management to enforce his or her rights under this chapter,the homeowner,in addition to damages afforded by law,may,in the discretion of the court,be awarded an amount not to exceed two thousand dollars for each willful violation of this chapter by the management.this section has been interpreted in patarak,supra,th,d,by reference to a criminal law pattern jury instruction which states,t he word willfully does not require any intent to violate the law,or to injure another,or to acquire any advantage.id.at,d.the trial court here noted that the appellate court in patarak compared that standard to the principle that willful conduct requires more than negligence or accidental conduct,and held that even though that landlord did not have any specific intent to achieve septic system failures,her failure to maintain that system and also to allow the tenants access to the common areas of the park constituted willful conduct for the purposes of assessing penalties under the mrl.id.at,d.
to dispute the trial court finding of willfulness sufficient to assess statutory penalties under section,owners primarily contend that because they consulted the city on an ongoing basis about their proposed property tax charges,and then litigated the matter by seeking declaratory relief after being sued in small claims court,their conduct in assessing these charges should be deemed lawful,such that no willful violations of statute occurred.in their view,their actions amounted to justifiable reliance upon an existing ordinance,in an unsettled area of the law.see olszewski scripps health cal th,d.at the worst,owners argue that no more than negligence or accidental conduct can be attributed to them,and their conduct is not as bad as that of the landlord in the patarak case,involving ongoing sanitary violations on the premises and unreasonable withholding of use of common areas.patarak,supra,th at,d.
residents defend the ruling of the trial court,arguing that owners turning a blind eye to a state statute prohibiting a property tax after being warned the statute could be inconsistent with a local ordinance,is not a mistake.they also claim that owners mischaracterized the property tax as rent,rent,and other over a period of a few years,and this should be relevant to the issue of owners willfulness.
here,the ruli
