the federal government,through the section program,provides financial assistance to tenants.we granted review to determine whether a landlord who terminates a tenancy agreement with a tenant receiving federal financial assistance through the section program section tenant is required by civil code section to give the tenant days notice if the property is not subject to a local rent control ordinance.we conclude that civil code section applies whether or not the property is subject to a local rent control ordinance,and that landlords must comply with the notice provision of section in order to terminate a tenancy agreement with a section tenant.
facts and procedural history 
defendant syriah degrate,a section tenant,entered into a tenancy agreement for an apartment in san diego.the agreement began on may,and was to terminate on october,but would thereafter be renewed on a basis.degrate previously had entered into a lease for this apartment.
on june,the owner of the apartment entered into a housing assistance payment contract hap contract with the san diego housing commission to receive funds provided to the local authority by the united states department of housing and urban development.cfr a,b.the hap contract provided that it only appli ed to the household and unit occupied by degrate,and that the contract terminates automatically if the lease is terminated by the owner or the tenant.an owner who receives such funds also enters into a rental agreement with the section tenant tenancy agreement,under which the tenant agrees to pay the balance of the rent due.cfr.
on january,plaintiff wasatch property management served degrate with a notice of termination of tenancy that stated,in pertinent part,that t he owner is electing not to renew your lease and you are being served with this notice pursuant to title united states code section d b ii.the notice directed degrate to vacate the unit on march.
degrate did not vacate the premises on march,as ordered by the notice of termination.on march,wasatch filed an unlawful detainer complaint in san diego county superior court.the superior court entered judgment in favor of wasatch,and denied a motion by degrate to vacate the judgment,holding that civil code section applies only in jurisdictions that have enacted rent control ordinances 
the parties appealed the judgment to the appellate division of the superior court,which held that section applies only in jurisdictions,but reversed the trial court judgment because wasatch had not provided degrate with notice of good cause to terminate the lease,as required by the lease and the hap contract.
the appellate division of the superior court certified the case to the court of appeal,pursuant to california rules of court,rule.the court of appeal accepted certification and,in a published decision,held that the notice provision in section applies in all jurisdictions,including those without rent control ordinances and when a landlord terminates a tenancy agreement,thereby causing the termination of the hap contract with the government agency,the notice provision of section applies.the court of appeal also held that the notice degrate received was inadequate because the lessor failed to provide degrate with notice of good cause to terminate her lease.
we granted review to clarify the proper interpretation of section,and declined to review the court of appeal alternate holding that the notice was inadequate for failure to show good cause to terminate the lease.
ii.discussion 
a tenant may defend against an unlawful detainer action by asserting that the lessor has not provided proper notice of termination,as required by statute.kwok bergren d.generally,when a tenancy is terminated without good cause,a lessor must provide the affected tenant with days notice.see,people ex rel.of transportation lucero d.however,in certain instances,section alters the notice requirement by requiring a lessor to provide days notice of a lease termination.
section requires that where an owner terminates or fails to renew a contract or recorded agreement with a governmental agency that provides for rent limitations to a qualified tenant,the tenant or tenants who were the beneficiaries of the contract or recorded agreement shall be given at least days written notice of the effective date of the termination and shall not be obligated to pay more than the tenant portion of the rent,as calculated under the contract or recorded agreement to be terminated,for days following receipt of the notice of termination of nonrenewal of the contract.
applicability of section in jurisdictions without rent control ordinances 
wasatch contends that it was required to give degrate only days notice of the termination of her tenancy,as prescribed by section,rather than the notice required by section,because the latter statute applies only in jurisdictions in which a public entity has enacted a residential rent control ordinance.however,nothing in the language of section suggests that it applies only in jurisdictions that have enacted rent control ordinances.
in ascertaining the meaning of a statute,we look to the intent of the legislature as expressed by the actual words of the statute.people snook cal th,d.we examine the language first,as it is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.it is that statutory language which has been lobbied for,lobbied against,studied,proposed,drafted,restudied,redrafted,voted on in committee,amended,reamended,analyzed,reanalyzed,voted on by two houses of the legislature,sent to a conference committee,and,after perhaps more lobbying,debate and analysis,finally signed into law by the governor.the same care and scrutiny does not befall the committee reports,caucus analyses,authors statements,legislative counsel digests and other documents which make up a statute legislative history.ibid.
examining the language of section,it is apparent that the statute does not apply only in jurisdictions with rent control ordinances,but rather applies anywhere in the state w here an owner terminates or fails to renew a contract or recorded agreement with a governmental agency that provides financial assistance,such as through the section program.
it appears that the legislature deliberately decided not to limit the reach of section to jurisdictions.not only is there no language within section that explicitly limits the reach of the statute to jurisdictions,but the same bill that added section to the civil code also amended section to include such an express restriction.section,subdivision a a,as amended,plainly limits its scope to a jurisdiction that controls by ordinance or charter provision the rental rate for a dwelling or unit.had the legislature intended to also limit the scope of section in the same manner,it would have included similar language doing so.w hen the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and has excluded it in another,it should not be implied where excluded.brown kelly broadcasting cal d,quoting ford motor county of tulare d.singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed.accordingly,we decline to interpret section to include a term limiting its application to jurisdictions.
indeed,the legislative history of section suggests that the notice provision was meant to address issues of statewide concern.the senate judiciary committee comment on the proposed notice provision explained the purpose of the increased notice period as follows proponents assert that the current requirement of days notice is insufficient time for a section tenant to find replacement income and housing when the property owner decides to no longer accept section housing vouchers,thereby forcing the tenant to move.they assert that this proposal,requiring days notice of the effective date of the landlord termination or nonrenewal of a section agreement and freezing the tenant rent for that period,does not impose an undue burden on the property owner.the only burden is to advise the affected tenants of the owner decision days earlier,thereby giving the affected tenants more time to prepare.this is fair
