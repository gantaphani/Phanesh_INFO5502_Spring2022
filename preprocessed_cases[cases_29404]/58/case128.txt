this consolidated appeal concerns the prepayment of a section loan by owners of housing in oregon contrary to the prepayment procedures required by the emergency low income housing protection act of,elihpa.appellants are residents who presently live in this housing property.
first,they appeal the district court denial of their motion to intervene in a quiet title lawsuit,iv limited partnership,et united states,between the property owners and the rural housing service rhs,an administrative division of the united states department of agriculture.second,appellants appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the owners and rhs in appellants administrative procedure act apa claim,which alleged that rhs accepted prepayment on a section loan in violation of elihpa.
we affirm the district court denial of appellants motion to intervene in the quiet title lawsuit because their interests are sufficiently protected by their apa lawsuit.however,because the district court misconstrued our holding in kimberly associates united states,cir,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.kimberly merely held that certain defenses were not available to the government in a quiet title action brought by section borrowers to enforce their contractual right to prepay their loans.however,ours is an apa case brought by residents challenging the agency with the emergency low income housing protection act.kimberly did not hold that elihpa was invalid or that the department of agriculture was free to violate it.the district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment to the agency on the tenants claim that the agency acted contrary to law.
background 
the facts are not disputed.
section of the national housing act of was enacted by congress to encourage private investment in housing for elderly and individuals in rural areas.see et.section authorized the farmers home administration,which was later subsumed into rhs,to make direct loans to finance affordable housing.in exchange for favorable interest rates and operating subsidies,the housing owners agreed to rent to qualified tenants at affordable rates for as long as the loans were outstanding.
iv,forest hills,jadin,norseman,and vii hereinafter collectively dbsi entered into loan agreements with rhs in the mid to late to finance six properties forest village,seacrest,hillside terrace,vittoria square,norseman village,and meadowbrook i.the loan agreements gave dbsi the right to prepay the loans and exit the section program at any time,even before the or terms of the loans expired,stating prepayments of scheduled installments,or any portion thereof,may be made at any time at the option of borrower.the loan agreements also provided this note shall be subject to the present regulations of the farmers home administration and to its future regulations not inconsistent with the express provisions hereof.
are six tenants currently residing in these properties.sherry goldammer,donald gerhard,ron veillon,and carmen thomas are elderly residents of seacrest diana rhodes is a resident of meadowbrook.
in,congress enacted elihpa,stat.in passing this legislation,congress was motivated by concerns that rhs loans were vulnerable to prepayment,which removed housing from section ahead of schedule,thus undermining the purpose of the program.
thus,congress imposed elaborate requirements for prepayments in order to discourage project owners from prepaying their loans,despite the terms of the loan contracts.kimberly,at.elihpa provides,in pertinent part 
the secretary may not accept an offer to prepay any loan made or insured under section unless the secretary takes appropriate action which will obligate the borrower and successors in interest thereof to utilize the assisted housing and related facilities for the purposes specified in section,as the case may be,for a period of fifteen or twenty years,depending on the type of loan,or until the secretary determines prior to the end of such period that there is no longer a need for such housing and related facilities to be so utilized or that federal or other financial assistance provided to the residents of such housing will no longer be provided.
specifically,elihpa requires an owner to give notice of its intent to prepay,c,at which point the secretary of agriculture must offer the owner a series of financial incentives to remain in the program,id.c.if the owner insists on prepaying,the owner is obligated to offer the project for sale to any qualified nonprofit organization or public agency at a fair market value determined by independent appraisers.id.c a i.if no such sale is made within days,then and only then may rhs accept prepayment.id.c a ii the prepayment process is subject to agency regulations now found at part et.
in,dbsi submitted final payments on their loans on four section properties,including seacrest.no prepayment was offered for meadowbrook rhs,relying upon elihpa and the accompanying regulations,refused to accept the prepayment tenders and refused to reconvey the deeds of trust or issue satisfactions of the mortgages that encumbered the properties.
on october,dbsi filed a quiet title lawsuit against the united states in the district of oregon.in its complaint,dbsi claimed that they were entitled to quiet title judgments because rhs wrongfully rejected the prepayment tenders.
on february,dbsi and rhs entered into an agreement in principle to settle the quiet title lawsuit.dbsi and rhs agreed to negotiate values for the four properties involved in the quiet title lawsuit,as well as for meadowbrook i,and to offer the properties initially to entities that would keep the properties in section.if no such sale occurred,however,the agreement provided that rhs would accept dbsi prepayment and release the properties from section without regard to any prepayment restrictions,including but not limited to the restrictions contained in c and et.
although dbsi and rhs agreed to values for the four properties,the government did not agree to finance the sale of these properties to nonprofit entities.therefore,pursuant to the agreement,dbsi paid the balance of the loan for seacrest on october,and the government accepted this prepayment on december.on december,rhs reconveyed the deed of trust for the seacrest property and released seacrest from the section program.on december,dbsi and rhs stipulated to a quiet title judgment pursuant to.b also on december,suit against the secretary of the department of agriculture and various other federal defendants under the administrative procedure act,alleging that the agency acted contrary to law in allowing dbsi to exit the section program without complying with elihpa.
it is undisputed that rhs accepted prepayment of the seacrest loan without requiring dbsi to comply with the requirements of elihpa.
after prepaying the seacrest loan,dbsi conveyed seacrest to northwest real estate capital corporation northwest,which had previously purchased seacrest from dbsi.northwest eventually procured united states hud section housing vouchers for the seacrest tenants from a local housing authority,allowing the tenants to continue paying rents.
dbsi has not initiated prepayment of the section loan on meadowbrook 
ii.motion to intervene 
approximately one month after dbsi and rhs stipulated to the quiet title judgment in the iv lawsuit,appellants filed their motion to intervene as of right in that action,pursuant to.a,seeking the opportunity to set aside the quiet title judgment on the ground that it was issued in violation of elihpa.the district court denied the motion on the grounds that appellants apa claim sufficiently protected their interests.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
a district court denial of a motion to intervene is reviewed de novo.see united states alisal water,cir.
as a preliminary matter,dbsi contends that the june,dismissal with prejudice of the quiet title lawsuit moots appellants appeal of the denial of their motion to intervene.the law is otherwise.although the district court entered final judgment in the underlying case during the pendency of the appeal,the intervention co
