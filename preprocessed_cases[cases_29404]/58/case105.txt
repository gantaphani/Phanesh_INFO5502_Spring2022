charmaine hunter brings four separate appeals relating to attempts by the city of des moines municipal housing authority hereinafter the des moines housing authority or the housing authority to terminate her public housing lease.we consolidated these appeals for purposes of hearing oral argument but we consider and rule on each appeal separately.
on october,hunter entered into a public housing dwelling lease with the des moines housing authority,a state agency.the lease is a lease,which provides for automatic renewal upon advance payment of the rent.the lease requires hunter,among other things,to provide accurate information as to her income and family composition at least once each year.as the renter,hunter agrees not to provide lodging to boarders but to use the premises solely for her household as identified in the lease.the lease also provides that the des moines housing authority shall not terminate the lease other than for serious or repeated violations of its material terms and that the housing authority shall give a notice prior to termination of the lease.the renter may request a hearing in accordance with the des moines housing authority grievance procedure to challenge the lease termination.
on april,the des moines housing authority served hunter with notice that her lease would terminate in days on the grounds that hunter had violated the lease provisions and public housing regulations by not reporting gambling income,by not reporting an unauthorized boarder,and by allowing illegal drug activity on the premises.hunter invoked the grievance procedure and appealed the lease termination to a hearing examiner.the hearing examiner upheld the lease termination decision,concluding that the allegations of illegal drug activity were too remote to be a factor here but that hunter had violated her lease by not reporting gambling income and by permitting an unauthorized boarder to live on the premises.hunter then filed suit in federal district court seeking judicial review of the housing authority termination decision.neither the parties nor the district court questioned subject matter jurisdiction at that time.the district court affirmed the hearing officer decision on july,concluding that substantial evidence existed in the record to support the hearing officer conclusion that hunter had violated her lease.hunter did not appeal this decision.
because hunter did not vacate the property on may,as required by the initial notice of termination,the des moines housing authority served her with a notice to quit on june.when she had not vacated the property after days,the des moines housing authority commenced a state law forcible entry or detention of real property action pursuant to iowa code chapter in polk county small claims court.on august,the small claims court entered judgment for the des moines housing authority on grounds of issue preclusion,noting that the federal court had already determined that the termination of the lease was proper.the small claims court ordered hunter to vacate the premises by august.
hunter appealed the small claims court decision to the state district court,which reversed on the basis of state law.the state district court held,among other things,that the des moines housing authority had not complied with iowa requirement of providing a notice to cure before terminating a dwelling lease.iowa code the supreme court of iowa denied discretionary review.
in january prior to the legislature amendment of the statute to eliminate the notice to cure for federal public housing leases,the des moines housing authority again served hunter with a notice of lease termination,citing her longstanding violations of the public housing rental agreement.the notice did not provide a opportunity to cure the claimed violations.hunter did not vacate the property.
on april,hunter returned to federal district court and filed a rule b motion for relief from the judicial review decision dated june,asserting that it was no longer equitable to give that judgment prospective application because the state court had since ruled that the notice of termination was inadequate due to its failure to provide written notice of a window to cure the alleged violations of the lease,as provided in iowa law.the federal district court denied the motion concluding that there was no showing that the adequacy of the written notice had been an issue before it when it made the original judicial review determination.hunter then filed a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment,citing the same reason,and the district court denied this motion as well.hunter appeals.
on april,hunter filed a complaint in federal district court against the housing authority and several of its individual agents,alleging that they violated her federal right of due process by attempting to terminate her federally subsidized lease without proper notice to cure as required by iowa law.the district court dismissed the action for failure to state the violation of a federal or constitutional right.the district court denied hunter motion to alter or amend the judgment,and hunter appeals the dismissal of her claim.
while all of that was working its way through the federal district court,hunter requested another administrative hearing,this time challenging the housing authority second attempt to terminate her lease,dated january.the hearing officer ruled on november,that the written notice was sufficient and that no notice to cure is required where the alleged breach can not be remedied.the des moines housing authority then returned to state court and filed another forcible entry and detainer of real property action in an effort to remove hunter from the premises.the state district court once again dismissed the action due to the housing authority failure to give the notice to cure under state law.
on december,hunter returned to federal court,this time seeking judicial review of the des moines housing authority second attempt to terminate her lease dated january.hunter alleged that the housing authority had not properly terminated her lease because the termination notice lacked the notice to cure required by iowa law.the district court dismissed this suit,concluding that the des moines housing authority is a state agency whose decisions are not subject to review under the federal administrative procedure act and that,in any event,the doctrine of res judicata bars the action.hunter appeals.
finally,on may,while hunter appeal of her first rule b motion challenging the july,judicial review decision was still pending before this court,hunter filed in federal district court a second rule b motion,asserting a new reason why the july,judgment should be set aside.hunter for the first time argued that the court had no jurisdiction to make the judicial review decision of july,because the housing authority is not a federal agency within the meaning of the administrative procedure act.therefore,hunter asked the district court to declare the judgment void.the district court denied this second rule b motion noting that the case was already before this court on appeal of hunter first rule b motion.hunter now also appeals the denial of her second rule b motion.
in her first appeal,hunter challenges the district court denial of her rule b motion,asserting that,in light of the subsequent state court ruling that the notice provision was inadequate,it is not equitable to give prospective application to the district court july,judgment.we review the denial of rule b relief for an abuse of discretion,and an abuse will be found only where the district court judgment was based on clearly erroneous factual findings or erroneous legal conclusions.parton white,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of hunter rule b motion.the subsequent state court ruling in this case held that the notice provision of the lease termination was inadequate under state law.the district court properly concluded that the state court judgment did not impact the validity of its determination that the housing authority correctly concluded it had grounds on which to terminate hunter lease,where the adequacy of the notice under state law was not at issue.we thus affirm the district court denial of hunter rule b motion in appeal.
while appeal was pending before this court,hunter filed a second rule b motion in district court,attacking the same july,judicial review decision.she argued that the judgment was void for lack of jurisdiction under rule b.she also sought relief under rule b for the same reasons articulated in her first motion and under rule b,which allows the court to vacate a judgment for any other proper reason.the district court denied the motion noting that the case was already on appeal to this court and nothing remained to be decided.hunter now appeals the denial of her second rule b motion in appeal.
we first consider our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.every federal court has the inherent power to determine as a preliminary matter its own subject matter jurisdiction.gaines nelson in re gaines,cir.as a general rule,a federal district court and a federal court of appeals should not attempt to assert jurisdiction over a case simultaneously.the filing of a notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court o f its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.liddell bd.of,cir quoting griggs provident consumer disc,d.our case law,however,permits the district court to consider a rule b motion on the merits and deny it even if an appeal is already pending in this court,and a separate appeal may thereafter be taken to challenge the denial.see winter cerro gordo county conserv,cir pioneer ins.gelt,cir noting also that if,on the other hand,the district court decides to grant the motion,the parties should request the court of appeals to remand the case so a proper order can be entered.since the district court denied the motion,appeal is properly before us.
relief under rule b is an extraordinary remedy that lies within the discretion of the trial court,design classics,westphal in re design classics,cir,but relief from a void judgment pursuant to rule b is not discretionary,kocher dow chem,cir.we note that neither a rule b nor a rule b motion may be used as a substitute for a timely appeal of a judgment.id.at.hunter did not appeal the july,judicial review decision from which she sought rule b relief.instead she employs this motion as a substitute for an appeal she never filed.we bear in mind,however,that the appeal of the denial of a rule b motion does not raise the underlying judgment for our consideration and review but only presents the merits of the rule b motion for our consideration.sanders clemco,cir.
where a party has failed to appeal an adverse judgment,her rule b motion will not succeed merely because the same argument would have been successful on direct appeal.kocher,at.a rule b motion to void the judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction will succeed only if the absence of jurisdiction was so glaring as to constitute a total want of jurisdiction or a plain usurpation of power so as to render the judgment void from its inception.id.at quoting kansas city so.ry.great lakes carbon,cir.en banc,cert.denied,d.stated another way,such plain usurpation of power occurs when there is a total want of jurisdiction as distinguished from an error in the exercise of jurisdiction.kansas city,at.
we conclude that the judgment in this case is not void within the meaning of rule b.the complaint alleged jurisdiction under the administrative procedure act apa,asserted violations of the federal public housing statutes and their implementing regulations,and sought declaratory relief for the agency alleged violation of federal law and regulations in terminating her public housing lease.the district court generally is vested with power to deal with cases involving the implementation of federal statutes through federal regulations,and to review agency action under the apa.hunter argues that the court lacked jurisdiction because the housing authority is not a federal agency subject to review under the apa.nevertheless,the allegations in her complaint provided the existence of an arguable basis for jurisdiction over hunter claims.an error in interpreting jurisdiction or in assessing jurisdictional facts does not render the judgment a complete nullity or a plain usurpation of power for purposes of rule b,especially in this case where the party now complaining about a lack of subject matter jurisdiction brought the suit herself,never questioned the court jurisdiction while the case was pending before the district court,lost on the merits,failed to appeal the judgment,and then belatedly challenged the district court jurisdiction some two years after the entry of judgment.we conclude that the underlying judicial review judgment is not void under rule b.
hunter again asserts under rule b that it is not equitable to give prospective relief to the judgment in light of the subsequent state court order.we see no basis on which to revisit the same argument that we rejected with regard to hunter first motion.likewise,her request to vacate the judgment for any other proper reason under rule b essentially repeats the arguments she made for relief from a void judgment under rule b.we reject her rule b arguments for the same reasons we rejected her rule b can not use rule b as a substitute for a timely appeal,and the underlying judgment,while perhaps lacking in subject matter jurisdiction,can not be considered a total usurpation of power because there existed an arguable basis for jurisdiction.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of relief under either rule b or rule b.
accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of hunter second rule b motion in appeal.
hunter third appeal involves another attempt to seek judicial review of state agency action in federal court.hunter filed this complaint under the apa,seeking judicial review of the des moines housing authority january decision to terminate her lease.the district court dismissed the complaint upon concluding that the des moines housing authority is not an agency whose action is subject to review under the apa.
e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to consider its own jurisdiction.schatz family gierer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter of litigation can not be waived by the parties or ignored by the court.rock island millwork lumber,cir.the appellate court must satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction but also that of the district court.id.the case will be dismissed if subject matter jurisdiction is lacking,and the appellate court review is limited to determining whether the district court application of the law is correct and,if the decision is based on undisputed facts,whether those facts are indeed undisputed.trimble asarco,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the district court made findings of disputed jurisdictional facts,we review those findings under the clearly erroneous standard.id.
the apa defines agency as each authority of the government of the united states,subject to certain exceptions that are not applicable here.b.the apa does not grant federal courts jurisdiction to review actions of state or municipal agencies.the des moines housing authority is a state agency created pursuant to the authority granted in iowa code chapter.the agency provides federally subsidized public housing to low income families,but it is not a federal agency whose actions are governed by the apa.there is no allegation in the complaint that the des moines housing authority is an agency of the united states government.instead,the complaint plainly indicates that it is an authority of the city of des moines.
hunter argues that there is a disputed fact question concerning whether the housing authority is a federal agency in light of and its implementing regulations,which the housing authority must follow with regard to public housing leases.we respectfully disagree.we find nothing in these provisions that either grants federal agency status to the state agency or grants federal courts the jurisdiction to review the actions of loc
