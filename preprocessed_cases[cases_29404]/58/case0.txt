the appellant contends the fair housing act requirement that landlords must make reasonable accommodations for their disabled tenants entitles her to stay in her apartment of many years,even though she had been told she was no longer eligible for the federal subsidy on which she had been relying to make the rent.she also contends her landlord impermissibly discriminated against her because of her disability in other ways,and also that it retaliated against her for pursuing her fair housing act rights.the district court granted summary judgment for that landlord,a private housing cooperative in san juan,puerto rico,and a number of the cooperative board members,whom the appellant had also named as defendants.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand in part.
since,priscilla batista has leased the same apartment at the cooperativa de vivienda jardines de san ignacio,a san juan,puerto rico housing cooperative.her two children used to live in the apartment with her,but they moved out in and,respectively.
for most of the time batista has lived at the cooperativa,she received benefits under the federal housing assistance program known as section,and these benefits enabled her to cover the rent for her apartment.under that program,government subsidies are available for families so they may obtain a decent place to live.a.those subsidies assist section recipients with the rent they owe to private landlords.see id.o.although the section program is a federal one,it is administered by public housing agencies at the state and local level.see id.b.in puerto rico,the entity responsible for administering the section program is the puerto rico housing finance authority.
one of the obligations of the housing finance authority is to conduct a management review of buildings that house recipients of section assistance.during such a review of the cooperativa in october of,the puerto rico housing finance authority observed that four units,including batista unit,were for section purposes.by,the agency meant the tenants in those four units were living in units larger than those they qualified for under section.the cooperativa accordingly sent batista who was by then living alone in the unit a letter later that month informing her that,under section,she was required either to transfer to an appropriately sized unit in which case she could continue to receive section assistance or to remain in her unit but pay the fair market rent without such assistance.
the cooperativa sent batista additional letters in november of and february of informing her that a apartment was available and advising her that,if she chose to stay in unit,she would have to pay rent without the section assistance as of april.batista did not respond to any of the letters.
three weeks before the april deadline,however,batista submitted a request to the cooperativa for reasonable accommodation under the fair housing act on account of her disability batista accommodation request stated that,in addition to a bedroom,her disability requires that she have one room for physical therapy and another room for reading and,consequently,that moving to a smaller unit would compromise her health.the request further stated that in light of her hypersensitivity to sounds,batista could not move to the proposed unit,which she claimed was noisier than her current unit.
upon receiving this request,the cooperativa asked the housing finance authority and the department of housing and urban development hud for guidance on how to resolve the matter.the cooperativa also tabled any increase in batista rent for unit until it heard back.
the housing finance authority responded to the cooperativa inquiry on may.the housing finance authority letter to the cooperativa stated that the cooperativa should offer a smaller unit to the member and require paying the market rent if batista refuses to transfer to another unit.the letter also stated that when a tenant,such as batista,requests a reasonable accommodation for medical conditions,the cooperativa must determine the eligibility of the applicant on a case by case basis.
after receiving the housing finance authority letter and a separate response from hud,the cooperativa performed a test for the apartment it had offered batista.according to the cooperativa,the results of its independent noise pollution test showed that the unit it had offered would not have been unsuitably loud.the cooperativa did not,however,analyze batista medical condition itself.instead,the cooperativa relied on findings hud had compiled after it had received the cooperativa letter seeking assistance in responding to batista request for reasonable accommodation.
the cooperativa then denied batista accommodation request.batista nonetheless remained in her unit.she stopped receiving section benefits at some point thereafter and,while still residing there,she filed an administrative complaint with hud on april.the complaint alleged the cooperativa had violated the fair housing act by failing to provide the accommodation she sought.the complaint also alleged the cooperativa had retaliated against her because she had recently prevailed in a separate hud proceeding against the cooperativa.that earlier proceeding arose out of the cooperativa failure to provide batista with a key to the garbage depository on her floor.
in that earlier proceeding,the hud administrative law judge found that the coopertiva failure in that regard had caused batista undue hardship in light of her disability and,on that basis,issued a consent order sanctioning the cooperativa.this consent order required the cooperativa to give batista a key to the depository,pay her,issue a written apology,and r emove any and all blemishes,sanctions,etc,arising out of this case,from her record,including any outstanding fees and the revocation of her voting privileges.
in evaluating the reasonable accommodation and retaliation claims in batista april complaint,hud found in favor of the cooperativa as to each.hud concluded that batista had not submitted medical documentation stating that a unit,as opposed to a unit like the one the cooperativa had offered,was necessary to accommodate her disability.hud further found that the cooperativa had not retaliated against batista in violation of the fair housing act.hud did not address whether the fact that batista had been denied section assistance for the apartment in which she continued to reside was relevant to the reasonable accommodation claim.
batista then filed suit in federal court.she named the cooperativa and a number of its past and present board members as defendants.in addition to reasonable accommodation and retaliation claims under the fair housing act,batista also alleged a separate disparate treatment claim under that act as well.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on may,finding in their favor on the merits of the reasonable accommodation and disparate treatment claims and concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the retaliation claim.batista timely appealed that decision.

we begin with batista reasonable accommodation claim.the fair housing act prohibits discriminatory housing practices based on a person handicap.see f prohibiting discrimination in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling,because of a handicap of an individual.one type of discriminatory housing practice is the refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.id.f b.
the cooperativa conceded that batista qualifies as handicapped under the act and that it either knew or should have known that fact.see astralis condo.ass sec y,dep t of hous.urban,cir.but the district court determined there was not a triable issue of fact as to whether the cooperativa had failed to provide a reasonable and necessary accommodation,see,and we agree 
according to batista,she was simply requesting to use her hud subsidy under section to fund the rent for the apartment that she believed she was entitled to stay in due to the accommodation that she contends the fair housing act required the cooperativa to make.but while the fair housing act obliges private landlords to adjust their policies to make reasonable accommodations for their tenants who otherwise receive section subsidies,see f b,the puerto rico housing finance authority,not the cooperativa,is the entity responsible for administering section benefits.in doing so,the housing finance authority,not the cooperativa,established the policy that led to the former revocation of batista section benefits.and so far as we are aware,batista has never challenged the housing finance authority determination that,under its policy,she does not qualify for the subsidy so long as she stays in the unit.
perhaps she could.see pub.hous.mgmt.occupancy,dep t of hous.urban,public housing occupancy guidebook,available at exceptions to the largest permissible unit size for section purposes may be made in case of reasonable accommodations for a person with disabilities.a iii public housing agency must give section participant family opportunity for informal hearing to consider whether determination of family unit size under applicable subsidy standards complies with applicable laws and regulations colvin hous.auth.of city of sarasota,cir recognizing right to challenge termination of section assistance under certain circumstances.but batista has sued the cooperativa instead.and the cooperativa is not responsible for the section subsidy determination.nor has the cooperativa said it would decline to make the current apartment available to batista if she were deemed eligible for a section subsidy to pay the market rent.
as a result,batista must but has not explained why a private landlord,like the cooperativa,acts unlawfully in refusing to provide the subsidy itself.see howard city of beavercreek,cir an accommodation is reasonable when it imposes no fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or undue financial and administrative burdens.quoting smith lee assocs.city of taylor,cir.indeed,not even batista argues her requested accommodation would be a reasonable one under the act if the subsidy she previously received were not reinstated.
seeing no way this suit against the private landlord could result in an order to the administering agency for the section program to reverse course and reinstate the rental subsidy,we do not see how the requested accommodation could be a reasonable one.its denial by the cooperativa rested solely on batista inability to pay,which she appears to concede arises only from her need for federal rental support.see salute stratford greens garden apartments,cir impecunious people with disabilities stand on the same footing as everyone else id.at calabresi,dissenting addressing a claim brought by section eligible recipients who alleged they were in need of the assistance because their disability had made them poor.and thus,she does not contend the denial of the accommodation resulted from any policy of the cooperativa that would prevent her from acquiring the funds necessary to make the rent,which she does not contend must be lowered.we accordingly affirm the district court decision to grant the defendants summary judgment on this claim.
in addition to her claim,batista also alleged in her complaint that the cooperativa had engaged in a definite pattern of discriminatory actions against her in violation of the fair housing act.the cooperativa had done so,batista contends,by instituting multiple claims against her,disallowing her from voting in assemblies,attempting to prevent visitors from entering the premises to see her,threatening to evict her from her unit,and more.
the district court treated these allegations as presenting a disparate treatment claim under the fair housing act,see generally astralis condo.ass n,at fair housing act contemplates three types of claims for perceived discrimination disparate treatment,disparate impact,and failure to make reasonable accommodations quoting smith lee,at,and so do we.summary judgment for the defendant is warranted on a disparate treatment claim if the plaintiff can not produce either a direct evidence of discriminatory intent or b indirect evidence creating an inference of discriminatory intent.gallagher magner,cir.
we may assume the cooperativa did what batista alleges attempting to collect money from her she did not owe,stopping her from voting in the assemblies,threatening to evict her,and so on.but even still,batista has put forward no evidence,nor pointed us to any,to suggest that an impermissible,discriminatory purpose motivated the cooperativa actions.
in fact,batista argued below and did so again in her brief on appeal that the cooperativa true intent was to eliminate section beneficiaries from the housing cooperative,and thus one unrelated to her disabled status.and while batista has tried on appeal to recast her argument by claiming that i t is hard to visualize how her position,as a handicapped person protected under several applicable federal laws supporting reasonable accommodation,was particularly troublesome for the appellees in light of their intent to eliminate section beneficiaries from cooperativa,this argument still frames the cooperativa actions as having been motivated by an intent to eliminate section beneficiaries from the cooperativa rather than by her status as a disabled person protected by the fair housing act.thus,we affirm the district court decision to grant the cooperativa summary judgment on this claim as well.
finally,batista alleges that after the administrative law judge found in her favor in the proceeding about the garbage depository issue,the cooperativa swift ly retaliated against her.the cooperativa did so,she claims,by initiating collection proceedings against her for amounts she allegedly owed since and denying her request for reasonable accommodations and ignoring her need to remain in her present three bedroom apartment due to her multiple health conditions.
batista complaint does not directly refer to the consent order the administrative law judge issued at the close of the garbage depository case,but the district court interpreted batista retaliation claim as if it were an effort to enforce that order.consistent with that understanding,the district court then dismissed the claim without prejudice for,under m,only the first circuit has jurisdiction to enforce such an order.see m a ny person entitled to relief under the order may petition for a decree enforcing the order in the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the discriminatory housing practice is alleged to have occurred.
but the paragraph of batista complaint that sets forth the retaliation claim does not cite to the provision for enforcing consent orders,m.instead,the paragraph refers to section c of the fair housing act,c,which deals with private enforcement of the act guarantees.and one of those guarantees,of course,is freedom from coerc ion,intimidat ion,threat,or interfer ence on account of a person having exercised or enjoyed the right to seek redress for housing discrimination.
thus,although the complaint is less than clear as to its target,batista retaliation claim is best understood as an attempt to enforce not the consent order itself,but the right against retaliation the fair housing act right the district court surely does have jurisdiction to enforce.see id.a a an aggrieved person may
