timothy hoblitzell plaintiff appeals from a summary judgment in favor of the city of ione city on plaintiff claim that the city was vicariously liable for the allegedly tortious conduct of two of its employees.
this appeal requires us to decide whether public employees who commit tortious acts while acting outside their employer jurisdiction,outside of their official duties,and for personal reasons may nonetheless be deemed to be acting within the scope of their employment.we conclude that they are not and shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff action 
in his complaint,the plaintiff,who was a contractor at a construction site,claimed that on november,at the request of a disgruntled former employee defendant jim brown,defendants jeff barnhart and don law enforcement officer and a building inspector,respectively,employed by the to the job site in an unmarked vehicle,identified themselves as building inspectors,and told the property owner that plaintiff had been performing the construction without permits and that the site should be shut down they also made disparaging remarks about the quality of plaintiff work and had a heated verbal argument with plaintiff that led to defendant brown poking plaintiff in the chest.as a result of defendants conduct,plaintiff work on the site was delayed for three days while he arranged for county building inspectors to come to the site to assure the property owner that permits were not required.
plaintiff alleged intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligence against all of the individual defendants brown,barnhart,and myshrall.he also alleged assault and battery against defendants brown and barnhart.finally,he alleged,on the basis of respondeat superior,that the defendant city was liable for its employees negligence,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,assault,and battery.
ii.the city motion for summary judgment 
the city moved for summary judgment on the ground that the actions of barnhart and myshrall were outside the scope of their employment with the city the city evidence showed that the construction site was located in an unincorporated area of amador county,outside the city jurisdiction,and that plaintiff knew this that neither barnhart nor myshrall told plaintiff that they were present on official business that barnhart and myshrall drove to the project at the request of brown plaintiff disgruntled former employee while they were off duty that barnhart was dressed in plain clothes,did not carry a gun,baton,or other weapon,and never identified himself as a police officer and that neither barnhart nor myshrall informed plaintiff that he would be arrested or cited for a violation of any of the city ordinances.
iii.plaintiff opposition to the motion 
plaintiff admitted the following facts,either in his opposition or in his deposition that he was aware that the construction site was located in an unincorporated area of amador county and that the city had no jurisdiction over the project that he was aware,owing to his work in the construction business,that construction permits for a project had to be obtained from a county or municipality depending upon where the project was located that neither barnhart nor myshrall said that they were there on official business that barnhart was not wearing a police uniform or badge and did not mention that he was a law enforcement officer that plaintiff thought myshrall and barnhart were imposters and that plaintiff was never cited or given a notice of a violation.
but plaintiff presented the following evidence in support of his claim that barnhart and myshrall were acting within the scope of their employment that the two men identified themselves as building inspectors,telling the property owner that the job was not permitted and should be shut down that both traveled in a white,unmarked car with red and blue lights in the windshield and california exempt license plates that they were wearing civilian clothes,although barnhart appeared to have a holster underneath his jacket that myshrall told plaintiff that he was a building inspector from ione,inspected a retaining wall,and gave his opinion that a permit would be required that barnhart had contracted to build a set of stairs at the project and had asked myshrall to give his opinion on the quality of the landing on which the stairs were to be built and that myshrall did not have any written documentation that showed that he had taken time off from work at the time of the incident.
iv.the court order granting the city motion 
the court granted summary judgment in favor of the city by an order that states in pertinent part t he act of a building inspector going to a job site that is outside of the c ity jurisdictional limits and threatening to shut the job down is not the type of risk that ione should bear as a cost of doing business.thorn city of glendale th,d.likewise,a city is not vicariously responsible for the intentional conduct of an police officer such as b arnhart.melendez city of los angeles th,d.
judgment was thereafter entered in the city favor,and plaintiff appeals 
discussion 
the summary judgment motion was properly grantedi.standard of review 
g enerally,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.fn.omitted.ibid.
on appeal,we review the record de novo to determine whether the moving party met its burden of proof.citations.lewis county of sacramento th,d.we consider all of the evidence set forth in the supporting and opposition papers,except that to which objections have been made and sustained by the court,and all uncontradicted inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence.citation.artiglio corning cal th,d,bracketed text in artiglio.
ii.the respondeat superior doctrine 
plaintiff contends that there was a triable issue of material fact as to whether myshrall and barnhart were acting in the course and scope of their employment for the city so as to make the city liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.
the doctrine of respondeat superior applies to public and private employers alike.mary city of los angeles cal d,mary.
government code section,subdivision a,provides a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.
by this language,the legislature incorporated general standards of tort liability as the primary basis for respondeat superior liability of public entities citation.courts have construed the term scope of employment in section as broadly as in private tort litigation.citations.mary,supra,cal d at.
respondeat superior is based on a deeply rooted sentiment that it would be unjust for an enterprise to disclaim responsibility for injuries occurring in the course of its characteristic activities.citations.mary,supra,cal d at.in perez van groningen sons,cal d,perez,the california supreme court explained the scope of employment principles under the respondeat superior doctrine as follows a n employer is liable for risks arising out of the employment.citations.a risk arises out of the employment when in the context of the particular enterprise an employee conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer business.citations.in other words,where the question is one of vicarious liability,the inquiry should be whether the risk was one that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise undertaken by the employer.citation.citation.accordingly,the employer liability extends beyond his actual or possible control of the employee to include risks inherent in or created by the enterprise.citation.these principles were reiterated in mary,supra,cal d at page.farmers ins.group county of santa clara cal th,d.
notwithstanding the generally broad view given to scope of employment determinations,the law is clear that an employer is not strictly liable for all actions of its employees during working hours.significantly,an employer will not be held vicariously liable for an employee malicious or tortious conduct if the employee substantially deviates from the employment duties for personal purposes.citations.thus,if the employee inflicts an injury out of personal malice,not engendered by the employment citation or acts out of personal malice unconnected with the employment citation,or if the misconduct is not an outgrowth of the employment citation,the employee is not acting within the scope of employment.stated another way,i f an employee tort is personal in nature,mere presence at the place of employment and attendance to occupational duties prior or subsequent to the offense will not give rise to a cause of action against the employer under the doctrine of respondeat superior.citation.in such cases,the losses do not foreseeably result from the conduct of the employer enterprise and so are not fairly attributable to the employer as a cost of doing business.farmers ins.group county of santa clara,supra,cal th at,d.
for instance,the cases hold that,except where sexual misconduct by police officers against members of the public is involved,mary,supra,cal d,white county of orange d,the employer is not vicariously liable to a third party for sexual misconduct.citations.farmers ins.group county of santa clara,supra,cal th at,d.in those decisions,vicarious liability was rejected as a matter of law because it could not be demonstrated that the various acts of sexual misconduct arose from the conduct of the respective enterprises since the acts had been undertaken solely for the employees personal gratification and had no purpose connected to the employment and had not been engendered by events or conditions relating to any employment duties or tasks id.at,d.
likewise,a nonsexual assault which was not committed to further the employer interests and arose from a personal dispute,such as an assault by an bartender in the course of a dispute with his common law wife monty orlandi d,or an arson which was committed by a fire marshal out of personal compulsion during a fire inspection thorn city of glendale,supra,th at,d,do not constitute a basis for vicarious liability against the employer.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital cal th,d.
iii.application 
in this case,plaintiff contends that there is a triable issue of material fact whether myshrall and barnhart were acting within the course and scope of their employment with the city based on the following facts both men stated that they were from ione myshrall,acting as a building inspector,gave an opinion on plaintiff workmanship defendants had driven to the project site during normal working hours and the city had not proffered any evidence defining or limiting defendants authority to act on behalf of the city.
in his reply,however,plaintiff concedes that it does not appear that officer barnhart was acting in the course and scope of his employment.nonetheless,he insists that the city is responsible for the conduct of inspector myshrall because inspector myshrall had been employed to inspect buildings for the city of ione and was apparently given a vehicle for that purpose and,on the day in question,was acting as a building inspector using a city vehicle during the normal business hours of his employment.
but as mentioned,the law is clear that an employer is not strictly liable for all actions of its employees during working hours.significantly,an employer will not be held vicariously liable for an employee malicious or tortious conduct if the employee substantially deviates from the employment duties for personal purposes.farmers ins.group county of santa clara,supra,cal th at,d.
here,it is undisputed that myshrall and barnhart were acting outside the city jurisdiction,that they were wearing civilian clothing,and that they were acting for personal we credit the city version that they were acting at the request of defendant brown plaintiff disgruntled former employee or plaintiff version that myshrall acted at the request of defendant barnhart who had contracted to build a set of stairs at the project and wanted myshrall opinion.clearly,both myshrall and barnhart substantially deviated from their employment duties for the city when they acted outside the city jurisdiction,outside their employment,and for personal reasons.
as stated by the supreme court in farmers ins.group county of santa clara,supra,cal th at page,d,vicarious liability is deemed inappropriate where the misconduct does not arise from the conduct of the employer enterprise but instead arises out of a personal dispute citation,or is the result of personal compulsion citation.in such cases,the risks are engendered by events unrelated to the employment,so the mere fact that an employee has an opportunity to abuse facilities or authority necessary to the performance of his or her duties does not render the employer vicariously liable.citation.
thus,it makes no difference that myshrall identified himself as a building inspector from ione or used an unmarked city car the purported misconduct did not arise from the employer enterprise but arose for personal reasons.while the employee need not have intended to further the employer interests,the employer will not be held liable for an assault or other intentional tort that did not have a causal nexus to the employee work.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital,supra,cal th at,d.and a n act serving only the employee personal interest is less likely to arise from or be engendered by the employment than an act that,even if misguided,was intended to serve the employer in some way.id.at,d.respondeat superior liability should apply only to the types of injuries that as a practical matter are sure to occur in the conduct of the employer enterprise.citation.id.at,d.
as our state supreme court has repeatedly reiterated,the inquiry should be whether the risk was one that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise undertaken by the employer.citation.citation.farmers ins.group county of santa clara,supra,cal th at,d,mary,supra,cal d at.here,the defendants alleged misconduct outside the city jurisdictional limits and thus outside their authority and for their personal purposes can not be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental to the city business.
plaintiff nonetheless argues that mary,supra,cal d,is controlling,and supports the application of respondeat superior liability here.in mary,sergeant schroyer of the los angeles police department detained a female driver for erratic driving.id.at,the detention occurred at the sergeant was in uniform he wore a badge and had a gun and he was driving a marked police unlike this case.after the suspect fared poorly on field sobriety tests,she asked not to be taken to jail.schroyer appeared to comply and drove the suspect to her residence,but there he demanded payment for his forbearance and raped her.the jury returned a liability verdict against the city of los angeles,finding that the officer was acting within the course and scope of his employment.the supreme court upheld this determination.
our state high court wrote at the outset,we observed that society has granted police officers extraordinary power and authority over its citizenry.an officer who detains an individual is acting as the official representative of the state,with all of its coercive power.as visible symbols of that power,an officer is given a distinctively marked car,a unif
