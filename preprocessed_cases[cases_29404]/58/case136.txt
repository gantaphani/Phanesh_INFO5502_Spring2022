in this appeal we consider whether a plaintiff may be sanctioned for declining the opportunity to amend her complaint.we answer in the negative.we also address the pleading standard for discrimination claims under the fair housing act,et 
background 
since,priscilla edwards has lived in a mobile home in the marin park development in greenbrae,california.see generally hacienda valley mobile estates city of morgan hill,cir describing relationship of a mobile home park to a.edwards,we assume at this stage of the the management of the park sent her unjustified,harassing notices in order to drive her from her tenancy.the notices,which the parties call day legal notices,were first sent on january and january.these missives apparently notified edwards that her home was not in compliance with various provisions of california mobilehome residency law,cal.civil code ch.on february and april,edwards wrote the park management,describing the two notices as fraudulent,malicious,oppressive,willful and negligent,while apparently failing to explain in what respect either notice was in fact any of those things.edwards second letter explained that the park notices had caused her to suffer various medical and psychological ailments.
further notices followed,abating once edwards sued marin park,pro se,in california superior court on july.edwards dropped her complaint in april.as she puts it,the peace and quiet she had enjoyed during the pendency of the suit led her to believe no adjudication would be necessary.harassing inspections and notices from marin park allegedly resumed the day the suit was dismissed.
in july,edwards wrote to the california department of housing and community development and several california elected officials complaining of unsafe conditions at the park and of management attempts to enforce minor building standards violations against three female tenants while the more grave safety problems went unrepaired.days later edwards was offered a or renewal of her lease,rather than,as she had expected and previously enjoyed,a lease for a longer term.
edwards sued again,this time in federal court.her amended,pro se complaint claimed that under the federal fair housing act fha,et,marin park had illegally retaliated against edwards for her tenant activism that the day legal notices amounted to mail fraud actionable under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et that marin park reprisals and harassment violated edwards rights under the first and fourteenth amendments that the disrepair of the park roads constituted a nuisance and that the defendants had intentionally inflicted emotional distress,actionable under state law.
the defendants moved to dismiss all claims under federal rule of civil procedure b,failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.edwards then retained counsel and obtained extra time in which to file a response.the district court,in an order filed july,dismissed the fha retaliation claim without leave to amend because edwards failed to allege that she engaged in any protected activity under the fha.in so ruling,the district court held that protesting dangerous conditions on residential premises is not,as such,a protected activity.the rico claim was dismissed with leave for edwards to amend so as to plead the alleged fraud with the specificity demanded by federal rule of civil procedure b the constitutional claims were dismissed,as none of the defendants is a state actor,but edwards was given leave to amend with analogous state constitutional claims that might be viable against private parties.the nuisance and emotional distress claims were dismissed with prejudice,the former for failure to comply with a statutory notice requirement,see cal.civil code,the latter because the conduct as alleged was insufficiently outrageous,as a matter of law,to state a claim.
the court dismissal of the rico claim granted leave to amend by august,only one week after the initial dismissal order.failure to file an amended pleading by august,the court warned,will result in the dismissal of this action,with prejudice.on august,rather than file an amended complaint or motion seeking more time,edwards filed an election to stand upon the sufficiency of amended complaint pleadings indicating her desire to expedite an appeal to this court.the district court disapproved of edwards stance,counstru ing this curious pleading as a deliberate refusal to amend the complaint.stating that it had considered the five factors set forth in ferdik bonzelet,cir,the court dismissed the complaint with prejudice under federal rule of civil procedure b providing for dismissal f or failure of the plaintiff to comply with any order of court and entered judgment for defendants with prejudice.
edwards appeals from the dismissal of the fha and rico claims.for the reasons given below,we reverse as to the fha claim but affirm the rule b dismissal of the rico claim.we briefly address her claims as well.
ii.discussion 
edwards fha claim 
we review de novo the district court grant of a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.stone travelers,cir.a motion under rule b should be granted only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief,conley gibson,d,construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,geraci homestreet bank,cir.
swierkiewicz sorema,d,instructs us that the standards for pleading discrimination claims are no higher than the relaxed notice pleading standard of federal rule of civil procedure a,a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.swierkiewicz overruled the second circuit practice of imposing,at the dismissal stage,the prima facie case framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d.swierkiewicz,at.rather than adduce a prima facie claim in the complaint discovery,often necessary to uncover a trail of evidence regarding the defendants intent in undertaking allegedly discriminatory action,has taken plaintiff need only give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.swierkiewicz,at.quoting conley,at.the prima facie case is an evidentiary standard,not a pleading requirement.id.at.failure to adduce it may result in a later loss at summary judgment,but failure to plead it does not support dismissal at the outset.id.at.
while swierkiewicz arose in the context of employment discrimination,its reasoning applies to any claim to which the mcdonnell douglas framework is applicable,and courts have readily applied swierkiewicz to fha claims.see,hamad woodcrest condo.ass n,cir fair housing alliance,prudential ins,d,burrell state farm cas,d.moreover,swierkiewicz liberal reading of rule a applies with equal force to discrimination and retaliation claims,so it must similarly apply to fha retaliation claims.see walker thompson,cir applying swierkiewicz to prisoner retaliation claim castillo norton,applying swierkiewicz to employment discrimination and retaliation claims.edwards fha claim thus need only satisfy the rule a notice pleading standard reaffirmed in swierkiewicz to survive a rule b dismissal.
the most germane paragraphs of edwards amended complaint read 
defendants retaliated against plaintiff for engaging in protected acts in order to ensure fair housing conditions,including a disproportionate number of women seemingly targeted by defendants who met together to speak about having noticed the disproportionate figure.
the purpose of defendants was to squelch any such speech or association and to have a chilling impact on the desire of other tenants including a disproportionate number of women complaining of feeling targeted as women,to speak out in protection of their fha rights.
first emphasis in original,other emphasis added.attached to the complaint was also edwards letter to california elected officials,asserting that marin park agent,inspector bellavia,was un evenly enforc ing housing code provisions,demanding trivial changes to one woman mobile home while serious safety problems with the roads and other homes went unaddressed.see hal roach studios,richard feiner,cir noting that attachments to a complaint are to be considered part of the complaint in deciding a rule b motion.
the district court recited the factors of a prima facie fha retaliation claim,see walker city of lakewood,cir,and held that the claim should be dismissed because edwards failed to allege with adequate specificity her engagement in a protected activity,one prong of the prima facie case.in dismissing the claim premised on the paragraphs for failure to state an fha cause of action,the district court demanded more than fair notice of the claim.see swierkiewicz,at.
applying instead the proper rule a standard,we conclude that edwards fha allegations are sufficient,albeit barely,to survive a motion to dismiss.the fha protects against discrimination in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin,b,and renders it unlawful to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of,or on account of his having exercised or enjoyed,or on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of,any right granted or protected by,id.these latter requirements are the protected activities that form part of a case.walker,at.edwards seeks relief only for retaliation,under,not for discrimination,under.the district court found edwards vague and conclusory allegations concerning her gender and that defendants actions had a disproportionate effect on women wholly irrelevant to her retaliation claim.but edwards has,albeit a bit opaquely,made out a colorable claim that marin park sought to intimidate her to stop her from working with other women tenants to secure the enjoyment of their tenancies free from sex discrimination.
on a fair reading,edwards has put marin park on notice that she believes it attempted to intimidate,threaten,or interfere with her on account of her having aided or encouraged women tenants to complain about discrimination in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling because of sex.she alleges that all other tenants in her section of the park were offered leases at the time she was denied is,that marin park took action directed specifically towards her,hoping to coerce her into ceasing her activism on behalf of women tenants claiming sex discrimination.edwards has,therefore,stated a claim under the fha,not because tenant activism about dangerous conditions as such is protected activity,which the district court took to be the dispositive issue,but because edwards has adequately stated a claim for retaliation based on activism against sex discrimination.the complaint adequately sets forth the gravamen of edwards claim,and that is enough to survive a rule b dismissal here.
dismissal of edwards fha claim under rule b was therefore improper.
edwards rico claim 
we are faced with two questions regarding the rico claim.the first is whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing it under rule b as a sanction for edwards failure to follow the court instruction that she amend the complaint.see yourish california amplifier,cir.if so,we review de novo whether the rule b dismissal was proper.see stone,at.
the rule b dismissal 
dismissal under rule b is a sanction,to be imposed only in extreme circumstances.dahl city of huntington beach,cir quoting thompson housing auth.of los angeles,cir per curiam.the district court was clearly aggravated by edwards choice not to amend the rico claim when given the chance.but edwards considered decision to forego amending her complaint was perfectly proper,and was not sanctionable.
under wmx technologies,miller,cir en banc,edwards was unable to appeal the dismissal of any of her claims for which leave to amend was denied until the district court entered a final judgment dismissing them.see also webb ada county,cir explaining the need for a separate document constituting a final judgment before appeal may be taken.she apparently felt that prompt appeal of six of her claims was more important than revising the seventh and attempting to add state constitutional causes of action,and so chose to take her chances that we would find the rico claim viable as pled.edwards choice was all the more understandable in light of the district court admonition that any amended rico claim would be scrutinized under rule.
in wmx technologies,we specifically noted that a plaintiff may obtain an appealable final judgment by fil ing in writing a notice of intent not to file an amended complaint.at quoting lopez city of needles,cir.faced with the district court initial order dismissing most of her claims and granting leave to amend the rico claim,edwards did just what we indicated in wmx technologies she should do she made a reasonable choice to expedite the rest of the case and test her belief that the rico claim was adequately pled.her election to stand upon the sufficiency of amended complaint pleadings was a proper means to put that choice in the record and did not merit a sanction.on the contrary,the district court should have taken the election not to amend at face value,entered a final judgment dismissing all claims with prejudice,and allowed the case to come to us on appeal in that posture.
the court order of dismissal,perhaps understandably,read yourish as precluding this course and instead necessitating a rule b dismissal under the present circumstances.yourish,however,carefully read,does not mandate that a b dismissal with leave to amend be converted into a rule b when a plaintiff chooses not to amend although given the chance to do so and so informs the court.
the district court in yourish had notified the parties of its tentative ruling to grant a dismissal.the parties agreed the plaintiff could amend within sixty days,and the district court entered a minute order dismissing the initial complaint and granting the sixty days to amend.an amended complaint was never filed.upon the defendant motion,filed long after the running of the sixty days,the court entered a rule b dismissal for failure to obey the minute order.at.
in yourish,we upheld the rule b dismissal,stating that,u nder ninth circuit precedent,when a plaintiff fails to amend his complaint after the district court dismisses the complaint with leave to amend,the dismissal is typically considered a dismissal for failing to comply with a court order rather than for failure to prosecute a claim.id.at the same time,we noted that t his approach is somewhat problematic because a plaintiff failure to amend a complaint is not easily described as disobeying a court order,because the plaintiff has the right simply to allow the complaint to be dismissed.id.
the precedent on which yourish relied,ferdik bonzelet,cir,upheld a district court rule b dismissal after a pro se habeas petitioner failed timely to make an extremely minor amendment to his petition.ferdik analyzed the district court application of five factors for rule b dismissal set forth in our earlier cases and determined that the court did not abuse its discretion in issuing its dismissal.id.at.
wmx technologies,an en banc opinion,was filed after ferdik but before yourish.yourish,although expressing discontent with the ferdik approach,failed to cite wmx technologies or to note the apparent tension between ferdik,read broadly,and wmx technologies.it is our obligation,nonetheless,to reconcile yourish and wmx,if possible,so as to avoid an intracircuit conflict necessitating en banc consideration.see in re exxon valdez,cir describing this court approach to intracircuit conflicts.
we believe that yourish and ferdik can be understood as limited to circumstances in which the plaintiff did not,as wmx technologies recommends,give the court notice of intent not to file an amended complaint,at,but instead simply failed to take any action.yourish and ferdik both arose when plaintiffs,given the opportunity to amend or be dismissed,did nothing.in that situation,resources continue to be consumed by a case sitting idly on the court docket.the failure of the plaintiff eventually to respond to the court by am
