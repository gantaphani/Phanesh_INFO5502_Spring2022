a landlord decided to remove its apartment building from the rental market.in response to the required removal notices under state and local law one of the tenants asserted she was disabled and thus wished to have the usual day period for finding alternate housing extended to a year as provided in state and local law for soon to be displaced disabled tenants.the landlord requested confirmation of the tenant disability to learn whether it was a qualifying disability within the meaning of the applicable statutes.the tenant believed it would constitute a violation of her right of privacy to divulge such information and accordingly did not supply detailed information regarding her disability to the satisfaction of the landlord.the landlord ultimately had the tenant removed through an action for unlawful detainer.the department of fair employment and housing dfeh brought suit against the landlord for disability discrimination.the landlord moved to strike portions of the complaint as a slapp strategic lawsuit against public participation.the trial court denied the landlord motion,finding the gravamen of the complaint was for disability discrimination and for this reason the suit did not arise out of the landlord petition to governmental authorities and protected communications it made in connection with removing its residential units from the rental market.in the event a reviewing court disagreed,the court made a finding it was unlikely dfeh would prevail on its claim for disability discrimination.we affirm.

b limits a major life activity 
on july,mangine sent alta loma written notice stating she was a disabled american,and requested,among other things,an extension of the day period to vacate to one year.
on july,alta loma,through its attorney,requested from mangine a letter from your physician indicating the nature of your disability.
in response,mangine sent alta loma a note from her doctor.on a prescription pad,mangine doctor wrote,mangine is being treated for a disorder that renders her totally disabled at this time.
on august,counsel for alta loma sent mangine a letter.among other things,the letter stated,with regard to the issue of your disability status,you will note that government code section b defines disabled in accordance with section of the government code copy attached and which references section of the government code.thus,a note from your doctor which indicates that you are disabled,but does not provide a diagnosis,leaves our client no way of ensuring that you qualify for disabled status and for an extension of your tenancy of up to one year or until june.accordingly,you must provide evidence that your disability is one that is cited under section of the government code in order to obtain an extension of your tenancy.
on august,alta loma informed the city of west hollywood,department of rent stabilization,four tenants had requested an extension of their tenancy based on their disability and two of the four tenants,including mangine,had not yet documented their disability status.
two days later mangine sent an email to counsel for alta loma.in her email mangine discussed several topics,including her disability status.mangine stated,i can assure you that my disability affects one or more of the body systems as defined in the copy california government code,that you have provided.i can also tell you that my disorders have made it impossible for me to,among other things,perform the important duties of my profession.to put it simply,i am unable to work as a result of my disorders.if you would like,i can ask my treating physician to write another note which would include the fact that i am unable to work at this time due to my disorders if it will satisfy your client s needs.based upon what is contained in government code such an addendum should suffice.however,any more details regarding my illness will be challenged as an infringement upon my right to keep my medical condition private.
around this time a case analyst for real party in interest,the housing rights center,assumed mangine representation in the matter.the housing rights center is a nonprofit agency which provides counseling,investigation,and legal services to people who allege unfair housing practices.on september,the housing rights center wrote to counsel for alta loma requesting a reasonable accommodation be made for mangine.the case analyst commented the doctor note stating mangine was totally disabled at this time should be enough to establish mangine disabled status.
in october counsel for alta loma responded he did not doubt mangine was disabled.counsel also stated alta loma was not opposed to granting her an extension.however,counsel pointed out mangine doctor had yet to verify mangine disability was one which qualified under the statute for an extension of her tenancy.
in late october mangine forwarded a letter from her doctor stating mangine was being treated for a physiological chronic disorder that renders her totally disabled and unable to perform her job as a designer.the balance of the letter then quotes the statutory language describing conditions that do not qualify as disabilities under the statute.the letter states mangine does not suffer from sexual behavior disorders,compulsive gambling,kleptomania,pyromania or psychoactive substance use disorders resulting from the current unlawful use of controlled substances or other drugs.
in response,counsel for alta loma wrote to the housing rights center stating the doctor letter came close to satisfying the statutory requirements for establishing a qualifying disability but still failed to specify whether mangine disability affected one of the body systems enumerated in the statute.counsel for alta loma advised representatives from the housing rights center if mangine did not wish to divulge the details of her disability then a note from her doctor tracking the statutory language would suffice and supplied a sample letter.although the standard period for vacating the premises had already elapsed,counsel for alta loma stated he would allow mangine until the close of business on december,to provide the requested documentation before beginning unlawful detainer proceedings.
on december,a representative from the housing rights center wrote to counsel for alta loma to inform him the requested documentation would not be forthcoming mangine doctor feels uncomfortable interpreting the law to reflect that mangine disability is one that is defined under government code section k.mangine doctor feels it is not within her medical realm and by providing a letter that states,mangine suffers from a condition defined under government code section k could pose legal and ethical concerns.the representative from the housing rights center stated the doctor earlier notes were sufficient to establish mangine disability and should be accepted as satisfying the statutory criteria without placing mangine doctor in a position that may jeopardize her medical practice and still respecting mangine privacy by not disclosing the specifics of her disability.
alta loma counsel wrote counsel for the housing rights center to explain mangine doctor notes in combination still did not include the required elements to establish mangine had a qualifying disability.counsel closed his letter by saying mangine failure to provide us evidence that she is indeed disabled as defined by government code section k unfortunately leaves us no alternative other than to prosecute our client legal rights in this matter.
on january,alta loma filed an unlawful detainer action against mangine.alta loma voluntarily dismissed this suit without prejudice on january,pursuant to an automatic stay related to mangine bankruptcy proceedings.
on may,the bankruptcy court granted alta loma request for an order annulling the automatic stay.the bankruptcy court order was conditioned on payment of in attorneys fees to mangine in opposing the unlawful detainer,payment of in relocation costs,the amount to which she would be entitled as a relocation fee if she proved that she is a disabled person as she asserts she is,among other conditions.the court order specified no judgment for eviction could be enforced prior to july.
on june,alta loma filed a second unlawful detainer action.it also voluntarily dismissed this action without prejudice and refiled the action on july.alta loma secured a writ of possession on august,and mangine was evicted sometime thereafter in september.
in may dfeh filed a complaint against alta loma for disability discrimination on behalf of mangine and the housing rights center.specifically,dfeh complaint alleged causes of action for discrimination in connection with housing accommodation under government code subdivision a,the fair employment and housing act denial of civil rights under government code section,subdivision d,the unruh civil rights act civ.code,and civil code section et and denial of civil rights under government code section and civil code section,subdivision d for disability discrimination.dfeh complaint requested injunctive relief,statutory damages,actual damages and costs to the housing rights center,actual damages to mangine for her emotional distress,and punitive damages for housing discrimination,denial of civil rights and disability discrimination.
in july alta loma filed a motion pursuant to code of civil procedure section to strike the damages portion of the complaint.alta loma asserted dfeh entire complaint was based on communications in exercise of its free speech rights made in connection with official proceedings in removing its residential units from the rental market and thereafter in filing unlawful detainer actions.alta loma argued dfeh complaint was an attempt to attack this protected activity.dfeh filed opposition and included declarations from mangine and her doctor.in her declaration in opposition to alta loma motion to strike,mangine doctor stated mangine suffers from a chronic condition that affects her neurological,immunological,musculoskeletal and respiratory systems.mangine also suffers from depression.mangine feels fatigued and is subject to getting infections,colds and headaches.mangine also deals poorly with stress and has difficulty concentrating and remembering things.mangine also suffers from insomnia,occasional dizziness,and is jittery.mangine ailments prevent her from functioning needs frequent rest,a lot of time visiting different doctors,and recuperation time from infections.i have held the same medical opinion of mangine condition from to present.
dfeh requested an award of attorneys fees,claiming alta loma motion was frivolous and taken for purposes of delay.
the trial court found the gravamen of the complaint was for disability discrimination.the court noted the allegations of the complaint did not concern alta loma petition to remove its residential property from the rental market and only mentioned the fact alta loma had filed unlawful detainer actions against mangine to recover its property.for these reasons,the court found dfeh suit did not arise from alta loma exercise of its free speech or petition rights and denied alta loma motion to dismiss the complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation.
on the other hand,and in the event a reviewing court concluded dfeh suit did arise out of alta loma protected activity,the court found dfeh had not established a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of its complaint.the court found dfeh presented insufficient evidence to show alta loma knew of mangine disability prior to or during the actions alleged in the complaint.the court noted mangine refused to divulge the precise nature of her disability and it was not until her doctor filed a declaration in opposition to alta loma motion to strike that the doctor for the first time provided details of mangine disability.
although dfeh was the prevailing party the court denied its request for attorneys fees.the court noted alta loma had raised legitimate and interesting legal issues in its moving and reply papers and pointed out the unlawful detainer actions were in fact a form of petition.for these reasons the court could not find alta loma motion frivolous or intended solely to delay the proceedings.
alta loma appeals to challenge the denial of its motion to strike portions of dfeh complaint 
discussion 
statutory requirements for establishing a suit is a slapp and subject to a motion to dismiss under code of civil procedure section.
code of civil procedure section provides,among other things,a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in conjunction with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law 
section sets out a process for determining whether an action is a strategic lawsuit against public participation,or slapp.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e braun chronicle publishing th,d.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b see generally equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,cal th at,d.
i n order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing,subd.b,the plaintiff need only have stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,briggs,quoting rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,
only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute 
in making each determination the trial court considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.
in the present case the trial court found alta loma had not satisfied its burden to show the challenged acts in dfeh complaint arose from its protected activity.we review the trial court ruling on this motion independently under a de novo standard of review 
ii.alta loma failed to meet its threshold burden to show the acts alleged in dfeh complaint were in furtherance of its right of petition or free speech.
alta loma contends dfeh complaint is based on the communications it made and actions it took during the rent control removal proceeding,thus constituting communications in an administrative proceeding authorized by law and its protected activity in filing the unlawful detainer actions in judicial proceedings.accordingly,alta loma contends the trial court erred in finding the gravamen of dfeh complaint was for disability discrimination rather than based on its communicative acts arising out of its protected activity.
we will assume alta loma acts of filing and serving notices of its intent to remove its residential units from the rental market,its investigation and communications made necessary by the rent control removal process,and its filing and prosecuting its unlawful detainer actions against mangine constituted protected petitioning or free speech activity.but the mere fact an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean it arose from that activity.instead,the act underlying the plaintiff cause or the act which forms the basis for the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.in other words,that a cause of action arguably may have been triggered by protected activity does not entail that it is one arising from such.citation.in the context,the critical consideration is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant protected free speech or petitioning activity.citations.
in this case,the pleadings and the affidavits submitted by the parties establish the gravamen of dfeh action against alta loma was one for disability discrimination,and was not an attack on any act alta loma committed during the rental property removal process or during the eviction process itself.
the allegations of dfeh complaint consist primarily of the details of the numerous communications between alta loma and mangine and alta loma and the housing rights center on mangine behalf noted above of mangine assertions of disability and alta loma requests in reply for substantiation mangine suffered from a qualifying disability which would justify an extension of her tenancy.the concluding paragraph of the general allegations states because alta loma did not receive the documentation it requested to verify mangine disability,alta loma initiated the first of three eviction proceedings against mangine and she was ultimately forced to leave the premises in september.in its request for damages,dfeh complaint asserts by refusing to reasonably accommodate mangine disability and thereafter initiating multiple eviction proceedings alta loma engaged in unlawful housing discrimination in violation of housing discrimination,disability discrimination and civil rights laws.the prayer for relief seeks an injunction ordering alta loma to cease and desist from discriminating against,and failing to accommodate,mangine and any other tenant or housing applicant on the basis of disability.the prayer for relief also seeks statutory and punitive damages,as well as actual damages for the housing rights center costs in assisting mangine in her housing and disability claims and for mangine emotional distress.
contrary to alta loma argument,the communications and the actual eviction itself were not the acts attacked in dfeh complaint.instead,the allegations of wrongdoing in dfeh complaint arose from alta loma alleged acts of failing to accommodate mangine disability.the letters,email and filing of unlawful detainer actions constituted dfeh evidence of alta loma alleged disability discrimination.in other words,dfeh might well have filed the same lawsuit had alta loma simply ignored mangine claim of disability and requests for extension of her tenancy without any communication from it at all and simply filed a complaint for unlawful detainer.
the decisions alta loma rely on do not assist it.in vergos an employee who claimed he had been sexually harassed brought a civil rights suit against,among other persons,the manager who had heard,processed and decided his grievance.the manager moved to strike the causes of action against her as a slapp.the trial court denied the manager motion and the appellate court reversed.the court of appeal held the challenged acts of the manager in hearing,processing and deciding the employee grievance were all done in her capacity as a hearing officer,and in connection with an issue under review in an official proceeding authorized by law.as such,the suit based on her hearing,processing and deciding the grievance were protected acts of free speech and in furtherance of the right of petition of the employee plaintiff and all similarly situated employees accordingly,the court held it was error not to grant the manager motion to strike the causes of action in the employee complaint against the manager.
in this case,by contrast,dfeh lawsuit does not challenge any act alta loma took with respect to its official filings with the municipality in connection with the removal process.nor is dfeh suit an attack on the unlawful detainer actions it filed.dfeh instead sued alta loma for its alleged acts in failing to make a reasonable accommodation for mangine disability.
alta loma offers the decision in ingels westwood one broadcasting services,to emphasize the importance of looking beyond the title of a cause of action to the actual acts complained of to determine whether the statute applies.in ingels,a listener sued a radio station for age discrimination alleging it refused to allow him to participate in a show because he was over years old.the radio station moved to strike his complaint as a slapp.ingels argued there was no nexus between his action for age discrimination and a chilling of the radio station first amendment rights and thus it could not be stricken as a slapp the court observed,when considering a section motion,a court must consider the actual objective of the suit and grant the motion if the true goal is to interfere with and burden the defendant exercise of his free speech and petition rights.the court had no trouble concluding that the radio station activity in providing an open forum by means of a radio talk show fits within the scope of the statute.
in the case at bar,on the other hand,all the acts complained of,regardless of heading or placement in the complaint,concern alta loma alleged acts of disability discrimination in refusing to accept mangine claim of disability and in failing to accommodate her disability by extending her tenancy.in this sense the ingels decision favors the trial court ruling.
the circumstances in the present case are most analogous to the situation in santa monica rent control board pearl street,llc in pearl street,the of a rent controlled building filed papers with the city rent control board board seeking to restor
