the frances berger foundation berger,the owner of a mobilehome park in the city of escondido the city,appeals a judgment denying its petition for writ of mandate code civ,challenging the adequacy of a rent increase authorized by the city of escondido mobilehome rent review board the board,and dismissing on summary judgment an accompanying complaint for damages on theories of inverse condemnation and violation of a right to constitutional due process under title united states code section.berger contends the board decision is not supported by substantial evidence,and,specifically,the board failed to adequately account for inflation as a factor affecting the fair return analysis.we agree the board decision lacks evidentiary support.we reverse the judgment insofar as it concerns the court denial of the petition for writ of mandate,and affirm it in all other respects.
factual and procedural background 
in june the city voters approved a mobilehome rent control ordinance ordinance escondido,et designating the escondido city council as the board,establishing base rent ceilings at january,levels,and requiring owners to obtain the board approval for any rent increase.the ordinance,which has been the subject of extensive litigation,provides that on application by the owner the board shall approve such rent increase as it determines to be just,fair and reasonable.the ordinance specifies no method or formula for determining rents,but it enumerates nonexclusive factors the board shall consider,including changes in the consumer price index cpi,comparable rents and capital improvements the ordinance provides no guidance on how the board should weigh the factors.
berger,a charitable foundation,acquired the town country club park the park in by donation.the park is a senior park,in which at least one resident in percent of the spaces must be a minimum of years old.
in february berger applied for a rent increase.at the time,the average rent was berger claimed various valuation approaches justify a rent increase of between and it sought an increase of,or percent.
at the september administrative hearing the parties presented reports and testimony,which will be discussed more fully in part ii,post.the city principal expert recommended a rent increase of between and.the board adopted a resolution authorizing a increase.
berger then filed a petition in the superior court for administrative mandamus,along with a complaint for damages under theories of inverse condemnation and violation of title united states code section,alleging the rent increase is inadequate and does not properly account for inflation.after reviewing the administrative record,the court denied the petition,concluding substantial evidence supports the board decision.the city then successfully moved for summary judgment on the complaint

general principles governing rent control 
the city ability to control rents is principally circumscribed by substantive due process,which requires that all legislation have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose.morgan city of chino th,d.constitutionally valid rent control schemes must allow park owners to earn a just and reasonable or fair return on their investment.citations.the term fair return is incapable of precise definition citation,but is generally considered to include returns that are commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having comparable risks citation,or high enough to encourage good management,reward efficiency,discourage the flight of capital,and enable operators to maintain their credit.donohue santa paula west mobile home park th,d birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d.
the term fair rate of return refers to a constitutional minimum within a broad zone of reasonableness w ithin this broad zone,the rate regulator is balancing the interests of investors,landlords,with the interests of consumers,mobilehome owners.galland city of clovis cal th,d.a rent control provision that does not permit a just and reasonable return on a landlord investment is confiscatory.city of berkeley city of berkeley rent stabilization bd.th,d city of berkeley.
in california,a rent control system must generally permit profits to be adjusted over time for inflation so that the real value of that profit does not shrink toward the vanishing point.galland city of clovis,supra,cal th at,d.if the fixed amount of a landlord profit remains the same year after year his or her return will in time diminish in real value.furthermore,although a fixed profit amount may produce a reasonable or fair return on investment for investments such as bonds,investment in rental units contemplates a higher risk and hence,in times of high inflation and when viewed in the long term,demands more than mere maintenance of an existing profit amount.citations.therefore,although an ordinance may properly restrict landlords profits on their rental investments,it may not indefinitely freeze the dollar amount of those profits without eventually causing confiscatory results.fisher city of berkeley cal d.

lack of substantial evidence 
the city expert on the fair return issue,kenneth baar,advocated a maintenance of net operating income mnoi standard.in his report,baar explained that while the ordinance does not set forth a specific fair return standard,it mandates consideration of the types of factors that are considered in an mnoi formula.
the mnoi standard,which baar also refers to as the cost approach,is intended to ensure that an owner net operating income noi will not be reduced by rent control the rent increase consists of the base period rent plus the increase in operating expenses since the base year.baar,guidelines for drafting rent control laws lessons of a decade rutgers,hereafter guidelines for rent control laws.the mnoi standard recognizes that in the rental housing market,ratios of rental income to value,equity,and gross income vary substantially among buildings.therefore,rather than designating a particular rate of return as fair,mnoi standards pursue the best available option,which is to preserve prior noi levels.id.at.
according to baar,the thorny issue associated with the use of an mnoi standard is what type of adjustment,if any,should be made to the base year noi to account for inflation and allow for growth in income referred to as indexing.guidelines for rent control laws,supra,rutgers.at.some rent control agencies allow no adjustment for inflation,some allow full inflation adjustments and others allow adjustments of various fractions of the inflation rate.id.at.a full inflation adjustment,which berger sought here,would increase noi at the inflation rate.id.at.according to baar report,various california municipalities use from percent to percent cpi indexing ratios in their mnoi standards to account for the effect of inflation.see also city of berkeley,supra,th at,d.
baar calculated that under an mnoi standard,berger rent should be increased by to cover the increase in operating costs between and.he recommended additional increases of for two capital improvements and to cover the application fee.
baar report includes alternate mnoi standards that adjust noi of by various percentages of the inflation rate,or increase of percent in the cpi between the end of the date of berger last application for a rent increase and the end of.baar calculated that indexing of percent,percent and percent would require additional rent increases of,respectively adding those amounts to increases for higher operating expenses,capital improvements and the application fee,total rent increases using percent,percent and percent indexing would be,and,respectively.baar recommended percent indexing,and advised that a rent increase is required to provide a fair return under an mnoi standard.at the hearing,baar explained no court has said that indexing is required.i do know of any ordinance or situation where mnoi indexing is used where lower than indexing is used.a number of ordinances use.
additionally,baar report addresses rent increases based solely on the percent increase in the cpi during the relevant time.he calculated that using percent,percent or percent of the cpi increase,new rents would be,and,respectively.this calculation does not concern noi.rather,the inflation rate of percent,or fraction thereof,is multiplied by the base rent of.baar noted that under the board written guidelines it shall take into account no more than percent of increases in the cpi he also noted,however,that the board had an approach of granting percent cpi increases pursuant to short form petitions.
the city also retained an appraiser,james brabant,to address the ordinance comparable rents factor.brabant believed the park spaces had an overall rental value of,for an increase of.in baar report,however,he criticized brabant inclusion in his analysis of some spaces not subject to rent control.for instance,when a mobilehome is sold in place,the owner may raise rent for its space without applying to the board.baar found that when such rents were excluded from the study,berger rents lagged those of comparable spaces by.
the tenants objected to any rent increase,but their representative argued that if the board granted an increase it should not exceed.several tenants submitted letters of hardship.
the board rejected baar recommendation of a minimum rent increase of.it also rejected brabant comparable rents analysis of.it granted a rent increase by averaging three figures an increase of based on baar analysis of controlled rents an increase of based on an increase of existing rents by percent of the increase in the cpi and based on an mnoi standard that indexes base year noi at percent of the increase in the cpi.the board added these figures,divided the total by three and rounded the result of down to the nearest dollar.
we conclude the board ruling lacks evidentiary support.although the board was not required to employ any specific formula,its averaging method was faulty because there was no showing that two of the figures the board relied on were within the range of reasonable rents under the fair return criterion.conceptually,several figures may be averaged to arrive at a new rent only if each of the figures is independently within the range of reasonableness.
weighing the competing interests of owners and tenants and satisfying constitutional criteria is not a task within common experience.to the contrary,courts consider it a matter of expert opinion what rate of return on a mobilehome park is fair.whispering pines mobile home park,city of scotts valley d.whispering pines concord communities city of concord th,d concord communities.
in whispering pines,the court held a rent commission erred by rejecting expert testimony on the fair rate of return issue and relying instead on factors of common knowledge and experience,such as the state of the economy and high interest rates.whispering pines,supra,d at.the court concluded that s ince there was no proper evidentiary basis for the commission conclusions on a fair rate of return,there is no basis for the trial court conclusion the commission findings were supported by the evidence.id.at.similarly,in concord communities the court held the rent control board finding that base rents were not significantly below market value lacked evidentiary support.the board rejected expert testimony and premised its finding on personal experience and knowledge of real estate.concord communities,supra,th at,d see also galland city of clovis,supra,cal th at,d,determining prices that will provide a fair return is product of expert judgment.
baar neither recommended a rent increase based on the single factor of comparable rents,nor stated such an increase would satisfy the fair return standard.rather,he believed a minimum increase of,under a modified mnoi standard,was required to meet the fair return standard.baar report explains that if a fair return is provided under an mnoi standard,no additional increase would be justified by the comparable rent factor.italics added.further,baar wrote that the difference between the result required to permit a fair return and the result that would be justified under brabant comparable rents approach is not substantial.in the past comparables have only been considered as a relevant factor if the differences in rents among comparable parks are significant.baar indicated this is not such a case.
additionally,the city staff rejected the notion that a rent increase would provide a fair rate of return.rather,staff advised the board that if it intended to rely on the comparable rents factor brabant approach of is more in keeping with the language of the ordinance.the ordinance directs the board to consider,among numerous other factors,the rent lawfully charged for comparable mobilehome spaces in the city of escondido.the construction of an ordinance is a pure question of law for the court,and the rules applying to construction of statutes apply equally to ordinances.aptos seascape county of santa cruz d.county of madera superior court d.our primary aim in construing any law is to determine the legislative intent.citation.in doing so,we look first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.committee of seven thousand superior court cal d.
at the hearing,baar conceded that l iterally reading that term the comparable rents factor,it would mean any rents that are charged as long as they are not in violation of the law.brabant advised the board his comparable rents figure was based on what i believe to be all of the lawfully charged rents at comparable parks.given the plain language of the ordinance,we can not say the voters who approved the rent control scheme intended to exclude rents from a comparability study.for comparability,the mobilehome park spaces must be comparable,not the manner in which rents are set.
likewise,no evidence was presented that a rent increase of,based on a straight cpi increase at the percent level,would constitute a fair return,taking the effect of inflation into consideration.the mere fact that an expert report includes consideration of various single factors enumerated in the ordinance does not show a rent increase based thereon would provide a fair return.
the city points out that due process only requires a fair return on the mobilehome park as a whole,not a fair return on each discrete aspect of the park,such as each capital improvement.morgan city of chino,supra,th at,d.the city suggests a increase would provide a fair return even if it does not cover all of its increased operating costs or specific capital improvements.to any extent that is arguably correct,it remains that there was no evidence before the board to support the use of the and figures in deciding the fair return issue.f
