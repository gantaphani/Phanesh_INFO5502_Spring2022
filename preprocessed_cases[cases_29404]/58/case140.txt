in a case of first impression,we must decide whether a disabled person seeking to enforce rights created by f of the fair housing amendments act fhaa,stat.codified as amended at,must have an interest in actually purchasing or renting a particular property or dwelling in order to allege a discriminatory violation.see.we also face a related question whether disabled rights action committee drac may have organizational standing to allege fhaa violations based on its own articulated injury in fact.because we answer the first question in the negative and the second in the affirmative,we reverse the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim and denial of motion to reconsider,and remand for further proceedings.we do,however,agree with the district court that disgorgement,one of the remedies sought by appellant,is inappropriate in any case and therefore also affirm in part.
facts and procedural history 
the nature of the district court dismissal requires us to accept as true the factual allegations of drac complaint and to construe those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.pareto fdic,cir.
in late and early,robert ray smith,a polio victim,began investigating housing developments in clark county,nevada,as part of a program to test compliance with the fhaa the tester program of which smith was a part was organized and implemented by drac,a organization promoting the rights of disabled persons in utah and nevada.as a result of his investigations,smith discovered discriminatory design and construction defects in four properties designed and built by pacific properties development corporation pacific properties these defects included,inter alia,inaccessible interior doorways,pathways and thermostats.
based on these discoveries,smith and drac filed administrative complaints with the united states department of housing and urban development hud.hud conducted its own investigation,confirmed the existence of apparent fhaa violations and instituted compliance litigation resulting in a consent decree with pacific properties.under the decree,pacific agreed to make certain adjustments to the four housing developments in accordance with an injunction prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of f c.uninformed of the terms of the consent decree,smith visited another pacific development,savannah at silverado ranch,after the decree was entered and again encountered various architectural barriers in the common areas.
dissatisfied with a lack of notice of the entry of the decree as well as its scope and reach,smith and drac initiated the instant litigation in district court,claiming that conditions in all five pacific properties developments violated f prohibition of discrimination against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling,because of a handicap of inter alios that person.
on motion of pacific properties,the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to.b for failure to state a claim,determining that neither a tester in smith circumstance nor an organization like drac had standing to assert rights under the fhaa drac subsequently moved for reconsideration under.e.in that motion,drac alerted the court that smith had passed away,and asked that the court reconsider its motion to amend the complaint to include supplemental facts in support of its own representational and organizational standing in light of smith death.
the district court denied drac reconsideration motion without articulating the basis for denial.drac appeals both the dismissal and the denial of the motion for reconsideration.we have jurisdiction over both orders under because the denial of reconsideration is an integral part of the final judgment on the merits,even though not entered concurrently with that judgment.see united states v.one ford pickup,cir per curiam.
standard of review 
we review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion,kona,estate of bishop,cir.the same standard of review applies to denial of leave to amend.zivkovic cal.edison,cir.whether such a denial rests on an inaccurate view of the law and is therefore an abuse of discretion,see united states state of washington,cir,requires us to review the underlying legal determination de novo.see southwest voter registration educ.project shelley,cir en banc per curiam.
because it is the only facially viable basis for denial of drac motion to reconsider,we assume that denial was premised on the futility of amendment in light of the district court legal ruling on the scope of f as the supreme court has explained 
in the absence of any apparent or declared as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,futility of amendment,leave sought should,as the rules require,be freely given.
foman davis,d.there is no allegation or evidence of delay,bad faith,or prejudice in the record.because drac alleges on appeal that the court legal ruling buttressing the denial of amendment was in error,we review de novo the district court determination that f of the fhaa requires that a disabled person have an interest in actually renting or purchasing a dwelling in order to allege a violation.see southwest voter registration educ.project,at.
with regard to the dispute over drac standing separate and apart from any tester injury,we review de novo the district court conclusion that drac lacked organizational standing to bring the instant litigation.see fair housing of marin combs,cir,cert.denied,d.
discussion 
drac has asserted two bases for its standing.first,it claims standing as a representative of its members,see hunt washington apple advertising comm n,d,including testers like smith,who were allegedly subjected to limited housing opportunities and overtly discriminatory conditions stemming from pacific properties failure to comply with the law.second,drac claims organizational standing in its own right,alleging that pacific properties discriminatory practices negatively impacted its organizational mission and caused drac to redirect scarce resources to combat discrimination by pacific properties.see,fair housing of marin,at.while drac representational standing is contingent upon the standing of its members to bring suit,see hunt,at,drac organizational standing is separate from the standing of its members,turning instead on whether the organization itself has suffered an injury in fact.see havens realty coleman,d.we address each of these bases for drac standing separately below.
representational standing 
to establish representational standing,drac must demonstrate that 
a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to vindicate are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.
hunt,at.the district court determined that drac lacked representational standing because it could not demonstrate that any one of its members,including the tester smith,had standing to sue.
drac concedes that none of its members have any interest in actually purchasing or renting property from pacific properties.it contends,nonetheless,that f,like other provisions of the fhaa and the original fair housing act fha,et,creates a broad right to be free from discrimination that may be enforced by disabled persons or those acting for them even if they are testers,someone having no interest in actually buying or renting that poses as buyer or renter to collect evidence of unlawful housing practices.see havens,at.the district court disagreed,finding that f does not create a broad right to the opportunity to buy or rent a dwelling that is unconnected to any interest in actually renting or buying a dwelling.
testers have played a long and important role in fair housing enforcement,stemming from the supreme court determination that with the fha,congress intended to establish a broad set of rights to be free from housing discrimination,and that as a general rule,courts should not erect standing than the minima required by article those seeking to vindicate these rights.see havens,at.see also gladstone realtors village of bellwood,d.the high court more recently cautioned that courts be no less generous in interpreting provisions added to the fha by the fhaa.see city of edmonds oxford house,d.
we begin our analysis with the various enforcement provisions of the fha and fhaa.the citizen suit provision of the fha permits enforcement by any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice.i.broad construction of the any person language was subsequently extended to d of the fha by the supreme court in havens.at.the court concluded that d confers on all persons a legal right to truthful information about available housing.id.in reaching this end,the court contrasted the language of a,which prohibits the refusal to sell or rent in the face of a bona fide offer because of race,color,religion,and so on,with that of d,which more broadly prohibits misrepresentation to any person for the same reasons.at.because congress plainly omitted any such requirement of a bona fide offer insofar as it banned discriminatory representations in d,that a tester may have approached the real estate agent without any intention of buying or renting a home,does not negate the simple fact of injury within the meaning of d.id.
when congress enacted the amendments to the fha,it spoke in even broader terms,changing the language of d by making it unlawful for the first time to represent to any person because of handicap that any dwelling is not available for inspection,sale,or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.d,amending d.congress also added f,a section dealing specifically with discrimination based on handicap.under the court broad holding in havens,testers began to and still most often do bring suit under d,specifically because that section has been held not to require an actual intention to rent or buy the property in question.the issue of whether the court interpretation in havens extends to f is an issue of first impression.we therefore look at how other provisions of the fha and fhaa have been interpreted in determining the answer.
the language of f replicates that of its predecessor,b it is simply directed specifically to discrimination based on handicap,rather than race,color,religion,sex,familial status or national origin.the seventh circuit has determined that b of the fha is violated,even in the absence of an actual intention to rent or buy a property,when a landlord offers black testers apartments at higher rental rates than those offered to white testers.see united states balistrieri,cir.this is because b,like d,prohibits discrimination against any person in the terms or conditions of rentals.see balistrieri,at see also village of bellwood dwivedi,cir t he logic of havens embraces discrimination in the provision of services,forbidden explicitly by section b and implicitly by section a.
pacific properties argues that b is not relevant to the instant inquiry,because that section specifically excludes discrimination based on racial,gender,or other enumerated tester groups may have standing under b is inapposite because disabled testers are different from those seeking to redress discrimination against other protected classes.disabled testers,pacific argues,have no need to undertake investigations to determine whether the terms and conditions of sale or rental create barriers to accessibility,because such violations would be readily apparent to anyone attempting to rent or buy.pacific concludes that congress recognized this difference when it created a special section for disability discrimination with f.
but the plain statutory language of f both replicates that of b,and adds additional classes of individuals who may seek to enforce rights under the provision based on either their own disability or that of another.f a c,supra.we refuse to accept the notion that congress could somehow have intended different standing requirements for identical provisions.this is particularly true when one looks to f sister provision,f,a more narrow provision that tracks the language of a,limiting the class of affected individuals to any buyer or renter,just as a is limited to any person making a bona fide offer to sell or rent.
it is also significant that while f explicitly prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental,or to otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling because of a handicap,f prohibits a broader set of behavior,making it illegal to even discriminate in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling,because of a handicap f.the logical conclusion is that the group of individuals that could fall victim to the latter class of broader and less specific behaviors would be,a fortiori,larger and less specific than the enumerated class of renters and buyers affected by the former prohibition.
moreover,the district court noted that while a tester may have standing under f,the language of f makes plain that the injury to the tester must arise from something more than merely observing a discriminatory architectural feature.the court therefore apparently recognized the possibility of disabled tester standing under this section but simply attempted to distinguish the facts of this case based on what that tester must accomplish in order to gain standing.to read an additional standing requirement into the statute beyond mere observation,however,ignores that many overtly discriminatory conditions,for example,lack of a ramped entryway,prohibit a disabled individual from forming the requisite intent or actual interest in renting or buying for the very reason that architectural barriers prevent them from viewing the whole property in the first instance.more importantly,the district court reasoning fails to recognize the dignitary harm to a disabled person of observing such overtly discriminatory conditions.
interpreting f to exclude these individuals from enforcing their right to be free from discrimination undermines the specific intent of the fhaa,which is to prevent disabled individuals from feeling as if they are citizens.see generally,at.the district court therefore erred as a matter of law in interpreting f to preclude tester standing,and as a consequence,drac representational standing.the district court subsequent denial of leave to amend or reconsider based on this interpretation was an abuse of discretion see washington,at.
organizational standing 
on the merits of the motion to dismiss,the district court also committed legal error when it determined that drac,as an organization,did not have standing separate and apart from smith under f.we need look no further than the statute itself,our recent decision in fair housing of marin combs,and the face of drac complaint to discover where that error lies.section d of the fha defines person to include corporations and associations.d.as a threshold matter,drac,a corporation,is a person protected by the statute.see havens,at.walker city of lakewood,cir.drac must therefore satisfy the requirement for individual standing a demonstration of concrete and particularized injury giving drac a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.baker carr,d see also havens,at.warth seldin,d.
in addition to interpreting d for purposes of tester standing,havens analyzed the independent standing of housing opportunities made equal,or home,an organization which,like drac,utilized testers.based on home complaint,which alleged that its efforts to assist equal access to housing had been frustrated by defendants practices and that it had devoted significant resources to identify and counteract those practices,the court found that home had sufficiently alleged injury for standing in its own right.at.such concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization the consequent drain on the organization far more than simply a setback to the organization abstract social interests.id.c
