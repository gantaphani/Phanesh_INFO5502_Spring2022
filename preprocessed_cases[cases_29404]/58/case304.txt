introduction 
the superior court issued a writ of mandamus barring enforcement of two provisions of the san francisco residential rent stabilization and arbitration ordinance.admin.code,ch.hereafter,the rent ordinance.the superior court found that section a c and section a g of the rent ordinance are unconstitutional on their face.we affirm.
ii.factual and procedural history 
a.the rent ordinance and the daly amendments 
the rent ordinance was adopted in june in order to address problems created by a shortage of decent,safe and sanitary housing in the city and county of san francisco.the ordinance addresses these problems by,among other things,imposing rent increase limitations for tenants in occupancy and limiting the grounds pursuant to which a landlord may lawfully recover or endeavor to recover possession of a residential rental unit from a tenant.
one basis for a tenant lawful eviction is so that the landlord or landlord close relative may use the unit as his or her principal residence.a.this owner provision of the rent ordinance is consistent with the state ellis act which provides that,with limited exceptions,a statute,ordinance or regulation may not compel the owner of any residential real property to offer,or to continue to offer,accommodations in the property for rent or lease,subd.a.however,the rent ordinance also contains provisions designed to ensure that a landlord can not avoid controls imposed by the rent ordinance by evicting a tenant,pursuant to the owner provision the ellis act,and then the unit to a new tenant who does not possess the protections under the rent ordinance that the original tenant could have claimed.a.
in august,the san francisco district attorney office,which is charged with enforcing the rent ordinance,contacted san francisco supervisor daly and shared concerns about problems the office encountered while investigating illegal evictions.for example,the district attorney office was concerned by a practice it referred to as the ellis bluff which it described as follows a landlord threatens,but never actually files,an ellis act eviction notice in order to recover a rental unit from a tenant.if the tenant vacates the unit,the landlord then receives the benefit of an ellis eviction without any of the consequences,and can the unit at market rate.the office had also allegedly encountered cases in which tenants who were not represented by counsel had been subjected to owner or ellis act evictions and had waived their rights under the rent ordinance,purported to release landlords from their obligations under the ordinance agreed not to cooperate with the district attorney or the rent board.
supervisor daly introduced proposed amendments to the rent ordinance intended to remedy the problems about which the district attorney office had complained.on april,the san francisco board of supervisors passed ordinance which amended sections,b,and a of the rent ordinance.ordinance was approved by then mayor brown on may.ord,file.like the parties and other individuals involved in this case,we refer to amendments effectuated by this ordinance as the daly amendments.several of the changes effectuated by the daly amendments were made to section a of the rent ordinance which is entitled misdemeanors and other enforcement provisions.
for example,section a c now states it shall be unlawful for a landlord or for any person who willfully assists a landlord to request that a tenant move from a rental unit or to threaten to recover possession of a rental unit,either verbally or in writing,unless the landlord in good faith intends to recover said unit under one of the grounds enumerated in section a or b and within five days of any such request or threat the landlord serves the tenant with a written notice stating the particular ground under section a or b that is the basis for the landlord intended recovery of possession of the unit.
section a g,which was also amended,states except as provided in this subsection,it shall be unlawful for a landlord,or for any person who willfully assists a landlord,including the landlord attorney or legal representative,to seek or obtain a tenant agreement not to cooperate with an investigation or proceeding by any administrative or law enforcement or other governmental agency under this chapter,or to otherwise seek or obtain a tenant waiver of rights under this chapter.any waiver of rights by a tenant under this chapter shall be void as contrary to public policy unless the tenant is represented by independent counsel and the waiver is approved in a settlement agreement,or by a retired judge of the california superior court sitting as a mediator or arbitrator by mutual agreement of the tenant represented by independent counsel and the landlord.any settlement agreement shall identify the judge,mediator,or arbitrator reviewing the settlement,all counsel representing the parties,and any other information as required by the board.the landlord shall file a signed copy of the settlement agreement with the board within ten days of execution.unless otherwise required by the board,the copy of the agreement filed with the board shall redact the amount of payments to be made to tenants.
another change effectuated by the daly amendments was the addition of section a i which states any person who violates section a a,b,c,d,g or h is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a mandatory fine of one thousand dollars,and in addition to such fine may be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than six months.each violation shall constitute a separate offense.
b.the present action 
on october,john baba,philip brady,sergio iantorno,john zanghi and arnold evje,ii respondents filed an amended petition for administrative mandamus the petition and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the san francisco board of supervisors,the rent stabilization and arbitration board and the city and county of san francisco appellants.according to the petition,baba and brady are residential tenants of property located in san francisco,iantorno is a san francisco landlord,and zanghi and evje practice law in san francisco.together,they challenged several of the daly amendments,including section a c and a g,on a variety of grounds.
the trial court issued an alternative writ on october,and set the matter for briefing and hearing.thereafter,on april,the honorable james mcbride denied the petition in part,finding that some of the challenges advanced did not constitute controversies that were sufficiently ripe for judicial determination.however,the court granted the petition with respect to section a c and section a g.it found that section a c is unconstitutional on its face because it criminalizes speech that is protected by the first amendment and by article,section of the california constitution and that it is also void for vagueness.the court also found that section a g is invalid because it violates a person fundamental right to represent himself or herself in a proceeding that may or may not ripen into a lawsuit.the court reasoned that a person has a fundamental right to appear in court in propria persona and that the right to represent oneself outside the courthouse is just as fundamental.
a writ of mandamus prohibiting appellants from enforcing section a c and section a g was issued on may.appellants filed their timely notice of appeal on july.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
respondents have advanced facial challenges to sections a c and a g.a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.citation.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d.we review de novo both the trial court interpretation of the challenged provisions and the constitutional issues it resolved.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,herbst swan th,d.
section a c 
appellants challenge the trial court findings that section a c violates free speech guarantees and is vague.they contend that the speech which is regulated by this provision falls outside the protection of the first amendment and that it is not vague because its language is easily understood with resort to simple common sense.because we agree with the trial court that the provision suppresses constitutionally protected speech,we need not address the void for vagueness doctrine.
governing principles and issues presented 
the first amendment of the united states constitution provides in part that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech although by its terms this provision limits only congress,the united states supreme court has held that the fourteenth amendment due process clause makes the freedom of speech provision operate to limit the authority of state and local governments as well.citation.kasky nike,cal th,d,kasky.article,section,subdivision a of the california constitution states every person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.a law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.the state constitution free speech provision is at least as broad as citation and in some ways is broader than citations the comparable provision of the federal constitution first amendment.kasky,supra,cal th at,d,gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d,gerawan i.therefore,if section a c violates the first amendment,it also offends our state constitution.
as a general rule,laws that by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed are content based.citation.people hsu th,d.section a c is a regulation it criminalizes communications made by or on behalf of a landlord based on the content of the communication.a content based regulation is presumptively invalid.citation.it may be upheld only upon a showing that it is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and has been narrowly tailored to serve that end.people hsu,supra,at,d.
appellants have never attempted to show that section a c is a permissible regulation which satisfies the test we have just quoted.in the lower court,appellants took the position that respondents failed to carry their burden of proving this ordinance is unquestionably unconstitutional.on appeal,respondents assert a new argument.they contend,for the first time on appeal,that this provision is constitutional because it penalizes false and misleading commercial speech which is not constitutionally protected at all.
t he federal constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression.bolger youngs drug products,d bolger.kasky,supra,cal th at,d.because regulation of commercial speech based on content is viewed as less problematic bolger,supra,at.than a regulation of noncommercial speech,the united states supreme court crafted an test for determining the validity of a regulation of commercial speech.that test is for commercial speech to come within the first amendment,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if both inquiries yield positive answers,we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,d central hudson see also kasky,supra,cal th at,d,gerawan farming,kawamura cal th,d,gerawan ii.
appellants rely exclusively on the first prong of this central hudson test which reflects the rule that commercial speech that is false or misleading is not entitled to first amendment protection and may be prohibited entirely.citations.kasky,supra,cal th at,d.but appellants overlook one aspect of this rule which is noteworthy here.with regard to misleading commercial speech,the united states supreme court has drawn a distinction between,on the one hand,speech that is actually or inherently misleading,and,on the other hand,speech that is only potentially misleading.actually or inherently misleading commercial speech is treated the same as false commercial speech,which the state may prohibit entirely.citations.by comparison,s tates may not completely ban potentially misleading speech if narrower limitations can ensure that the information is presented in a nonmisleading manner.citations.id.at,d.
therefore,in order to accept appellants claim that the speech suppressed by section a c is not constitutionally protected at all,we would have to find that this provision embraces only commercial speech which is false or inherently misleading.if appellants are wrong on either count,the first amendment is implicated and we must consider whether the regulation infringement on the constitutional right to freedom of speech is justified.
section a c regulates constitutionally protected speech 
commercial speech 
commercial speech,at its core,is speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction citation,and,more broadly,is speech that goes beyond proposing such a transaction but yet relate s solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience citations.gerawan i,supra,cal th at,d.commercial speech has been distinguished from political speech which is speech that deals with governmental affairs citation,and ideological speech citation which is speech that apparently concerns itself with philosophical,social,artistic,economic,literary,ethical,and similar matters citation.ibid.
section a c is not directed at core commercial speech it does not regulate speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction.moreover,we find the speech that is regulated by this provision does not relate solely to the economic interests of the speaker his or her audience.section a c penalizes specified types of speech by a landlord regardless of whether that speech is motivated by economic considerations.it also applies to speech by one who willfully assists a landlord.a speaker who willfully assists a landlord in this context may not have any economic interest in the matter at issue at all.further,this statute punishes a threat to recover possession of a rental unit regardless of the basis for that threat.and it applies even more broadly to any request that a tenant move from a rental unit.any such threat or request subjects the speaker to criminal liability unless the landlord has the present intent to institute formal eviction proceedings against his or her tenant pursuant to section a or b and acts on that intent within five days.a c.neither this broadly worded provision nor the penalty it imposes contains any language limiting its reach to speech that is motivated by or even related to the economic interests of the parties.
a few examples illustrate our point.during the course of a heated argument over a current political issue,an angry landlord requests that her tenant move out but does not have any present intent to evict him or her.that landlord violates the express terms of section a c and is subject to criminal prosecution.a i.a forgiving landlord who feels an obligation to the tenant beyond that required by the rent ordinance threatens to evict that tenant in the future unless the tenant remedies his or her prior breach of the rent ordinance or refrains from committing future breaches.under these circumstances,the landlord has violated section a c because he does not have the present intent to institute a formal eviction.although,in these examples,the economic interests of the parties may be implicated,the speech which is penalized is not motivated by or even related to the economic interests of the parties.
some of the speech prohibited by this provision could be construed as commercial speech.for example,a landlord who requests that a tenant vacate a rental unit in exchange for a cash payment would violate this regulation to the extent he or she does not have the present intent to evict the tenant pursuant to a ground set forth in section a or b of the rent ordinance.however,such speech is suppressed not because this provision regulates commercial speech but rather because it applies to broad categories of speech regardless of their commercial nature.absent any language limiting the reach of this provision to commercial speech we can not reasonably interpret it as containing such a limitation.
appellants contend that a test recently articulated by our supreme court in kasky,supra,cal th at page,d,establishes that section a c is properly viewed as a commercial speech regulation.
in kasky,the court held that statements allegedly made by defendant nike about its labor practices and working conditions in its factories constituted commercial speech subject to regulation under the state false advertising and unfair competition laws.in reaching that decision,the kasky court acknowledged that there is no test to distinguish commercial from noncommercial speech under the federal or state constitution and it expressly declined to propose any such test.instead,the court formulated the following test w hen a court must decide whether particular speech may be subjected to laws aimed at preventing false advertising or other forms of commercial deception,categorizing a particular statement as commercial or noncommercial speech requires consideration of three elements the speaker,the intended audience,and the content of the message.kasky,supra,cal th at,d.applying this test,the kasky court found that the statements at issue in that case were commercial speech because nike was acting as a commercial speaker,because its intended audience was primarily the buyers of its products,and because the statements consisted of factual representations about its own operations.id.at,d.
kasky does not assist appellants for several reasons.first,the kasky test is a test.it applies when the issue to be decided is whether particular speech may be subjected to laws aimed at preventing false advertising or other forms of commercial deception kasky,supra,cal th at,d.the present case presents no such issue here we must determine whether a particular law violates free speech guarantees.beyond that,the law at issue here is a provision of a local rent control ordinance and does not have anything to do with false or misleading advertising which was the subject of kasky.
indeed,kasky appears to undermine appellants position in this case to the extent the court there recognized that all of the united states supreme court commercial speech decisions have involved statements about a product or service,or about the operations or qualifications of the person offering the product or service.kasky,supra,cal th at,d.the relationship,though it surely has a commercial component,is more complex,personal and permanent than the relationship between the seller of goods or services and his or her potential buyer.we simply are not comfortable manipulating the kasky test to fit this very different situation.
finally,to the extent the kasky test can and should be adapted to fit this context,it does not support appellants claim that section a c is purely a commercial speech regulation.as noted,the kasky test requires consideration of the speaker,the intended audience and the content of the message.kasky,supra,cal th at,d.this test helps to identify common characteristics of commercial speech which include a speaker who is engaged in commerce an audience of persons who may be influenced by the speech to engage in a commercial transaction with the speaker or the person on whose behalf the speaker is acting and a message which is commercial in character such as a representation of fact about the speakers business operations,products or services.kasky,supra,cal th at,d.
appellants contend that the speech subject to section a c has these commercial speech characteristics because t he landlord is a commercial speaker,the tenant is a consumer of the landlord services,and the eviction threat asserts a present intent to the landlord business operations that the landlord can verify but the tenant can not.to the contrary,and as already noted,section a c applies regardless of whether the landlord is acting as a commercial speaker and it also applies to individuals who willfully assist landlords and may have no commercial relationship with the tenant at all.furthermore,section a c does not regulate factual representations about the landlord business it applies to any threat to evict and any request that a tenant vacate a unit regardless of the basis for the threat or request or of the context in which it is made.thus,kasky does not alter our conclusion that section a c is not purely a commercial speech regulation.
false or inherently misleading speech 
as noted above,the first amendment protects commercial speech which is not false or inherently misleading.thus,to the extent that section a c can properly be analyzed as a commercial speech regulation,the first amendment affords some level of protection against governmental suppression of commercial speech unless this provision regulates only false or inherently misleading speech.
appellants contend that section a c punishes only two specific types of speech insincere threats of legal evictions and sincere threats of illegal evictions.appellants further contend that,by limiting its scope to these two categories of speech,section a c only penalizes speech which is false or misleading.we simply can not accept appellants strained interpretation of this regulation.
section a c expressly applies both to threats to recover possession of a rental unit and requests that a tenant move from a rental unit.appellants not only ignore this broad language,they also read into this section sincerity limitations that simply are not there.they move even further from solid ground by arguing that these illusory sincerity limitations somehow ensure that only false and misleading speech will be suppressed by this regulation.by definition,a threat refers to some future action and the absence of a present intent to immediately act on that threat does not render it either false or inherently misleading.by the same token,the sole fact that a landlord does not presently intend to force a tenant to vacate a unit obviously does not render that landlord request that he or she do so either false or misleading.
again,a few examples help illustrate our point.a landlord who requests that a tenant move out but also expressly acknowledges that the tenant has a legal right to stay has not made a false or misleading statement.however,if that landlord does not have the present intent to evict the tenant,he or she has violated section a c and is subject to criminal prosecution.furthermore,a landlord threat that he or she will evict a tenant if or when a proper ground for eviction arises is neither false nor misleading.however,a landlord who makes such a threat violates the express language of section a c and is subject to criminal prosecution because he or she has threatened eviction without having the present intent to evict.
thus,we reject appellants contention that the speech regulated under section a c is not protected by the constitution for two reasons.first,even if the commercial speech doctrine applies to communications between a landlord or his agent and a tenant,section a c necessarily regulates both commercial and noncommercial speech.second,this provision also regulates speech which is neither false nor inherently misleading.therefore,contrary to appellants position in this court,section a c suppresses speech which is protected by the first amendment.
the suppression of protected speech has not been justified 
the trial court found that t he harm that the city seeks to redress with this statute can not justify the infringement on the right of free speech guaranteed by the first amendment and by article of the california constitution.appellants ignore this finding because,as already noted,their limited defense of section a c is premised on the erroneous notion that the speech subject to this provision is not constitutionally protected at all.thus they do not even attempt to justify the impingement on free speech rights.on this record,we agree with the trial court that the suppression of constitutionally protected speech can not be justified.
we focus our analysis on the remaining prongs of the central hudson test applicable to commercial speech because,if section a c can not satisfy this test,it necessarily fails under a strict scrutiny analysis.the second prong of the central hudson test requires that the government assert an interest that is substantial.central hudson,supra,at.to satisfy the final two prongs of central hudson,the challenged regulation must directly advance the asserted substantial interest and must be no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.ibid.
the record before us contains very little evidence relating to any of these considerations.the only evidence appellants offered in the trial court was a declaration by assistant district attorney brian bringardner and a transcript of a public hearing conducted by a committee of the san francisco board of supervisors prior to the adoption of the daly amendments.
bringardner is responsible for prosecuting illegal rent increase and illegal eviction cases that rise to the level of a criminal offense.in his declaration,bringardner stated i t came to my attention that some landlords were removing tenants from rent controlled units by buying out threatening the tenants of such units in order to create vacancies that would allow them to raise the rent to market level.this included threatening tenants that if they did not voluntarily vacate their rent controlled units,either with or without a financial payment by the landlord,they would be subjected to either an owner or ellis act eviction.in some cases,tenants were further threatened that this would damage their credit record and make it very difficult for them to find replacement housing.it quickly became apparent that tenants without counsel were especially vulnerable to this sort of pressure,even where the facts and the law were on their side 
at the public hearing,bringardner spoke about the purpose and need for the various amendments but he did not specifically address section a c or the problem of threats by landlords against their tenants.further,in his concluding comment,bringardner stated i do think it can be said enough that it is a very small minority of landlords who are doing this sort of thing but the effect they are having on their tenants is terrible.most of these people end up having to leave san francisco and we are losing some of our most talented people,some of whom have lived in this city for years and the face of this city is changing because of this.so,thank you very much.
despite the meager record below,we have no trouble finding a substantial governmental interest in this case.appellants have a substantial interest in preventing san francisco landlords from evading regulation under the rent ordinance.however,the lack of evidence relating to the specific practice which allegedly implicates this important governmental interest certainly impacts the remainder of our central hudson analysis.
the third step of central hudson concerns the relationship between the harm that underlies the state interest and the means identified by the state to advance that interest.it requires that the speech restriction directly and materially advanc e the asserted governmental interest.this burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture rather,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.citations.lorillard tobacco reilly,d lorillard tobacco see also gerawan ii,supra,cal th at,d.
here,appellants have not satisfied this third prong of the central hudson test.notably absent from this record are any concrete data,studies or examples of the harms the daly amendments were designed to address.indeed,appellants have neglected to produce evidence of a single actual case in which a tenant vacated his or her unit pursuant to an owner or ellis act bluff.this lack of evidence is particularly disconcerting in light of bringardner concession that it is a very small number of landlords who are doing this sort of thing.further,appellants have also failed to produce any evidence that the harm they seek to redress,landlord bluffing,would be materially alleviated by imposing the speech restrictions at issue here.
assuming appellants could fill this evidentiary void with respect to the third prong of central hudson,we would nevertheless find that section a c is invalid.the last step of the central hudson analysis compliments the third step,asking whether the speech restriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve the interests that support it.citation.lorillard tobacco,supra,at.although this is not a least restrictive means test,there must be a reasonable fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.citations.see also gerawan ii,supra,cal th at,d.as our analysis thus far demonstrates,section a c is more extensive than necessary and it is not narrowly tailored to serve the governmental interest in this case.if coerced voluntary eviction is the perceived harm,that is the conduct that should be penalized.instead,this statute criminalizes a wide range of expressive first amendment activity regardless whether that activity causes the harm that appellants seek to prevent or,indeed,any harm at all.
in summary,even if analyzed as a commercial speech regulation,section a c suppresses speech which is neither false nor inherently misleading.appellants have not demonstrated that this provision directly advances a substantial governmental interest or that it is no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.therefore,we affirm the trial court finding that section a c in unconstitutional.
section a g 
background and appellants contentions 
section a g divides into two distinct parts.first,this provision imposes restrictions on a tenant ability to waive his or her rights under the rent ordinance by providing that such a waiver is void as contrary to public policy unless the tenant is represented by independent counsel and the waiver is approved by a court or a retired judge sitting as a mediator or arbitrator.we refer to this aspect of section a g as the waiver restrictions.second,section a g expressly criminalizes conduct by making it unlawful for a landlord,a landlord attorney,legal representative,or an individual acting on behalf of a landlord to seek or obtain from a tenant either an agreement not to cooperate with a government or agency investigation or proceeding conducted pursuant to the rent ordinance or a waiver of rights under the rent ordinance,e xcept as provided in this subsection.we refer to this aspect of the provision as the conduct restrictions.
focusing on the waiver restrictions imposed by this provision,the trial court found that section a g violates a tenant fundamental right to.unquestionably,these restrictions preclude a tenant from representing him or herself during the process pursuant to which a waiver of tenant rights can lawfully be accomplished.further,these restrictions require that such a waiver be both conceived and approved in the context of an adversarial legal proceeding.thus,these restrictions preclude the tenant from representing himself in a civil proceeding pursuant to which he may lawfully waive any or apparently all his rights under the rent ordinance.appellants contend that this aspect of the provision is unremarkable because tenants have no right to in this context 
to support their position,appellants rely on cases construing the sixth amendment right to personally present a defense.see,in re barnett cal th,d,people williams th,d.these cases construe the sixth amendment as pertaining strictly to the basic rights that an accused enjoys in defending against a criminal prosecution and does not extend beyond the point of conviction.in re barnett,supra,cal th at,d.appellants authority is relevant to the extent it supports the general proposition that there is no sixth amendment right to in a civil proceeding.people williams,supra,th at,d.however,appellants truncated analysis does not resolve the issue presented here.
appellants claim that section a g is valid because it does n
