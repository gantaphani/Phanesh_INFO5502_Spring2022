douglas emmett realty fund and douglas,emmett company appeal from the judgment entered after a jury found them liable for violating provisions of two santa monica rent control ordinances prohibiting notices to quit and eviction actions except on certain enumerated grounds and making unlawful demands for excessive rent.the plaintiff in that action,robert bisno,from a pretrial order summarily adjudicating that the affirmative defense of reliance on advice of counsel barred his malicious prosecution cause of action,and from the denial of his jnov motion on his breach of contract claim.we hold that there were no triable issues of fact to defeat reliance on the defense and,therefore,affirm the summary adjudication order.finding the litigation privilege,subd.b applies,we reverse the judgment outright as to the rent control claims based on the eviction notice and unlawful detainer action.we also reverse the judgment as to the rent control claim for excessive rent demands but permit retrial because whether the litigation privilege applies in the present setting is a question of fact and the jury was not instructed to consider that defense.we affirm the order denying bisno motion for partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict on his breach of contract cause of action.we also reverse the order awarding bisno attorney fees,allowing the parties to renew their respective motions upon resolution of the remaining claim.
facts and procedural history 
robert bisno rented an apartment at the shores,a santa monica,in.although bisno had been married for several years to jeanette bisno,she was not mentioned in the lease at all,and he was the only person to sign the lease and be designated as a tenant.in,the shores was bought by douglas emmett realty fund,a california limited partnership,which designated douglas,emmett company to serve as the property manager under the lease,bisno had a tenancy at a monthly rate of.the lease said no one but bisno could occupy the unit without first obtaining the owner consent,and that bisno could not assign or sublet the unit.paragraph of the lease provided that the monthly rent would increase to if bisno assigned or sublet the unit,whether with or without the owner consent.
when bisno rented the unit in,he and jeanette lived in berkeley,where they owned a home and where bisno worked as the ceo of a real estate development company bisno would sometimes stay at the unit when he was in los angeles on business,and jeanette would sometimes stay there too.the bisnos moved to southern california in and bought a parcel of land in beverly hills in an area known as beverly park,where they began to build a house.while construction was underway,they lived in a rented house also in beverly hills.jeanette filed for divorce in december,and bisno moved into the shores in early.he stayed there until the fall of,when he moved into the home in beverly park.in april,jeanette moved into the shores,intending to make bisno unit her primary residence.in or about that time,bisno asked emmett to make jeanette a tenant on the lease.
we digress to describe some unpleasantries between bisno and emmett leading up to jeanette move to the shores.back in,bisno and emmett had a dispute over the number of parking spaces bisno was allowed.although the lease allotted him only one space,bisno was using two.when emmett tried to enforce the lease and take back one of the spaces,bisno contended the prior owner of the shores had agreed to give him two spots.the prior owner eventually confirmed this,and emmett let bisno keep both spaces.in june,jeanette and the bisnos son were initially denied entrance to bisno unit when they asked to move in some items.the shores personnel did not know who jeanette was and asked her for identification.she produced a driver license,but,because she was not listed in the shores directory as either a tenant,occupant,or permitted visitor,they insisted on confirming her identity with bisno.although bisno secretary confirmed jeanette identity,bisno was not available,and the shores personnel insisted on seeing a marriage certificate before they would open the unit for jeanette.she was eventually allowed in,and was soon after added to bisno guest list for entry 
on february,bisno wrote emmett to give notice that his rent on the unit would be paid monthly by automatic electronic transfer to emmett bank.bisno also wrote that a lthough the unit is my wife residence,my payment of the rent is pursuant to an agreement between us.this is a private matter and i am not interested in publicity.by separate letter that same day,bisno wrote to jay hotch,the shores property manager,about a meeting they had planned.bisno said,as you probably surmised,based upon my request to do certain improvements to the unit,my wife is looking to make the unit her residence.
on march,emmett,represented by attorney don sherwood,served the bisnos with a notice of intent to file a petition seeking to raise the monthly rent from the rent controlled rate of around to the market rate of more than.under section of the santa monica rent control charter amendment section,such a increase was allowed if the tenant did not occupy the rental unit,based on a determination that the unit was not his usual residence of return.the petition was filed on april,and a hearing officer of the santa monica rent control board board conducted a hearing on the petition on may,the hearing officer issued her decision on august.because bisno had not resided in the unit since and was now living in his home in beverly hills,the hearing officer found that bisno unit at the shores was not his residence of return.because jeanette was not a named tenant and had never made the shores her home,she had a limited right of occupancy but was not a tenant or a subtenant.finally,because jeanette had seldom lived in the unit by the time of the hearing,it was not her usual residence of return.based on those findings,the hearing officer found that the shores was entitled to increase the monthly rent on bisno unit to the market rate.
bisno appealed that decision.the board staff recommended that it be affirmed in a report prepared for the board october meeting.the appeal was denied and,at a hearing,the hearing officer set the fair market monthly rent of bisno unit at.bisno sued the board,contending that section was invalid because the board exceeded its authority when it enacted that measure.bisno was granted a preliminary injunction enjoining any attempt to implement the rent increase.bisno ultimately lost at trial,and the judgment for the board was affirmed by this court in bisno santa monica rent control bd.th,d bisno i.
during argument at the board hearing,bisno lawyer contended that a rent increase under section was not proper,but acknowledged that one might be authorized by the rental housing act,et after the trial court in bisno i preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the rent increase approved by the board,trial attorney sherwood spoke with emmett general counsel,william kamer,to discuss the point made by bisno lawyer concerning the applicability of the act,section,subdivision d.after discussing the issue with kamer and researching the act,sherwood concluded that the act provided emmett another means of raising the rent on bisno unit.he had emmett portfolio manager,michael boge,prepare a notice of rent increase.after certain changes recommended by sherwood were made to that draft,emmett served the notice on bisno.citing to section,subdivision d,the notice said that the rent increase was authorized under the act because jeanette was a lawful sublessee,and demanded a new monthly rent of.
sherwood recommended that a lawyer with true expertise be hired to review the notice that had been served,confirm there was a valid legal basis for the rent increase under,and then take care of an unlawful detainer action against bisno should one become necessary.acting on this recommendation,emmett hired lawyer craig mordoh,an unlawful detainer specialist with experience.although there is a dispute as to which documents mordoh reviewed,it is undisputed that he reviewed the lease and the board hearing officer report,and advised emmett that it had a valid claim under the act.when bisno refused to pay the increased rent,mordoh prepared and served a notice to pay rent or quit in february.when that was ignored,mordoh prepared,filed,and served an unlawful detainer action against the bisnos.
in june,counsel for bisno wrote mordoh to point out several perceived flaws in the unlawful detainer action according to the lawyer,did not apply because jeanette was an original occupant of the unit,had lived there for some time with emmett knowledge and consent,and was not a subtenant.the letter threatened a malicious prosecution action and a claim for attorney fees for defending the unlawful detainer action.mordoh read bisno lease again and realized he had missed paragraph,which set the rent in case of a sublease or assignment at per month,an amount that would control under the act.although mordoh believed a rent increase in the reduced amount would be valid,he recommended that emmett dismiss the unlawful detainer action for several reasons the costs of proceeding with that action the likelihood of an appeal by bisno if he lost the cost of attorney fees if bisno prevailed and the termination of the preliminary injunction in bisno i,which reinstated the rent increase approved by the board.based on this advice,emmett dismissed the unlawful detainer action.
bisno then sued emmett for malicious prosecution for having brought the unlawful detainer action.bisno alleged that the unlawful detainer action was just the last step in a campaign of harassment by emmett designed to drive him from his apartment.his complaint also included causes of action under two provisions of santa monica rent control laws charter amendment section section,which establishes a cause of action for wrongful eviction,including actual and punitive damages,against landlords who serve notices to quit or bring unlawful detainer actions unless the tenant has failed to pay the rent or otherwise committed some material breach of the lease and charter amendment section section,which establishes a cause of action based on improper demands for unwarranted and excessive rent,including actual damages,attorney fees,and a civil penalty of treble damages if the landlord acted willfully and maliciously.bisno also stated a cause of action for breach of contract,based on allegations that emmett demanded an unauthorized rent increase and refused to accept the lawful rent of brought the unwarranted unlawful detainer action and breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment.
before bisno action against emmett went to trial,the court made two critical rulings.first,it denied emmett motion for leave to amend its answer to assert the litigation privilege as an affirmative defense.second,it denied emmett motion for summary judgment,but granted its motion for summary adjudication of the malicious prosecution claim because it found that emmett established as a matter of law the affirmative defense of good faith reliance on the advice of counsel.the remaining causes of action went to the jury,which found that emmett had violated sections and,and did so maliciously and in bad faith,and awarded bisno more than in punitive damages.the jury also found that emmett had not breached its contract with bisno.after various posttrial motions,the judgment awarded bisno damages of under section,and under.following additional posttrial motions,the trial court reduced the punitive damage award to.bisno was awarded costs of more than and attorney fees of more than.
on appeal,emmett contends the trial court erred by denying its motion to amend its answer and assert the litigation privilege as a defense the litigation privilege bars both causes of action under the rent control laws and as the prevailing party on the contract cause of action,it was emmett who was entitled to attorney fees,not bisno bisno has,contending the trial court erred by granting summary adjudication of his malicious prosecution claim,and the jury determination that emmett did not breach the lease was in error.
discussion 
summary adjudication was properly granted on the malicious prosecution of review 
summary judgment or adjudication of a single cause of action is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.in reviewing an order granting summary adjudication,we must assume the role of the trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion.in doing so,we must strictly scrutinize the moving party papers.the declarations of the party opposing summary adjudication,however,are liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact.all doubts as to whether any material,triable issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the opposing party.while the appellate court must review a summary adjudication motion by the same standards as the trial court,it must independently determine as a matter of law the construction and effect of the facts presented.barber marina sailing,th,d.
a defendant moving for summary adjudication meets its burden of showing that there is no merit to a cause of action if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subds.o,p.if the defendant does so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action or defense.in doing so,the plaintiff can not rely on the mere allegations or denial of her pleadings,but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists code civ,subd.p.a triable issue of material fact exists if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.fn.omitted.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.

overview of malicious prosecution principles 
to prevail on a claim for malicious prosecution,the plaintiff must show the prior action was begun with malice and without probable cause at the defendant direction and was terminated in the plaintiff favor.the probable cause element is objective,not subjective,with the trial court required to determine whether,on the basis of the facts known to defendant,it was legally tenable to bring the prior action.the benchmark for legal tenability is whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim was tenable.sheldon appel albert oliker cal d.good faith reliance on the advice of counsel,after truthful disclosure of all the relevant facts,is a complete defense to a malicious prosecution claim.bertero national general cal d.
emmett summary adjudication motion was based on declarations from hotch,boge,and kamer,who stated they relied solely on the advice of lawyers sherwood and mordoh before seeking a rent increase under,then serving a notice to quit and unlawful detainer action after bisno refused to pay the higher rent.their accounts were backed up by lawyers sherwood and mordoh,who stated they had reviewed the entire bisno tenant file and the lease before giving their advice,but had failed to notice the paragraph limit of for rent in case the unit was sublet.
bisno contends the unlawful detainer action constituted malicious prosecution because there was no probable cause to seek a increase of when paragraph of the lease limited any such increase to.he contends there was no probable cause to seek a increase in any amount because jeanette was an original tenant,the rent control hearing officer found she was not a subtenant,as asserted in emmett demand,and because of emmett acceptance of rent after she moved in.in connection with the defense,bisno contends emmett did not provide mordoh with the tenant file,which included documents that cast doubts on the validity of a rent increase.he also contends boge and hotch were aware of paragraph,but failed to point it out to either sherwood or mordoh.therefore,according to bisno,there were triable issues of fact concerning whether emmett fulfilled its duty to make full disclosure to counsel for purposes of the defense.
there were no triable fact issues concerning emmett disclosures 
duty to disclose is limited to factual information 
although emmett sought to increase bisno rent to the fair market rate of,paragraph of his lease contained a provision limiting a rent increase to in the case of a lawful assignment or sublease.both sherwood and mordoh overlooked that provision when reviewing bisno lease and instead advised emmett that it had a valid claim for the larger rent increase.because hotch and boge were generally aware that such provisions existed in the leases of tenants at the shores,bisno contends this was a fact they were obligated to point out to their lawyers.their failure to do so,he contends,did not fulfill their duty of full disclosure as required by the defense.
we disagree.sherwood and mordoh were asked to advise whether a rent increase was permitted.appellate cases on the failure to disclose concern a client failure to disclose known facts,such as statements,events,or circumstances.see weber leuschner d.malicious prosecution based on criminal charge for issuing a check with insufficient funds defendant failed to tell his lawyer that the party who wrote the check called to stay he had stopped payment because of a dispute over goods purchased with that check klotz alexander d.failure to tell city attorney of personal feud with the malicious prosecution plaintiff when describing facts of case to city attorney in order to procure the plaintiff arrest schubkegel gordino d,landlord who had tenant arrested for defrauding an innkeeper failed to tell his lawyer about a conversation with the tenant that made it appear the landlord had waived his security lien on certain items the tenant took upon vacating.
the cases all speak of the failure to disclose facts none has held that a client who provides a copy of a contract to counsel,when seeking legal advice about his rights under the contract,is obligated to point out any particular provision or a legal theory to the lawyer as a prerequisite to the defense clients engage counsel to tell them what a contract means and what provisions are significant to their rights and obligations.adopting bisno argument would effectively undermine the defense whenever a client was aware of a contract provision that turned out to weaken his case.finally,as a necessary corollary to this,the rule of full disclosure is satisfied when the lawyer has obtained the undisclosed information from some other source.singleton singleton d,foster banks.because sherwood and mordoh had the lease,they had the information bisno contends emmett failed to disclose 
bisno also contends emmett failed to ask mordoh for legal advice about the applicability of two other provisions.the first concerned the testimony of boge and hotch at the rent control hearing that they believed jeanette was a lawful occupant of bisno unit.based on that belief,bisno contends mordoh should have been asked to advise whether a rent increase was permitted under section,subdivision d,which states that an increase is not permitted where one occupant moves out,but another occupant remains.the second concerned emmett acceptance of rent from bisno after learning jeanette intended to occupy the unit as her primary residence.based on that,bisno contends mordoh should have been asked whether the rent increase was permitted under section,subdivision d,which states that no waiver of a prohibition against subletting occurs unless a landlord accepts rent from a party to the lease after receiving written notice of the sublease from that party.
as above,if these alleged facts existed and were in fact disclosed to counsel as part of a request to give advice on the applicability of a particular statute,the client has fulfilled its duty of disclosure under the defense and has no obligation to ask the lawyer to consider any particular provisions of the statute we next consider bisno argument that emmett did not make the required factual disclosures.
emmett disclosed all relevant facts 
bisno contends triable issues of fact exist concerning the defense because there is evidence that emmett did not provide mordoh with its bisno tenant file,which included several documents that he believes cast doubt on the validity of any rent increase.the five documents described in bisno appellate brief are a key release signed by jeanette that only tenants could sign a notice of key release sent by the shores to the bisnos a letter from the shores to the bisnos concerning fluids leaking from one of their cars and,two february letters from bisno notifying emmett that jeanette intended to occupy the unit as her primary residence.
mordoh testified at his deposition that he reviewed the tenant file,and stated in a declaration that he got the tenant file from either boge or hotch.hotch said in a declaration that he gave mordoh a copy of the file.sherwood testified that he reviewed the contents of the file with mordoh.however,bisno contends triable issues of fact exist concerning whether emmett ever provided mordoh with the tenant file.he bases this on the following boge testified that he was emmett with mordoh mordoh never asked to see the tenant file and boge never provided it the only documents he provided mordoh were the lease and the hearing officer report from the rent control hearing hotch acted under his instructions and,to his knowledge,nobody other than he communicated with mordoh about the matter.
on the last point,however,boge in fact testified that hotch was instructed to forward to boge any documents relating to the bisno matter.that statement does not preclude hotch from having sent a copy of the file to mordoh without boge knowledge.just because boge was unaware that hotch had provided mordoh with a copy does not raise a triable issue of fact that hotch had not done so.
bisno also points to the absence of any entries on mordoh time sheet showing that he reviewed the file.mordoh explained,however,that because emmett was a new client,he did not bill for the time spent reviewing the file,or for certain other matters.
finally,bisno relies on a november letter from sherwood to bisno lawyer,in which sherwood refused to stipulate to letting bisno file a first amended complaint that would have let bisno reinstate his malicious prosecution claim.in discussing the merits of emmett claim,sherwood wrote that before seeking a rent increase under that act,emmett consulted with mordoh.they did not recite the facts of bisno provided him with the decision of the hearing examiner from the rent control hearing.based on his review of the hearing examiner decision,mordoh concluded that the subject rent increase was authorized under costa hawkins,and that the underlying unlawful detainer action should be filed if bisno failed to pay the increased rent.from this bisno asserts an inference can be drawn that mordoh saw no other documents before offering his legal advice.we disagree.at his deposition,sherwood explained that he meant that the facts which underlay the rent increase and subsequent unlawful detainer action were the same as those recited in the hearing officer board decision.when viewed in context,we conclude that sherwood statement does not raise an inference that the hearing officer report was the only document mordoh reviewed 
however,even if the only document reviewed by mordoh apart from the lease was the hearing officer report,we alternatively conclude that the information contained in that report satisfied emmett duty of disclosure for purposes of the defense.the report sets forth in great detail the testimony of the parties and their witnesses,including a description of various documents that were introduced in evidence.among these were the january,key release that listed both bisno and jeanette as authorizing permanent access for an esperanza shearer,along with boge statement that only a tenant could authorize such a release and boge testimony acknowledging the august,letter about leaking auto fluids that was addressed to both bisno and jeanette.as for the two february letters from bisno concerning jeanette intention to move in,the report cites hotch testimony that during a february meeting,bisno might have mentioned that his wife was planning to move in.therefore,of the five documents mentioned by bisno in his appellate brief,the only one apparently not referenced during the rent control hearing was the march key release for delivery of a dishwasher that was signed by only jeanette.not only was this cumulative to the evidentiary effect of the other key release,the report mentions another letter that was helpful to bisno april letter from him to emmett stating that he and jeanette sought permission to do certain work in their unit.when combined with the detailed recitation of each party evidentiary contentions and legal arguments,we hold that the report by itself disclosed all the relevant facts to mordoh.
if that were not enough,there is also the undisputed deposition testimony of sherwood,where he recounts in some detail the many facts and documents he discussed with mordoh during a meeting on january,before the notice to pay rent or quit was served.sherwood said he asked mordoh if he had reviewed the rent increase notice and whether there was a valid basis for increasing bisno rent under.mordoh said the notice looked appropriate to him and that he believed there was a valid basis for seeking a rent increase under.sherwood then recounted the background of all that had previously gone on in the relationship between douglas emmett and bisno.sherwood told mordoh he was in effect walking him through and summarizing the tenant file.
sherwood told mordoh that bisno lived in northern california when he leased the unit,that bisno did so because he planned to spend more time in southern california,and that even though the bisnos were married at that time,jeanette was not a tenant on the lease.sherwood summarized the various disputes between the bisnos and emmett,including the parking spaces,the time jeanette was denied access to the unit,and the incident where jeanette placed a parking sticker on the forehead of an employee at the shores.sherwood told mordoh about the specifics of the rent control hearing,the evidence presented by the bisnos,and the comment by bisno lawyer about the possible applicability of a rent increase.sherwood told mordoh about bisno february letters trying to add jeanette to the lease and the hearing officer findings.sherwood then asked mordoh whether emmett had a legitimate basis to proceed under.mordoh said it did,but warned that bisno would probably not pay the increased rent in february,which would require a notice to pay rent or quit,then an unlawful detainer action.
it is clear from this that mordoh was apprised of all the relevant facts in emmett possession.it is also clear that sherwood was acting on behalf of emmett when he disclosed those facts to mordoh.when combined with the material contained in the board hearing officer report,there are no triable issues of fact whether full disclosure to mordoh took place 
b.the litigation privilege bars most of the two rent control verdicts 
the rent control cause of action charter amendments and procedural background 
the jury found for bisno on his claims under sections wrongful eviction and unlawful rent demands of the santa monica rent control laws.emmett argues both causes of action are barred by the litigation privilege,and we should reverse.
section provides that landlords shall not take actions to terminate a tenancy,including,but not limited to,making a demand for possession of a rental unit,threatening to terminate a tenancy,serving any notice to quit or other eviction notice or bringing any action to recover possession of a controlled rental unit unless certain conditions exist.these include the tenant failure to pay rent,material breach of the lease,creation of a nuisance,holding over after the lease term expires,or refusal to vacate when the landlords seeks in good faith to have the unit occupied by himself or certain family members.the landlord failure to comply with section may be raised as an affirmative defense in an unlawful detainer action,and also gives rise to a cause of action for wrongful eviction,including actual and punitive damages.
section provides that any landlord who demands,accepts,receives,or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum lawful rent,in violation of various city ordinances,rules,or regulations pertaining to rent control,shall be liable in a civil action to the tenant from whom such payments are demanded the tenant is entitled to actual damages based on the amount of the improper demand or receipt of excess rent,attorney fees and costs,and a civil penalty of treble damages if the landlord acted willfully or with oppression,fraud or malice.
emmett sought leave to amend its answer to assert as an affirmative defense the litigation privilege.codified at section,subdivision b,the litigation privilege provides that a publication or broadcast made as part of a judicial proceeding is privileged.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d.the privilege is absolute and applies to all publications no matter how maliciously they were made.ibid.the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings,by litigants or other participants authorized by law,to achieve the objects of the litigation,and that has some connection or logical relation to the action.the principal purpose of the litigation privilege is to give litigants and witnesses the utmost access to the courts without fear of being harassed by derivative tort actions.ibid.it applies to all tort causes of action except malicious prosecution.id.at,d.
trial court orders on motions to amend pleadings are reviewed for abuse of discretion,but a ruling based on an error of law is an abuse of discretion.we exercise independent review to determine whether legal error occurred.in re charlisse cal th,d.
action apartment 
in action apartment,our supreme court considered whether the litigation privilege applied to another santa monica related ordinance.at issue was santa monica municipal code section,subdivision i,which prohibits landlords from maliciously serving a notice of eviction or bringing any action to recover possession of a rental unit without a reasonable factual or legal basis.the disputed provision prohibits landlords from taking any action to terminate any tenancy including service of any notice to quit or other eviction notice or bring any action to recover possession of a rental housing unit based upon facts which the landlord has no reasonable cause to believe to be true or upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to the landlord.ibid.
because an unlawful detainer action falls squarely within the litigation privilege,the court held the ordinance was preempted by section,subdivision b to the extent it applied to the maintenance of such an action.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d.while a notice of eviction may well have been sufficiently connected to an unlawful detainer action to qualify for the litigation privilege,the court held this was not necessarily so.instead,it presented a factual question as to whether the prelitigation communication relates to litigation that was contemplated in good faith and was under serious consideration.action apartment thus holds that the litigation privilege may preempt some but not all local ordinances regulating bad faith eviction notices or other prelitigation conduct.id.at,d.
we now apply action apartment to the present dispute.bisno testified at trial that his charter amendment causes of action were based on the rent increase demand,the notice to quit,and the unlawful detainer action.we analyze each separately and in reverse order.
emmett contends that the reasoning and rationale of action apartment applies to the unlawful detainer here.bisno counters that action apartment does not apply here because the jury found all the elements necessary for malicious prosecution except for favorable termination,but insists favorable termination is undisputed because emmett dismissed the unlawful detainer action.he bases this contention on the action apartment court rejection of the city argument that the bad faith eviction ordinance mirrored a malicious prosecution claim.this appeared to be the city last and least persuasive argument.in rejecting it,the court noted that the ordinance did not include the element of a favorable termination that is found in malicious prosecution claims.accordingly,the court declined to address the issue whether a similar ordinance that included that element would be excepted from the litigation privilege.the court also noted that a tenant who has successfully defended an eviction action may always sue for malicious prosecution.action apartment,supra,cal th at,d.
we reject bisno reliance on this dicta,if for no other reason than that although santa monica municipal code section,subdivision i and malicious prosecution claims share some common elements,sections and include none of the elements of a malicious prosecution cause of action.they require only that a landlord have brought an unlawful detainer action when the tenant had not committed certain proscribed acts or the landlord demanded excess rent.bisno reliance on the jury punitive damages verdict and the award of treble damages for the excessive rent demand claim is also misplaced,because those findings do not necessarily correlate to those required for the elements of malicious prosecution.we find the reasoning of action apartment compelling and conclude that the section claim was barred by the litigation privilege to the extent it was based on emmett unlawful detainer action.
bisno next argues that the supreme court in action apartment expressly held the litigation privilege does not necessarily apply to prelitigation conduct,which,he contends,includes section eviction notices and section excess rent demands.bisno contends those communications do not qualify for the privilege if the landlord was not in good faith contemplating litigation when he served the eviction notice or made the unlawful rent demand,leaving a factual question for the trier of fact.
at least in the present case,we disagree with bisno as to the notice to quit,which was a prerequisite to filing the unlawful detainer action.code civ,subds.and.faced with this same issue,the court in feldman park lane associates th,d feldman,held that the test was whether the notice was issued when a concomitant unlawful detainer action was contemplated in good faith.that determination does not call into question the merits of the action.instead,the focus is on whether the unlawful detainer action was seriously contemplated when the notice was served,without regard to its merits or the landlord motive.because the notice in feldman was quickly followed up with an unlawful detainer action,and because there was no claim that the notice was made as some hollow threat,the feldman court held that there was no dispute over the connection between the notice and the later unlawful detainer action.id.at,d.the same is true here.emmett notice to quit was quickly followed by the unlawful detainer action and bisno does not contend that the notice was a hollow threat.accordingly,no reasonable jury could conclude that the notice was not sufficiently connected to the unlawful detainer action.as a result,the litigation privilege applies to that aspect of bisno section cause of action as well,and we reverse the judgment on that claim in its entirety.
the same is not necessarily true of bisno section cause of action based on emmett notice of a demand for increased rent.although emmett contends it qualifies as a communication made in anticipation of litigation,it is far more attenuated from the ultimate unlawful detainer action than was the penultimate notice to quit.
first,the notice requirement applies whenever a landlord demands a rent increase in the amount sought by emmett,regardless of the reason,unless a different notification period is required by statute.because does not provide a notice period,the notice was required,subds.a,b,c.second,although the rent increase was sought pursuant to a statute,at heart allows landlords to avoid local rent control ordinances and impose whatever rent they think the market will bear either at the start of a new tenancy or when an existing tenant sublets his unit.the essence of such an arrangement is by far more contractual than statutory,as exemplified by express preference for any contractually rental rate in the event of a sublease,subd.d.theoretically any demand for increased rent could be viewed as a step toward litigation,because it is possible a tenant might refuse to comply,leading the landlord to sue.to apply the litigation privilege to such demands without regard to the factual setting would stretch the privilege to its breaking point.the central issue here is factual,namely,whether litigation was contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration at the time the notice was sent.that issue has never been litigated,so it must be litigated on remand either through trial or by an appropriate form of pretrial disposition.
finally,bisno contends that if action apartment applies to sections and,it should not be applied retroactively.he rests this contention on the principle that an existing rule of law was changed,but the decisions he cites concern landlord notices to vacate so a family member may move in,and do not implicate the litigation privilege.as emmett points out,the litigation privilege has been in force for many years,and the general rule favors retroactive application of judicial decisions.newman emerson radio cal d.we find no bar to applying action apartment here.
given the trial court legal error and the effect it had on the outcome of this action,we believe the trial court abused its discretion in denying emmett motion for leave to amend.bisno contends the order can be affirmed because emmett was not diligent in bringing the motion.he supports this by pointing out that the motion was brought months after the complaint was filed,after discovery was nearly over,and a trial date had been set.that is not enough.the motion was brought six months before the original trial date,and nearly a year before trial took place.discovery was still ongoing,the proposed amendment raised primarily a legal issue,and bisno does not contend that he was prevented from conducting discovery on any factual issues related to the defense.finally,there is nothing in the record that suggests the trial court denied the amendment because it was untimely.
based on the foregoing,that part of the judgment dealing with a claim un
