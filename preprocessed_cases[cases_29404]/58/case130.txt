mustang marketing,mustang brought this suit against chevron products company chevron alleging a violation of the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa,et,with respect to a gas station the service station that chevron had leased from macerich and then franchised to mustang.mustang alleges that chevron failed to comply with a provision of the pmpa requiring chevron to assign to mustang any option it possessed for an extension of the underlying lease after the underlying lease had expired.additionally,mustang alleges that chevron violated the pmpa by entering into a subsequent lease with macerich after ending mustang franchise through expiration of the original underlying lease and lock mustang out of the deal.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of chevron on all counts.mustang brings this appeal on the questions of whether chevron relying upon pmpa c can refuse to assign mustang the option to extend the underlying lease whether chevron may end its franchise relationship with mustang based upon expiration of its underlying lease with macerich and subsequently negotiate a new underlying lease with macerich and locking mustang out of the deal whether,if any of these allegations are true,any exemplary damages may be awarded to mustang whether the proposal sent by chevron to mustang in april constitutes a breach of contract in california and whether this case,if remanded,should be reassigned to a different district judge 
background 
on april,chevron predecessor in interest,standard oil company of california,entered into the underlying lease ground lease for the service station for a term expiring may,with two options to extend with macerich predecessor in interest.chevron then took over the lease and exercised the and options extending its tenancy through may.meanwhile,macerich succeeded to the lessor interest under the underlying lease.throughout the entire term of the underlying lease,chevron subleased the premises to independent service station operators licensed to sell motor fuel.
the underlying lease granted chevron,as lessee,the following right for extending its tenancy 
lessee,while in possession,shall have the prior right to lease the whole or any part of the leased premises or any larger parcel which includes the leased premises,if lessor receives from a third party an acceptable bona fide offer,or if lessor offers,to lease such property for a term commencing on or after the expiration of the term hereof or any extension thereof 
taking language from section itself,therefore,mustang refers to this right as the prior right to lease.chevron says that this section merely gave chevron the right to match an offer for a new underlying lease received by macerich during chevron tenancy that macerich wanted to accept.
in december,mustang purchased the previous franchisee equipment,goodwill,and pmpa franchise rights.although aware that the underlying lease expired on may,mustang principal,robert lintz lintz,correctly predicted that chevron would be very interested in extending its underlying tenancy however,even if chevron elected to depart,lintz assumed mustang would be to obtain its own direct lease from macerich.
approximately one year before the underlying lease expired,chevron evaluated the service station.chevron concluded that the service station location was attractive but that the service station itself particularly the service bays no longer met chevron image requirements.based on this conclusion,chevron decided that it would attempt to keep its brand at the site,but only if the service station could be demolished and rebuilt with modern improvements.
chevron says that its evaluation meant that the service station could no longer be operated as a site.chevron states that the significant costs of constructing a new station estimated at mandated that the service station be converted either to a site or a site depending on who financed the improvements.however,there was uncertainty as to the outcome since everything depended on macerich approval of a new lease.
on april,mustang franchise agreements were renewed through may,
in march,chevron property specialist jeffery cole cole wrote to mary paquin at macerich stating that chevron clearly prefers to obtain a lease for the service station property upon expiration of chevron current underlying lease.meanwhile,chevron retail account manager julie humphreys humphreys and her supervisor,scott lystad,approached lintz with an offer to buy mustang service station interests for.mustang did not wish to sell especially at the price chevron offered.lintz proposed a price of,but only on the condition that chevron agree to sell to mustang chevron interest in two other service stations.
humphreys wrote to lintz on may,setting forth chevron proposal to pay.in the preamble to the letter was the following statement 
this letter sets forth only a proposal for your consideration.neither you nor chevron will be bound or have any obligations with respect to this proposal unless and until the following conditions have been satisfied.
the sale would be subject to four conditions chevron ability to secure extended tenancy from macerich beyond may,chevron ability to obtain permits to remodel the facility approval by chevron management and the parties execution of an agreement for mutual termination of dealer lease,substantially in a form purportedly attached to the may letter.
humphreys letter also did not mention the two service stations lintz desired to purchase from chevron.lintz therefore handwrote those additional terms on humphreys letter,signed in chevron signature block accepted and agreed to,and returned the letter to humphreys.humphreys telephoned lintz to explain that she could not add language to chevron letter,then wrote void due to bob putting conditions on her file copy.
at around the same time chevron and mustang attempted to negotiate a new lease with macerich.given the significant investment required to rebuild the service station,chevron says that both it and mustang insisted that macerich agree to an initial lease term of at least twenty years.however,macerich refused to accept such a lengthy term and insisted on a term of five years according to chevron.chevron also states that the rent that macerich was seeking was unacceptable.
chevron made a second written offer to mustang for on june.mustang still did not wish to sell.on february,chevron employees cole,humphreys and michael,told lintz in a meeting at chevron offices that if mustang was not willing to sell its service station interests to chevron,then chevron would not extend its underlying lease.lintz protested chevron negotiating tactics and insisted the business was worth more than.
apparently all the parties were also aware that macerich wanted to convert the property to a restaurant as soon as chevron underlying lease expired.
chevron then to lintz its february,written notice of of the franchise relationship notice,relying solely upon expiration of chevron underlying lease on may.mustang claims that chevron never offered to assign to mustang the prior right to lease as required by c b of the pmpa.both orally and in letters dated february,march,and june,lintz insisted that the pmpa required chevron assign to mustang its prior right to lease,which chevron refused to do.with the notice now pending,on march,chevron offered to pay mustang for its service station interests.
in letters dated march,april,and april,chevron told lintz that chevron would not renew its underlying lease with macerich unless and until chevron had reached a mutually satisfactory agreement for the purchase of mustang interests.on april,chevron offered mustang.on april,chevron offered.
unknown to lintz,macerich was finding that chevron intent to exercise the prior right to lease was dissuading all other prospective tenants from offering to lease the service station property.in fact,aside from offers by mustang and chevron,macerich received no other offers.
during march through may,chevron and macerich exchanged written lease proposals.in each proposal,chevron requested an initial base term of only two years,to be followed by multiple options exercisable in chevron discretion.macerich mark strain strain testified that such short initial base terms were generally unacceptable to macerich,as were multiple options to extend.for its part,chevron states that macerich made unreasonable offers with a lease term of only five years.nonetheless,paquin was optimistic macerich would eventually reach agreement with chevron,and she attached no importance to doing so prior to may.
on may,chevron cole reportedly went to macerich offices to meet personally with strain and paquin.cole testified the meeting was very contentious,and he left believing macerich did not want chevron as a tenant.neither cole nor anyone else at chevron pursued negotiations with macerich between may and.at the same time,some negotiations between macerich and mustang did take place which proved unproductive.
mustang states that paquin contradicted cole account of this meeting in several material respects.paquin testified that the meeting was not the least bit contentious.according to paquin,negotiations were proceeding normally.in,paquin unexpectedly required a medical leave of absence.
advised lintz in early may,that chevron had discontinued its negotiations with macerich.mustang was free to negotiate its own lease he said,though cautioned lintz against paying macerich too much for rent.unknown to lintz,chevron attorney,paula bailey,wrote to macerich on may,insisting that chevron receive notice of all offers made to lease the property.cole testified that chevron fully intended to assert the prior right to lease against offers made to or by mustang.
chevron represented in the district court that by early may,it had given up hope of obtaining a new lease from macerich.chevron then reportedly wrote off its service station assets,weeks before its underlying lease was to expire,and began the process of pulling permits to demolish its improvements.however,on may,humphreys frankly told lintz that chevron was not pursuing any hard negotiations with macerich because mustang had not yet agreed to sell its service station interests.
chevron april,offer for remained outstanding.at humphreys urging,lintz reluctantly signed the letter on may,thus forming the letter agreement.chevron states that by the time mustang agreed to this offer,negotiations for a new lease between chevron and macerich had been broken off so this offer was never submitted to chevron management for consideration because the conditions were not satisfied.
throughout june and july,chevron took no action to actually remove its service station improvements.no other tenant ever took possession.when mustang inquired about purchasing chevron improvements in june,chevron disavowed any duty to sell,whether or not mustang successfully obtained its own direct lease for the property.for its part,chevron states that the prior right to lease was not relevant since it expired with the ground lease.
the next month,chevron began to change the terms in its conditions for the new underlying lease.learning of chevron progress,lintz asked on july,to confirm their arrangement under the letter agreement,while he also offered not to compete against chevron for the macerich lease.
by letter dated july,richard loyd at chevron confirmed all of the essential terms of chevron new lease with macerich.on august,finally responded to lintz in writing,confirming that chevron had reached a tentative agreement on a new lease with macerich,and saying that the april,letter was merely a proposal.
chevron signed a new lease for the service station premises on may,and reopened the service station as a facility on may.
chevron also paid macerich as a lease inducement fee for environmental liabilities.however,chevron has admitted that the payment was for back rent to june.macerich accounting records corroborated this fact.on february,chevron obtained city of santa ana approvals to renovate the service station and to build a new convenience store.
for its part,chevron claims that in late june,macerich dramatically altered its negotiating position because macerich was now prepared to accept a long term rent at a rate much closer to chevron figures.chevron then says that without telling chevron or mustang about its change in position,macerich invited chevron to renew its efforts to negotiate a new lease while simultaneously negotiating with mustang.macerich then selected chevron.chevron then states that it took nine months to finalize the deal and finally,on may,a new ground lease was executed.
as of june,no renovations had been made to mustang former service station.chevron now operates the facility exclusively for its own account.judgment was first entered on july.on chevron motion,the original judgment was vacated as incomplete and an amended judgment was entered august.this appeal followed.

chevron option of the prior right to lease and pmpa c b 
mustang claims that it was never offered the prior right to lease option by chevron as was required by the pmpa.chevron claims that it did in fact make the offer to mustang and that regardless,the offer was not required since the option expired with the termination of the underlying lease with macerich.
a franchisor invoking c as grounds for or termination must offer to assign to its franchisee any option to extend the underlying lease which the franchisor holds.the offer to assign is a condition to the very validity of the notice.c b.
we have observed that a s remedial legislation,the pmpa must be given a liberal construction consistent with its goal of protecting franchisees.hilo,at citing humboldt oil exxon,cir.prompted by reports of unfair and coercive practices by major oil companies,congress provided protections where franchisees were most vulnerable,against the actual or threatened loss of their businesses.as such,the overriding purpose of title i of the pmpa is to protect the franchisee reasonable expectation of continuing the franchise relationship.unocal kaabipour,cir.
with this general principle of the pmpa serving as the background,statements by representative wyden explain the purposes of c b as follows 
another problem arises in situations where the service station operators are not parties to the lease agreements for the properties where their stations are located.some oil companies are taking advantage of this,and,by refusing to renew the lease for the property,are forcing dealers to be evicted.
second,addresses situations where the franchisor leases the service station property from a third party and the station operator is not a party to the lease.in these circumstances,the station operator typically has no right to extend the lease or to purchase the property from the landlord the franchisor has the sole right to exercise any options to renew the lease or buy the service station.as a result,franchisors can in effect terminate their franchisees and put the station operators out of business simply by failing to exercise these options.
to protect dealers against terminations in these situations,franchisors will now be required to give their franchisees the opportunity to assume the underlying leases for the station properties when those leases expire.oil companies,which are typically the parties to the lease agreements,will now be required to offer to assign to the service stati
