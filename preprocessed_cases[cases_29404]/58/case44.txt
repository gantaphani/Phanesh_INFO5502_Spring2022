a chapter sought to assign its shopping center lease in contravention of a provision that limits use of the premises to the sale of auto parts.the bankruptcy and district courts approved the assignment,and the lessor and owner of the shopping center appeals.we are asked to resolve the conflict between f,which generally allows a debtor to assign its lease notwithstanding a provision restricting assignment,and b c,which specifically requires a in a shopping center to assign its lease subject to any provision restricting use of the premises.we hold that b c,the more specific provision,controls in this case.as a result,we reverse and remand.
trak auto corporation trak auto is a retailer of auto parts and accessories that once operated stores in virginia,eight other states,and the district of columbia.on july,in the eastern district of virginia,trak auto filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code and continued in business as debtor in possession.as part of its effort to reorganize,trak auto obtained court approval to close its stores in four states,illinois,indiana,michigan,and wisconsin.thereafter,trak auto sought to assume and assign certain of its leases of retail space where stores had been closed.one of these leases the west town lease or the lease is at west town center,a shopping center in chicago.trak auto lessor and the owner of the shopping center is west town center llc west town,the appellant the west town lease contains explicit use restrictions.section l limits permitted uses to the s ale at retail of automobile parts and accessories and such other items as are customarily sold by tenant at its other trak auto stores.in section trak auto covenants to use the leased premises only as a trak auto store and for the uses provided in section l.
trak auto engaged a real estate firm to advertise the availability of the west town lease and to solicit bids.of the bids received,none came from an auto parts retailer.the high bidder was a e stores,a e,an apparel merchandiser that offered to buy out the lease.if a e obtains the lease,it will open a pay half store on the premises,selling brand name family apparel at discount prices.
in a motion filed in the bankruptcy court,trak auto sought an order authorizing it to assume the west town lease and to assign it to a west town,trak auto lessor,objected on two grounds.first,west town argued that the proposed assignment would breach the lease provision limiting use to the sale of auto parts and accessories.according to west town,this use provision was enforceable under b c.west town did not rely on the lease restriction that said the premises could be used only as a trak auto store.second,west town argued that the assignment would disrupt its shopping center tenant mix in violation of b d.trak auto responded that the use restrictions in the lease were unenforceable provisions under f and that an assignment to a e would not,as a matter of fact,disrupt the tenant mix.
the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing and made the following factual findings,which we accept.the west town shopping center is in an urban area chicago where only percent of the population own cars.the shopping center is surrounded by competing shopping areas not owned by west town.the tenants in west town center include clothing stores,food vendors,a,a laundromat,a travel agency,a bank,a cash advance or small loan agency,an adult entertainment outlet,and a public library branch.trak auto was the shopping center only auto parts retailer,but there are seven auto parts retailers within three miles of the center.after announcing its factual findings,the bankruptcy court issued its conclusions.first,the court concluded that the lease use restrictions amounted to provisions that were prohibited by f of the bankruptcy code.second,the court concluded that west town did not present sufficient evidence to support a finding that assignment of the lease to a e would disrupt the tenant mix at west town center.based on these conclusions,the bankruptcy court entered an order granting trak auto motion to assume the west town lease and,in turn,to assign it to a 
west town filed a notice of appeal to the district court,and the bankruptcy court stayed its order pending appeal.the district court affirmed,and west town then appealed to our court.we have also granted a stay.on october,three weeks before oral argument,west town filed a motion to dismiss its own appeal as moot,arguing that its lease to trak auto had expired by its own terms on september.we deferred a ruling on the motion,which we take up now.
west town moves to dismiss its appeal as moot,arguing that trak auto no longer has any lease to assign.the facts relevant to west town motion are undisputed.trak auto lease from west town ran through september,but automatically extended for another sixty months if trak auto was not in material default.after trak auto filed for bankruptcy in july,it made rent payments to west town for several months,see d,but stopped making these payments after december.on march,west town filed a motion requesting the bankruptcy court to order trak auto to pay administrative rent due under d.the court determined that west town had a valid administrative claim for rent,but the court declined to make a specific order about payment timing,deferring that issue until a decision was made on whether trak auto could assign the lease.
the bankruptcy court later entered an order allowing trak auto to assign the lease to a e the order provided that west town would be paid the administrative rent from proceeds of the assignment.this meant that west town would not be paid the rent until the assignment was concluded.the assignment was put on hold by stays pending appeal issued by the bankruptcy court and this court at the request of west town.furthermore,west town did not object to or appeal the part of the bankruptcy court order that deferred trak auto time for payment of the rent.in light of all of this,west town surely understood two things first,that appeal of any decision allowing the assignment would take some time and second,that the term of the lease would automatically extend on september,if an appeal was then pending because trak auto would not yet be obligated to deliver the rent payment according to the unchallenged provision in the bankruptcy court order.in these circumstances,we conclude that west town has waived any argument in this appeal that the lease has expired because trak auto has not paid accrued rent.see in re lane,cir in re arnold,cir.west town motion to dismiss the appeal is accordingly denied.
today substantive issue requires us to deal with the conflict between two provisions in of the bankruptcy code dealing with the assignment of a lease by a debtor or trustee.section b c specifically requires a at a shopping center to assign its store lease subject to any provision restricting the use of the premises.on the other hand,f generally allows a debtor to assign its lease notwithstanding a provision restricting assignment.in this case,the bankruptcy court permitted trak auto to assign its shopping center lease to the highest bidder,refusing to enforce the restriction that required the premises to be used for the retail sale of auto parts and accessories.the district court affirmed.the legal issue is dispositive of this appeal,and we like the district court review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo.see butler david shaw,cir.we hold that b c controls in this case.this means that the bankruptcy court erred in permitting trak auto to assign its lease to an apparel merchandiser that would not honor the use restriction.our analysis follows.
section a allows a chapter debtor to assume an unexpired lease.a.the debtor may,in turn,assign the lease if the assignee provides adequate assurance of future performance.id.f b.when a in a shopping center seeks to assign its lease,the adequate assurance of future performance must include specific assurances that are spelled out in the code.most important to this case,there must be adequate assurance that assignment of a shopping center lease is subject to all the provisions thereof,including but
