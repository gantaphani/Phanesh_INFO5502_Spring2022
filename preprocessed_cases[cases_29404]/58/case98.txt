background 
in,ceridian built a office tower tower in bloomington,minnesota.an underground parking garage resides beneath the tower,and an open plaza forms the parking garage roof on the tower east and west sides.
immediately after construction,ceridian experienced problems with the glass curtain wall forming the tower exterior.the glass curtain wall leaked during rainstorms,and the glass forming the curtain wall began to crack and fog.ceridian tried to remedy these problems,including caulking the glass and gaskets forming the curtain wall and injecting foam into the gaps at the glass curtain wall base.in,ceridian settled with the glass curtain wall designer,the glass manufacturer,and the general contractor for the problems associated with the glass curtain wall.
in,to raise capital,ceridian entered into a transaction with united trust fund,llc utf for the tower and the land on which the tower sat collectively,property.after utf purchased the property,a utf affiliate and ceridian entered into the lease.the lease provided for a lease term.the lease also included repair and maintenance,surrender,and net lease clauses.later that year,utf sold the property to reiss and sons reiss.reiss sold the tower to fortune,and fortune became the lessor under the lease.as part of the transaction,ceridian submitted an estoppel letter stating it was not in default under the lease.
approximately one month before the lease expired,fortune requested that ceridian repair the tower glass curtain wall and plaza deck and also replace the tower elevator system.ceridian refused to make the repairs,contending the property was in the same condition as it was at the beginning of the lease,except for ordinary wear.after the lease expired,fortune sued ceridian,alleging,inter alia,ceridian breached the lease repair and maintenance and surrender clauses,committed and statutory waste of the tower and,in,fraudulently misrepresented the tower condition.
on for summary judgment,the district court concluded on the contract claim that the repair and maintenance and surrender clauses only required ceridian to maintain the property in the same condition as it was in,except for ordinary wear,and fortune failed to present evidence that ceridian breached its repair and maintenance obligations.on the waste claims,the district court concluded fortune failed to establish ceridian owed a duty to maintain the property other than the duty imposed by the lease,and ceridian fulfilled its repair and maintenance obligations under the lease.finding material issues of fact remained on fortune fraudulent misrepresentation claim,the district court set the fraud claim for trial.
at trial,fortune attempted to present evidence of the glass curtain wall condition from to.the district court excluded fortune evidence,finding the evidence was irrelevant and would confuse the jury about the issues it would decide.the jury returned a verdict for ceridian,finding ceridian did not falsely represent past or present material facts to fortune.fortune appeals,contending the lease imposes an obligation upon ceridian to make the requested repairs,the district court erred in dismissing its waste claim,and the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of the glass curtain wall condition from to.

section a of the lease,the repair and maintenance clause,governs ceridian repair obligations 
ceridian acknowledges that it has received the property in good order and repair.ceridian,at its own expense,will maintain all parts of the property in good repair and condition,except for ordinary wear and tear,and will take all action and will make all structural and nonstructural,foreseen and unforeseen and ordinary and extraordinary repairs which may be required to keep all parts of the property in good repair and condition including,but not limited to,glass,fixtures and equipment,and all paving in as good a condition as they existed at the beginning of the lease term,ordinary wear and tear excepted.fortune shall not be required to maintain,repair or rebuild all or any part of the property.
emphasis added.according to its plain,unambiguous language,section a does not impose a duty on ceridian to make repairs attributable to ordinary wear.the clauses ordinary wear and tear excepted and except for ordinary wear and tear describe and limit the general repair duty imposed by section a.
the minnesota supreme court in state mutual life assurance oliver iron mining,concluded similar language relieved a lessee from making repairs attributable to ordinary wear.the lease in state mutual life contained the following language 
t he lessees do hereby further covenant that they will keep said building,both inside and outside,and appurtenances,in good and substantial repair and in as good condition as said premises shall be on the completion of said building,ordinary wear and tear alone excepted w hile the lessor is not to be considered hereby bound to make any repairs or improvements at its own expense which the lessees are required to make it shall make such repairs as the lessees are not hereby required to make,it being understood that the lessees shall keep the building in good repair not including,however,ordinary wear and tear.
id.at emphasis added.after parts wore out in the building elevator,the lessor sued the lessee for the cost of the repairs.construing the above language,the minnesota supreme court concluded t he lessees were not required to make repairs necessitated by ordinary wear.id.at.the court reasoned that the lessor assumed the obligation to make the repairs and replacements which became necessary by reason of ordinary wear incidental to the lessees proper use of the elevators.id.at.similarly,section a second sentence does not obligate ceridian to make repairs caused by ordinary wear,and,therefore,fortune assumed this obligation.
section a first sentence does not alter our construction,although fortune contends this first sentence is controlling.the first sentence acknowledges ceridian received the property in good repair.in the context used,good order and repair must mean the property condition at the beginning of the lease.as noted above,the second sentence requires ceridian to maintain the property in as good a condition as it existe
