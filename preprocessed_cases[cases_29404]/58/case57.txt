appellant texas,texas one appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees general star indemnity company general star and fireman fund insurance company fireman fund on its claims for insurance coverage relating to damage to the oak meadow apartment complex caused by water leaking from the plumbing system.on appeal,texas one argues that the district court erred in holding that general star is not liable for access costs because the damage caused by water leaks are not covered water damage under the general star policy and the plumbing leaks under each building are,as a matter of law,separate occurrences for purposes of determining deductibles under the fireman fund excess coverage policy.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
background 
texas one,at all times relevant to this suit,owned the oak meadow apartments complex oak meadow in san antonio,texas.oak meadow,built in,consists of thirty residential buildings,three office buildings,and other facilities.each residential building contains at least four separate apartments.general star insured oak meadow pursuant to a commercial property policy effective from october,to october.fireman fund provided excess coverage pursuant to a commercial excess property policy effective from october,to october.around october,texas one discovered that several of the buildings had suffered foundation movement and above ground damage.the foundation movement and damage resulted from moisture changes in the soil beneath the foundations.although the cause of these moisture changes remains disputed,tests revealed that nineteen buildings in the complex had experienced plumbing leaks.texas one admits that it does not know when any of the leaks began.the parties agree that the leaks existed continuously and repeatedly for more than days prior to discovery of the damage.the parties also stipulated that the leaks under any particular building foundation at the property only affected the foundation of that particular building and did not contribute to the movement of any other building foundation at the property nor did they cause any other plumbing leaks.
in november,texas one filed suit in texas state court against general star and fireman fund for breach of contract arising out of the insurers refusal to pay on texas one claims.general star and fireman fund removed the case to federal court and subsequently moved for summary judgment.

discussion 
general star 
texas one argues that general star was obliged to pay for costs incurred by texas one in accessing the plumbing system for repair.texas one raises two arguments in support of its claim that the language of the general star policy requires payment of texas one access costs even though payment for the damage caused by the leaks is barred under an exclusionary clause and that general star admitted that it was obliged to pay for the access costs because it made a partial payment on texas one access cost claims.texas one arguments are without merit.this court recently addressed texas one arguments in a case interpreting policy language identical to the language at issue in this case and held that access costs were not recoverable.see accident ins.oaks,cir.
fireman fund 
texas one also contends that the district court erred in determining that the damage to each of the nineteen buildings is a separate occurrence under the fireman fund excess coverage policy for which texas one must pay nineteen deductibles.texas one argues that although each building was damaged by different leaks,there is still only one occurrence for purposes of the fireman fund policy.texas one argument rests upon its contention that all of the leaks can be traced back to defects in the materials and installation of the underground plumbing system.the fireman fund policy,in pertinent part,provides 
this company shall be liable in respect of each and every loss occurrence,irrespective of the number and kinds of risks involved,for of the ultimate net loss excess over and above ultimate net loss to the insured in each and every loss occurrence.
the term loss occurrence means the total loss by perils insured against arising out of a single event.when the term applies to loss or losses from the perils of tornado,cyclone,hurricane,windstorm,hail,flood,earthquake,volcanic eruption,riots,riots attending a strike,civil commotion,and vandalism and malicious mischief,a single event means all losses whenever occurring which directly results from such perils during a continuous period of hours.
the policy provides for a maximum payout of per occurrence.
the damage to the nineteen buildings resulted in more than net loss to texas one.however,the damage to any one building did not exceed.thus,we are called upon to interpret the term occurrence and determine whether the damage to the nineteen buildings constitutes one occurrence resulting in one deductible or nineteen occurrences resulting in nineteen deductibles.
neither party contends that occurrence is ambiguous in this contract nor that our determination of the number of occurrences hinges on resolution of a factual dispute.thus,the interpretation of occurrence as used in the contract is a question of law.general accident ins,cir per curiam.under texas law,the proper focus in interpreting occurrence is on the events that cause the injuries and give rise to the insured liability,rather than on the number of injurious effects.id.at quoting butt grocery union fire ins,cir.
in understanding how to apply this test,we are guided by a prior decision applying texas law to a policy containing language similar to that found in the fireman fund policy.goose creek consol.cont l cas,dist,no writ dealt with two fires occurring at two different schools at different locations and at different times.the insurance policy in goose creek stated that a loss occurrence referred to the total loss by perils insured against arising out of a single event.id.at.this is the same definition found in the fireman fund policy.hoping to pay only one deductible,the school district sought to prove that the damages arose from the work of a single arsonist on a single morning.the court held that regardless of the presence or absence of a single arsonist,there were two occurrences as a matter of law due to the fact that two fires distinguishable in space and time occurred and that one did not cause the other.id.at.similarly,texas one property experienced multiple leaks distinguishable in space and time 
goose creek instructs us not to look to any overarching cause,but rather to focus on the event that gave rise to fireman fund liability under the policy.for example,in goose creek the court did not look to the existence of a single arsonist,but rather to the number of fires that caused the buildings to burn.thus,in determining the number of occurrences under the fireman fund policy,we should not focus on the alleged overarching cause,but rather on the specific event that caused the loss.in this case the losses arose when the pipes broke,not when they were installed.the parties have stipulated that a different leak was responsible for the damage to each building,and as such we agree with the district court that each leak constitutes a separate occurrence as a matter of law.
to point to the installation of the pipes as the single event which gave rise to the damage to the nineteen buildings proves too much.of course it is true that had the plumbing system never been installed the leaks would not have occurred.in this sense,it is true that the leaks which independently damaged the nineteen buildings arose from the same event.however,to look this far back would render any damage to the complex occurring at any time related to the plumbing as arising from the same event.
since no one building suffered a net loss,texas one has not met the per occurrence threshold to recover under the fireman fund policy.therefore,the district court was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of fireman fund.
conclusion 
upon review of the record,we find that summary judgment in favor of general star was proper in light of this court decision in unity.furthermore,summary judgment in favor of fireman fund was proper because the net loss attributable to each occurrence was less than the deductible under the policy.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
texas one has raised a fact question as to whether the damage to its buildings constituted one or nineteen loss occurrences under the fireman fund excess coverage policy.i disagree with the majority reliance on caselaw involving liability policies and with the result it reaches by employing this approach.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from the portion of judge jones excellent and careful opinion that deals with fireman fund.
texas law takes a slightly different approach for determining the number of occurrences under policies designed to protect the insured from liability to others liability policies from the approach it takes for determining the number of loss occurrences under policies designed to protect the insured from damage or loss to property owned by the insured loss policies.for loss policies,texas courts apply a cause test,which determines the number of loss occurrences based on the number of events that caused the loss or losses at issue.goose creek consol.indep.sch.dist.continental cas,dist,no writ.for liability policies,the number of occurrences is determined by finding the number of events or incidents for which the insured is liable.maurice pincoffs paul fire marine ins,cir.this approach has been described as the event test 
the approach to be employed is determined by the type of injury at issue.the injury insured against under a loss policy is direct physical damage to or loss of property,and the number of occurrences is determined not by the number of losses or types of damage,but by the number of events that caused loss damage.liability policies operate only when the insured has a civil liability to one or more nonparties.the injury is the liability,and therefore courts look for the number of events that cause liability.
the event test may be viewed as a specialized application of the cause test.the court still looks to the cause of the injury,but the injury insured against is liability,not property damage or theft.whenever an insured party is liable to other parties for civil damages,there often will be contemporaneous and related injuries to the insured and to other parties.the test crafted by pincoffs focuses the inquiry on the relevant injury and prevents the court from being distracted by these other injuries.
consideration of the facts of pincoffs elucidates this distinction.pincoffs,the insured,bought a large amount of contaminated birdseed and sold it to eight dealers,pincoffs,at,who then sold it to numerous bird owners,killing many pets.the aggrieved bird owners made claims against their respective dealers,not against pincoffs directly.the dealers then made claims against pincoffs,which in turn sought coverage under its liability policy.id.we concluded that there had been eight occurrences,because there were eight sales that caused pincoffs liability for the type of injury protected under the policy.
because liability was the injury insured against,i f pincoffs had destroyed the seed before sale,for instance,there would be no occurrence at all for which the insured would be liable.id.at.but under a loss policy covering loss or spoilage of inventory,the destruction of the seed before sale would not have prevented the occurrence of an insurable event.the loss occurrence would have been the event that contaminated the birdseed,or,if it was already contaminated before pincoffs received it,the occurrence would have been pincoffs purchase of the seed.any subsequent sales of the birdseed would have been irrelevant to determining the number of loss occurrences.
for the above reasons,cases that determine the number of occurrences under liability policies have limited applicability when determining the number of loss occurrences under loss policies.characteristics unique to liability policies determine what losses are relevant.even under otherwise identical facts,insurance policies,depending on their purposes and definitions employed,may focus on different losses or interpret the underlying events differently 
twice recently,this court inadvertently has brought confusion to this area by citing caselaw employing both the liability policy and loss policy approaches,without noting the type of policy at issue.see butt,at interpreting a liability policy accident ins.of,cir per curiam interpreting a policy covering losses caused by employee dishonesty.neither case,however,mandates the approach taken by the majority.
in butt,at,we considered the number of occurrences under a liability policy for abuse of children by an employee of insured grocery store.though the butt majority cited cases employing both approaches,including pincoffs and goose creek,id.at,it appears to have applied a cause test.it determined that there had been two occurrences,because the immediate cause s of the two injuries were separate incidents committed on two different days.id.at.the concurring opinion also found two occurrences,but did so by focusing on the number of events,finding two occurrences because the claims against butt arose from two separate acts of abuse 
both opinions focused on the same events,but for different reasons the majority because those two events caused the injuries to the child,the concurrence because those events triggered the civil liability of the insured.because the third member of the panel joined in the judgment only,butt,at,neither opinion reasoning carries precedential weight 
considered the number of occurrences under an employee dishonesty policy where two employees had separately stolen more than each.see at.as the majority notes,in we quoted the butt majority statement that the court should look to the events that cause the injuries and give rise to the insured liability.id.at quoting butt,at.we went on,however,to cite goose creek and apply its cause test,concluding that there were two occurrences because the losses were caused by two different employees in separate and independent acts of employee dishonesty we made no attempt to determine what events gave rise to the insured liability.such an approach has never been utilized when interpreting a loss policy,by this court or any texas court.
though the majority is correct that quoted from and endorsed the event test from butt and pincoffs,this test has no applicability to the facts at issue here.butt and pincoffs held that the court should look to the events that gave rise to the liability of the insured to other parties.the insured here,texas one,has no liability to anyone.the only liability at issue is the insurer to the insured.as applied to this case,then,this test points to no events at all 
perhaps influenced by the desire to blend the event test with the relevant law as established by goose creek,the majority suggests that goose creek instructs us to focus on the event that gave rise to fireman fund liability under the policy.this looks similar to butt admonition to look to the events that give rise to the insured liability,butt,the difference being,of course,that fireman fund is the insurer defendant,not the insured plaintiff.
the majority characterization of goose creek creates a test with no useful meaning.the loss occurrence definition is designed to help the parties determine the event or events that give rise to the insurer liability.the majority holds that the number of events that cause the insurer liability determines the number of loss occurrences,creating a circular definition.
despite the instruction of and goose creek to find the cause of the loss,the majori
