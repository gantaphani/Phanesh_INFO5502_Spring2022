this case teaches the maxim of life and law from the roman philosopher publius syrus never promise more than you can perform.don cooper and robert cooper appeal from a judgment in an action for breach of contract involving their personal guaranties of payment on a commercial lease.we conclude that the guaranty agreements were continuing guaranties of performance under the lease that applied to the lease amendments.we will affirm the judgment.
background 
cooper and cook insurance services,c c,a corporation,leased premises from pleasanton plaza associates,ppa,the predecessor in interest of central building,llc.c c was frequently late in making the rent payments.
in september of,c c and ppa negotiated a lease termination agreement,a new lease for smaller premises at the same rental rate per square foot,and personal guaranty agreements by the individual principal shareholders of c c.the lease termination agreement also provided for termination of existing personal guaranty agreements.
at the time of signing the new lease,the principals of c c executed new personal guaranty agreements.the new lease and the lease termination agreement specifically referenced the personal guaranties as additional consideration for the lease.the guaranty agreements referred to the lease termination agreement and the new lease and provided that the guarantors jointly,severally,unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee up to the guaranty amount as defined below the following obligations a the faithful and prompt performance by lessee of each and every one of the terms,conditions and covenants set forth in the agreement referring to the lease termination agreement to be kept and performed by lessee b the prompt payment by lessee of all rentals and other charges payable by lessee under the new lease and the faithful and prompt performance by lessee of each and every one of the terms,conditions and covenants of the new lease to be kept and performed by lessee.the guaranty agreements provided for an aggregate limit of on the liability of the guarantors.they also provided for decreasing the amount of the guaranty by on the last day of each calendar month p rovided that lessee commences and continues to faithfully and promptly perform each and every one of the terms,conditions and covenants of the agreement and the new lease 
the term of the new lease was from september,to august.the lease stated that the minimum rent payment was due in advance on the first of every month the stated minimum rent was per month for the first months and per month for months of the term.
in june of,central building purchased the premises.antonia naranjo,central building chief accountant,testified c c first late payment was on september.from that date forward c c payments were late almost every month.don cooper,a defendant in this case and one of the guarantors,reviewed c c bank statements and cancelled checks.based on the records from through,cooper testified that no checks arrived at the landlord office by the due date 
before the lease term expired,the parties entered into a first amendment to the lease,dated august,effective september.the first amendment expressly stated that it was incorporated into and made a part of the prior lease and agreed to amend the lease to extend the term to december.the rent was stated as per month.the amendment stated that all other monetary obligations remained the same as the initial term of the lease.finally,the first amendment provided except to the extent modified herein,all terms and conditions of the lease shall remain unchanged.there was no evidence that the guaranty agreements were terminated or reduced at this time.
after expiration of the extended term c c remained on the premises from january,to march of,pursuant to the holdover provision of the lease.that provision stated if lessee should remain in possession of the leased premises after the expiration of the term and without executing a new lease,then,upon acceptance of rent by lessor,such holding over shall be construed as a tenancy from,subject to all the conditions,provisions and obligations of this lease as existed during the last month of the term hereof,so far as applicable to a tenancy.
on march,the parties executed a second amendment to the lease extending the term from april,to march.the second amendment recited that the initial term expired on or about august,the extended term expired on december,and the parties desired to extend the term of the lease.the second amendment stated that it was incorporated into and made a part of the september,lease and the first amendment dated august.the second amendment provided that except as modified,the original lease terms remained in effect.don cooper admitted that the parties intended to extend the term of the original lease.again,there was no evidence that the guaranty agreements were terminated,reduced,or even discussed.
c c never paid rent after the date of the second lease amendment.
on december,central building filed a complaint for breach of contract against the guarantors.in a first amended complaint,it added c c as a defendant.on october,apparently as a result of negotiations with central building,c c vacated the premises c c admitted that it owed central building as unpaid rent and other fees,but the guarantors denied any liability to central building.
the trial took place in december of.on january,the trial court entered judgment against c c,don cooper,ben fernandez and robert cooper,jointly and severally,in the amount of plus costs.the amount awarded appears to be the amount of rent,late fees and other charges admittedly owed by c c,plus interest.don cooper,ben fernandez and robert cooper appealed 
discussion 
defendants argue that the guaranty agreements did not extend beyond the term of the lease,or into the period of the holdover tenancy,and that they should not be held for c c admitted defaults.they also contend that they should have been given credit under the terms of the guaranty for every month that c c paid rent before the end of the month in which it was due.
after reviewing general principles of suretyship and guaranty and the terms of the governing documents,we conclude that the guaranty agreements applied to the lease as amended and that the condition that would have triggered credits under the guaranty agreements did not occur.
general principles applicable to guaranty agreements 
civil code section provides in relevant part a surety or guarantor is one who promises to answer for the debt,default,or miscarriage of another,or hypothecates property as security therefor.we independently review a lease and a guaranty agreement subject to the usual rules of contract interpretation.principal mutual life ins.vars,pave,mccord freedman th,d principal mutual life river bank america diller th,d.where the contract language is clear and explicit,its terms are interpreted without regard to extrinsic evidence.
when a guaranty agreement incorporates another contract,the two documents are read together and c onstrued fairly and reasonably as a whole according to the intention of the parties.citations.cates construction,talbot partners cal th,d.in other words,when a party undertakes to guarantee the faithful performance of another contract,the guarantor is contracting in reference to the other contract otherwise it would not know what obligation it was assuming.boys club of san fernando valley,fidelity deposit th,d.
keeping these principles and facts in mind,we address defendants arguments regarding enforceability of the guaranty agreements in this case.
enforceability of the guaranty beyond the term of the lease 
guarantor defendants argue that the personal guaranty agreements expired at the end of the term of the lease and the lease contained no provision for renewal or extension.alternatively,they contend that even if the first amendment extended the term of the lease,it did not refer to the guaranty and did not extend its term.finally,they contend that the second amendment could not have extended the guaranty because the guaranty did not survive the holdover period,which should be considered a new and distinct tenancy.central building contends that the agreement was a continuing guaranty,applicable to future transactions,which remained in effect.we agree with central building for the following reasons.
guaranty agreements may be limited or continuing.a guaranty relating to a future liability of the principal,under successive transactions,which either continue his liability or from time to time renew it after it has been satisfied,is called a continuing guaranty.a continuing guaranty is a contract pursuant to which a person agrees to be a secondary obligor for all future obligations of the principal obligor to the obligee.rest d suretyship and guaranty.
the guaranty of payment of a tenant present and future rent liability is an example of a continuing guaranty.see,office leasing guaranty of lease.the guaranty agreement in this case applied to present and future obligations under the lease,and was a continuing guaranty,as specifically stated in paragraph of the agreement.
although in general a continuing guaranty may be revoked at any time,the guaranty in this case was expressly made irrevocable and had no expiration date the guarantors waived a number of statutory defenses,including the revocation provisions of civil code section.a guarantor may validly waive rights and defenses in the guaranty contract.rest d suretyship and guaranty.in addition to waving the statutory revocation provisions,the guaranty agreements provided for termination only by an agreement in writing by the lessor and lessee to terminate the lease and release all obligations of the guarantors.
in contrast to a continuing guaranty,the example of a limited guaranty in the above referenced california continuing education of the bar publication provides,in part at the expiration of the guaranty period,the obligations of guarantor under this guaranty shall automatically terminate.the guaranty period is specifically defined as the starting and ending date of the lease.office leasing,supra.no similar limiting language is present in the guaranty agreements in this case.such language would have conflicted with the express terms of the agreements.
ignoring the lack of limitation in the guaranty,defendants argue that there is no specific language in the guaranty or the lease that makes the guaranty applicable to extensions of the lease term.they refer to principal mutual life,supra,th,d as an illustration of the language necessary to create a guaranty that expressly applies to renewals and extensions of a lease.although the main issue in principal mutual life concerned the effect of an attornment clause,that court also found that the guaranty agreement in that case provided that it continued during any renewals of the lease.id.at,d.the language quoted from the contract in that case provided that the guaranty would not be affected by modifications,alterations or extensions of the lease and that the guaranty applied to performance of the l ease as changed.id.at,d.but inclusion of the word extensions is not necessary to express an agreement that a continuing guaranty will apply to changes in the underlying agreement 
the lease in this case contains clear language allowing modification by an agreement in writing.in addition,the guaranty agreements in this case provided that it is specifically agreed and understood that the terms of the foregoing lease termination agreement and new lease may be altered,affected,modified or changed by agreement between lessor and lessee or by a course of conduct without consent or notice to guarantors and that this guaranty shall thereupon and thereafter guarantee the performance as so changed,modified,altered or assigned.the language in the relevant documents plainly makes the guaranty applicable to modifications in the lease such as extensions of the lease term.moreover,in paragraph b of the agreements,the guarantors expressly waived their statutory right under civil code section,to exoneration when the original obligation is altered 
even without the express term in the guaranty allowing modification,a modification of the underlying obligation generally does not revoke a continuing guaranty,but only modifies the guaranty in the same way that the underlying obligation is modified.rest d suretyship and guaranty.the guarantor is only discharged if the modification other than an extension of time creates a substituted contract or imposes risks on the secondary obligor fundamentally different from those imposed pursuant to the transaction prior to modification.ibid.the restatement explains that a substituted contract is a new contract that discharges or satisfies the original duty and therefore discharges the guarantor.rest d suretyship and guaranty,com.e.in this case,the only substituted contracts were the new lease and lease termination agreement.the lease termination agreement expressly terminated the prior personal guaranty agreements.this action demonstrates that the parties knew how to terminate a personal guaranty when that was their intent.
defendants rely on a number of inapplicable cases,discussed below,to argue that once the extended lease term expired and they remained on the premises as holdover tenants,the guaranty ceased to apply.they focus on the general rights of parties during a holdover period,without considering the fact that the guaranty in this case was intended to secure the ongoing obligations of the primary obligor,despite changes in the lease by agreement or a subsequent course of conduct.parties to a commercial transaction are free to structure their relationship in a different way than the general law would require.rest d suretyship and guaranty,com.a.in this case,the parties did not leave their relationship to the general law of holdover tenancies,but provided that the guaranty applied to changes in the lease made by agreement and by course of conduct 
defendants cite burroughs ben auto park,cal d,for the proposition that a holdover period is a new tenancy that does not carry over provisions of the lease.but burroughs was a tort case that did not involve a holdover tenant.the issue in burroughs was whether an express agreement to extend the tenancy on a month basis at a different rent deprived the lessor of the right of reentry to inspect for dangerous conditions.the court distinguished a lease renewal as creating a new tenancy,while an extension is the stretching or spreading out of a former term citations.id.at.regardless of the distinction,the court stated it was immaterial in that case to determine whether a new tenancy was created or an old one was extended.ibid.burroughs does not apply to this case.
defendants cite spaulding cal d,in support of the argument that the guaranty did not extend beyond the initial term of the lease,regardless of language in the holdover provision applying the terms of the lease to any holdover period.the court in spaulding found that the language of a lease implied a correlation between a purchase option and the lease term,so that the option expired at the end of the lease term,even though the tenant remained on the premises.id.at.defendants can point to no language in the lease indicating an intent to release the guarantors in the event of an extension of the lease term.to the contrary,the language of the documents in this case disclose an intent that the promise of the guarantors would continue.
union oil moesch d,cited for the proposition that a holdover is a new arrangement rather than a continuation of the lease is also inapplicable.the case involved a gasoline franchise lease that stated it would terminate automatically on a date specified in the lease.id.at.no amendment or new lease was entered into in union oil.the tenant in that case merely remained on a basis until the landlord terminated the tenancy.id.at.the issue was whether the court could apply a new statute to the tenancy without impairing a contractual right.id.at.dover mobile estates fiber form products,d.is similarly inapposite.in that case,a foreclosure sale extinguished the lease and the tenant continued on a basis.no amendment or extension of the lease was involved.
the statutory rights governing a holding over period did not result in continuatio
