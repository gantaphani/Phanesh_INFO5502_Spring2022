in this appeal,plaintiff,the santa monica rent control board the board challenges orders that granted defendants special motion to strike the board complaint,and awarded defendants attorney fees and costs.defendants are pearl street,llc,a limited liability company,rosario perry,sued as manager of pearl street,llc,and robert hackamack pearl street,perry,and hackamack,collectively,defendants 
the board filed this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief because it contends that portions of state and local rent control law have been violated by defendants in their ownership or management of a residential rental property at pearl street in the city of santa monica.rental of such property is subject to article xviii and to relevant provisions of state law 
this case concerns the board skepticism about the nature of defendants rental of two of the four rental units.specifically,the board asserts defendants created sham tenancies to enable themselves to fulfill the letter of state rent control law while avoiding the economic constraints of the spirit of such law.that law provided that when a landlord withdrew a residential unit from the rental market and then later restored that unit to the market,the rent charged for the initial tenancy upon such restoration could not be greater than it would have been if the units had not been withdrawn.however,when such initial tenancy of a restored unit was legally terminated by the landlord or the tenant,the landlord would then be free to charge the next tenant market rent for the unit.in the instant case,the board was presented with facts that raised a suspicion as to whether defendants initial rental of two units after their restoration to the rental market were legitimate tenancies or simply sham rentals for an intentionally short duration in order to permit the defendants to charge market rents upon the termination of the initial tenancies.upon learning of the suspicious rentals,the board filed this suit,alleging that defendants were not legitimately entitled to charge market rate for the rentals.
defendants filed a special motion to strike the board complaint based on their contention that the lawsuit constituted what is known as a slapp a strategic lawsuit against public participation the trial court agreed that this case is a slapp,and on that basis,granted the special motion to strike the complaint,and awarded defendants attorneys fees and costs.
our review of the record,as well as applicable law,convinces us that defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that the basis of this suit is an act taken by defendants in furtherance of their constitutional right of petition or free speech.therefore,the order striking the board complaint must be reversed,as must the order awarding defendants attorney fees and costs,as the latter order was based on defendants having prevailed on their special motion to strike.the case will be remanded for further proceedings.
background of the case 
allegations of the complaint regarding the history of the subject residential rental building 
according to the board complaint,defendant hackamack is a member manager of pearl street.he owned the subject property from may,to december,and title to the property was transferred to defendant pearl street on the latter date.
prior to such transfer of title,hackamack,on july,filed notice with the board that he intended to withdraw the property from the rental market the date of withdrawal was august.
according to such notice of withdrawal,one arlynn hackamack was the tenant in unit a.the notice identified her as the owner mother and stated that she paid no rent.a leslie boraz was identified as the tenant of unit b,with a rent of.walter and ruth schechter were identified as the tenants of unit c,with a rent of.the notice identified gayle hackamack and defendant robert hackamack as the tenants of unit d and stated that they paid no rent.on august,the tenancies of leslie boraz boraz and walter and ruth schechter schechter were terminated by eviction notices served by hackamack.
then,on september,hackamack filed a notice with the board of his intention to restore the subject property to the rental market.on that same day,he filed an application for a permit for occupancy of the subject property as residential rental property.
displaced tenants boraz and schechter sent the board copies of the notices they had served on hackamack indicating they desired to their former units.however,rather than offering the units to boraz and schechter,hackamack paid them statutory damages pursuant to government code section.
on september,the board wrote to hackamack,acknowledging his notice of intent to the withdrawn rental units,and advising him of the restrictions on how much rent he could charge for the initial tenancies of the previously withdrawn units,citing government code section.
subsection f of section of the city rent control law authorizes the board to set a maximum allowable rent for a unit.section of the government code provides that when a previously withdrawn unit is restored to the rental market,and such unit is subject to local rent control and was so subject at the time it was withdrawn from the rental market,the first rent charged for the unit upon shall be no greater than the rent that would be in effect if the unit had not been withdrawn from the rental market.when the subject property was restored to the rental market,the maximum allowable initial rent for units a and c was each.the appellate record contains copies of rental agreements for restored units a and c,showing that those units were rented on a month to month basis,commencing on november,for such maximum allowable initial rent.
on february,pearl street filed a vacancy unit registration for unit c.the registration stated that unit c was being rented for,for a tenancy commencing february.thus,the tenancy for that unit that had commenced on november,with a monthly rent of,was shown to be a tenancy.
then,on may,pearl street filed a vacancy unit registration for unit a.it stated that unit a was being rented for,for a tenancy beginning may,and that the previous tenant had vacated unit a in january.thus,the november,rental of unit a was also a tenancy.the rental agreement identified arlynn hackamack defendant hackamack mother as that tenant.
the board allegations of wrongdoing 
in its complaint,the board alleged that,contrary to the information on the vacancy unit registrations that pearl street filed for units c and a,the first rental period for unit c following its return to the rental market was actually the tenancy commencing on february,and arlynn hackamack,a former owner of the property,was not actually a legitimate tenant of unit a and she did not pay rent for the occupancy of that unit.the board also had evidence that there was no tenant at all in unit c during the november,to january,period 
the complaint contains two causes of declaratory relief and for injunctive relief.the board sought a judicial determination that the maximum allowable rent for the february,rental of unit c,and the may,rental of unit a was each.the board also sought injunctive relief on behalf of the real parties in interest tenants that had rented units a and c,specifically,that defendants be prohibited from charging those parties more than the maximum allowable rents that would have been in effect for units a and c had such units not been withdrawn from the rental market.the board alleged that the city rent control law was enacted for the public benefit and the public would be harmed if defendants were permitted to charge a rent that violated the ellis act and the board regulations.it further alleged it had been judicially enjoined from administratively changing the rent that defendants are charging for units a and 
defendants motion to strike 
the defendants responded to the board action with a special motion to strike the complaint.the defendants asserted that the board action was an attempt to punish them for following the statutory procedure for an upward adjustment of the amount of rental on the subject units.they contended that the board improperly chilled their right,and the rights of others similarly situated,to seek redress of government by means of the rent control process established by the rent control law.
the special motion to strike was heard and granted on december.an order of dismissal was signed and filed by the court on january.notice of entry of the order was served by defendants on january,
defendants moved for attorney fees and costs,pursuant to subdivision c of section.the motion was granted on february.thereafter,the board filed a timely notice of appeal from the order of dismissal and the order awarding fees and costs.
issues on appeal 
the board contends that the statute has no application to this case.it asserts that even though this suit may have been triggered by the filing of the notices of intention to units a and c at market prices after what defendants assert are legitimate initial rental periods upon restoration to the rental market,and even though the filing of such notices may be an act in furtherance of defendants right of petition or free speech,the suit is not based on the defendants act of filing the relevant documents.rather,the suit is based on the dispute between the board and the defendants as to whether defendants are entitled to charge market rents for units a and c,or whether such units are still subject to rent control restrictions for initial of units previously withdrawn from the rental market.
defendant hackamack contends the board has no cause of action for declaratory relief because there is no actual controversy between himself and the board.he further contends this suit was only filed as a means around an order issued in a prior case that prevented the board from administratively enforcing certain of its regulations.
discussion 
the nature of a section motion,and the appropriate standard of review 
a section special motion to strike involves a analysis.this includes determining first whether the plaintiff cause of action arose from an act taken by the defendant in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech,and if it did so arise,then determining whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing on the claim in the complaint.the defendant bears the burden on the first question,and the plaintiff on the second.if the court determines the cause of action did not arise from such protected activity,the motion to strike must be denied.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,gallimore state farm fire casualty ins.th,d gallimore.
when reviewing a ruling on a defendant section special motion to strike a complaint,we employ our independent judgment.gallimore,supra,th at,d.in the instant case,defendants have not met their burden of showing that the board claims arose from acts taken by defendants in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech.
this suit is based on the alleged act of charging unlawful rent,not on the act of filing documents with the board 
the instant case involves a situation quite similar to one we addressed in gallimore,supra,th,d.in both cases,the plaintiffs filed suit based on allegedly wrongful acts that came to the plaintiffs attention by way of information in documents that the defendants filed with an administrative agency defendants in both cases sought to have the complaints stricken by asserting that the causes of action against them arose from their having presented such documents to the administrative agencies.here,as in gallimore,that assertion must fail 
as noted above,section addresses itself to causes of action that arise from acts taken in furtherance of a defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.our supreme court has made it clear that a plaintiff cause of action does not necessarily arise from a defendant section protected activity merely because the plaintiff suit was filed after the defendant engaged in that activity.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,city of cotati.the statute can not be read to mean that any claim asserted in an action which arguably was filed in retaliation for the exercise of speech or petition rights falls under section,whether or not the claim is based on conduct in exercise of those rights.citations.id at,d.the supreme court said that the phrase arising from in section should not be construed as meaning in response to.ibid.in short,the statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.id.at,d.a cause of action may be triggered by protected activity without necessarily arising from such protected activity.ibid.
here,defendants claim their protected activity is the filing of paperwork,with the board,to restore units a and c to the rental market,and to assert that an initial first of such units had occurred prior to the tenancies commencing on february and may,respectively.for purposes of our analysis,we will assume that such administrative activities were undertaken by defendants in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech,as that phrase is used in section.but defendants were not sued for their conduct in exercising such constitutional rights.they were sued by the board to compel their compliance with the provisions of the rent control law.
thus,while this suit may have been triggered by defendants submission of such documents to the board,it is not true that this suit is based on the filing of such papers.rather,the suit is based on activity that preceded the filing of the papers.this suit is based on the board claim that defendants are charging an illegal rent for units a and not surprisingly,defendants have not presented any authority for the proposition that their conduct in charging illegal rent is an act in furtherance of their rights of petition or free speech.if we were to accept defendants argument,then they could preclude any judicial review of their violation of the rent control law,no matter how egregious,by simply filing a slapp motion in response to any board complaint.we are confident that the legislature intended no such application of this statute.
defendants have thus not met their threshold burden of showing that this suit is based on protected activity.therefore,the board is not required to demonstrate that it has a reasonable probability of success on its claims against defendants.gallimore,supra,th at,d.
there is a present controversy between the board and defendants 
the fundamental basis of declaratory relief is the existence of an actual,present controversy over a proper subject.citation.city of cotati,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.here,we can not agree with defendant hackamack assertion that there is no actual,present controversy between the board and defendants.as alleged in the board complaint,a controversy exists over the correct amount of rent to be charged for units a and c,namely whether the initial tenancies for units a and c that defendants assert commenced on november,were sham tenancies and therefore nonsupportive of defendants claim that the amount of rent for subsequent tenancies was the result of a valid vacancy decontrol.
this suit is not precluded by an order previously issued against the board in another action 
in june,in a case entitled cabinda llc santa monica rent control board super.los angeles county,the los angeles superior court issued an order prohibiting the board from using its own regulations that enable it to make a per se determination that a landlord attempt to raise the rent on a rent controlled unit is a sham.under one regulation,a tenancy of less than four months is prima facie evidence that the tenancy is a sham,and the landlord must therefore demonstrate that it was a valid tenancy or the landlord can not be granted a vacancy decontrol rent increase.under a second regulation,the loss of a tenant will not be deemed a voluntary vacancy if there is a single instance of harassment or intimidation.
the superior court ruled such regulations are invalid because they conflict with provisions of the costa hawkins rental housing act,et,specifically,provisions for rent increases when the previous tenant has volu
