we agree with appellant first contention and reverse.because the notice was served by a registered process server,the proof of service should not have been excluded and evidence code section applied to establish a presumption of the facts set forth therein.
factual and procedural background 
the yadegars lease.
since,the yadegars have leased a penthouse apartment in a building located at north palm drive in beverly hills property.on august,the yadegars entered into a lease agreement lease with the teitler family trust trust,then the owner of the property.the first two pages of the lease were a standard form lease drafted by the trust representative,tracy pieper pieper,and the third was a addendum drafted by fred yadegar fred.the standard form portion of the lease indicated a lease term of one year and a rental amount of per month.the addendum modified those terms,extending the lease term to three years and increasing the rent to per month in the second year and per month in the third year.
on march,pieper and fred entered into a second addendum to the lease,which modified the rent amount according to a sliding scale that corresponded to the number of months in advance rent was paid.on june,pieper and yadegar entered into a third addendum,which provided that rent would be reduced to annually in exchange for a month advance rent payment,with the yadegars receiving credit for a previous prepayment.the third addendum also provided that there would be no rent increases during the term of the lease and extended the lease term for five years to november,with one option to extend the lease for an additional five years to november.
prior litigation.
in december,enpalm,llc,and pico,llc collectively enpalm,acquired the property from the trust.alleging that it was unaware of the yadegars lease at the time it purchased the property,enpalm filed its first action against the trust and the yadegars in august.the trial court granted the trust and the yadegars motion for judgment in june.
enpalm then filed an unlawful detainer action against the yadegars,which challenged the authenticity of the lease.in a statement of decision following a bench trial,the trial court ruled that the third addendum to the lease was enforceable against enpalm.accordingly,it found that neither a nor a day notice to quit was appropriate,because the yadegars were not in violation of the lease and were operating under a lease that did not expire until.judgment was entered in june.in january,the trial court ordered enpalm to pay the yadegars in attorney fees and in costs.
in an unpublished opinion,we affirmed,rejecting enpalm argument that the term of the yadegars tenancy had been litigated in the first action and determined to be.enpalm yadegar,case no,wl,filed december.in april the trial court entered an award of attorney fees and costs on appeal,ordering enpalm to pay the yadegars in attorney fees and in costs.
while the appeal was pending,the yadegars learned that the property was in foreclosure and advised the deed of trust holders of their intention to withhold their rent as an offset to the amounts due them under the judgments.beginning in march,the yadegars stopped paying rent in order to offset the judgment amounts owing from enpalm.
wilmington park,acquired the property through foreclosure.after the yadegars informed the new owner of the offset,it neither sued the yadegars to collect rent nor took any other action to obtain rental payments from the yadegars.
the instant unlawful detainer action.
appellant purchased the property in october.on november,a registered process server served the yadegars with a notice to pay rent or quit that stated that the amount of rent due was.in response,the yadegars,via their attorney,wrote to appellant on november,stating that they had been served with a notice,outlining the history of the litigation between them and the prior owners of the property,disputing that any amount was then due and offering to pay as representing the balance of the annual rent due from october to april.
appellant filed an unlawful detainer action on november.it alleged that the yadegars entered into a lease on september,that had become a lease,and that they had agreed to pay per month in rent.it further alleged that it posted on the premises and mailed a notice to pay rent or quit on november,and that the amount of rent due at that time was.attached to the complaint were copies of the lease,including the lease addendum entered into simultaneously with the lease the second addendum signed march,the third addendum dated june,the notice to pay rent or quit and the proof of service of the notice.
the yadegars filed a verified answer,denying the allegations and asserting several affirmative defenses.
following a january,bench trial,the trial court granted the yadegars motion for judgment brought pursuant to section,reasoning that appellant had failed to establish a prima facie case as to any cause of action alleged.specifically,relying on liebovich shahrokhkhany th,d liebovich,the trial court sustained the yadegars objection to the admission of the proof of service of the notice and found that appellant failed to meet its burden to show that the notice was properly served.judgment was entered in march and this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellant contends that it met its burden to show proper service of the notice,arguing that the trial court abused its discretion by declining to admit into evidence the process server declaration and that it erroneously ruled that the yadegars admission of receipt of the notice was insufficient to establish proper service.though we can not conclude that appellant met its burden of proof to show proper service,the proof of service should have been admitted and accorded a presumption of the facts stated therein.for this reason,we must reverse the judgment and remand the matter for retrial
