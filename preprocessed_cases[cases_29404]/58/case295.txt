factual and procedural background 
the following factual background was not in dispute.in july,respondent narinder singh grewal,as lessee,entered into a written lease for a gas station located at west manchester boulevard in los angeles respondent ravinder grewal,brother of narinder,was the guarantor of payment obligations under the lease.the lease commenced july,and expired june.rent was per month the first year,per month the second year,and each year thereafter years through the monthly rent was increased by a flat over the monthly installment paid during the previous month period.
in june,narinder grewal assigned the lease to mepco oil.the written assignment of lease did not release respondents from their original obligations under the lease.
in august,appellant purchased the gas station and adjacent service bays for the business was incorporated under the name china petrol and appellant was sole shareholder,director and officer.appellant received only one rental payment for september from mepco oil.thereafter no rent was paid either by respondents or mepco oil.in october,appellant husband george beliciu discovered mepco oil was gone.the premises had been vandalized gas pumps had been removed leaving only holes in the ground filled with gasoline.computer controls for underground tanks were ripped out of the walls,wires had been cut,a computer was missing and everything inside the convenience store was missing,broken or moved.
faced with property that was vacant,damaged and unproductive,appellant and her husband occupied the property,made necessary repairs,and began to operate the business themselves.her husband became the manager and both worked at the business operating except for one brief period hours a day,seven days a week,practically sleeping in the gas station.appellant claimed no profit was made the first three months but later the business began generating a profit.appellant continued to attempt to relet or sell the property.arco and exxon oil companies,among others,were contacted to see if there was any interest but declined to lease the property.
in early and again in,appellant signed two listing agreements for the sale of the property.appellant entered into escrow to sell the property for million on october,but the sale did not close.
the lease,under article,required respondents to maintain the subject premises and every part thereof,structural and,in good order and repair,whether or not the need for repair and maintenance occurs as the result of lessee use,any prior use,the elements,or the age of the premises.
further,article provided that lessee shall indemnify and hold lessor and lessor property harmless from and against any and all claims and related expenses arising from or related to lessee use of the subject premises,or from the conduct of lessee business or from any activity or work performed or permitted by lessee or lessee employees and agents,at the subject premises or elsewhere,and lessee hereby assumes all risk of property damage and personal injury on or about the subject premises arising from any cause and hereby waives all claims in respect thereof against lessor.
appellant filed a claim for breach of the lease on october.appellant operated the business throughout the remainder of the lease period and continued to do so up to the time of trial.a first amended complaint fac was filed july,shortly after expiration of the lease term.the fac stated causes of action for breach of contract including unpaid rent plus late charges,other specified damages,and damages resulting from removal of property and fixtures from the premises.appellant also sought declaratory relief to establish respondents breach and liability for damages.respondents filed an answer asserting a general denial and setting forth five affirmative defenses failure to state a cause of action,comparative negligence,waiver,failure to mitigate and unclean hands.respondents argued appellant could not recover damages if she received more revenue from operating the premises than she would have under the lease.
at trial,respondents admitted the property had been abandoned during the lease term and that no rental payments were made over a period of several years.the only issue involved the amount of damages that was recoverable.appellant presented evidence showing unpaid rent and late fees from october to june.respondents did not dispute appellant damages of unpaid rent instead,they claimed a setoff based on mitigation pursuant to civil code section.appellant asserted that fair market rental value was the proper measure of mitigation respondents contended that mitigation could properly be based on either operational profits or increased value as demonstrated by sale valuation.
at trial,appellant presented evidence of the property fair market rental value by way of expert testimony from alan wallace,an attorney and real estate broker,and scott olson,a real estate broker specializing in the sale of gas stations.although olson was originally contacted by respondents attorney to provide a lease value for the property,he was subpoenaed by appellant and testified that he inspected the property,looked at comparable leases,obtained a property profile from a title company and based on his knowledge of the industry concluded the property had a fair market rental value of a month.respondents presented no testimony concerning rental value instead their expert,cpa jason engel,made assumptions concerning operations in order to conclude that profits generated during the period of time from approximately october to june far exceeded any lease obligation.his testimony,in large part,was critical of and responsive to the analysis prepared by appellant expert,cpa barry charles,that in turn was designed to meet respondents mitigation theory 
the trial court chose to adopt the theory suggested by respondents that appellant fully mitigated her damages by deriving a profit from the operation of her business despite respondents breach.the trial court held a ny damages by reason of the breach of the lease were far less than the profits made by appellant and her husband,from the operation of the gas station and minimarket after the breach of the lease during the lease period.as such,judgment is entered on behalf of respondents with attorney fees and costs in favor of respondents to be determined.appellant was denied relief altogether and respondents were awarded costs and legal fees in the amount of.
appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment and award of costs and attorney fees.
