travelers indemnity company of connecticut insured high mountain,llc,which managed two condominium units in utah owned by john and diane mullin.the mullins sued high mountain for renting the units for discounted rates without permission,theft of property from the condominiums owned by the mullins,failure to forward rental income,and theft of property from a rental unit that the mullins occupied.they obtained a default judgment against high mountain,which then declared bankruptcy.the bankruptcy led the mullins to bring this direct action against travelers for a declaratory judgment that they are entitled to recover from travelers the full amount owed on their judgment against high mountain.see diversity jurisdiction utah code ann.allowing direct action against insurers of bankrupt insureds.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of the mullins.
on appeal travelers argues that it is not obligated to pay the default judgment because the judgment against high mountain is for losses not covered by the travelers insurance policy and high mountain failure to provide prompt notification of the default judgment was prejudicial and bars recovery under the policy.we have jurisdiction under and reverse and remand.travelers is entitled to summary judgment with respect to three of the alleged losses.the mullins abandoned at oral argument their claim that the travelers policy covers the loss from discounted rents.the failure to forward rental income is not a loss included within the policy coverage for loss of use of tangible property.and the theft from the condominiums owned by the mullins is not covered by the policy because it predated the policy coverage period.we agree with the mullins,however,that the travelers policy covered the caused by high mountain the condominium they occupied.but travelers may still escape liability for that loss if recovery under the policy is barred by high mountain failure to give proper notice to travelers.although the district court granted the mullins summary judgment on travelers claim of inadequate notice,we think that disputed facts precluded that judgment.we therefore remand for further proceedings on the issue.
background 
the mullins owned two rental condominiums in park city,utah,which high mountain began managing for them in.from october,until october,high mountain had a general commercial liability policy with travelers.the mullins sent letters to high mountain in late and throughout complaining of the loss of in rental income because high mountain had discounted the rents for the mullins units without their permission high mountain failure to forward in rental income to the mullins the theft of property valued at from their two rental condominiums and the theft of property valued at from a rental unit where they were staying in december because their own units had been rented.
on october,the mullins filed suit against high mountain in utah federal district court,alleging that high mountain was liable for the losses of rental income and thefts.they claimed that high mountain had breached its contract by allowing the thefts to happen,discounting the rental rate,and failing to forward rents that its agents and employees had stolen at least of the mullins property that it was liable for gross negligence in permitting the various thefts to occur and that high mountain had been unjustly enriched by retaining the mullins property.
after high mountain failed to file a timely answer,default judgment was entered in the mullins favor on january,and they were awarded plus interest,attorney fees,and costs.high mountain filed an answer to the complaint four days later,on january,and filed for bankruptcy in february.
travelers had begun representing high mountain by april,but it did not file a motion for relief from judgment until november.the district court denied the motion.it noted that the mullins would be prejudiced by reopening the case because high mountain had dismissed its employees and ceased doing business,making it almost impossible to reconstruct what had happened.in addition,the court found no excuse for high mountain delay in seeking relief.it indicated,however,that it would have set aside the default judgment if high mountain had so moved when it filed its answer on january.we affirmed the denial of relief on june.
in the meantime,on november,the mullins had filed the suit before us in the united states district court for the district of utah the mullins filed a motion for summary judgment in which they argued that travelers had to pay the entire amount of the default judgment.travelers filed a motion for summary judgment as well,in which it argued that none of the losses was covered by high mountain insurance policy and that,in any event,it was freed of liability by high mountain failure to provide it with timely notice regarding the mullins suit.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the mullins and denied travelers motion.it ruled that all the mullins losses were covered by high mountain policy with travelers,and it held that travelers was not prejudiced by any failure of high mountain to provide notice because travelers accepted tender of its insured defense,effective january,in ample time to file a successful motion for relief from the default judgment.mullins travelers,ts,mem.decision order granting pls.mot.summ,opinion at.the court entered judgment in the amount of,which was the amount of the mullins judgment against high mountain,plus costs,fees,and interest.
ii.discussion 
for travelers to be liable for the default judgment,it is necessary that the mullins obtained,but w ere unable to satisfy,a judgment against high mountain and the damages arising from high mountain actions were covered by the travelers policy.speros fricke,utah.travelers does not contest that the mullins obtained a judgment against high mountain that they were unable to satisfy,so we need consider only the second issue,whether high mountain alleged wrongdoings were covered by the travelers policy.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonprevailing party.navair,ifr americas,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute over any material fact,and a party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.see.c.because the parties arguments rely on utah law,we will assume that utah law governs.see anthony hosp.dep t of health human,cir assuming that oklahoma law applies because parties assumed that it did.when the utah supreme court has not addressed specific issues raised in this appeal,we must predict how that court would rule.pompa am.family mut.ins,cir.we consider each alleged loss in turn.
unpaid and discounted rent 
the mullins argued below that the provision in the travelers policy covered high mountain liability to the mullins arising from renting their units at a discount and failing to forward rental income received by high mountain on the mullins units.at oral argument the mullins explicitly abandoned their claim with respect to the discounted rentals,so we need not address it.
to assess the mullins claim based on failure to forward rental income,we begin with the pertinent policy language.the travelers policy covers only those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.aplee.at travelers prop.cas.policy no.policy.a.the policy defines property damage as 
physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or 
loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
policy.the mullins do not claim that paragraph a provides coverage.the issue,therefore,is whether the mullins suffered a l oss of use of tangible property that was not physically injured when high mountain did not forward the rental payments to them.the mullins conten
