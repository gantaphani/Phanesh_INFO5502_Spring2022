people to end homelessness,peh,is a organization operating in woonsocket,rhode island,which seeks to expand and preserve the supply of affordable housing in rhode island.in this case are the develcos the owners,a group of four but commonly managed housing developments located in woonsocket,rhode island.the other in this case are the united states department of housing and urban development hud and its secretary.peh brought suit in federal district court challenging the expiration of housing contracts between hud and the owners.the district court granted hud motion to dismiss and then granted summary judgment for the owners.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm both rulings.
background 
this litigation revolves around the section program created by hud in.the program is governed largely by the united states housing act of,as amended,the housing act.we begin with a brief sketch of how this program works.the purpose of the program is to aid families in obtaining a decent place to live and promote economically mixed housing.id.a.under the section program,hud enters into housing assistance payment hap contracts with private property owners and determines the maximum monthly rate that the owner may charge for each dwelling.under the terms of the hap contract,the property owner receives rent directly from two sources,the tenant and hud.the tenants pay the property owner a percentage of their adjusted income,typically about percent.the difference that remains between the hap contract rent and the portion provided by the tenant is paid to the owner by hud in the form of an assistance payment or subsidy.
owners are required to provide the secretary of hud and the tenants not less than one year written notice of their intention to terminate any section hap contract id.c a.if the owner does not provide the proper notice,the owner may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants rent until such time as the owner has provided the notice and the full one year has expired.id.c b.in circumstances when the hap contracts expire,the secretary and the owner may agree to renew the contract.
should the owner choose not to renew,the housing act dictates that hud will provide rental assistance to all eligible residents,enabling them to choose the place they wish to rent,which is likely to include the dwelling unit in which they currently reside.id.c a.if tenants choose to stay in the unit in which they currently reside,hud issues those tenants enhanced vouchers.these vouchers cover the cost of any increase in rent that the owner of the dwelling may charge once the hap contract expires,while keeping the tenants portion of the rent stable at the rate.
having described the basic mechanics of the section program,we now turn to the events that prompted this appeal.the owners began providing affordable housing to families pursuant to section hap contracts in the.since that time,the owners and hud entered into numerous renewal hap contracts.the most recent hap contracts were set to expire on may.six weeks before the scheduled expiration date,the owners sent the tenants a notice informing them that the hap contracts would not be renewed.hud,in coordination with the woonsocket housing authority wha,subsequently issued enhanced vouchers to each eligible tenant 
on may,the day before the hap contracts were set to expire,peh filed a complaint,a motion for a temporary restraining order and a motion for a preliminary injunction in the district court against the owners,hud and its secretary,and the wha.peh raised two major issues in the complaint.first,peh argued that the six weeks notice given to the tenants by the owners failed to comply with the one year federal notice requirement.second,peh argued that hud was acting in violation of federal law by approving the owners decision not to renew the expiring hap contracts and by issuing enhanced vouchers to the tenants.
on june,peh moved to add the develco tenant association dta,a group of develco tenants,as a with peh.there were no objections to the motion and the complaint was amended to add dta as a.shortly thereafter,the owners agreed to a voluntary restraining order.the order prohibited the owners from evicting or raising the rent on any tenant for one year,provided that the tenant was a participant in the section program.
after the restraining order was issued,hud moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the district court,in a memorandum opinion dated march,granted the motion.the district court ruled that federal law did not obligate or even authorize hud to unilaterally extend hap contracts against the will of owners.similarly,the district court stated that there was no statutory authorization which would require the owners to continue participating in hap contracts once they expired.the district court stated that the sole remedy for failing to provide the requisite notice is that the owner is prohibited from evicting tenants or increasing their rent payments until such notice has been provided and the prescribed notice period has elapsed.
with hud dismissed from the case,the owners and wha moved for summary judgment.in a second memorandum opinion,dated october,the district court held that peh and dta lacked standing to pursue their complaint and granted the motion.the district court rejected peh request to require the owners to continue renting units under the section hap contracts.the court found that hud decision not to renew the expiring hap contracts was a permissible exercise of hud discretion,and that since the contracts had expired,it was not possible to grant the relief requested.peh filed this timely appeal challenging the district court decision to dismiss peh claims against hud and grant the owners motion for summary judgment the dta no longer exists and therefore has not joined in this appeal.no other develco tenant joined peh in this case at any time.
ii.discussion 
we address first peh challenge to the district court decision to dismiss hud from this lawsuit for failure to state a claim.see.b.we review a district court allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo.see martin applied cellular,cir.in doing so,w e accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint,draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff favor and determine whether the complaint,so read,sets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.id.at.
peh complaint alleged that hud violated a variety of federal laws,including the housing act,the administrative procedures act,et,the fair housing act,e,and the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution.fairly read,the essence of these claims is that hud illegally permitted the hap contracts to expire.peh alleges that hud should have required the owners to remain in the section program under hap contracts until the one year notice period ended pursuant to the voluntary restraining order agreed to by the owners.
this argument,however,is forestalled by the clear language of the housing act.see.when the language of a statute is plain and admits of no more than one meaning the sole function of the courts is to enforce the statute according to its terms.arnold united parcel,cir quoting caminetti united states.section c b of the housing act states in relevant part 
in the event the owner does not provide the notice required,the owner may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants rent payment until such time as the owner has provided the notice and year has elapsed.the secretary may allow the owner to renew the terminating contract for a period of time sufficient to give tenants year of advance notice under such terms and conditions as the secretary may require.
emphasis added.congress statement that the secretary may allow the owner to renew the hap contracts makes it apparent that hud was not required to renew the section hap contracts,even in the face of a notice violation.
peh also argues that hud should not have issued enhanced vouchers to the tenants once the owners had provided inadequate notice.according to peh,enhanced vouchers can only be issued when an owner provides proper notice and the one year notice period has expired.this argument
