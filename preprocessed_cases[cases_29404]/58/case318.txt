the city of chino city appeals from a judgment awarding beverly morgan morgan damages and granting her a writ of administrative mandamus based on the city council refusal to grant a rent increase to compensate morgan for a capital improvement to the streets of her mobilehome park.the judgment was based on the trial court conclusion that the council was required by due process and its own rent control ordinance to permit a rent increase sufficient to allow morgan to both recoup the cost of and earn a fair return on the capital improvement.we disagree with this legal conclusion and reverse the judgment in its entirety.due process and the city rent control ordinance merely required the council to take the capital improvement into account when determining whether morgan was earning a fair return on her investment in the park as a whole.the council properly applied that standard and rejected the requested rent increase because morgan never provided the evidence necessary to calculate her overall rate of return.
statement of facts 
rent control ordinance 
this case involves the chino mobilehome park rent control ordinance,which was intended to protect the residents of mobilehomes from unreasonable space rent increases,recognizing the need of mobilehome park owners to receive a fair return on their investment and revenue sufficient to cover any increased costs of repairs,maintenance,insurance,upkeep and additional amenities.former chino,subd.d.to that end,the ordinance created a mobile home park review committee and authorized the committee to hold public hearings on any petition concerning space rents.the committee was instructed to consider all relevant factors,including,but not limited to,increased or decreased costs to the mobilehome park owner attributable to utility rates,property taxes,insurance,advertising,governmental assessments,cost of living increases attributable to incidental services,normal repair and maintenance,capital improvements,and the upgrading and addition of amenities or services,as well as a fair rate of return on investments,subd.e.the committee was required to forthwith submit its findings and recommendations to the council,subd.b.based on those findings,the council was permitted to require the owner to reduce,increase,maintain,or modify the space rent,subd.c.
petition for a rent increase 
in may,morgan petitioned the committee for a temporary rent increase of per month for five years to recover the cost of repairing the roads and installing a petromat system to make the roads more durable in july,after several hearings,the committee adopted a resolution recommending that the council grant a temporary rent increase of per month for eight years.the resolution contained various findings of fact,including that the petromat was a capital improvement,the petromat cost approximately,the petromat is properly amortized over a period of eight years,and percent per annum would be a reasonable rate of return on the petromat.
the council was not satisfied,however,and remanded the matter to the committee with specific instructions to,among other things,d etermine morgan actual return on her investments in the park,including the interior streets and d etermine whether morgan return on her investments in the park is a fair rate of return.
as a result of the remand,the committee held further hearings and adopted a second resolution reporting its additional findings in march.among other things,the committee found that morgan had not yet received a return on the petromat investment and reiterated that percent per annum was a reasonable rate of return on the petromat.
in april,the council members challenged the committee additional findings and expressed dismay at the committee failure to answer the specific questions that were asked.regardless,the city attorney advised the council that there was no basis to deny the rent increase,and that a denial could lead to legal action resulting in an order to approve the rent increase,plus liability for the costs of the petromat,attorney fees,and damages.following that warning,a council member moved to validate the committee findings,but there was no second,so the motion died.after further discussions about the inadequacy of the committee findings,another council member moved to deny the rent increase based on lack of evidence.that motion was seconded and reportedly carried on a vote.however,at the conclusion of the meeting,it was discovered that the reported vote of was incorrect,that the vote was actually.as a result,the motion was continued for reconsideration at the next meeting in may 
at the meeting in may,a council member asked whether the council could find that the committee hearing was flawed.the city attorney responded that although he did not think the committee hearing was flawed,the council could conclude that the committee failed to answer the council questions on remand and could therefore conduct further hearings on those limited issues.the council concluded that the committee had erred in part by limiting its responses to the return on the petromat as opposed to the return on all the investments in the park.the council unanimously rejected the inadequate committee findings and scheduled a council hearing to obtain additional evidence on those issues.
at the next hearing a few weeks later,the council received additional evidence from morgan and the renters and unanimously denied the requested rent increase.among other things,the council found the ordinance does not require a of any single expenditure in the absence of a showing that a park owner fails to realize sufficient income from the space rents of the park to pay for the expenditure,realize a fair rate of return on the investment in the park and other factors.instead,the ordinance provides for an increase in space rents based upon the particular circumstances proven by the petitioner under an all inclusive formula.morgan failed to demonstrate that the expenditure for the petromat prevented morgan from receiving a fair rate of return on the park and,in fact,the income statement submitted by morgan demonstrates that morgan received revenues from space rents sufficient to pay all operating costs including the petromat installation and that morgan still realized a net operating income of of gross revenues.morgan failed to submit any evidence whatsoever on her actual return on her investment in the park.
legal action 
morgan subsequently filed a complaint.in count one,morgan sought declaratory relief,alleging that the ordinance and the law required a fair rate of return and rent increases for necessary capital improvements.in count two,morgan sought a writ of administrative mandamus,alleging that the city acted in excess of its jurisdiction and failed to proceed in a lawful manner by refusing to allow a of the costs of the petromat the city denied morgan a fair trial by engaging in ex parte communications,making promises to real parties in interest,and cooking the administrative record and the city decision was not supported by the findings.in count three,morgan alleged a violation of substantive due process under section of title of the united states code.
the trial court initially found as a general proposition of law that the city was required to permit morgan to recoup the costs of the petromat and obtain a fair rate of return on that investment.the court then determined that the city exceeded its jurisdiction by holding its own evidentiary hearing after rejecting the findings of the committee,noting that the committee was the sole fact finder under the ordinance.the court next concluded that the city abused its discretion by ignoring the committee factual findings and deciding the matter based on irrelevant issues,such as morgan rate of return on the mobilehome park as a whole.lastly,the court concluded that the city deprived morgan of a fair trial by showing bias against morgan prejudging what constitutes a capital improvement delaying the proceedings for three years by remanding the matter for additional findings and failing to maintain the committee membership and putting political pressure on the city attorney to chang
