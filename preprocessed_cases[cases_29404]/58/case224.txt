introduction 
plaintiff and appellant apartment association of los angeles county,challenges the lawfulness of an ordinance enacted by defendant and respondent city of los angeles city.the ordinance provides that if a landlord demolishes residential property subject to city rent control law,and builds new residential rental units on the same property within five years,the newly constructed units are also subject to the rent control law.the trial court sustained city demurrer to plaintiff complaint for declaratory relief without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of city.plaintiff appeals from the judgment.
this case requires us to interpret two statutory schemes.the first is the ellis act,government code section et the ellis act permits owners of property subject to rent control to evict their tenants and go out of business if they comply with certain procedural requirements.it also includes recontrol provisions designed to thwart efforts by landlords to circumvent rent control by evicting tenants under the false pretense that they intend to go out of the rental business,and then their property at market rental rates.one such provision,section,subdivision d,specifically authorizes city to enact the ordinance at issue in this case.
the second statutory scheme is the rental housing act,civil code section et,which was enacted after the ellis act.a provision of,civil code section,subdivision a,generally exempts newly constructed residential units from rent control.specifically,it provides a notwithstanding any other provision of law,an owner of residential real property may establish the initial and all subsequent rental rates for a dwelling or a unit about which any of the following is true it has a certificate of occupancy issued after february.italics added.
plaintiff argues that civil code section,subdivision a preempts city ordinance because the ordinance was enacted pursuant to section,subdivision d,which plaintiff contends was impliedly repealed by.absent an express declaration of legislative intent,however,we presume that a statute was not impliedly repealed by a subsequent statute unless there is no rational way to harmonize the two potentially conflicting statutes.as we will explain,plaintiff can not meet its burden of overcoming the presumption against the implied repeal of section,subdivision d.
section,subdivision d and civil code section,subdivision a can and should be harmonized in a manner that does not preempt city ordinance.this can be done by interpreting section,subdivision d as an exception to civil code section,subdivision a.
specifically provides that it does not affect the authority of a public entity that may otherwise exist to regulate or monitor the basis for eviction,subd.c.section,subdivision d is,in essence,a statute that allows local entities to enact ordinances that discourage landlords from evicting tenants under the false pretense that they are going out of business pursuant to the ellis act.thus,by its terms,does not override section,subdivision d,or affect city authority to enact the ordinance at issue here.
our interpretation of the statutes in question is consistent with the principle of reconciling statutes by giving a more specific provision precedence over a more general provision.civil code section,subdivision a generally governs all newly constructed rental units that were issued a certificate of occupancy after february.section,subdivision d governs a relatively small subset of such rental units,namely accommodations that replace rental units withdrawn under the ellis act.
the legislative history of the ellis act and also supports our holding.section,subdivision d was amended after the enactment of.if section,subdivision d had been repealed by,as plaintiff contends,the legislature would not have engaged in the idle act of amending a repealed statute.further,expressly repealed a host of statutes but did not do the same with respect to section,subdivision d.this indicates that the legislature did not intend to repeal the latter.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that the city ordinance promulgated pursuant to section,subdivision d was not barred or preempted by.we thus affirm the judgment in favor of city.
background 
plaintiff is a trade association representing owners of rental housing the majority of plaintiff members own property subject to the rent stabilization ordinance of the city of los angeles rso,los angeles municipal code section et.the rso places limitations on the amount of rent landlords may charge for certain residential rental units.see.
the ordinance 
as we explain,section,subdivision d,a provision of the ellis act,authorizes local governmental entities to enact certain ordinances.although the ellis act was enacted in,city did not promulgate an ordinance pursuant to section,subdivision d for approximately years.on june,however,city adopted ordinance ordinance,which was codified as los angeles municipal code section.subsection of this section provides,in pertinent part if a building containing a rental unit that was the subject of a notice of intent to withdraw pursuant to the provisions of subsection of section is demolished and rental units are constructed on the same property and offered for rent or lease within five years of the date the rental unit that was the subject of the notice of intent to withdraw was withdrawn from rent or lease,the owner may establish the initial rental rate of the newly constructed rental units.the provisions of the rent stabilization ordinance,section,et,and other provisions of this chapter shall apply to the newly constructed rental units.
plaintiff complaint 
on june,plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory relief against city.plaintiff alleged that the ordinance is preempted by a provision of,civil code section,subdivision a plaintiff prayed for a declaration that the ordinance is invalid to the extent that it attempts to extend coverage of the rso to rental housing constructed after february.
city demurrer 
city demurred to the complaint on the ground that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.city argued that the ordinance was not preempted by,and that the ordinance was specifically authorized under section,subdivision d.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and entered judgment in favor of city.plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
the issue of preemption of a municipal ordinance by state law presents a question of law,subject to de novo review.apartment,supra,th at,d.the interpretation of state statutes also entails a resolution of a pure question of law,which is examined de novo.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.
principles of statutory interpretation 
this case requires us to interpret provisions of the ellis act and,as well as the interrelationship between the two statutory schemes.the fundamental task of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in order to determine this intent,we begin by examining the language of the statute.citation.the words of a statute are to be interpreted in the sense in which they would have been understood at the time of the enactment.people cruz cal th,d.
the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation people shabazz cal th,d.
where,as here,the plain meaning of a statute is insufficient to resolve a question of interpretation,we may review the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment,as well as the public policy underlying the law.absher autozone,th,d.if two seemingly inconsistent statutes conflict,the court role is to harmonize the law.citations.we presume that the legislature,when enacting a statute,was aware of existing related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules.stone street capital,llc california state lottery com.th,d stone street see also,fair employment housing com.cal d,statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible drouet superior court cal th,d,drouet when two statutes regarding the same subject matter appear in conflict,the court task is to harmonize the statutes.
one elementary rule of statutory construction is that statutes in pari is,statutes relating to the same subject be construed together.citation.the rule of in pari materia is a corollary of the principle that the goal of statutory interpretation is to determine legislative intent.droeger friedman,sloan ross cal d.
if inconsistent statutes can not otherwise be reconciled,a particular or specific provision will take precedence over a conflicting general provision.citations.the supreme court has confirmed,where the general statute standing alone would include the same matter as the special act,and thus conflict with it,the special act will be considered as an exception to the general statute whether it was passed before or after such general enactment.citations.people gilbert cal d.stone street,supra,th at,d.
generally,we will presume that the enactment of a statute does not impliedly repeal existing statutes.garcia mccutchen cal th,d,garcia.absent an express declaration of legislative intent,we will find an implied repeal only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two potentially conflicting statutes citation,and the statutes are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.id.at,d.
the ellis act was enacted to allow landlords of property subject to rent control to evict tenants and go out of the residential rental business 
in nash city of santa monica cal d,nash,the california supreme court upheld a city ordinance that restricted the circumstances in which owners of residential properties could evict tenants in order to withdraw from the rental market.pieri city and county of san francisco th,d,italics added.the ellis act,enacted in stats,ch,was a direct response to nash.the purpose of the ellis act is to allow landlords who comply with its terms to go out of the residential rental business by evicting their tenants and withdrawing all units from the market city of santa monica yarmark d,italics added holding that city ordinance prohibiting eviction of tenants of rent control unit absent permit was preempted by ellis act.the heart of the ellis act is section,subdivision a,which states that no public entity shall by statute,ordinance,regulation,or administrative action compel the owner of any residential property to offer,or to continue to offer,accommodations in the property for rent or lease,except under circumstances not relevant to this case.
section,subdivision d is intended to prevent landlords from evicting tenants under false pretenses 
a provision of the ellis act,section,subdivision d,authorizes cities to enact ordinances that impose rent control on newly constructed buildings that replace residential rental units previously subject to rent control.specifically,cities may enact ordinances that provide if the accommodations are demolished,and new accommodations are constructed on the same property,and offered for rent or lease within five years of the date the accommodations were withdrawn from rent or lease,the newly constructed accommodations shall be subject to any system of controls on the price at which they would be offered on the basis of a fair and reasonable return on the newly constructed accommodations,notwithstanding any exemption from the system of controls for newly constructed accommodations,subd.d.the ordinance at issue in this case was promulgated pursuant to section,subdivision d.
section,subdivision d was not originally part of senate bill sb,which enacted the ellis act.opponents of sb argued that the bill would undermine local rent control ordinances and various state laws protecting tenants.they claimed that the bill could permit property owners to take a unit off the market and evict the tenant under the pretext of going out of business,and then relet the property as a new rental months later.com.on judiciary,bill reg.sess.as amended april,italics added.
sb was amended to include recontrol provisions to address this concern with respect to rental property subject to rent control that is withdrawn from the market and demolished,sb was amended to include the language currently codified as section,subdivision d as to rental units subject to rent control withdrawn from the market but not demolished,sb was amended to include a provision codified as section,subdivision a under this provision,if the units withdrawn from the market are subsequently offered again for rent,local governments may require landlords to offer the units at the lawful rent in effect at the time the notice of intent to withdraw was filed.drouet,supra,cal th at,d.
generally prohibits the application of rent control to newly constructed residential units,but does not affect the authority of local public entities to regulate or monitor the basis for eviction 
in,california enacted.stats,ch.as we have explained,a provision of,civil code section,subdivision a,effectively exempts newly constructed rental units from local rent control.civil code section,subdivision c provides that this statute shall not be construed to affect the authority of a public entity that may otherwise exist to regulate or monitor the basis for eviction.
another provision of,civil code section,established vacancy decontrol for residential dwelling units where the former tenant has voluntarily vacated,abandoned or been legally evicted.cobb san francisco residential rent stabilization arbitration bd.th,d see also action apartment,city of santa monica cal th,d,action apartment.the effect of this vacancy decontrol provision was to permit landlords to impose whatever rent they choose at the commencement of a tenancy.citation.the legislature was well aware,however,that such vacancy decontrol gave landlords an incentive to evict tenants that were paying rents below market rates.citation.accordingly,the statute expressly preserves the authority of local governments to regulate or monitor the grounds for eviction,subd.e.action apartment,at,d.
does not preempt the ordinance,and does not expressly or impliedly repeal section,subdivision d 
section,subdivision d is an exception to civil code section,subdivision a 
we now turn to applying the general principles of statutory interpretation to the interrelationship between the ellis act and.for reasons explained herein,we hold that section,subdivision d and civil code section,subdivision a can and should be harmonized by construing the former as an exception to the latter 
as a general rule,if residential real property has a certificate of occupancy issued after february,it is not subject to any system of controls on the price at which rental units are offered rent control,subd.a.however,a public entity may provide by statute,ordinance or regulation as specified in section,that such residential real property is subject to rent control if the following conditions are satisfied 
the residential real property consists of accommodations constructed on the same property where previous accommodations were demolished 
the previous accommodations were subject to rent control before being withdrawn from rent or lease and 
the new accommodations are offered for rent or lease within five years of the date the previous accommodations were withdrawn from rent or lease,subd.d.
we can not,conversely,consider civil code section,subdivision a as an exception to section,subdivision d because the exception would swallow the rule.mycogen monsanto cal th,d,rejecting a proposed statutory interpretation when the exception would swallow the rule.this is because many cities,including los angeles see,subd.e,require a landlord to obtain a certificate of occupancy before a tenant may occupy newly constructed real property.see
