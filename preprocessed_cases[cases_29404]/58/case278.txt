david anthony rodriguez shot michael william hawkins outside an apartment complex.we affirmed rodriguez convictions for attempted murder and related charges.people rodriquez,nonpub.opn,wl.
in this case hawkins sued the owners and managers of the apartment complex collectively wilton,alleging that wilton was negligent in hiring rodriguez as an apartment manager and security guard,and in allowing him to remain as a tenant after notice of his dangerous propensities,specifically,that wilton knew rodriguez had been convicted of manslaughter,and that he carried guns,used methamphetamine and threatened tenants while working for wilton.the trial court granted wilton motion for summary judgment and hawkins timely appealed.
hawkins first argues wilton did not meet his burden to show a lack of triable issues.we agree.wilton motion did not even purport to show that hawkins could not prove his respondeat superior theory of recovery,that is that rodriguez shot him while working for wilton,and hawkins appropriately raised this failing in the trial court.because wilton did not alternatively seek summary adjudication,we decline to address issues about those legal theories on which wilton might possibly have prevailed.we reverse.
standard and scope of review 
we review summary judgment appeals by applying the same analysis applied by the trial court first,we identify the issues raised by the pleadings.second,we determine whether the movant established entitlement to summary judgment,that is,whether the movant showed the opponent could not prevail on any theory raised by the pleadings.third,if the movant has met its burden,we consider whether the opposition raised triable issues of fact.we review these matters de novo.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar guz bechtel national,cal th,d,guz.
as for defense motions,we determine with respect to each cause of action whether the defendant seeking summary judgment has conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiff case,or has demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of a trial.guz,supra,cal th at,d.wilton bore the burden to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
where the evidence presented by defendant does not support judgment in his favor,the motion must be denied without looking at the opposing evidence,if any,submitted by plaintiff.duckett pistoresi ambulance service,th,d see binder aetna life ins.th,d plaintiff has no evidentiary burden unless the moving defendant has first met its initial burden villa mcferren th,d villa cal.judges benchbook civil proceedings before trial cjer summary judgment and summary adjudication motions,id.update,defendant must present evidence and not simply point out through argument the facts to support summary judgment.
as will be seen,we need not proceed beyond the second step of analysis because wilton failed to carry his burden.
factual and procedural background 
a.the pleadings 
the first amended complaint alleged that on may,and prior to that time both hawkins and rodriguez were tenants of the complex and on that date rodriguez shot hawkins.wilton knew that rodriguez had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter and served a prison term therefor.wilton had been warned by other tenants that rodriguez was dangerous and was using illegal drugs methamphetamines,tweeking on crank meaning over using said drug and being out of control,and carrying numerous different loaded firearms around the kentfield apartments complex.wilton had been warned that rodriguez had pulled a gun several times on another tenant and that the tenants were frightened for themselves and their children for their own personal safety.nonetheless,wilton employed rodriguez as manager and night security guard.
this pleading explicitly captioned four legal theories.first,wilton was liable as rodriguez employer respondeat superior.second,wilton was negligent in hiring and retaining rodriguez.third,wilton was negligent in not protecting tenants from foreseeable criminality.fourth,wilton had been negligent as a landlord in allowing a dangerous tenant to remain in possession.
wilton denied these allegations and raised a number of affirmative defenses.
b.the motion for summary judgment 
wilton motion raised one legal theory b ecause the shooting occurred outside the premises of the apartment complex between two individuals freely and voluntarily associating with each other,as a matter of public policy and as a matter of law,defendants had no duty to protect plaintiff.
wilton tendered six alleged undisputed facts,as follows.
the shooting occurred in the city street and on the sidewalk outside the premises of the complex.
rodriguez and hawkins were pretty good acquaintances and pretty friendly who worked together for several weeks and spoke and smoked cigarettes together almost daily.
hawkins had warned wilton managers a week or two before that rodriguez acted weird,carried guns,and was going to end up killing somebody or something.
hawkins continued to socialize with rodriguez.
hawkins freely let rodriguez into his apartment and willingly went with rodriguez to the street.
hawkins and his fiance√©,who were much closer to rodriguez than defendants,had no warning or factual information that would cause them to reasonably anticipate that rodriguez would hurt hawkins.
c.the opposition 
hawkins pointed out in his written opposition and at the hearing that wilton facts and theory did not negate all theories of liability.hawkins disputed some facts and their import and tendered other facts.
trial court ruling 
the trial court sustained wilton objections to some evidence and overruled some of hawkins objections.as for respondeat superior,negligent hiring and retaining a dangerous tenant,the trial court ruled hawkins tendered evidence was inadmissible on various grounds.based on purported gaps in hawkins opposition,the trial court found rodriguez was not an employee or tenant at the time of the shooting and although perhaps triable whether the shooting took place on wilton property as opposition evidence as wilton now concedes on appeal,rodriguez criminal conduct was not reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances here and,imposing a duty and liability on defendants for not having prevented rodriguez from coming onto the property to visit his family or evicted the mother of his children and his children would be in violation of public policy.
wilton motion did not tender facts as to whether rodriguez was a tenant or an employee or exercised apparent authority over the premises even if he was no longer employed,and no mention was made about his possible reasons for being on the property,to visit family.nor did the motion address the knowledge wilton allegedly had about rodriguez conviction,drug use,display of firearms at the complex and so forth,as alleged by hawkins.
discussion 
the motion for summary judgment should have been denied because it did not refute tenable pleaded theories.as existing caselaw explains,because summary judgment deprives a party of his or her right to a jury trial,the erroneous granting of a motion for summary judgment will ordinarily be reversible error and will be found harmless only where the trial court error was technical.here the trial court disregarded the statutory framework of summary judgment and improperly shifted the burden to hawkins the error was neither minor nor technical.
we review a summary judgment appeal in the footsteps of the trial court.before even looking at hawkins evidence,we consider whether wilton established a prima facie case for relief.he did not.
the facts tendered by wilton do not address,far less negate,the theory that rodriguez was wilton employee and was allowed to carry firearms although he was known by wilton to be a convicted felon convicted of a serious and violent felony,voluntary manslaughter and known to be an methamphetamine user who had threatened tenants.an employer who allowed such conduct by a manager or security guard would not be insulated from respondeat superior liability simply because the tenant chose to socialize with the employee,or simply because the shooting took place on the sidewalk outside the apartment complex.nor did wilton evidence or legal argument negate the theory that wilton negligently retained rodriguez as a tenant,despite the alleged obvious danger.
we briefly outline the substantive law supporting liability on the allegations of the complaint.
the employer of a security guard may be liable for the guard assaults if the employer negligently hired the guard or negligently placed him in a position to commit foreseeable harmful acts.see,guard company collecting cases,negligent hiring of security guard d proof of facts easley apollo detective agency,d,plaintiff verdict upheld where armed apartment security guard assaulted a tenant,but a proper background check would have revealed his unfitness for the position.here,allegedly,wilton actually knew rodriguez had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter,but allowed him to carry firearms on the job and ignored reports of his drug usage.see,landlord conduct,liability hinges on proving some connection between the duties performed by the employee as the landlord agent and the employee attack on the tenant,thereby showing that the employee was acting in the interest of his employer at the time of the assault,collecting cases upholding liability for assaults where landlords allowed manager to carry guns,did not discover criminal background,ignored employee violent tendencies,etc.
in our view an employer can not allow a convicted felon to carry and brandish loaded firearms during the course and scope of employment,particularly where,as here,the employment necessarily consists of making contact with members of the public,such as tenants and visitors to the complex.such conduct merits liability because it should be discouraged,the victim should be compensated and the victim losses should be borne by the enterprise causing the risk moreover,liability will not impose an undue burden but will merely ensure that apartment owners who choose to employ security guards or managers will select,train and supervise them to avoid inflicting additional risks on their tenants.wilton motion failed to show hawkins could not prove this theory at trial.
a landlord may also be liable for failing to address the presence of a dangerous tenant or other person on or about the property.madhani cooper th,d landlord had duty of care to tenants to protect them from foreseeable attacks by another tenant the key issue here is foreseeability of harm.the california supreme court summarized the general rules of landlord liability as follows 
ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,d,announced the rule we follow today,namely that california law requires landowners to maintain land in their possession and control in a reasonably safe condition.citations.in the case of a landlord,this general duty of maintenance,which is owed to tenants and patrons,has been held to include the duty to take reasonable steps to secure common areas against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties that are likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary measures.we also observed that a duty to take affirmative action to control the wrongful acts of a third party will be imposed only where such conduct can be reasonably anticipated.
in the case of a criminal assault,ann held that the decision to impose a duty of care to protect against criminal assaults requires balancing the foreseeability of the harm against the burden of the duty to be imposed.i n cases where the burden of preventing future harm is great,a high degree of foreseeability may be required.on the other hand,in cases where there are strong policy reasons for preventing the harm,or the harm can be prevented by simple means,a lesser degree of foreseeability may be required.or,as one appellate court has accurately explained,duty in such circumstances is determined by a balancing of foreseeability of the criminal acts against the burdensomeness,vagueness,and efficacy of the proposed security measures.wiener southcoast childcare centers,cal th,d,citations omitted.
even if rodriguez was no longer an employee or in apparent charge of the premises,if,as the complaint pleads,wilton knew he frequented the premises while carrying a firearm and while intoxicated by methamphetamine,hawkins may be able to prove wilton failed to take reasonable steps to exclude rodriguez from the premises.the tendered facts do not negate this theory of liability,they merely show hawkins associated with rodriguez and did not fear him,not that the landlord,who allegedly knew of rodriguez manslaughter conviction,possession of guns and use of drugs,had no duty to protect hawkins from foreseeable harm,while rodriguez was on drugs.wilton tendered facts did not establish that hawkins knew rodriguez used drugs or had a manslaughter conviction,only that he knew rodriguez had guns and that hawkins was apparently not afraid of a personal assault by rodriguez just so had wilton warned hawkins that rodriguez used drugs and was a convicted felon,perhaps hawkins would have shunned rodriguez.
in any event,because the motion did not negate theories of employer liability,the trial court should have held that wilton failed to carry his initial burden and stopped there.
in apparent response to hawkins emphatic position that wilton had not shifted the burden,the trial court swallowed a red herring dragged through the papers by wilton,who argued at the hearing that hawkins due process claim was meritless because the law indicates that an alternative to the separate statement of undisputed facts is to challenge the plaintiff to prove the prima facie case.so there is no violation of due process here.although nowhere in his papers did wilton offer authority excusing the failure to make a prima facie case,the trial court ruled the court has discretion to consider not specifically referenced in the separate statement.see ccp b san diego watercrafts wells fargo bank th,d san diego.
the trial court misread the authority it relied on.san diego does hold that a trial court has discretion to consider evidence not referenced in the moving party separate statement when ruling on summary judgment.san diego,supra,th at,d however,the trial court overlooked the next passage of san diego,as follows 
in exercising its discretion whether or not to consider evidence undisclosed in the separate statement,the court should also consider due process implications noted in united community church garcin d.the due process aspect of the separate statement requirement is self inform the opposing party of the evidence to be disputed to defeat the motion.id.at.
here,the evidence not only was omitted from the separate statement,it also was not filed until after assignee had responded to the issues raised in the separate statement.in considering this evidence,the court violated assignee due process rights.assignee was not informed what issues it was to meet in order to oppose the motion.where a remedy as drastic as summary judgment is involved,due process requires a party be fully advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail.san diego,supra,th at,d.
thus,san diego,supra,th,d,does not salvage the trial court ruling because the issues to be addressed in this case,as defined by wilton motion,did not entitle wilton to summary judgment.see fenn sherriff th,d emphasizing due process limits to the discretion recognized by san diego.
nor was this a case where the defendant relied on a plaintiff factually devoid discovery,that is,plaintiff lack of evidence,as wilton asserted in his reply brief in the trial court.wilton motion merely contained an unsworn assertion of counsel,without citation to evidence or lack of evidence by hawkins,that rodriguez was not an employee.wilton motion did not rely on factually insufficient discovery responses as wilton led the trial court
