plaintiffs and appellants joel andrews and telma maria andrews appeal a judgment following a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants and respondents mobile aire estates mobile aire,sierra management llc sierra,and william leyland,valerie parker parker,jose de jesus de jesus,christian tovar tovar,christa de la parra de la parra and janis miller miller the individual defendants collectively,defendants 
the andrewses,the lessees of a space at a mobile home park,sued the park owner,mobile aire,for breach of written contract,alleging mobile aire breached the lease by failing to take any action against a troublesome neighbor,william molyneux molyneux,the lessee of an adjacent space at the park.
the trial court disposed of the breach of contract claim on the ground mobile aire did not owe the andrewses a duty to evict molyneux.
inherent in the andrewses lease agreement with mobile aire was the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment,giving rise to a contractual duty in mobile aire to preserve their quiet enjoyment.the lease agreement,at paragraph,also expressly provided we will try to maintain the peace and quiet of the premises and w e will do what we can.the additional implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing imposed upon mobile aire a duty to make a reasonable effort to fulfill the commitment it undertook in paragraph.
therefore,mobile aire as a matter of law owed the andrewses a contractual duty to preserve their quiet enjoyment.duty is a given.the remaining issue is whether mobile aire breached its contractual duty by not taking any action against molyneux.that question is for the trier of fact.
we conclude the trial court erred insofar as it granted summary judgment in favor of mobile aire on the andrewses cause of action for breach of the lease.the judgment is reversed in part and is otherwise affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the lease agreements.
in,the andrewses entered into a written rental agreement for space with mobile aire,the owner of a mobile home park in covina the park,which agreement periodically was extended in,molyneux signed a rental agreement with mobile aire for the adjacent space,space.
mobile aire form rental agreements included the following pertinent provision at paragraph the park is an average residential neighborhood,it is not perfect.we will try to maintain the peace and quiet,but there may be times when whatever we do wo work.we will do what we can if you can not get others to understand your complaints.italics added.
the conflict between the andrewses and molyneux and notice thereof to mobile aire.
the relationship between the andrewses and molyneux was far from neighborly.overall,between february through august,approximately calls were placed to the covina police department by either the andrewses or molyneux.
on january,tovar,an onsite manager at the park,received several resident objection forms from the andrewses regarding molyneux concerning incidents that occurred in september,october and november,and on january.in these objection forms,the andrewses complained molyneux repeatedly had splashed mud on their newly washed cars had aimed a video camera into their living room had subjected them to a racial epithet as well as other verbal abuse and in the most recent incident,on january,molyneux had driven down the middle of the street,forcing joel andrews to swerve and nearly run his vehicle into space.
it was the policy of mobile aire and sierra,the management company,not to allow their onsite managers to become involved in tenant or neighbor disputes due to their potential for danger.instead,managers were directed to notify sierra promptly for guidance.in accordance with this policy,tovar contacted sierra,which instructed him to advise the andrewses and molyneux to call police if they had a problem with their fellow residents.tovar so advised the andrewses and molyneux.
on february,about one month after the andrewses filed the resident objection forms with tovar,the dispute became physical.joel andrews and molyneux engaged in an altercation over fencing,which escalated into battery.
proceedings.
on august,the andrewses filed suit against molyneux as well as mobile aire,sierra and the six individual defendants noted above,who were managers of the park.the complaint included causes of action against molyneux for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
for purposes of this appeal,the relevant causes of action are the fifth cause of action against mobile aire and sierra for breach of written contract,the rental agreement,based on their failure to take any action against molyneux and the sixth cause of action,against mobile aire,sierra and the six individual defendants,for negligence in failing to exercise reasonable care in managing the park 
the fifth cause of action,breach of written contract,pled in pertinent part.defendants issued rules for the subject mobile home park including rules against battery,infliction of distress,obscene and offensive language,and loud noise.the users of the subject mobile home park are bound by the subject rules pursuant to their rental agreements.plaintiffs have performed all obligations to defendants including abiding by the subject rules.plaintiffs at various times since august have informed defendants of the conduct of molyneux which violated the rules and requested action.defendants since august,have breached the agreement in that defendants have failed to take action against molyneux or do anything else to enforce the subject rules.as a result of defendants failure to enforce the rules,molyneux continued to engage in conduct in violation of the rules and has caused plaintiffs physical injury,emotional distress,medical expenses and loss of income.
the sixth cause of action alleged defendants were negligent in failing to take any action against molyneux.the andrewses pled,inter alia defendants made an intentional conscious decision not to take action against molyneux with awareness that this would probably result in future conduct by molyneux that would result in injury to plaintiffs.
mobile aire,sierra and the six individual defendants answered the complaint,denying the allegations and asserting numerous affirmative defenses.
b.the motion for summary judgment.
on december,mobile aire,sierra and the six individual defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the following grounds the negligence claim was meritless because they did not owe the andrewses a duty of care due to the absence of any prior similar incidents of physical violence,making the february,incident unforeseeable there was no evidence any negligence by defendants was a substantial factor in plaintiffs injuries the andrewses lacked standing to enforce the rental agreement between molyneux and mobile aire because the andrewses at best were incidental beneficiaries of the aire lease and the rental agreement executed by the andrewses did not provide for eviction of other residents on demand.
the andrewses opposition papers argued,inter alia,that additional discovery was needed to address the issues of duty and notice and they requested a continuance for that purpose.
trial court ruling.
on february,the matter came on for hearing the trial court denied the andrewses request for a continuance and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,ruling n othing in the rental agreements imposed a duty on moving parties to evict molyneux for alleged violation of the park rules,as distinct from a right to terminate molyneux tenancy which moving parties had the discretion to enforce or not to enforce.the rental agreement between molyneux and sierra did not confer incidental benefits on plaintiffs,and was intended for the mutual benefit of molyneux and sierra alone.nothing in any of the rental agreements,including those between plaintiffs and sierra,imposed a contractual duty to evict molyneux.moving parties owed plaintiffs no duty to evict molyneux under a negligence theory based on davis gomez d.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of mobile aire,sierra and the six individual defendants.the andrewses filed a timely notice of appeal 
contentions 
the andrewses contend defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the cause of action for negligence because a landlord has a duty to protect tenants from assault by other tenants and there is a triable issue of fact as to whether defendants breached their duty of care defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the cause of action for breach of contract because the contract claim is not based on a third party beneficiary theory mobile aire failed to preserve their right to quiet enjoyment under their lease agreement and the trial court abused its discretion in denying their request for a continuance to conduct additional discovery.

as the landlord,mobile aire owed a duty to preserve the quiet enjoyment of all its tenants,including the andrewses.
we begin with a discussion of the implied covenant of quiet possession,which gives rise to duty in the landlord to preserve the quiet enjoyment of all tenants.davis gomez,supra,d at.
general principles relating to the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.
quiet enjoyment is an implied term of every lease agreement.
in the absence of language to the contrary,every lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment,whereby the landlord impliedly covenants that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment and possession of the premises.petroleum collections swords d.guntert city of stockton d.the covenant of quiet enjoyment insulates the tenant against any act or omission on the part of the landlord,or anyone claiming under him,which interferes with a tenants right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy.green superior court,cal d,fn,d,landlord and tenant.petroleum collections swords,supra,d at.
the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is partially codified in civil code section,enacted in,which provides an agreement to let upon hire binds the letter to secure to the hirer the quiet possession of the thing hired during the term of the hiring,against all persons lawfully claiming the same.the statutory covenant guarantees the tenant against rightful assertion of a paramount title.guntert,supra,d at.beyond the statutory covenant,the landlord is bound to refrain from action which interrupts the tenants beneficial enjoyment.ibid.
protection under implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is similar to that afforded by implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing overlap to impose similar duties of care.ocean services ventura port dist.th,d.a covenant of good faith and fair dealing also is implied in every contract,including leases.carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th,d.
a typical formulation of the burden imposed by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,quoting comunale traders general ins.cal d.or,to put it another way,the implied covenant imposes upon each party the obligation to do everything that the contract presupposes they will do to accomplish its purpose.schoolcraft ross d.careau security pacific business credit,d.
substantial interference is required to establish a breach of quiet enjoyment.
minor inconveniences and annoyances are not actionable breaches of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.to be actionable,the landlords act or omission must substantially interfere with a tenants right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy.petroleum collections swords,supra,d at.see,pierce nash d,landlord breached tenants right to quiet enjoyment by installing interior building supports which unnecessarily interfered with tenants billiards business sierad lilly d.landlord breached covenant of quiet enjoyment by denying retail tenant use of adjoining parking spaces which were essential to tenants use and enjoyment of the property friedman et,cal.practice guide the rutter group.
perpetrator need not be the landlord personally.
the perpetrator of the interference with the tenants quiet enjoyment need not be the landlord personally.there may be an actionable breach where the interference is caused by a neighbor or tenant claiming under the landlord.petroleum collections swords,supra,d at.see,lee placer title th,d shopping center tenant claimed covenant was breached by landlords failure to remedy ventilation problems caused by adjoining dry cleaning business.
remedies for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
an interference by the landlord,or by someone claiming under the landlord lee placer title,supra,th at,d,by which the tenant is deprived of the beneficial enjoyment of the premises amounts to a constructive eviction if the tenant so elects and surrenders possession,and the tenant will not be liable for rentals for the portion of the term following his eviction.citations.kulawitz pacific.paper cal d.upon surrendering possession of the premises,the tenant is relieved of the obligation to pay rent and may sue for damages,or may plead damages by way of offset in an action brought by the landlord to recover any unpaid rent that accrued prior to the surrender of the premises.petroleum collections swords,supra,d at.
alternatively,a tenant may elect to stand upon the lease,remain in possession and sue for breach of contract damages kulawitz pacific.paper guntert,supra,d at.as well as for injunctive relief.petroleum collections swords,supra,d at.
civil code section prescribes the measure of damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment additionally,case law holds a tenant suing for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment may recover contract damages in accordance with civil code section amount that will compensate the aggrieved party for all the detriment caused by the breach or which in the ordinary course would be a likely result.guntert,supra,d at.thus,in an appropriate case,recovery may include,inter alia,lost profits guntert,supra,at,lost business goodwill johnson snyder d,and moving expenses ibid.
preliminary conclusion re mobile aires implied contractual duty.
inherent in the lease agreement between the andrewses and mobile aire was the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment,giving rise to a contractual duty in mobile aire to preserve the andrewses quiet enjoyment of the premises.
b.the mobilehome residency law expressly authorizes mobilehome park owners to take necessary steps to preserve the quiet enjoyment of mobilehome park tenants.
because this tenancy relates to a site in a mobilehome park,we address the application of the mobilehome residency law mrl,et to the issues presented herein.
the mrl is an extensive statutory scheme governing mobilehome park tenancies.it addresses a host of issues,ranging from the required contents of rental agreements,and exemption from local rent control measures,to tree trimming,and pets.
for purposes of this discussion,the relevant provisions are civil code sections and.in order to protect mobilehome park tenants,the legislature conferred upon them certain protections from eviction,while authorizing a mobilehome park owner to terminate a mobilehome park tenancy in specified circumstances.ibid.
the legislature declared its intent at civil code section,stating a the legislature finds and declares that,because of the high cost of moving mobilehomes,the potential for damage resulting therefrom,the requirements relating to the installation of mobilehomes,and the cost of landscaping or lot preparation,it is necessary that the owners of mobilehomes occupied within mobilehome parks be provided with the unique protection from actual or constructive eviction afforded by the provisions of this chapter.in furtherance of that end,the statute provides the management may not terminate or refuse to renew a tenancy,except for a reason specified in this article,subd.b,italics added.
the authorized grounds for termination of a mobilehome park tenancy are enumerated in civil code section,which provides in relevant part a tenancy shall be terminated by the management only for one or more of the following reasons a failure of the homeowner or resident to comply with a local ordinance or state law or regulation relating to mobilehomes within a reasonable time after the homeowner receives a notice of noncompliance from the appropriate governmental agency.b conduct by the homeowner or resident,upon the park premises,that constitutes a substantial annoyance to other homeowners or residents.d failure of the homeowner or resident to comply with a reasonable rule or regulation of the park that is part of the rental agreement or any amendment thereto.italics added.
in addition to authorizing the eviction of an offending tenant,the mrl authorizes a mobilehome park owner to seek injunctive relief to enjoin a violation.civil code section provides a in addition to any right under article commencing with section to terminate the tenancy of a homeowner,any person in violation of a reasonable rule or regulation of a mobilehome park may be enjoined from the violation as provided in this section.b a petition for an order enjoining a continuing or recurring violation of any reasonable rule or regulation of a mobilehome park may be filed by the management thereof with the superior court for the county in which the mobilehome park is located.
in short,while the mrl limits the eviction rights of mobilehome park owners,it expressly preserves the park owners ability to secure the quiet enjoyment of mobilehome park tenants by authorizing park owners to pursue eviction or injunctive relief against offending tenants.
trial courts ruling mobile aire had no contractual duty to evict molyneux confused the issues of duty and breach triable issues of fact exist relating to whether mobile aire breached its obligation under the lease to preserve the andrewses quiet enjoyment.
in granting summary judgment on the breach of contract claim,the trial court ruled nothing in the rental agreements imposed a duty on moving parties to evict molyneux for alleged violation of the park rules,as distinct from a right to terminate molyneux tenancy which moving parties had the discretion to enforce or not to enforce and that n othing in any of the rental agreements imposed a contractual duty to evict molyneux.
the trial court ruling confused the issues of contractual duty and breach.as explained above,as a matter of law,inherent in the lease agreement between mobile aire and the andrewses was the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.consequently,mobile aire owed the andrewses a contractual duty to preserve their quiet enjoyment.
thus,the issue is not duty a contractual duty exists.the issue is whether mobile aire breached its obligation under the lease by not taking any action against molyneux.that question presents triable issues of fact,including whether the level of interference by molyneux was sufficient to amount to a deprivation of the andrewses right to quiet enjoyment,whether mobile aire had notice of the interference,the nature of any investigative and corrective measures a reasonable landlord should have taken,a warning,a petition for injunctive relief pursuant to,or other measures to secure molyneuxs compliance,and thereafter,the extent of the andrewses recoverable damages.
we express no opinion with respect to any of these matters.we simply hold mobile aire owed a contractual obligation to the andrewses,as to any tenant,to preserve their right of quiet enjoyment.
in sum,the grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract claim on the ground mobile aire had no duty under the lease to evict molyneux was error 
mobile aires express contractual duty pursuant to paragraph of the lease.
in addition to owing an implied duty to the andrewses to preserve their quiet enjoyment pursuant to the leases implied covenant to that effect,mobile aire owed the andrewses an express duty pursuant to paragraph of the lease agreement.
as indicated,paragraph of mobile aires form lease provides the park is an average residential neighborhood,it is not perfect.we will try to maintain the peace and quiet,but there may be times when whatever we do wo work.we will do what we can if you can not get others to understand your complaints.italics added.
paragraph simply makes express the obligation that is imposed by the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.in this provision,mobile aire explicitly undertook to try to protect the andrewses quiet enjoyment of the premises.
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing imposed upon mobile aire a duty to make a reasonable effort to fulfill the promise it made in paragraph of the lease.otherwise,paragraph would be rendered hollow.as explained above,the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing imposes upon each party the obligation to do everything that the contract presupposes they will do to accomplish its purpose.citation.careau security pacific business credit,supra,d at.
accordingly,mobile aire contractually was obligated to the andrewses to make a reasonable effort to maintain the peace and quiet of the premises pursuant to the express language of paragraph,supplemented by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.whether mobile aire breached that duty requires resolution by the trier of fact.
the trial court erred in characterizing the andrewses as incidental third party beneficiaries of the mobile lease.
mobile aire argued,and the trial court found,the andrewses lacked standing to enforce the rental agreement between molyneux and mobile aire because the andrewses at best were incidental third party beneficiaries of the aire lease 
the trial court erred in viewing the andrewses claim as an attempt by a third party to enforce a provision of the mobile lease.the andrewses do not purport to be third party beneficiaries of the lease agreement between molyneux and mobile aire.
the andrewses are standing upon their own lease agreement with mobile aire,which agreement gave rise to its own rights and obligations,based on the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and paragraph of the lease.the andrewses cause of action against mobile aire for breach of the lease is predicated on express and implied obligations that mobile aire owed the andrewses pursuant to the lease agreement between the andrewses and mobile aire 
remaining issues.
trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the negligence claim.
the key issue in determining whether defendants owed a duty to protect joel andrews from the february,battery by molyneux is the foreseeability of harm.see,sharon arman,cal th,d,ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,d.
in madhani cooper th,d,the court held the defendant landlords owed a duty of care to protect the from foreseeable future assaults by moore,a fellow tenant and neighbor,at,d.there,the evidence showed the landlords knew or should have known moore had engaged in repeated acts of assault and battery against madhani as well as her mother,italics added.therefore,it was foreseeable moore violent outbursts and physical assaults would eventually result in serious injury to madhani,at,d.
