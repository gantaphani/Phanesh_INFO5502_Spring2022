background 
the information charged bell with one count of identity theft in violation of subdivision a of penal code section count,one count of false personation in violation of section count,one count of making a false financial statement in violation of subdivision of section count,and grand theft of personal property in violation of subdivision a of section count 
the charges were tried to a jury,which found bell guilty on all counts.the court sentenced bell to years months in state prison.bell appealed.
the evidence introduced at trial showed that bell signed a apartment lease in april under the name of leah taylor,using taylor social security number and other personal identifying information in order to obtain approval of bell rental application.bell then resided in the apartment with another woman and a little girl.the director of operations of healstone property management,which managed the apartment complex,described the rental history as follows there were collection issues,there were partial payments,late payments,and then the final was the returned check.in june the late payments started.h aving the delinquent payments right off the bat was a red flag after june,the problems persisted with l ate payments july,august,partial payments through august,september,october.at which point in november there was a returned check along with a delinquency in which we had sent first the notice requesting that they surrender the property,pay the rent in full.and upon no response to that,we filed an unlawful detainer.
pursuant to an unlawful detainer judgment,healstone garnished from the bank account of the real leah taylor for the unpaid rent.when taylor sought to get her money back,claiming truthfully that she had never lived in or even applied to rent the apartment in question,the identity theft finally came to light.taylor did get her back but,as of the time of trial,was still trying to restore her credit rating to its previous status.
we appointed counsel to represent bell on appeal.after examination of the record,counsel filed an opening brief raising no issues and asking us independently to review the record pursuant to people wende cal d.on october,we advised bell that she had days within which she could personally submit any contentions or issues that she wished us to consider.we received no response.
after reviewing the record,we sent a letter to the parties requesting supplemental briefing on the issue of whether the conviction for grand theft is supported by substantial evidence.in response to our letter,the issue was briefed.
discussion 
bell challenges the grand theft conviction on the basis that it is not supported by substantial evidence that she had the intent to permanently deprive the lessor of its property.we disagree and affirm because bell intended to permanently deprive the lessor of a leasehold interest,at least to the extent that bell failed to pay rent during her occupancy.
as to the grand theft count,the information alleged that bell did unlawfully take money and personal property of a value exceeding four hundred dollars,to wit rent money and currency the property of leah tomel taylor,healstone property management.according to the evidence,the rental arrearages exceeded that amount.
the court instructed the jury on only one legal theory with respect to the grand theft count,namely,theft by false pretenses.the instructions informed the jury that the defendant could be found guilty on that count only if the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant made either a promise without intent to perform it or a false pretense or representation,the defendant did so with the specific intent to defraud,the victim believed and relied upon the promise or representation,which was material in inducing the victim to part with its money or property even though the false pretense,representation or promise was not the sole cause,and t he theft was accomplished in that the alleged victim parted with its money or property intending to transfer ownership thereof.
the prosecutor argued to the jury that the theft is,it is not the property itself,obviously the apartment is still there,they do walk away with the apartment,it is the value of the service,it is the value of the apartment during the months that they lived there without paying rent.that is a theft under false pretense because they get the apartment through false pretense,then they stop paying rent,and then the owner is out the benefit of those months rent.that is the theft in this case.
on appeal,bell contends that t he facts that she paid the security deposit upon renting the apartment and then paid four months rent,indicate that her intent was to use the false identification to effect the rental,but not to permanently deprive either the owner of the property or of the identity of possession of the apartment or the rent money.respondent argues that bell false representations induced healstone to allow bell to take possession and title to property that belonged to healstone,namely the right to the apartment for one year pursuant to the lease which was worth around.the transfer of that property to bell,the rights under the lease,based upon bell fraudulent representations to healstone that she was leah taylor,cost healstone approximately,based on the breach of contract,plus attorney and court costs of approximately respondent further argues that healstone transferred legal ownership of the right to live in the apartment for one year pursuant to leah taylor,based on bell false personation.
our supreme court has admonished that california requirement for the crime of theft is flexible and not to be taken literally.t he general rule is that the intent to steal required for conviction of larceny is an intent to deprive the owner permanently of possession of the property.citations.people davis cal th,see also people turner d.the rule is not inflexible,however,and in certain cases the requisite intent to steal may be found even though the defendant primary purpose in taking the property is not to deprive the owner permanently of possession,such as when the defendant intends to sell the property back to its owner,when the defendant intends to claim a reward for finding the property,and when the defendant intends to return the property to its owner for a refund.people davis,supra,cal th at.in each of those exceptions,although the defendant does not intend to deprive the owner permanently of possession of the property,the defendant does intend to appropriate the value of permanent possession of the property.
in people avery cal th,our supreme court expanded on the flexibility of the rule we now conclude that an intent to take the property for so extended a period as to deprive the owner of a major portion of its value or enjoyment satisfies the common law,and therefore california,intent requirement.id.at.
the case generally cited see,people kunkin cal d,as establishing california requirement itself implies that the requirement is not to be taken literally.in people brown cal,the defendant defended against a charge of stealing a bicycle by testifying that he intended to return it.we held that the testimony,if believed,would make him not guilty of larceny.while the felonious intent of the party taking need not necessarily be an intention to convert the property to his own use,still it must in all cases be an intent to wholly and permanently deprive the owner thereof.id.at.despite the seemingly abs
