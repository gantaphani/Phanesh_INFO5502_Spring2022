under elections code section,the city council of defendant city of santee the city adopted without alteration a mobilehome rent control ordinance that was proposed by an initiative petition.however,it was later discovered that as a result of administrative mistake and inadvertence,there were differences between the text of the ordinance the city adopted ordinance and that of the ordinance that was circulated with the initiative petition.the city eventually sought to cure the defects in the enactment of ordinance by enacting the correct version of the ordinance ordinance and making it retroactively effective to the effective date of ordinance.
plaintiff mhc financing limited partnership two mhc,an owner and operator of a mobilehome park in the city,filed the instant action against the city seeking a judicial declaration that both ordinance and ordinance were null and void and raising other claims pertaining to the ordinances.the case was tried to the court without a jury and the court entered judgment in favor of mhc,declaring the ordinances void and enjoining the city from enforcing them.the court denied mhc posttrial motion for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section the private attorney general statute and civil code section,which authorizes an award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party in an action arising out of california mobilehome residency law mrl,et the city appeals the judgment,and mhc appeals the denial of its motion for attorney fees the city main contention is that the court erred by ruling it could not cure the defects in ordinance by enacting ordinance.we agree with that contention and,accordingly,reverse that portion of the judgment.we affirm the order denying mhc request for attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
on march,a member of a group of mobilehome owners calling themselves the committee to restore fairness ctrf submitted to the city clerk written notice of intent to circulate an initiative petition.the notice was accompanied by the text of the initiative the march initiative,a proposed ordinance that would amend the city existing mobilehome rent control ordinance.the notice included a request for preparation of a ballot title for,and summary of,the initiative in accordance with the california elections code.the city attorney prepared and provided the city clerk with the requested ballot title and summary as required by section.
on april,another member of ctrf submitted a modified version of the initiative the april initiative to the city clerk with a new notice of intent to circulate an initiative petition.the april notice stated,there has been a necessary typographical correction to the initiative as submitted to your office for a title and summary.however,the notice did not include an express request for a ballot title and summary,and the city attorney did not prepare a ballot title or summary for the april initiative.the april initiative petition was circulated under the ballot title and summary that had been prepared for the march initiative.
in september,ctrf submitted a number of completed sections of the april initiative petition to the city clerk,who determined that the petition had been signed by more than percent of the city registered voters.the county registrar of voters confirmed the number of signatures.upon receiving that confirmation,the city council was required under section to do one of the following adopt the proposed ordinance,without alteration,either at the regular meeting at which it was presented with certification of the petition,or within days after presentation of certification submit the proposed ordinance to the voters or order a report on the effect of the proposed ordinance and,when presented with the report,either adopt the ordinance within days or order an election.the city council chose the first option and,on october,enacted ordinance,believing it to be the ordinance proposed by the april initiative.however,due to administrative mistake and inadvertence,the text of ordinance was not that of the ordinance proposed by the april initiative,but rather,was the text of the ordinance proposed by the uncirculated march initiative.
ordinance became effective on november.on december,an association of mobilehome park owners known as the santee park owners association spoa filed an action against the city in the federal district court in san diego challenging the constitutionality of ordinance.mhc was a member of spoa at the time the federal action was filed.in,city employees,including the city clerk,became aware that there were discrepancies between the text of ordinance and the april initiative.the city employees initially believed the discrepancies were the result of problems with the software that had been used to codify the ordinance.however,the city later discovered that the discrepancies were the result of the city council inadvertent adoption of the march initiative rather than the april initiative.
in april,while the federal action was pending,the city offered to cure or reform ordinance by adopting the version of the ordinance set forth in the april initiative that had been circulated by petition.spoa rejected the city offer,asserting that the city could not lawfully reform ordinance.spoa counsel stated the horse is out of the barn,and there is nothing the city can do to repair this situation the only option the city has is to admit and declare that ordinance is not an initiative.any action inconsistent with this will subject the city to further liability.in july,the city filed a counterclaim for reformation and declaratory relief in the federal action,asking the court to reform ordinance to exactly match the language of the april initiative or,in the alternative,to declare that the city had the power to reform the ordinance in that manner.in november,the federal court dismissed the federal action on the grounds that spoa had failed to state a federal takings inverse condemnation claim and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over spoa ancillary state law claims.
in january,the city council enacted ordinance,entitled an ordinance of the city council of the city of santee to cure error in the adoption of ordinance no.the april initiative was attached to ordinance.section of the ordinance provides the text of ordinance is corrected to read exactly as in the initiative petition submitted and circulated by the committee to restore fairness,without alteration.this correction is made effective as of the effective date of ordinance.the text of ordinance is corrected to read as in the initiative which is as follows see attached initiative.the city began enforcing ordinance on february.
in october,mhc filed the instant action,pleading causes of action for denial of equal protection under the california constitution,violation of the elections code,violation of the brown act,and illegal assessment in violation of california constitution,article xiiid.in its complaint,mhc requested declaratory and injunctive relief based on these claims.on the city motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication of causes of action,the court summarily adjudicated in the city favor the causes of action for denial of equal protection and violation of the brown act.the court found there were triable issues of fact as to the other causes of action at trial,the court granted mhc request to file a second amended complaint adding two new causes of alleging that a certain notice provision in ordinance is preempted by civil code section of the mrl and the other alleging that ordinance imposition of application fees and obligations to pay tenants homeowner association attorneys fees and costs operate sic to deny mhc right of petition under article i,section of the california constitution and renders ordinance unconstitutional.
after the case was tried to the court on stipulated facts and the presentation of additional evidence,the court issued its final statement of decision and judgment.under the heading decision in that document,the court ruled that ordinance and ordinance were void because they were adopted in violation of the elections code.under the heading judgment,the court declared both ordinances void,and permanently enjoined the city from enforcing either of them.
addressing mhc request for damages based on the rent differential between the rent control ordinance that preceded ordinance and ordinance and,the court awarded mhc the remedy of future rent increases in an undetermined amount.the court ruled the remedy of future rent increases,as opposed to an award of damages,will adequately compensate mhc.this remedy will place the cost of compensating mhc on those tenants who benefited from the invalid rent control ordinance.california courts have routinely fashioned remedies in the form of compensating those who have wrongfully benefited from an unconstitutional statute or those who have been wrongfully damaged by an illegal charge.the court also awarded mhc damages of,representing the difference in the amount of a certain monthly assessment mhc would have been able to pass through to its tenants under the rent control ordinance that preceded ordinance and the lower amount allowed under ordinances and.
although the court ruled that ordinance and ordinance were void based on the city noncompliance with the elections code,the court addressed mhc other challenges to the ordinances in the decision section of its final statement of decision and judgment.in that part,the court additionally decided that the aforementioned monthly assessment required under ordinances and does not violate article xiiid of the california constitution that certain provisions in the ordinances were preempted by certain sections of the mrl and that certain assessment,cost and attorney fee provisions in the ordinances violated mhc right under article i,section of the california constitution to petition the city for rent adjustments greater than the maximum allowed under the ordinances.
discussion 
i.the trial court erred in ruling that the city council could not cure the defects in ordinance by enacting ordinance 
it is undisputed that under section,the city council was required to adopt the april ordinance without alteration,and that the council failed to comply with that requirement by mistakenly enacting as ordinance the text of the march initiative rather than the text of the april initiative.the main issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in ruling that the city council was precluded from curing its mistake by enacting ordinance and making it retroactive to the effective date of ordinance.we conclude the city council properly enacted ordinance and made it retroactively effective to cure the defects in ordinance.
california courts have long protected the right of the citizenry under the california constitution to directly initiate change through initiative,referendum and recall.robins pruneyard shopping center cal d.the initiative and referendum are not rights granted the people,but power s reserved by them.declaring it the duty of the courts to jealously guard this right of the people citation,the courts have described the initiative and referendum as articulating one of the most precious rights of our democratic process citation.i t has long been our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power wherever it is challenged in order that the right not be improperly annulled.if doubts can reasonably be resolved in favor of the use of this reserve power,courts will preserve it.citations.rossi brown cal th,d.
mhc relies on lesher communications,city of walnut creek cal d,lesher for the proposition that ordinance was void ab initio,and that ordinance could not operate retroactively to amend it.in lesher,the court decided that an initiative measure that limited municipal growth was invalid at the time it was passed because the initiative was in the nature of a zoning ordinance and it did not satisfy the state law requirement that a zoning ordinance conform to the city general plan.lesher,supra,at.noting that a void statute or ordinance can not be given effect id.at,the lesher court held an amendment to an invalid statute may itself constitute a valid enactment operative from its effective date citations,but neither such amendment nor an amendment of the general plan revives an invalid zoning ordinance.citations.id.at.here,the court apparently relied on this language in lesher in ruling having found that ordinance was invalidly adopted and therefore void,ordinance can not operate retroactively to amend a void ordinance.
however,lesher is inapposite.the initiative ordinance passed by the voters in lesher was held to be inherently and incurably invalid because the electorate did not have the power under state law to enact it.here,the electorate had the power to enact the initiative the city council intended to adopt.ordinance did not conflict with the city general plan or with any other superseding law,and its invalidity did not otherwise inhere in its substantive provisions.rather,ordinance was invalid only because the city council inadvertently adopted a somewhat altered version of the initiative that was circulated by petition,instead of an unaltered version as required under section.while the invalidity of the zoning ordinance in lesher was incurable because the electorate lacked the power to enact the ordinance,the invalidity of ordinance could be cured by simply replacing the ordinance with the correct,unaltered version of the petition initiative,which was properly put before the city council and which the city council was required to adopt under section.nothing in lesher precluded the city from taking that curative measure.
expiration of the statutory period within which the city council was required to act on the april initiative did not preclude the council from enacting ordinance to cure the defects in ordinance 
mhc contends,and the court determined,that ordinance was invalid because the city council did not adopt the april initiative attached to ordinance within days after the initiative petition was presented to the council,as is required by section,subdivision a,nor did it timely submit the initiative to the voters under section,subdivision b citing section and lesher,the court ruled that because the city council did not take either action on the initiative petition within the prescribed time periods,it sic action on the same initiative petition two years later is void.we conclude the periods prescribed by section did not preclude the city from retroactively enacting ordinance to cure its inadvertent noncompliance with section.
native american sacred site environmental protection city of san juan capistrano th,d native american supports the proposition that a city failure to either adopt a qualified voter initiative or place it on the ballot within the statutory time periods does not preclude the city from exercising its ministerial and mandatory duty to take such action.in native american,the city of san juan capistrano was presented with an initiative petition that qualified for adoption by the city council or placement on the ballot under section the city and city council defendants negotiated an implementation agreement to mitigate certain conditions and passed an ordinance that adopted both the initiative and the implementation agreement.the trial court granted a petition for writ of mandate filed by opponents of the initiative plaintiffs and ordered the defendants to set aside the ordinance on the ground that it violated section because the implementation agreement constituted an impermissible alteration of the initiative.native american,supra,th at,d.the defendants set aside the ordinance and passed a new ordinance that adopted the unaltered initiative without the implementation agreement.id.at,d.
appealing from the denial of their petition for writ of mandate challenging the second ordinance,the plaintiffs in native american contended,among other things,that the city ceased to have a ministerial duty to adopt the initiative under section,subdivision a,once the period prescribed by that subdivision had expired.rejecting that contention,the native american court held that a city statutory mandatory and ministerial duty to adopt a qualified voter initiative or place it on the ballot remains,even where performance is beyond the statutory time frame.native american,supra,th at,d.in support of this conclusion,the native american court cited goodenough superior court d.goodenough,in which the court of appeal held that a city failure to place a voter initiative on the ballot within the statutorily required time period was a procedural detail that would not be permitted to defeat the clear purpose of the statute to bring initiative measures to an early vote.citation.native american,supra,th at,d,quoting goodenough,supra,d at.the native american court also cited truman royer d,in which the court held that the ministerial act of correcting the certification of a referendum petition after the statutory period was deemed to relate back to the date of the original timely certificate.citation.therefore,time lapse between the two certifications is not fatal.citation.the native american court noted,h ere,passage of the ordinance sans the implementation agreement corrected the original erroneous adoption of the altered initiative.native american,supra,th at,d.
rejecting the plaintiffs analysis that the expiration of the statutory period to adopt the initiative invalidated the defendants power to adopt the initiative,the native american court concluded considering the intent of the section and the broader statutory and constitutional scheme of which it is a part,that is an absurd result we can not countenance.citation.rather,the only reasonable explanation for a period in which to adopt a initiative is a speedy effectuation of the will of the people.native american,supra,th at,d.addressing the plaintiffs claim that their appeal had nothing to do with the rights of the voters,the native american court stated it has everything to do with those rights.more than percent of the city voters signed the initiative petition.they,on behalf of themselves and of the entire city population,are entitled to have their decision implemented under section,which manifests the power of initiative reserved to the people under the constitution.native american,supra,at,d.
similarly,the voters who signed the initiative petition here are entitled to have their decision implemented under section,which,like section,manifests the people power of initiative under the california constitution.we agree with the native american court analysis and conclusion that expiration of the statutory time frame within which a city council must either adopt,or set an election on,a qualified initiative under section or does not extinguish the city council mandatory and ministerial duty to do so.native american,supra,th at,d.the expiration of the statutory period to adopt the april initiative did not preclude the city council from adopting the unaltered initiative to correct its earlier inadvertent enactment of an incorrect version of the initiative.
b.the adoption of ordinance retroactive to the effective date of ordinance was proper 
the city retroactive enactment of ordinance was proper under the doctrine of relation also referred to as the doctrine of relation back a doctrine explained and applied in willett jordan cal d,willett.in willett,the secretary of state of california did not place a proposed initiative measure on the statewide general election ballot because on the last day allowed under the state constitution for county clerks to certify signatures on the initiative petition,the petition was about signatures short of the number required for placement on the ballot.however,four days later the county clerk of alameda county discovered that a mistake had been made in checking the signatures on file in his office and that there were actually about more qualified signatures than he had previously certified.the clerk sent the secretary of state a second certificate amending his original certificate as of the date of the original to show the true status of the petitions filed in his office,but the secretary of state refused to place the measure on the ballot on the ground that the amended certificate was untimely.the proponent of the initiative successfully petitioned the california supreme court for a writ of mandate compelling the secretary of state to recognize the amended certificate and place the measure on the ballot.willett jordan,supra,cal d at.
the proponent invoked,and the supreme court applied,the doctrine of relation,by which an act done at one time is considered,by a fiction of law,to have been done at some antecedent period.peyton desmond cir,quoting gibson chouteau wall.the willett court explained that the doctrine is of both equitable and legal cognizance.citation.it was promulgated for the purpose of promoting justice or preventing injustice and is applicable where several proceedings are essential to complete a particular transaction.citation.when it is invoked the doctrine must be based on some antecedent lawful right citation,and when there is otherwise no remedy.citations.although applied usually in private transactions,it can also be applied in an initiative proceeding willett jordan,supra,cal d at.
the willett court decided that application of the doctrine of relation was proper because the proponents of the initiative had done everything required of them by law to have the measure placed on the ballot.they were not at fault for the errors made by the county clerk,and no private rights would be prejudiced by application of the doctrine.the willett court concluded to refuse application of the doctrine under the facts here disclosed would countenance a palpable injustice to those who,at great expense and effort,did all that was required of them by law and had established the antecedent right to have their petition recognized as sufficient.the correction of the admitted mistake of the public officer,the county clerk,and the amendment of the original certificates by him must therefore be deemed to date back to the time of the filing of the certificates originally filed in the office of the secretary of state.when this is done,the duty of the secretary of state to put the measure on the ballot is plain.willett jordan,supra,cal d at.
application of the doctrine of relation is equally proper here.the proponents of the initiative did everything required of them by law to have their proposed ordinance adopted by the city council or submitted to the voters under section,and were not at fault for the city errors that resulted in the city council adoption of an incorrect version of the initiative.mhc has not articulated any private rights that would be prejudiced by application of the doctrine.although mhc contends that willett is demonstrably inapposite here because of the intervening injury to mhc,mhc is not referring to injury caused by the enforcement of ordinance as opposed to ordinance,but rather to its claimed injury resulting from the application of either ordinance or as opposed to the ordinances 
in supplemental briefing,mhc cites the rule that a statute will not be given retroactive operation unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally intended that it operate retroactively.myers philip morris companies,cal th,d,myers.mhc argues that ordinance did not clearly and unequivocally convey that the city council intended it to apply retroactively.we disagree.as noted,section of ordinance provides the text of ordinance is corrected to read exactly as in the initiative petition submitted and circulated by the committee to restore fairness,without alteration.this correction is made effective as of the effective date of ordinance.italics added.the italicized language conveys the city council clear and unequivocal intent that ordinance apply retroactively to the effective date of ordinance.
mhc also argues that ordinance can not be given retroactive operation because it would interfere with antecedent rights myers,supra,cal th at,d,or substantially change the legal consequences of past events western security bank superior court cal th,d.mhc maintains that because ordinance was void ab initio,there was either no mobilehome rent control ordinance in effect during the relevant period,or the rent control ordinances that ordinance was intended to replace remained in effect.in either case,mhc contends that retroactive application of ordinance would cause it to suffer adverse and onerous consequences in the form of lost rent receipts,with a resulting reduction in the value of its mobilehome park.
we reject mhc argument that ordinance may not be applied retroactively.as mhc notes in its supplemental brief,the presumption against retroactive operation of legislative enactments is rooted in the constitutional principle that i n a free,dynamic society,creativity in both commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people confidence about the legal consequences of their actions.myers,supra,cal th at,d,quoting landgraf usi film products,d.between the effective date of ordinance and the city enactment of ordinance,the city did not enforce the preceding mobilehome rent control ordinances,and it did not abandon rent control altogether.rather,the city enforced ordinance.accordingly,there is no conflict between the legal consequences of mhc actions during that time period under retroactive application of ordinance and mhc perception of those consequences during that,as we will discuss post,to the extent those consequences may be adversely impacted by differences between ordinance and ordinance.
as was the case in willett,to refuse to apply the doctrine of relation here to give ordinance retroactive operation would countenance a palpable injustice to those who,at great expense and effort,did all that was required of them by law and had established the antecedent right to have their petitions recognized as sufficient willett jordan,supra,cal d at,and,accordingly,to have their proposed ordinance adopted by the city.the city council properly made ordinance retroactively effective to the effective date of ordinance.
c.the enactment of ordinance is not prohibited under section 
the city contends the court erred by ruling that section precluded it from amending ordinance by enacting ordinance.section provides that n o ordinance that is proposed by initiative petition and adopted by the vote of the legislative body of the city without submission to the voters shall be repealed or amended except by a vote of the people,unless provision is otherwise made in the original ordinance.the purpose of section is to protect the electorate constitutional right to initiative by preventing successful initiatives from being undermined through amendment by hostile legislative bodies.devita county of napa cal th,d.
the court alluded to section in its statement of decision,stating that nothing in ordinance permitted the city council to amend it through the adoption of a subsequent ordinance.the court expressly cited section as authority for its ruling that to the extent that ordinance adopted by the city for the purpose of curing error in is a city created measure,it purports to amend the text of a voter initiative,albeit uncirculated,and is therefore void.mhc argues that because ordinance contained no provision allowing it to be amended by the city council,mhc was entitled to assume that it would,in mhc words,stand or fall on its own merit except through a duly scheduled election.
the city council did not violate section by enacting ordinance because ordinance did not amend an ordinance that was proposed by initiative and properly adopted under section.rather,ordinance cured the city erroneous adoption of an ordinance that did not exactly match the language of the ordinance,as required by section.it is contradictory for mhc to argue on the one hand that section prohibited the city council from amending ordinance because the ordinance was proposed by an initiative petition,and to argue on the other hand that ordinance was invalid under section because it was not the ordinance proposed by the initiative petition.the city council enactment of ordinance to accurately reflect the will of the electors who signed the initiative petition comported with,rather than violated,the provision of section prohibiting the city council from amending the initiative ordinance,since it corrected the improper changes to the initiative that resulted from the inadvertent enactment of ordinance.
d.the ballot title and summary that circulated with the april initiative petition accurately reflect the substance of the initiative 
the city contends the court erred in ruling ordinance was invalid on the ground that a ballot title and summary was not prepared for the april initiative.when,as here,there is no dispute about the format of an initiative petition presented to the city clerk,and the issue on appeal is whether the petition substantially complies with the ballot title and summary requirements of section,subdivision b we review the matter de novo.alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,d.
t echnical deficiencies in referendum and initiative petitions will not invalidate the petitions if they are in substantial compliance with statutory and constitutional requirements.citation.a paramount concern in determining whether a petition is valid despite an alleged defect is whether the purpose of the technical requirement is frustrated by the defective form of the petition.assembly deukmejian cal d.the purposes served by the ballot title and summary requirement of section,subdivision b,are to reduce the risk that voters were misled when signing the petition to allow verification that the signers had a neutral explanation of the proposed ordinance available to them when they signed and to prevent signatures from being submitted in support of a different measure than that for which they were procured.alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade,supra,th at,d.
based on our own comparison of the ballot title and summary circulated with the april initiative petition with the sections of the april initiative addressed by the summary,we are satisfied that the title and summary accurately reflect the substance of the april initiative and therefore did not frustrate the purposes of the title and summary requirement of section.the differences between the full text of ordinance the march initiative and full text of the april initiative adopted as ordinance are sufficiently material to contravene section,which requires that a qualified initiative be adopted without alteration.however,they do not go to the heart of the circulated initiative,and thus do not render the ballot title and summary prepared for the uncirculated march initiative misleading as to the circulated april initiative the court final statement of decision and judgment includes a comparison of the provisions of ordinance and the corresponding provisions of ordinance that the court determined were materially different from their ordinance counterparts.of the six provisions specified by the court,only three are reflected in the summary that circulated with the april initiative petition.the first is section l b of the ordinances,which in ordinance requires that the manufactured home fair practices commission the commission give notice of meetings to representatives of the homeowners associations.in ordinance,that provision is changed to require that the same notice be given to representatives of the resident homeowners associations.italics added.the ballot summary notes simply that the initiative requires the commission to give homeowners associations notice of commission meetings.although the change from homeowners associations to resident homeowners associations is sufficient to contravene section,it is not a sufficient alteration to render the ballot summary not in substantial compliance with section.the use of the term homeowners associations in the summary adequately apprised voters of the general notice requirement under section l b of ordinance and did not create a risk that voters signing the initiative petition were misled.
the second altered provision reflected in the ballot summary is section b of the ordinances.in ordinance,that provision requires that a space rent agreement be consented to by percent of homeowner occupied rental spaces within a mobilehome park the corresponding provision in ordinance requires the consent of percent of the occupied manufactured home rental spaces within the park the ballot summary adequately reflects either provision by stating simply that of the qualified voters must approve the proposed rent schedule.italics added.
the third altered provision specified by the court and addressed by the ballot summary is section d of the ordinances.in ordinance,this provision allows a park resident to sublet a residence under certain conditions,while the corresponding provision in ordinance limits the right to sublet to a homeowner.italics added.the ballot summary reflects the sublease provision in ordinance more accurately than the corresponding provision in ordinance,as it states the initiative includes an express provision allowing homeowners to sublet under certain conditions.
thus,while the initiative petition technically did not comply with section because the city attorney did not prepare a ballot title and summary specifically for the april initiative,the petition substantially complied with section because the ballot title and summary that circulated with it accurately reflected the substance of the accompanying april initiative and did not create a risk that voters signing the petition would be misled about the substance of the initiative.the ballot summary technical noncompliance with section did not infringe the electors constitutional right of initiative.
ii.the rulings in the trial court final statement of decision and judgment that are not challenged on appeal are part of the judgment and are binding 
a.the scope of the judgment 
in the first two parts of the decision portion of the court final statement of decision and judgment the court explained the basis for its determination that ordinance and ordinance were void despite finding both ordinances void in their entirety,in sections through of the decision,the court addressed various challenges mhc made to particular sections common to both ordinances,and decided that various provisions either violated the california constitution or were preempted by the mrl.we issued the following request for supplemental briefing regarding those rulings if this court were to determine that ordinance was properly adopted to correct the errors in the adoption of ordinance,what would be the legal effect,if any,of the trial court findings and rulings set forth in parts through of the final statement of decision and judgment 
because none of the rulings in parts through of the court decision were challenged on appeal,we were not seeking supplemental briefing regarding the correctness of those rulings,but rather on whether they should be viewed as part of the judgment despite not being set forth in the judgment part of the court final statement of decision and judgment.the city argues in its supplemental brief that the portions of the ordinance the court found to be unconstitutional or preempted by the mrl are severable from the remainder of ordinance and that the remaining portions of the ordinance are valid and enforceable.mhc contends the court ruling that certain attorney fee and assessment provisions of ordinance are unconstitutional because they infringe mhc right to petition the city for rent adjustments renders the entire ordinance void.
significantly,the supplemental briefs of both parties reflect their common position that the rulings in parts through of the court decision are part of the judgment.although generally a statement of decision is not a judgment see industrial indemnity city and county of san francisco d,fn,under the circumstances of this case we agree with the parties implied view that the judgment in this case includes the entire final statement of decision and judgment,and not just part under the heading judgment.code of civil procedure section defines judgment as the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.it is not the form of the decree but the substance and effect of the adjudication which is determinative.as a general test,it may be said that where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with the terms of the first decree,that decree is final citations.griset fair political practices com.cal th,d.accordingly,a memorandum of decision may be treated as an appealable order or judgment when it is signed and filed,and when it constitutes the trial judge determination on the merits.citations.estate of lock d.here,because the final statement of decision and judgment clearly sets forth the court final determination on the merits of the various issues not challenged on appeal,we treat the entire document as the judgment.
b.the portions of ordinance that the trial court determined were unconstitutional or preempted are severable 
the city contends that the court rulings that certain provisions of ordinance are unconstitutional or are preempted by the mrl may be severed from the ordinance under the ordinance severability clause and california law,and that the remainder of the ordinance is operative mhc contends that the court ruling that the attorney fees and assessment provisions of ordinance unconstitutionally infringe mhc right to petition the city for rent adjustments renders the entire ordinance void.we agree with the city.
if an invalid provision of an initiative or ordinance is severable,it is stricken from the ordinance and the remaining provisions are given effect.pala band of mission indians board of supervisors th,d in re portnoy cal d.when the ordinance contains a severability clause,an invalid provision is severable if it is grammatically,functionally,and volitionally separable.pala band of mission indians,supra,th at,d calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d.an enactment passes the grammatical test where the language of the statute is mechanically severable,that is,where the valid and invalid parts can be separated by paragraph,sentence,clause,phrase,or even single words.citations.citation.people library one,d.a provision is functionally severable if it is capable of independent application.in order to pass this test t he remaining provisions must stand on their own,unaided by the invalid provisions nor rendered vague by their absence nor inextricably connected to them by policy considerations.citation.id.at.barlow davis th,d.the volitional requirement for severability is met if the voters likely would have adopted the initiative without the invalid provisions.calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d at,pala band of mission indians,supra,th at,d.
we conclude each of the provisions the court found to be invalid is grammatically,functionally,and volitionally separable.in part of the decision the court noted that the city the notice required to be given under section of ordinance,by park owners claiming an exemption under civil code section of the mrl is preempted by that statute.again noting the city concession,in part of the decision the court ruled that section of ordinance setting forth requirements for subletting mobilehomes,was preempted by civil code section,and that section o of the ordinances,extending the applicability of civil code sections and to prospective purchasers of mobilehomes,was preempted by those two statutes in part of the decision,the court ruled the following provisions in both ordinances were preempted by the mrl section p,extending the provisions of the mrl to the provisions of the ordinance the provision in section b,subjecting persons who demand,accept or retain any payment in violation of the ordinance to treble damages and section k,providing for criminal penalties for violations of the ordinance.each of these preempted provisions can be grammatically and functionally separated from ordinance,and it is unlikely their omission from the initiative would have affected the petition success,as they do not go to the heart of the rent control initiative,and the matters they address are adequately covered by the mrl.
in part of the decision,the court ruled that t he assessment,cost and attorneys fees provisions contained in sections,and of ordinance operate to chill mhc right to petition the city respecting its constitutional right to seek rent adjustments greater than the maximum allowed under those ordinances and,therefore,violate mhc rights under article i,section of the california constitution.in the order in which the court addressed them in its statement of decision,the specific ordinance provisions the court found to be unconstitutional are ordinance sections f,f,and a,b and c 
section f of ordinance requires a park owner applying for a rent adjustment to pay an application fee.it is grammatically and functionally severable and it is unlikely that omission of the requirement of an application fee from the ordinance would have significantly affected voter support for the initiative proposing the ordinance.
section f of ordinance provides that if a park owner unsuccessfully applies for a rent adjustment under certain provisions of the ordinance and is not awarded a rent increase in excess of the increase to which the owner is entitled under other adjustment provisions of the ordinance,the owner will be required to pay reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by homeowners or by the homeowners association in opposing the park owner application.this provision is also grammatically and functionally severable,and it is tangential to ordinance main provisions reducing allowable rent increases by park owners.accordingly,there is no reason to view it as critical to the success of the initiative petition proposing the ordinance.similarly,the provisions concerning the legal defense assessment in section a,b and c of ordinance are grammatically and functionally severable from section of the ordinance,and are volitionally severable because it is unlikely the success of the initiative petition turned on their presence in the proposed ordinance.
mhc cites birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d,birkenfeld for the proposition that any rent control law that fails to provide a fair and adequate procedure for obtaining discretionary rent increases is facially unconstitutional.noting that the trial court cited birkenfeld in ruling that the assessment,cost and attorney fees provisions in sections,and of ordinances and were unconstitutional,mhc contends the legal effect of the trial court birkenfeld holding is to render ordinance and unenforceable for facial unconstitutionality.
birkenfeld is inapposite.birkenfeld was a class action brought by berkeley landlords challenging an amendment to the city charter that imposed residential rent control.the birkenfeld court concluded the charter amendment was unconstitutional because the rent adjustment procedure it created drastically and unnecessarily restricted the rent control board power to adjust maximum rents without unreasonable delay,making inevitable the arbitrary imposition of unreasonably low rent ceilings.birkenfeld,supra,cal d at.the overall rent adjustment procedure in birkenfeld was so riddled with defects that it inherently and unnecessarily precluded reasonably prompt action on a rent adjustment application except perhaps for a lucky few.id.at.the birkenfeld court determined that the invalid limitations on the rent control board powers to adjust maximum rents could not be severed from the remainder of the charter amendment,stating the constitutional defect can not be cured simply by excision but only by additional provisions that are beyond our power to provide.id.at.
thus,birkenfeld supports the proposition that a rent control ordinance is facially unconstitutional if it does not provide a fair and adequate procedure for obtaining discretionary rent increases,and the defects in the procedure can not be cured by severing invalid provisions from the ordinance,but only by adding curative provisions to the ordinance.here,the trial court did not find that the overall rent adjustment procedure set forth in ordinance was inherently unfair or unconstitutional the court simply found that specific assessment,cost and attorney fees provisions relating to the rent adjustment procedure violated mhc right of petition under article i,section of the california constitution.as discussed above,these offending provisions can be severed from ordinance without impairing the ordinance key rent control and rent adjustment application provisions.they do not render ordinance entirely invalid.however,the matter should be remanded for the trial court to determine whether mhc suffered any legally remediable injury as a result of enforcement of any of the provisions in ordinances and that the court found to be unconstitutional and,if so,the proper remedy for such injury.
iii.the impact on mhc of ordinance versus ordinance 
between the effective date of ordinance and the enactment of ordinance,the operative ordinance enforced by the city was ordinance.we requested supplemental briefing on the differences,if any,in the impact of ordinance and the impact of ordinance on mhc.our concern is whether the retroactive application of ordinance to the effective date of ordinance interferes with antecedent rights mhc enjoyed under ordinance.
mhc claims that ordinance is significantly more onerous than ordinance in several respects we conclude that whether any differences between ordinance and ordinance caused mhc to suffer remediable harm,as a result of the city enforcement of ordinance rather than ordinance prior to the enactment of ordinance,is a factual issue,and thus is not properly decided by this court.accordingly,we will remand the case for the trial court to determine whether mhc suffered any legally remediable injury as a result of the retroactive application of ordinance to the effective date of ordinance and,if so,the proper remedy.
iv.mhc is not entitled to attorney fees under either code of civil procedure section or civil code section 
our reversal of the portion of the judgment declaring ordinance void and enjoining its enforcement renders mhc appeal from the order denying its motion for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section and its motion for judicial notice of the city demographics moot.in any event,we find no abuse of discretion in the court denial of private attorney general fees to mhc.we agree with the trial court suggestion that the outcome of the trial of mhc lawsuit benefited mhc,and did not benefit a large class of persons or the general public the city enactment of ordinance to accurately reflect the will of the electors who signed the initiative petition protected,rather than infringed,the electorate constitutional right to initiative mhc bid to invalidate ordinance had the opposite effect.
mhc also sought attorney fees under civil code section,which provides in any action arising out of the provisions of this chapter the the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs.a party shall be deemed a prevailing party for the purposes of this section if the judgment is rendered in his or her favor or where the litigation is dismissed in his or her favor prior to or during the trial,unless the parties otherwise agree in the settlement or compromise.mhc contends it is entitled to attorney fees under that statute because it prevailed on its mrl preemption claims,and those claims arose under the mrl.
an order granting or denying an award of attorney fees is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard of review however,the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs have been met is a question of law.citations.salawy ocean towers housing th,d.accordingly,mhc entitlement to attorney fees under civil code section is a question of law subject to de novo review.
asserting that the phrase arising out of in civil code section is the broadest connective phrase in california jurisprudence,mhc position is essentially that its mrl preemption claims arise out of the mrl within the meaning of civil code section because they relate to the mrl.we construe the phrase arising out of more narrowly and conclude that mhc preemption claims do not arise out of the mrl within the meaning of civil code section.
the fact that a declaratory relief cause of action relates to a particular statute or statutory scheme does not necessarily mean that the cause of action arises out of the statute or scheme.for example,in patel athow d,the
