plaintiff christine kasparian appeals from the summary judgment entered in favor of defendant avalonbay communities,landlord on the ground a recessed drain,as a matter of law,was both an open and obvious condition and a trivial defect,which negated any duty of care on the part of landlord to the kasparian who sustained severe injuries from a fall after she tripped we reverse the judgment.
kasparian contends summary judgment was improper,because competing expert declarations were in direct conflict on certain material factual issues.she assigns the following as unresolved material issues of fact whether the drain design and configuration met industry standards and building code requirements whether its size and dimensions in view of the surrounding circumstances rendered the recessed drain hazardous and whether landlord breached its duty of safety in managing and maintaining the apartment complex common area by failing to comply with its own inspection protocol.she also contends summary judgment was improper,because landlord statement of undisputed facts failed to address each of the two causes of action in the complaint.
based on our review of the record and applicable law,we conclude landlord was not entitled to summary judgment.the trial court erred in finding,as a matter of law,the recessed drain was both an open and obvious condition and a trivial defect.whether the recessed drain grate constituted a hazardous condition presents a material issue for the trier of fact to determine 
we conclude where the trial court grants summary judgment on the ground,as a matter of law,the alleged defect was open and obvious based on its personal inspection of photographs,the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court determinations.rather,the reviewing court takes a fresh look at the photographs relied upon by the trial court and examines the photographs de novo.summary judgment can not be based on photographs where the reviewing court concludes either reasonable minds might differ regarding whether the photographs correctly depict the alleged defect and the surrounding environs or whether the photographs conclusively establish the defect was open and obvious.we find the photographs before the trial court in this case are not conclusive on this issue and thus triable issues remain,requiring a reversal of the summary judgment.
facts and proceeding below 
undisputed relevant facts 
on october,kasparian resided in,a ground floor apartment at the avalonbay apartments.about,kasparian fell to the ground as she walked along the brick paver walkway from her apartment en route to a trash receptacle.she sustained a cervical fracture and broken teeth.when she fell,kasparian was carrying a trash bag and a purse in her left hand and using her cane,which was in her right hand kasparian always followed the same path from her apartment to reach the trash receptacle next to the elevator.as a cautious person,kasparian looked where she was walking.prior to the date of her fall,she had noticed the drains in the walkway and specifically the drain in question.she did not recall ever having a problem with that particular drain.
pertinent procedural matters and proceedings 
on october,kasparian filed a complaint against landlord pleading two causes of action,respectively,negligence and premises liability,based on the same factual allegations,namely,kasparian was walking in the common walkway of the apartment complex where she resided when she sustained continuing,severe injuries after suddenly tripping and falling due to the uneven nature of the bricks used to cover said walkway in a negligent fashion,which was a dangerous condition created by landlord.landlord filed an answer generally denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses.
landlord moved for summary judgment on the grounds the recessed drain was not an actionable defect,because t he drain was installed inch below the pavement in compliance with industry standards t he deviation of inch on the pedestrian walkway constituted a trivial defect and t he contrast between the drain and the adjacent pavers and kasparian admitted awareness of the drain make the condition open and obvious.
in her opposition,kasparian disputed the trivial defect defense was applicable,because the subject condition involved the design and placement of a recessed drain,not one involving wear and tear over time.she argued triable issues of material fact existed regarding the size and dimensions of the recessed drain whether its placement and installation were within industry standards whether the recessed drain constituted a dangerous condition of property in view of the totality of the circumstances and whether such condition was open and obvious.kasparian further argued even if this condition were open and obvious,landlord was under a duty to maintain the premises in a safe condition.she argued summary judgment also was improper,because landlord separate statement did not address each of the two causes of action.
landlord filed a reply attacking as nonsensical kasparian claim the trivial defect defense did not apply.landlord argued kasparian raised facts and issues irrelevant to whether summary judgment should be granted.it argued summary judgment was not foreclosed by the omission of its settled statement to address both causes of action separately and offered to file an amended settled statement.landlord further argued its description of the drain grate and kasparian were not substantially different and invited the trial court to view the photographs submitted by both to make its own determination whether the drain,within its surroundings,is a trivial defect,or a dangerous condition.
on november,following a hearing,the trial court granted landlord motion for summary judgment.the court made these findings the drain was an open and obvious condition that kasparian had seen before and the drain was a trivial defect because its depth was less than half an inch and the circumstances show that kasparian tripped on the drain at approximately on a sunny day with no rain the area was nothing obstructed plaintiff view and no debris or foreign material was on the ground.
during the hearing,the trial court concluded landlord owed no duty to kasparian,because the evidence showed the drain was an open and obvious condition,rather than a hidden danger.in this regard,the court noted kasparian admitted in her deposition she had noticed this particular drain when traveling from her apartment to the trash receptacle before the date of her fall,and the court found a useful visual of the drain is provided by landlord expert,carl sheriff,who includes photographs of the drain in exhibit to his declaration.
the trial court further concluded landlord also did not owe kasparian a duty,because the evidence demonstrated the drain was a trivial defect.according to the declaration of landlord expert,the drain was imbedded in the walkway in the manner required by industry guidelines and the drain was imbedded to of an inch below the walkway.the court noted this depth was less than the inch depth of the sidewalk crack found to be trivial in ursino big boy restaurants d.ursino.as for the surrounding circumstances,the court noted kasparian admitted in her deposition that she fell at about,on a sunny day with no rain,that the area was well lit,that nothing obstructed her view of the drain,and that there was no debris or other foreign material on the ground.
although noting the declaration of kasparian expert set forth a different drain depth,the trial court found such differing measurements did not create a factual issue as to the existence of a trivial defect.the court explained t he greatest depth measured by kasparian expert is of an inch,which is only of an inch more than the of a n inch measured by landlord expert.
the trial court found irrelevant kasparian argument landlord owed her a duty to inspect for dangerous conditions and maintain inspection records,because the evidence shows landlord had no duty to discover,repair,or warn her about the drain for the reason it was open and obvious and trivial.
the court rejected as unpersuasive kasparian arguments about the impropriety of landlord separate statement and the inapplicability of the trivial defect defense.
on december,the trial court entered an order granting landlord summary judgment motion.the order contained these recitals the reportedly dangerous condition was both open and obvious and constituted a trivial defect.landlord breached no duty to kasparian.this determination is based upon the papers submitted by both parties in connection with the motion and upon the holding in ursino landlord inspection practices were irrelevant because there was no duty to warn as there was no defective condition kasparian purported distinction that this case does not involve a crack is not supported by any citation to law and the condition at issue,as a matter of law and fact did not constitute a dangerous condition and the purported difference in measurements as asserted by the experts who presented declarations did not create or illustrate a defect beyond a trivial defect.
discussion 
standard of review 
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.the trial court grant of summary judgment is subject to de novo review.we independently determine whether the parties have met their respective burdens and whether no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
a moving defendant may prevail by presenting evidence conclusively negating an element of the plaintiff cause of action or,alternatively,the defendant may present evidence to show one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established by the plaintiff 
in order to meet the initial burden,the defendant must present evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding it was more likely than not the material fact was true citation,or the defendant must establish an element of the claim can not be established,by presenting evidence the plaintiff does not possess and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.citation.once this burden has been met,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate through specific facts,not simply allegations in the pleadings,the existence of a triable material factual issue as to the cause of action 
as a reviewing court,we consider the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party,liberally construing the opposing party evidence and strictly scrutinizing the moving party we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons or rationales.citation.summary judgment is a drastic remedy to be used sparingly,and any doubts about the propriety of summary judgment must be resolved in favor of the opposing party.citations.
ii.competing and conflicting expert declarations 
supporting and opposing expert declarations 
in his supporting declaration,carl sheriff,landlord reconstruction and safety,opined the subject configuration does not pose an unreasonable risk of harm to someone exercising due care in traversing the subject walkway.it is further my professional opinion that the imbedding of the drain in the subject concrete paver walkway is not a defect at all,but rather,is the preferred and proper method of installing a walkway drain.
based on his personal inspection of the subject site,sheriff concluded the drain in question was of metal composition,flat on its upper surface,and inches in diameter.the drain was imbedded in an interlocking concrete brick pavers walkway at a depth of no more than.he opined the imbedding of the subject drain in the concrete paver walkway at no more than a depth fully complies with all industry guidelines,and meets all industry standards for installation and safety.he stated t he american society for testing materials astm,as well as industry standards and product manufacturer s installation instructions specify drains placed in concrete brick paver walkways,the exact type of walkway that is at issue in this case,are to be installed to below the surface of the surrounding concrete brick pavers.
attached as exhibit to his declaration were copies of photographs he had taken of the drain,including his measurement of the depression caused by the drain,and of the surrounding area.
sheriff further stated he had reviewed the inspection records of the glendale department of building and safety and determined the entire avalon glendale apartment complex was approved by gdbs for code compliance and safety prior to its opening for business.
kasparian relied on declarations from two other experts to counter sheriff declaration.kasparian floor safety expert and consultant,kenneth newsome disagreed with sheriff opinion and conclusion the subject configuration does not pose an unreasonable risk of harm rather,it was newsome professional opinion the subject recessed drain,taken with the surrounding factors,presents a hazardous condition for someone who is used to being in a walkway where all of the other drain grates are flush to the surrounding surface of the pavers.
newsome stated t he slope to the drain in the walk path is dramatically more severe than that found in customary drains.moreover,there are no warnings or color distinctions to warn pedestrians of the fact that the drain is recessed.kasparian would have a reasonable expectation of safety when walking through this area and the management should have recognized this hazardous anomaly.
based on his personal inspection of the site,newsome concluded t he subject drain is of metal composition,flat on its upper surface,and measuring inches in diameter and the drain cover is imbedded in an interlocking concrete walkway.the hole created for the drain grate is uneven,with heights ranging from inch to inch.he used the profile imager to depict the condition.the size and profile of the depression created for the grate varies from one end to the other which poses a safety hazard to pedestrians who do not have any expectation any drain is not flush with the surrounding brick pavers.
newsome opined t he existing profile would allow a foot to come to an abrupt stop against a vertical surface that exceeds the standard of care abrupt level change.he explained t he abrupt change in level here amounts to a hazard per sic the california uniform building code and the american with disabilities act in that it exceeds inch.he stated astem f,the americans with disabilities act,and the california uniform building code identify any abrupt change in level that exceeds inch as a hazard.this provision of the building and safety code applies to the location of kasparian accident as an apartment building is considered a public building and is covered by occupancy b of the code.
he opined t he surrounding circumstances of the location of the accident make the area very hazardous given that the drains from a distance appear similar in color to the the drains are not distinguishable by color and texture from the surrounding pavers the drains in the area are not all flush with the adjacent brick pavers which surround the drains and in the totality of the circumstances can not be easily detected even in daylight.he explained t he survey of the other drains immediately near unit,on both sides of the drain in question,confirms those drain covers are flush with the surface,and the slope to the drain is nearly level unlike the drain in question.
in his opposing declaration,peter panossian,a licensed general contractor who had constructed various apartment complexes and condominium projects both in and outside of the city of glendale,stated he was familiar with the construction industry standards as well as the city of glendale municipal code requirements for construction and design of residential dwellings and walkways within such premises.panossian opined the location where kasparian fell was not in compliance with the glendale city building code or standard construction practices in that the drain was not flush with the surrounding brick pavers.
panossian explained the code provisions in effect at the time of the accident applicable to the residential apartment complex where the accident occurred,as well as construction industry standards,require any brick pavers installed on a walkway must be flush with any drains placed within the brick pavers.he opined t he slightest change in elevation will cause tripping and slipping hazards to users of such premises.
he stated all other drains in the immediate vicinity of the drain involved in kasparian accident are flush with the ground unlike the drain on which her foot became caught and opined this fact creates a hazard for users of the walkway who have an expectation that all the drains in the walkways will be flush with the surrounding brick pavers.
panossian further opined the location where kasparian fell was not in compliance with the city building code or standard construction practices in that changes in elevation between the drain and the brick pavers should have been made beneath the brick pavers and not between the pavers and the drains.he explained the code and construction industry standards require in the event the area around a drain is to be sloped for drainage purposes,the grading must occur beneath the surface of the brick pavers and not between the brick pavers and the surface drains.it is his understanding that while the area beneath the brick pavers in question was compacted sand,the grading which occurred was to the surface area as opposed to the subterranean portion which is required by the building code.
waiver if no ruling on evidentiary objections 
objections were filed to certain evidence relied on by kasparian in opposition to its summary judgment motion.landlord objected to the entirety of panossian declaration on the grounds it lacks foundation it is hearsay,it deals with an improper subject of expert opinion and it is speculative,specifically in reference to the purported applicability of the glendale municipal code none of whose provisions are cited.as authority,landlord cited caloroso hathaway th,d caloroso and ursino,supra,d.
relying on this case authority,landlord also objected to the entirety of newsome declaration.it objected specifically to paragraphs through of the declaration on the grounds the declaration lacks foundation it is hearsay it is the improper subject of expert opinion and it is speculative,particularly with reference to the americans with disability act,the california uniform building code,astmf,and any opinion the drain grate in this case,with surrounding circumstances,constitutes a dangerous condition.
the trial court never ruled on these objections.accordingly,whether these objections are meritorious is a matter not before us,and none of the matters objected to by landlord is excluded.w here counsel fails to obtain rulings on evidentiary objections to opposition evidence in summary judgment proceedings,the objections are waived and are not preserved for appeal.citation.
iii.whether recessed drain was open and obvious remains a disposed issue 
the record does not support the trial court finding the recessed drain condition was,as a matter of law,open and obvious.in making this finding,the trial court relied on copies of photographs taken by sheriff,landlord expert,and attached as exhibit to his declaration.
whether a trial court findings based on its inspection of photographs of the alleged defective condition are conclusive has been addressed in several published cases.in ursino,the plaintiff suffered a fractured hip,among other injuries,when she allegedly tripped over the raised edge of one section of the defendant walkway.in conjunction with a defense summary judgment motion,the parties stipulated to various facts,including the edge of the cement section in question was raised no higher than of an inch and the photographs presented to the trial court accurately depicted the sidewalk in question on the day of the accident.in granting summary judgment,the trial court concluded in view of the stipulated facts,reasonable minds could not differ as to the triviality of the defect.the appellate court stated it had reviewed the pictures of the sidewalk and agree d with the trial court that reasonable minds could not differ and that the defect was in fact trivial.
similarly,in caloroso,the appellate court affirmed a summary judgment based on its own review of the photographs relied upon by the trial court.in that case,plaintiff josephine caloroso allegedly tripped over a crack in the walkway in front of defendant home,which walkway allegedly consisted of individual concrete slabs that were cracked,jagged,and depressed.it was undisputed that the difference in elevation created by the crack in defendant walkway was less than half an inch at the highest point.the reviewing court concluded here,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that,in this case,no expert was needed to decide whether the size or irregular shape of the crack rendered it dangerous.the photographs of the crack submitted by both sides demonstrate that the crack is minor and any irregularity in shape is minimal.
we also conclude appellate review of the photographs relied upon by the trial court is subject to a de novo standard and therefore hold where the trial court grants summary judgment on the ground,as a matter of law,the alleged defect was open and obvious based on its inspection of photographs,the trial court determinations are not binding on the reviewing court.it is incumbent on the reviewing court to examine the photographs for itself and make its own determinations.
we further conclude in examining photographs,the court,whether the trial or reviewing court,should take into account such factors as the photograph subject,its focal point the view of the subject,distant,isolated,in context the photograph perspective,overhead,the use of any altering devices,camera color filter,lens,the characteristics of the photograph,sharp and clear,blurry,grainy,color or black and white whether the photograph was taken under identical or substantially similar conditions,timing,lighting,weather and any other relevant circumstances,addition of extrinsic aids,such as a ruler or pointer.
as a reviewing court,we thus are obligated to examine anew the photographs relied upon by the trial court mindful of the above factors and reach our own independent conclusions,which we now do.
the trial court finding of the open and obvious recessed nature of the drain is contrary to,and can not be harmonized with,our examination of the same photographic evidence.thus,contrary to the appellate court review of the photographic evidence the trial courts found conclusive in ursino and caloroso our review of the photographs here leads to a contrary result.based on the photographic evidence before the trial judge in this case,we find reasonable minds could differ as to whether this defect was trivial or open and obvious.consequently,a triable issue remains and summary judgment can not be predicated on the photographs on which the trial court relied.
in his declaration,sheriff stated he personally took the photographs in exhibit,which depict the subject drain that kasparian identified in her deposition as being the drain that was the site and cause of her fall the area immediately surrounding the subject drain and the measurements he took of the depression caused by the subject drain.
exhibit consists of black and white copies of five photographs.the first appears to be an overview of a walkway or path between two curving,walled,and raised planter areas.no drain in the walkway is visible.the second is a photograph of the round drain in the walkway taken from the perspective of someone a short distance away from the drain.the drain and the surrounding portion of the walkway are in the shadow of what appears to be some sort of dense foliage.the outlines of the drain appear blurred,and no depression or defect can be ascertained.the third photograph was taken at ground level and depicts a ruler stuck vertically into the drain.from this angle and perspective,the viewer is able to observe the drain surface appears recessed in an uneven,jagged manner.the fourth photograph is an overhead shot of the drain as set into the walkway.from this perspective,the drain appears leve
