factual and procedural background 
defendant and appellant mahvash mazgani owns a triplex in the westwood area of the city of los angeles.the property is subject to the los angeles rent stabilization ordinance rso,which restricts the circumstances in which a landlord may effect an eviction.los angeles municipal code lamc,a see also,subd.a.plaintiff and appellant karen clark was mazgani tenant for about eight years and paid a monthly rent of approximately.the rso permits eviction of a tenant from a apartment if the landlord intends to remove the unit from the rental market in order to free it for occupancy by a member of his or her immediate family.lamc,a a,subd.a.
in january,after serving and filing the requisite notices,mazgani filed an unlawful detainer action against clark to evict her from her apartment so mazgani daughter could move into that unit.mazgani prevailed in that action,and clark was evicted in april.
in september,clark filed this action against mazgani.clark alleged three causes of action violation of the rso,fraud,and unfair business practices in violation of bus.clark alleged that,following her eviction,mazgani daughter never moved into clark former apartment.clark claimed mazgani made fraudulent misrepresentations in the unlawful detainer action and never meant for her daughter to reside in clark former apartment.instead,and in violation of the rso,mazgani purposefully kept the apartment unoccupied at least until this lawsuit was filed and performed renovations,with the goal of the unit to a new tenant for a higher monthly rent.clark sought an order reinstating her tenancy,and statutory and punitive damages.in addition,under the rso,mazgani was required to pay clark a relocation fee at the time of her eviction.lamc,g,g mazgani had acknowledged that debt and had given clark a check for that amount.however,she stopped payment on her check.clark claimed mazgani still owed her the relocation fee.

discussion 
both sides filed timely appeals.we turn first to clark appeal,as our disposition of that matter renders mazgani appeal moot.
clark contends the trial court erred in granting the slapp motion because clark claim did not arise from mazgani protected activity taken in furtherance of her right of free speech or petition.we agree.
code of civil procedure section section sets forth the procedure for bringing a special motion to strike in lawsuits filed primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a kibler northern inyo county local hospital dist.cal th,d.the statute provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech includes any written or oral statement made before a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,or in connection with an issue under consideration by such body or in such proceeding,subd.e.if this showing is made,the movant need not separately demonstrate the statement also concerns an issue of public significance.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d.
the trial court undertakes a process in determining the merits of a slapp motion.first,in order for a complaint to be subject to a slapp motion,the court must decide if the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged claims arose from his or her protected activity.taus loftus cal th,d,kashian harriman th,d.if the defendant fails to satisfy this burden,the complaint is not subject to a motion to strike and the analysis ends.city of cotati cashman cal th,d.but,if the trial court finds such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.ibid.our review is de novo.marlin aimco venezia,llc th,d marlin.
in analyzing defendant burden under the first prong of the slapp analysis,the critical consideration is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant protected free speech or petitioning activity.navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier.the definitional focus is not on the form of the plaintiff cause of action,but on the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability.id.at,d.
there is no question that the prosecution of an unlawful detainer action is indisputably protected activity within the meaning of section.see jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d,navellier,supra,cal th at,d,birkner lam th,d birkner.
clark complaint,however,is not premised on mazgani protected activities of initiating or prosecuting the unlawful detainer action,but on her removal of the apartment from the rental market and fraudulent eviction of clark for the purpose of installing a family member who never moved in.terminating a tenancy or removing a property from the rental market are not activities taken in furtherance of the constitutional rights of petition or free speech.marlin,supra,th at,d santa monica rent control bd.pearl street,llc th,d.t he mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the statute.marlin,supra,th at,d,quoting navellier,supra,cal th at,d.the pivotal question is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant protected free speech or petitioning activity.ibid.
marlin is instructive.there,a landlord filed notice under the ellis act,et of its intention to permanently remove units from the rental market.the ellis act allows landlords who comply with its provisions to go out of the rental business even if doing so would otherwise violate a local rent control ordinance.tenants subjected to the notice sued the landlord challenging its right to invoke the ellis act.the landlord responded with a slapp motion,arguing the tenants action arose from the landlord filing and service of the ellis act notices.this district division seven disagreed.the court was willing to assume that filing and service of the eviction notices constituted protected free speech or petitioning activity,but concluded the landlord failed to show the lawsuit arose from any protected activity.the court reasoned that simply because an action was filed after ellis act notices were served and filed,did not mean it arose from or was based on those protected activities.marlin,supra,th at,d.rather,the cause of plaintiffs complaint was the landlords allegedly wrongful reliance on the ellis act as their authority for terminating plaintiffs tenancy.terminating a tenancy or removing a property from the rental
