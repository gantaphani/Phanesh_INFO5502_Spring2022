appellant mhc financing limited partnership two mhc owns and operates a mobilehome park the park in the city of santee the city.this consolidated appeal arises out of two lawsuits concerning the city mobilehome rent control ordinances.
the first lawsuit,filed by mhc against the city the mhc action,was the subject of a previous appeal in which we remanded to the superior court with directions that it determine whether mhc is entitled to recover damages from the city.mhc financing limited partnership two city of santee th,d mhc.the second lawsuit the city of santee action involves a complaint filed by the city against mhc,in which it seeks,among other things,restitution on behalf of the park tenants and a by mhc against the city alleging,among other things,that the city mobilehome rent control ordinances constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property and violate the right to substantive due process.
mhc appeal in the mhc action challenges the trial court ruling that mhc is not entitled to damages based on the issues that we specified in our remand directive.mhc appeal in the city of santee action challenges the trial court ruling sustaining a demurrer to mhc allegations that the city ordinances effected a private and physical taking of private property the trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of the city on all of the causes of action in mhc amended and the trial court ruling granting summary adjudication in favor of the city on its causes of action seeking restitution and an accounting on behalf of the park tenants.
as we will explain,in the published portion of our opinion we conclude that the trial court in the mhc action properly ruled that mhc was not entitled to damages,and we accordingly affirm the judgment in that action.with respect to the city of santee action,in the unpublished portion of our opinion we reverse in part and affirm in part.specifically,we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication in favor of the city on its causes of action seeking restitution and an accounting on behalf of the park tenants,but in all other respects,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the city rent control ordinances 
prior to november,the city municipal code regulated the rents charged by mobilehome park owners through ordinance,as amended by ordinance collectively,ordinances.
in a member of a group of mobilehome owners,acting under elections code section et,submitted to the city an initiative petition for a new mobilehome rent control ordinance.mhc,supra,th at,d.less than a month later,another member submitted a modified version of the initiative.ibid.after a petition containing the modified initiative was circulated and signed by more than percent of the city registered voters,the city council chose,pursuant to elections code section,to adopt the proposed ordinance,which was codified as ordinance and became effective on november.mhc,at,d.however,the city council inadvertently adopted the form of the ordinance proposed in the original initiative instead of the form of the ordinance proposed in the modified initiative.ibid.
in january,after becoming aware of the error,the city council enacted ordinance,which stated that the text of ordinance was corrected to contain the text of the ordinance set forth in the modified initiative circulated in,and that the correction was made retroactive to the effective date of ordinance.mhc,supra,th at,d.the city began enforcing ordinance on february.id.at,d.
b.the mhc action 
mhc filed a lawsuit against the city the mhc action.the mhc action asserted,among other things,a claim that the city had violated the elections code due to the city council mistake in adopting the wrong text for ordinance and attempting to correct the error by enacting ordinance and a claim that certain provisions of ordinance and ordinance violated mhc right to petition the government for a redress of grievances as guaranteed by article i,section,subdivision a of the california constitution hereafter,article i,section a 
on june,the trial court ruled,among other things,that ordinance and ordinance were void because the city had not complied with the elections code,and that certain provisions of the ordinances hereinafter,the unconstitutional provisions violated mhc right to petition under the california constitution addressing the remedy for the city violation of the elections code,the trial court stated that t he remedy of future rent increases,as opposed to an award of damages,will adequately compensate mhc.this remedy will place the cost of compensating mhc on those tenants who benefited from the invalid rent control ordinance.
the city appealed the ruling declaring ordinance and ordinance to be void because of noncompliance with the elections code,but it did not take issue with the trial court ruling that the unconstitutional provisions violated mhc right to petition under the california constitution.mhc,supra,th at,d.in january we reversed in part,concluding that the city council properly enacted ordinance and made it retroactively effective to cure the defects in ordinance.mhc,at,d.we remanded with the following instructions 
the matter is remanded for further proceedings to determine whether mhc suffered any legally remediable injury as a result of any differences between ordinance and ordinance and the retroactive application of ordinance to the effective date of ordinance whether mhc suffered any legally remediable injury as a result of enforcement of any of the provisions in ordinances and that the court found to be unconstitutional and the proper remedy for any such injury.id.at,d.
on remand the trial court conducted a bench trial on the issues specified in our opinion and issued a lengthy statement of decision.
in considering the first issue,the trial court extensively reviewed each of the differences between ordinance and ordinance that mhc had relied on for its damages argument,and it concluded that mhc had not established any injury from the retroactive application of ordinance to the time period between the enactment of ordinance and ordinance 
in considering the second issue,whether mhc suffered any legally remediable injury as a result of enforcement of the unconstitutional provisions in violation of mhc right to petition,the trial court made a ruling.
as the first part of its ruling,the trial court held that mhc was limited to declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy the violation of its right to petition under article i,section a.in support of this conclusion,the trial court cited decisions of our supreme court holding that a plaintiff may not recover damages as a remedy for an infringement of its right to free speech or a due process liberty interest arising under the california constitution.degrassi cook cal th,d,degrassi free speech katzberg regents of university of california cal th,d,katzberg due process liberty interest.in short,consistent with our remand directive,the trial court concluded that any injury mhc might have suffered as a result of the violation of its right to petition was not legally remediable through an award of damages.
as a second and independent basis for its ruling,the trial court reviewed the evidence presented at trial and concluded that,even if a violation of mhc right to petition was legally remediable through an award of damages,mhc had not established it had suffered any injury.the trial court reasoned that because the effect of the unconstitutional provisions was to chill mhc ability to petition the city for a rent adjustment,it would have to determine whether mhc would have obtained a rent adjustment if it had filed a rent adjustment application with the city manufactured home fair practices commission the commission.the trial court then concluded that the commission would not have granted mhc a rent adjustment had it applied for one during the period the unconstitutional provisions were in effect and,accordingly,mhc suffered no injury from the unconstitutional provisions 
c.the city of santee action 
background 
in september,after the trial court in the mhc action ruled that ordinance and ordinance were void,the city sent a notice to mobilehome park owners,including mhc,stating that the annual permissive rent adjustment for should be calculated based upon the former mobilehome rent control provision,ordinances,which allowed an adjustment of percent of the san diego consumer price index cpi,instead of percent of the cpi as would have been permitted by ordinances and the notice stated that i f the appellate court reverses the trial court decision,the city reserves its right to recoup and refund to tenants the difference between the one hundred percent of the average rate change in the cpi and the annual permissive adjustment permitted under ordinances.
mhc then sent a notice to tenants in the park,advising them that not only would mhc implement the permissive annual rent adjustment allowed by the city,but that effective january,mobilehome park tenants would incur a charge of,representing the additional rent that would have been collected pursuant to ordinance for the period november to the effective date of the trial court judgment,if those ordinances had been in effect and the base rent at the park would increase to,representing the base rent which would have existed had ordinance had sic been effective and enforced instead of ordinance.
the city original and amended complaint 
after mhc rejected a request by the city that it rescind its notice of the rent increases,the city filed a lawsuit against mhc in december to enjoin it from collecting any rent increase other than the annual permissive rent adjustment for the city of santee action the trial court denied the city request for a preliminary injunction,and mhc implemented the rent increase described in its notice to the park tenants.
in december,after we reversed the trial court ruling in the mhc action and thereby established that ordinance was retroactively effective to the date of the enactment of ordinance mhc,supra,th,d,the city amended its complaint to include causes of action for recovery of amount paid on reversed judgment,and an accounting of the rents received from the park tenants in and on behalf of the park tenants,the city sought an order requiring mhc to pay restitution of all of the monies it collected from the tenants following the trial court ruling that ordinances and were void,including the difference between the permissive annual rate adjustment allowed by ordinances and the permissive annual increase allowed by ordinance and the base rent increase and payment that mhc implemented in january.
mhc original 
in april mhc filed a in the city of santee action,asserting five causes of action.
the first and second cause of action focused on the city enforcement of the provisions in ordinances and that as established in the mhc action violated mhc right to petition for a redress of grievances and the city retroactive application of ordinance to the date of the enactment of ordinance.the first cause of action alleged that enforcement of the mobilehome rent control ordinances under those circumstances constituted an unconstitutional regulatory taking in violation of the federal and state constitutions under penn central transp.new york city,d penn central.the second cause of action alleged that enforcement of the mobilehome rent control ordinances under those circumstances violated the right to substantive due process under the state and federal constitutions in that it imposed substantial retroactive liability and costs and it was an irrational land use regulation.
the third and fourth causes of action focused on the substantive provisions of ordinances,ordinance and ordinance collectively the ordinances.the third cause of action alleged that the ordinances effected an unconstitutional taking in violation of the state and federal constitutions under four distinct theories a regulatory taking under penn central,supra.a physical taking on the ground that mhc is precluded from converting to another use by the city political commitment to maintaining the park property as a mobilehome park a private taking as described in kelo new london,d kelo,because t he clear purpose and effect of the ordinances was to confer a favor on a discrete number of private individuals who then resided in the park and who sought to acquire the park and a taking because it required an exaction as a condition to the owner use of the property as described in nollan california coastal comm,d nollan and dolan city of tigard,d dolan.the fourth cause of action alleged that the ordinances violate the right to substantive due process under the federal and state constitutions.
the fifth cause of action sought equitable indemnification.mhc alleged that h aving created a confusing regulatory scheme of enacting void and illegal ordinances,reviving old ordinances,and filing lawsuits in which they take inconsistent positions on which ordinance is in effect,the city should indemnify mhc for any costs,expenses,or liabilities it incurs defending itself against claims that it has not complied with the ordinances.
the trial court ruling on the demurrer to the original 
the city filed a demurrer to mhc.the trial court sustained the demurrer to the first and third causes of action on ripeness grounds,with leave to amend sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the private taking and physical taking theories alleged in the third cause of action and with respect to the first and third causes of action,ruled that the statute of limitations barred recovery for any damages arising before april.
mhc amended 
mhc then filed an amended.the first cause of action alleged that the city enforcement of the ordinances,from april,to december,effected a regulatory taking under penn central,supra.the second cause of action alleged a violation of the federal and state constitutional right to substantive due process based on t he city enforcement since approximately november of provisions that unconstitutionally chilled mhc right to seek a discretionary rent increase and its retroactive application of ordinance.the third cause of action focused on the city conduct on december,in severing the unconstitutionally chilling provisions of ordinance to make it a valid law,and then retroactively applying ordinance to the effective date of ordinance,and alleged a regulatory taking under penn central,supra,and a taking under the theory described in nollan,supra,and dolan,supra.finally,as in the original,the fourth cause of action alleged that the ordinances violated the state and federal constitutional right to substantive due process,and the fifth cause of action sought equitable indemnification.
the city motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication 
the city filed a motion for summary judgment challenging mhc amended.
the trial court granted the motion.specifically,it ruled to the extent the first through fourth causes of action asserted claims,they were barred because they were not ripe,in that mhc failed to pursue a rent increase from the city prior to bringing the action to the extent the second through fourth causes of action alleged facial challenges to the ordinances,those causes of action were barred by the statute of limitations and summary judgment was warranted on the fifth cause of action for equitable indemnity because mhc failed to provide evidence raising a triable issue of material fact as to tort liability on the part of the city.
the city also filed a motion for summary adjudication on the causes of action in its amended complaint for recovery of amount paid on reversed judgment,and an accounting of rents collected from the park tenants in and.the trial court granted the motion.
the parties then entered into a stipulation resolving the remaining causes of action in the city amended complaint,and the trial court entered judgment.
d.the consolidated appeals 
mhc filed notices of appeal in both the mhc action and the city of santee action.
in its appeal of the mhc action,mhc contends that the trial court erred in ruling that mhc is not entitled to damages on either of the bases specified in our remand directive.
in its appeal of the city of santee action,mhc contends that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer with respect to the allegation that the city effected a private or physical taking in granting summary judgment in favor of the city on mhc and in granting summary adjudication in favor of the city on its causes of action for recovery of amount paid on reversed judgment and an accounting.
we consolidated the appeals.
discussiona.the mhc.mhc has not established that the trial court erred in ruling that mhc did not suffer any legally remediable injury due to the retroactive application of ordinance to the period between the enactment of ordinance and ordinance 
the first issue specified in our remand directive in the mhc action was whether mhc suffered any legally remediable injury due to the retroactive application of ordinance to the date of the enactment of ordinance.mhc,supra,th at,d.mhc focuses comparatively little attention on this issue in its appellate briefing,devoting only three pages to the issue in its opening appellate brief,and less than three pages to the issue in its reply brief,with the vast majority of mhc appellate argument regarding the mhc action focusing on the second issue in our remand directive,whether mhc suffered any legally remediable injury as a result of the violation of its right to petition under article i,section a.as we will explain,mhc challenge to the trial court ruling on the first issue in our remand directive is without merit.
the trial court ruling on the first issue in our remand directive focused on the seven differences between ordinance and ordinance concluding that mhc had not established that it was injured by the retroactive application of ordinance to the period between the enactment of ordinance and ordinance.in its cursory treatment of the issue on appeal,mhc does not specifically challenge the trial court finding that none of the seven differences gave rise to an injury to mhc when ordinance was retroactively applied to the date of the enactment of ordinance.instead,mhc argues that it demonstrated that the retroactive application of those differences created an environment of confusion and uncertainty that diminished the value of mhc property by approximately.mhc argues that the trial court decision was flawed because the trial court improperly sustained objections to testimony presented by two of mhc witnesses,which would have established that diminution in value.mhc contends that if the trial court had considered the testimony of those witnesses,the evidence would have supported a finding that mhc was injured by the retroactive application of ordinance to the date between the enactment of ordinance and ordinance.
mhc first focuses on the testimony of its executive vice president and general counsel,ellen kelleher.over the city objection that kelleher had not been designated as an expert witness,the trial court permitted kelleher to testify about her opinion on whether the retroactive application of ordinance had a negative impact on the value of the park,reserving a ruling on the objection until after it considered the relevant authorities.after considering those authorities,the trial court,in its statement of decision,sustained the city objections to kelleher testimony on the subject of valuation,but it also stated that even if the objections were overruled,it was not persuaded by kelleher testimony about the diminishment of value of the property.the trial court explained that it viewed kelleher testimony as speculative 
based on this background,we reject mhc argument that the trial court would have come to a different conclusion as to whether mhc was damaged by the retroactive application of ordinance had it not sustained the objection to kelleher testimony.the trial court clearly considered kelleher testimony and found that it lacked probative value.
next,mhc focuses on the testimony of its expert john quigley.as with kelleher testimony,the trial court admitted quigley testimony as to the value of the park,subject to later considering an objection on the ground that quigley was not designated to testify on that subject.in a footnote to its statement of decision,the trial court sustained the objection to quigley testimony,but in the body of its statement of decision the trial court considered the substance of quigley testimony.there,the trial court explained that quigley testimony lacked any probative value on the subject of whether the retroactive application of ordinance caused injury to mhc because quigley conceded that he was not aware of the differences between ordinance and ordinance and his sole testimony related to the value of the park absent regulation.
because the trial court considered quigley testimony and concluded that it lacked probative value,mhc can not establish that the trial court prejudicially erred by sustaining the city objection to quigley testimony.
in sum,we conclude that mhc has presented no basis for us to reverse the trial court decision in the mhc action that mhc sustained no legally remediable injury from the retroactive application of ordinance to the period between the enactment of ordinance and ordinance.
the trial court correctly ruled that mhc may not recover damages for the city violation of its right to petition under the california constitution 
we next consider the issue to which mhc devotes most of its attention in its appeal of the judgment in the mhc action,namely,whether mhc suffered any legally remediable injury as a result of enforcement of any of the provisions in ordinances and that the court found to be unconstitutional.mhc,supra,th at,d.following our second remand directive,the trial court considered the issue and ruled that mhc suffered no legally remediable injury as a result of the city enforcement of the unconstitutional provisions of ordinances and in violation of mhc right to petition under article i,section a.
as we have explained,the trial court set forth two independent bases for its ruling that,as a matter of law,the remedy of damages was not available for a violation of the right to petition guaranteed by article i,section a and even if a damages remedy was available,mhc had not established that it incurred any damages because it would not have obtained a rent adjustment had it filed an application with the commission.
in its opening appellate brief,mhc devotes only two and a half pages to the first of the trial court two independent grounds for its ruling,making a cursory argument that the trial court erred in finding that damages are not recoverable for a violation of article i,section a.in contrast,mhc expends over pages challenging the second independent basis for the trial court ruling,that mhc did not incur any damages as a result of the violation of its right to petition.mhc asserts several grounds for its contention that the trial court erred in ruling that no damages resulted from the violation of mhc right to petition each one of these arguments relates to mhc contention that it did in fact incur damages as a result of the violation of its right to petition.however,we need not,and do not,reach any of these arguments.instead,as we will explain,we find the first of the trial court independent grounds for its decision to be dispositive.a plaintiff may not,as a matter of law,recover damages for a violation of article i,section a.
we begin our analysis by focusing on the text of article,section a.that provision of our state constitution establishes that t he people have the right to instruct their representatives,petition government for redress of grievances,and assemble freely to consult for the common good.art.i,a.the question presented is whether a plaintiff may obtain an award of damages if it establishes a violation of that state constitutional provision.
our supreme court in degrassi,supra,cal th,d,and katzberg,supra,cal th,d,described the analytical steps that a court must apply when it considers whether the violation of a specific provision of our state constitution gives rise to the right to recover damages.premising its approach on the united states supreme court discussion in bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,d bivens,our supreme court set forth the following analysis.
first,we shall inquire whether there is evidence from which we may find or infer,within the constitutional provision at issue,an affirmative intent either to authorize or to withhold a damages action to remedy a violation.in undertaking this inquiry,we shall consider the language and history of the constitutional provision at issue,including whether it contains guidelines,mechanisms,or procedures implying a monetary remedy,as well as any pertinent common law history.if we find any such intent,we shall give it effect.katzberg,supra,cal th at,d.
second,if no affirmative intent either to authorize or to withhold a damages remedy is found,we shall undertake the constitutional tort analysis adopted by bivens and its progeny.among the relevant factors in this analysis are whether an adequate remedy exists,the extent to which a constitutional tort action would change established tort law,and the nature and significance of the constitutional provision.if we find that these factors militate against recognizing the constitutional tort,our inquiry ends.if,however,we find that these factors favor recognizing a constitutional tort,we also shall consider the existence of any special factors counseling hesitation in recognizing a damages action,including deference to legislative judgment,avoidance of adverse policy consequences,considerations of government fiscal policy,practical issues of proof,and the competence of courts to assess particular types of damages.katzberg,supra,cal th at,d,see also degrassi,supra,cal th at,d.
turning to the first step of the prescribed analysis,we examine whether the language and history of article i,section a allows us to infer an affirmative intent either to authorize or to withhold a damages action to remedy a violation.
we find no assistance in the language of article i,section a itself.indeed,this is to be expected,as the language of most constitutional provisions does not speak to or manifest any intent to include a damages remedy for a violation of the provision.degrassi,supra,cal th at,d.
as for the history of article i,section a,we also find no indication of an intent to either allow or disallow an action for damages.as was the case with the provision guaranteeing the right to free speech appearing in article i,section,subdivision a of the california constitution that our supreme court considered in degrassi,supra,cal th at pages,d,the text of article i,section a was added to the california constitution through proposition on the november ballot.ballot,text of,proposition.we have reviewed the ballot materials that were before the voters in connection with proposition,and we find no suggestion of any intent to create or foreclose a damages remedy for a violation of article i,section a.as did our supreme court in degrassi,we have also considered materials from the drafters of the constitutional revision that was adopted by the electorate in proposition,and we find no evidence that the drafters considered the issue of whether a damages remedy would be available for a violation of the constitutional right to petition.cal.const.revision,proposed revision pt,comment on proposed revision limited to recommendation that it be retained and broadened to permit the petition of government in general rather than merely the legislature cal.const.revision,art.i declaration of rights background study concerning proposed revision of cal,former art.i,cal.const.revision,art.i declaration of rights iii concerning proposed revision of cal,former art.i.
ever since its adoption in and its reenactment in,the california constitution,prior to proposition,provided for the right to petition through its former article i,section as did our supreme court in degrassi,supra,cal th at pages,d,we have reviewed the relevant passages of the debates that preceded the adoption of the and constitutions and find no evidence that the drafters considered whether a violation of the right to petition could give rise to a suit for damages.see browne,of debates in convention of cal.on formation of state const,willis stockton,debates and proceedings cal.const.convention,willis stockton,debates and proceedings cal.const.convention.
we requested that the parties provide supplemental briefing identifying any available history of article i,section of the california constitution from which we might infer an intent to permit or foreclose an action for damages.the parties agree that no such materials exist.further,the parties briefing has not identified any authority recognizing a right to seek damages from an asserted violation of the right to petition,and we are aware of none.see degrassi,supra,cal th at,d,discussing the lack of any right to seek damages for an asserted violation of free speech rights katzberg,supra,cal th at,d,considering common law history.
instead of identifying a common law right to recover damages for a violation of the right to petition,mhc points to the legislature enactment of the statute code civ.that provision allows a defendant to bring a special motion to strike any cause of action arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition,subd.b,and,as mhc emphasizes,with certain exceptions allows a successful party to recover attorney fees,subd.c.we find the statute to be inapposite.under degrassi and katzberg,our inquiry is whether any authority exists recognizing a common law right to obtain damages for violation of the right to petition.the legislature enactment of the statute does not imply the existence of any such common law right.
in sum,we find nothing in the text or history of article i,section a to indicate an intention to either allow or disallow a damages remedy.accordingly,we proceed to the second step of the analysis set forth in katzberg and degrassi and determine whether a constitutional tort action for damages to remedy the asserted constitutional violation should be recognized.katzberg,supra,cal th at,d,see also degrassi,supra,cal th at,d,quoting katzberg.
in deciding whether to recognize a damages remedy,the first factor we may consider is whether the plaintiff has meaningful alternative remedies.katzberg,supra,cal th at,d,degrassi,supra,cal th at,d.here,as the history of the mhc action demonstrates,mhc had available to it the remedy of declaratory and injunctive relief,and in fact did exercise its right to obtain those remedies,which resulted in a ruling severing the unconstitutional provisions from ordinance.see katzberg,at,d,noting that the plaintiff could have sought declaratory or injunctive relief degrassi,at,d,noting that plaintiff could have sought an injunction against the challenged conduct with the effect of avoiding much of the conduct complained of,and rejecting the suggestion that such a remedy would be innocuous or empty.
the second factor we may consider is the extent to which a constitutional tort action would change established tort law.katzberg,supra,cal th at,d.the parties have not identified any existing tort law that would permit an action for damages arising from the violation of the right to petition,and we are aware of none.accordingly,we would be changing established tort law if we were to recognize a damages remedy for violation of the constitutional right to petition in article i,section a.
the third factor discussed in katzberg and degrassi is the nature of the provision and the significance of the purpose that it seeks to effectuate.katzberg,supra,cal th at,d,see also degrassi,supra,cal th at,d.however,as pointed out in katzberg,w hile this factor may be a proper consideration in the overall analysis,it is not one upon which we place great significance.how does one rank the importance of different constitutional provisions katzberg,at,d,quoting carlsbad aquafarm,state of health services th,d carlsbad aquafarm.w hen the considerations mentioned above do not militate in favor of recognizing a constitutional tort action,the relative importance of the right,standing alone,is not a factor of great significance.degrassi,at,d,italics added.thus,while the right to petition is a venerable and fundamental constitutional right that is also present in the united states constitution bill of rights b
