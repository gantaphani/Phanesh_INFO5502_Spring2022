introduction 
the orange county superior court,after a decision by the appellate division huntington continental town house,miner th supp.huntington continental,certified this case for transfer to this court pursuant to rule a of the california rules of court to address a single question.the question is whether a homeowners association is required by the davis stirling common interest development act,et the davis stirling act to accept partial payments from an owner of a separate interest,who is delinquent in paying his or her assessments,after a lien has been recorded against the owner separate interest to secure payment of delinquent assessments and other charges.we ordered the case transferred to this court for hearing and decision.
we agree with the decision of the appellate division of the superior court in huntington continental,and hold that under civil code section,subdivision a section a,a homeowners association an association must accept a partial payment made by an owner of a separate interest in a common interest development and must apply that payment in the order prescribed by statute.the obligation to accept partial payments continues after a lien has been recorded against an owner separate interest for collection of delinquent assessments.the remedies available to an association under civil code section depend upon the amount and the age of the balance of delinquent assessments following application of the partial payment.

relevant provisions of the davis stirling act 
the davis stirling act is codified as part of division of the civil code.articles,and of chapter of part of division of the civil code,set forth comprehensive rules,restrictions,and procedures for imposing,paying,collecting,and enforcing regular and special assessments.
the davis stirling act requires an association to levy regular and special assessments sufficient to perform its obligations under the governing documents and this act,subd.a.article of chapter of part of division of the civil code addresses payment and delinquency in payment of assessments.civil code section,subdivision a section a states a regular or special assessment and any late charges,reasonable fees and costs of collection,reasonable attorney fees,if any,and interest,if any,as determined in accordance with subdivision b,shall be a debt of the owner of the separate interest at the time the assessment or other sums are levied.
civil code section addresses allocation of payments against the debt.section a states any payments made by the owner of a separate interest toward a debt described in subdivision a of section shall first be applied to the assessments owed,and,only after the assessments owed are paid in full shall the payments be applied to the fees and costs of collection,attorney fees,late charges,or interest.italics added.this section does not state an association has the discretion to decline to follow the procedure set forth in the statute.
under civil code section,the amount of the assessment,plus any costs of collection,late charges,and interest assessed in accordance with subdivision b of section,becomes a lien on the owner of record separate interest in the common interest development once the association causes to be recorded a notice of delinquent assessment setting forth certain required information,subd.a,together with an itemized statement of charges,subd.b.the board of an association may,by majority vote in an open meeting,decide to record a lien for delinquent assessments.
before recording the lien,an association must provide the owner of record notice that includes the information set forth in subdivisions a through f of civil code section,including the right to request a meeting with the board to request a payment plan under civil code section.payment plans do not impede an association ability to record a lien on the owner separate interest,subd.d,and,i n the event of a default on any payment plan,the association may resume its efforts to collect the delinquent assessments from the time prior to entering into the payment plan,subd.e.
if an association and an owner of a separate interest dispute the validity of a charge or sum levied by the association,the owner may pay the disputed amount,including collection costs,and,in addition to pursuing alternative dispute resolution,may commence a small claims action to recoup the disputed amount paid,subd.a.
article of chapter of part of division of the civil code concerns collection of assessments and enforcement of liens.under civil code section,subdivision a,a lien created by civil code section may be enforced in any manner permitted by law,including judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure,after the expiration of days following the recordation of the lien,subd.a.the decision to initiate foreclosure of a lien for delinquent assessments must be made by a majority vote of the board of directors of an association in an executive session,subd.c,and must be preceded by an offer to the owner to participate in dispute resolution,subd.b.
in the event an association board decides to pursue nonjudicial foreclosure,a ny sale by the trustee shall be conducted in accordance with sections,and applicable to the exercise of powers of sale in mortgages and deeds of trust,subd.a.
particularly significant to this case is civil code section,which places limits on foreclosure.relevant parts of section b state an association that seeks to collect delinquent regular or special assessments of an amount less than one thousand eight hundred dollars,not including any accelerated assessments,late charges,fees and costs of collection,attorney fees,or interest,may not collect that debt through judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure,but may attempt to collect or secure that debt in any of the following ways 
section b identifies three ways to collect or secure delinquent assessments in an amount less than.the first is a civil action in small claims court b.the second is b y recording a lien on the owner separate interest upon which the association may not foreclose until the amount of the delinquent assessments secured by the lien,exclusive of any accelerated assessments,late charges,fees and costs of collection,attorney fees,or interest,equals or exceeds one thousand eight hundred dollars or the assessments secured by the lien are more than months delinquent.b.the third is a ny other manner provided by law,except for judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure.b.
the limitation on foreclosure of assessment liens for amounts under does not apply to a ssessments secured by a lien that are more than months delinquent,subd.c.hcta does not contend the assessments secured by its lien were more than months delinquent at the time the trust tendered the check.
an association must accept a partial payment made by an owner of a separate interest after a lien has been recorded.
two statutes within the davis stirling act,section a and civil code section,are the focus of our analysis and central to our holding an association must accept a partial payment.another,civil code section,also warrants additional discussion.
section a states any payments made by the owner of a separate interest toward a debt described in subdivision a of section shall first be applied to the assessments owed,and,only after the assessments owed are paid in full shall the payments be applied to the fees and costs of collection,attorney fees,late charges,or interest.two issues arise in interpreting section a.first,does it permit an owner to make a partial payment,that is,a payment which does not cover the owner entire debt under section a second,does section a require an association to accept a partial payment 
on the first issue,the plain language of section a unambiguously permits partial payments.the davis stirling act permits an association to impose late charges,reasonable fees and costs of collection,reasonable attorney fees,if any,and interest on delinquent assessments.a.by creating an order of allocation,section a,in effect,recognizes a payment might not cover the full amount of the delinquency and other charges.
on the second issue,the plain language of section a requires an association to accept an owner partial payment.section a does not refer to any payment made by the owner and accepted by an association.instead,section a states,a ny payments made by the owner toward a debt described in section a shall italics added be applied in the order set forth.use of the word shall connotes a mandatory act.under principle s of statutory construction,we ordinarily construe the word may as permissive and the word shall as mandatory,particularly when a single statute uses both terms.tarrant bell property,llc superior court cal th.in diamond superior court th,the court concluded the word shall in the davis stirling act,civil code former section,subdivision d,created a mandatory obligation to serve an owner of a separate interest with
