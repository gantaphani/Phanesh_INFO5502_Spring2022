we must determine whether a municipal rent control ordinance survives a due process and equal protection challenge or requires payment of compensation as a government taking.
on june,the county of san luis obispo adopted a mobilehome rent stabilization ordinance ordinance pursuant to a voter initiative.
the ordinance sought to protect the owners and occupiers of mobilehomes from unreasonable rent increases,while at the same time recognizing the need of park owners to receive a suitable profit on their property with rental income sufficient to cover increases in the costs of repair,insurance,maintenance,utilities,employee services,additional amenities,and other costs of operation,and to receive a fair return on their property.
county of san luis obispo,code c.the ordinance exempted t enancies covered by leases or contracts which provide for more than a tenancy,but only for the duration of such lease or contract.id.the ordinance established a mobilehome rent review board board consisting of members not connected with the mobilehome rental housing industry for their personal gain.id.the board powers and duties included the right t o increase or decrease maximum rents upon completion of its hearings and investigations.id.the ordinance prescribed a base rent at the monthly space rent as of december,allowed a maximum monthly space rent to be increased no more than once a year by an increase over the then existing space rent equal to sixty percent of the cost of living increase,and forbade owners to demand,accept or retain a rent in excess of the maximum permitted by this chapter.id.a,b,d.upon a transfer of mobilehome ownership,the ordinance allowed a rent increase of up to of the prior monthly rent.id.in addition,the ordinance included a hardship exception so that the board could approve rent increases above the normal maximum in the case of extraordinary expenditures and costs that would preclude a just and reasonable return on the property.id.
manufactured home communities,mhc,now known as equity lifestyle properties,is a public company.mhc created an operating limited partnership olp,which has acquired several mobilehome communities and resorts from original owners in exchange for limited partnership assets.the partners of olp,including mhc and its limited partners,receive revenue from these assets 
in,acting on behalf of olp,mhc purchased the sea oaks manufactured home community in los osos,california the park.olp maintains title ownership.mhc subsequently sought to impose rent increases on nine of the mobilehome lots in the park 
on march,mhc holding itself out as the gave notice to the park tenants that rent in the nine lots would increase by an average.the tenants protested that the ordinance barred such rent increases,but mhc noted that they had signed rental agreements and stated that the ordinance did not apply to such leases.see county of san luis obispo,code exempting t enancies covered by leases or contracts which provide for more than a tenancy for the duration of such lease or contract.
to settle the dispute over the rent increases,mhc wrote the board on march,asking for verification that the ordinance did not apply to the nine lots at issue.on may,the tenants in turn requested a hearing as to whether the increases violated the ordinance.they explained that the previous park owner had informed them that the leases would be subject to the ordinance and they relied on that information in renewing their leases.
the board accepted mhc representation that it was the park owner and gave notice of hearings,which it conducted on june,july,and august.at the hearings,the board allowed both sides to present witnesses and to submit limitless materials,but barred any.the board concluded that mhc agreements were in fact agreements covered by the rent control ordinance,for they included an undefined rent term and permitted rent increases anytime upon a notice mhc appealed to the san luis obispo county board of supervisors on september,which affirmed the board decision on october.
on january,mhc filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in the central district of california,based on federal question and diversity jurisdiction.see,a.the petition asserted federal claims under as well as california law claims within the pendent supplemental jurisdiction of th e court.see.the petition challenged the administrative ruling,and the respondents failure to declare their own ordinance unconstitutional under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
mhc subsequently filed a first amended complaint for 
petition for writ of administrative mandamus 
violation of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution takings claim 
violation of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution substantive due process 
violation of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution equal protection 
declaratory relief 
mhc sought damages and equitable relief from application of the ordinance.
on november,the county moved to dismiss the mhc first amended complaint under.b lack of subject matter jurisdiction and b failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the motion contended that mhc lacked standing,that its takings claims and due process claims were unripe,that its facial claims were barred by the statute of limitations,and that its other constitutional claims offered no basis for relief.in the alternative,the motion urged the court to exercise younger or pullman abstention.the district court responded with the following order the court has considered defendant motion to dismiss the first amended complaint,together with the moving and opposition papers.it is ordered that the motion be,and hereby is,granted.date february.mhc now timely appeals this order.
because abstention has been raised as an issue in this case,we recount related developments in state court.three days after filing its petition in the federal district court,mhc filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in the california superior court,asserting nearly identical claims as in federal court.on november,the had not been served with the petition until october a demurrer arguing that mhc lacked standing.on january,mhc filed a first amended petition,containing the same allegations as before,but explaining that mhc controls the actions of olp and has a direct,pecuniary interest in the amount of rent that can be charged at the property it has an interest in,including the sea oaks park.on october,the court overruled the demurrer.
on december,mhc filed a second amended and supplemental complaint in the state trial court,which mirrored the claims in its first amended complaint previously filed in the federal district court.the state trial court held that mhc had standing and bifurcated the action as to the writ and claims.the court denied the writ on july,granted judgment on the pleadings for the county on the claims on november,and entered judgment for the county on december.mhc filed a state court notice of appeal on january.the state trial court judgment and appeal thus occurred after mhc had appealed the district court order granting the county motion to dismiss.
the dismissal of a federal complaint requires de novo review we begin with the jurisdictional issue.mhc claims standing based on its financial interest as a partner of olp.in considering this claim,we must accept as true its assertion that mhc lost revenue when the board forbade olp from increasing rents by an average.see pennell city of san jose,d w hen standing is challenged on the basis of the pleadings,we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint,and construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.quoting warth seldin,d.
the government disputes mhc standing because title ownership of the park.but that argument is too rigid the application of standing requirements must not be turned into a mechanical exercise.allen wright,d.title ownership is not the only form of interest that can support standing.we have stated more broadly that p ecuniary injury is a sufficient basis for standing.fair epa,cir see also warth seldin,d stating that standing exists where unless relief from assertedly illegal actions i s forthcoming,the plaintiff immediate and personal interests would be harmed.mhc pecuniary interest in the park is sufficient for standing and we proceed to the merits 
mhc asserts two forms of takings challenges a facial challenge to the ordinance itself,and an challenge to the board implementation of the ordinance to the nine lots in question.the county contends that mhc,even if treated as the current owner,may not bring a facial challenge,because mhc acquired its interest in the property after the ordinance was enacted.the supreme court decision in palazzolo rhode island,d,rejects this view.the court expressly stated that a regulatory takings claim is not barred by the mere fact that title was acquired after the effective date of the restriction.id.at.
however,a takings claim must still comply with timeliness requirements.it must be filed neither too early unripe nor too late barred by a statute of limitations.in williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank of johnson city,d,the court articulated a analysis to determine whether a regulatory takings claim is ripe the underlying administrative action must be final before it is judicially reviewable and the claimant must have unsuccessfully attempted to obtain just compensation through the procedures provided by the state.id.at.
mhc challenge satisfies the first prong of the williamson test based upon its first having sought a decision of the mobilehome rent review board and the subsequent affirmance by the board of supervisors.see manufactured home cmtys city of san jose,cir stating that the claimant pursued its general rate increase claims through the administrative process provided by the ordinance and thus fulfill ed the first prong of the williamson county test for mhc takings claims related to a general rate increase.
however,mhc has not satisfied the second requirement of the williamson test,because it has not attempted to obtain relief through the state procedure designed to provide compensation for rent control losses.in a decision,the california supreme court established a procedure by which a party injured by a government taking could seek compensation.see kavanau santa monica rent control,cal th,d.the procedure required a n adjustment of future rents that takes into consideration past confiscatory rents,id.at,giving homeowners harmed by regulatory takings a means to obtain just compensation through the procedures provided by the state,williamson,at.
unless a complainant has sought relief through a kavanau adjustment,he can not file a federal complaint objecting to an uncompensated taking by the state.see manufactured home cmtys,at dismissing as unripe a complaint filed without first seeking a kavanau adjustment see also carson harbor village,at,concurring specially dismissing a complaint because the injured party had made no effort to seek compensation for an alleged taking through a writ of mandamus and a kavanau adjustment.
mhc then seeks to avoid the rule that a plaintiff can not bring a section action in federal court until the state denies just compensation,levald,city of palm desert,cir,by arguing that a kavanau adjustment procedure could not offer adequate compensation.here mhc relies on a narrow exception to the second prong of the williamson test,which allows a claimant to bypass state procedures if such procedures are shown to be unavailable or inadequate.at.this exception applies only if a party has already utilized state procedures and has shown pursuit of such remedies would be futile.
mhc contends that the exception should apply to the kavanau adjustment procedure,because kavanau adjustments only provide for an increase in future rents,and do not require landowners to be compensated for rent lost prior to or during the course of the litigation.although mhc admits that the kavanau court addressed this concern by pointing out in dicta that a landlord could seek a stay of that regulation during litigation,kavanau,d,at,mhc contends that california courts never grant such stays.to prove this point,mhc offers only the declaration of anthony rodriguez,an experienced mobilehome park attorney,who believes that seeking a stay would be futile given his personal knowledge of at least four cases in which california courts denied such stay requests.
we are not impressed by this single declaration and have considered the state decisions on the issue more closely.the futility exception is narrow,and mere uncertainty does not establish futility.manufactured home cmtys,at.although the facts alleged by a plaintiff are assumed true under a motion to dismiss,this court need not accept baseless allegations as proof of futility mhc allegations,at best,produce uncertainty and uncertainty does not equal futility.id.
california law requires that kavanau adjustments include losses incurred during the review process.the california supreme court explained this requirement four years after kavanau,expressly clarifying that the substantial legal and administrative costs attributable to the rent review process should be properly included as expenses when calculating the proper rent readjustment under kavanau.galland city of clovis,cal th,d.the galland decision ensures that state authorities apply kavanau in a manner that provides compensation for losses occurring during litigation.for that reason,the california supreme court rejected the argument now made by a kavanau adjustment would not provide adequate compensation and therefore that a party need not seek such remedy before filing a federal complaint.see id.at reversing the court of appeals,which had held that a party need not pursue a kavanau adjustment prior to filing a claim and that a kavanau adjustment anyway would have been inadequate.under california law,a kavanau adjustment may not arbitrarily exclude the reasonable expenses of seeking legitimate rent increases.id.at.
california rent control authorities tasked with making kavanau adjustments have applied the rulings of the california supreme court to address potential revenue lost during litigation.although we have found no published case in which a california court granted a stay pending a kavanau adjustment,rent control authorities have used alternative means to ensure that kavanau adjustments allow property owners to recoup compensable losses incurred during litigation.for example,in one ruling,a city council applying kavanau a rent control board decision that denied a rent increase the city council then ordered that the rents be adjusted not only to avoid future losses but to compensate for revenue opportunities lost during the review process.see city council of the city of concord mobilehome rent review board,res,at.in another decision,a local rent stabilization board granted rent increases to compensate for losses incurred due to the application of a rent decision that was later overturned.see carpinteria mobile home park rent stabilization board,res,at.
these alternative approaches enable parties to seek adequate compensation from the state.we reject mhc argument that a kavanau adjustment is not an effective remedy unless the park owner successfully stays enforcement of the applicable rent control ordinance pending the outcome of the litigation.although a stay might be useful to avoid losses,retrospective compensation also ensures that a property owner does not suffer from unwarranted revenue losses incurred during litigation.we will not the specific procedures california has chosen to use,so long as the methods provide just compensation.
we thus conclude that california creation and implementation of the kavanau adjustment process provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,and the property owner can not claim a violation of the just compensation clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.williamson,at.because mhc did not seek such compensation,its challenge to the board decision was unripe and the district court properly dismissed that aspect of the claim.
the futility analysis differs with respect to mhc facial takings claim.in,at the time the ordinance was enacted,california had no damages remedy for regulatory takings.see schnuck city of santa monica,cir prior to the supreme court decision in first english evangelical lutheran church,d we excused such failures in california because california provided no remedy in damages for a taking by a regulatory ordinance,but gave only injunctive or declaratory relief.it was not until,when the supreme court held california denial of a damages remedy unconstitutional,that california courts began to provide damages remedies for regulatory takings.id.because no adequate state remedy was available in,when the ordinance was enacted,mhc need not fulfill the second prong of williamson in order for its facial challenge to be ripe.
however,mhc facial takings claim fails because it was filed outside the statute of limitations.while does not specify a statute of limitations,the supreme court has instructed federal courts addressing personal injury claims to follow the statute of limitations of the state in which the challenged action occurred.see wilson garcia,d.here,the applicable rule can be found in of civ.as codified in,which set forth a statute of limitations 
a facial takings claim must be filed within the limitations period.see levald,at.mhc facial takings claim accrued in,when the ordinance was enacted.mhc did not file its facial challenge until.the facial takings claim was filed beyond the limitations period.
mhc argues that its claim was timely nonetheless,because the supreme court decision in palazzolo,d,eliminated any statute of limitations requirement from facial takings challenges.we disagree in part.
palazzolo did not exempt facial challenges from the statute of limitations.the decision simply clarified that subsequent landowners can bring a claim even though a previous failed to take action to protect against an injury.see id.at.it would be illogical,and unfair,to bar a regulatory taking claim because of the transfer of ownership where the steps necessary to make the claim ripe were not taken,or could not have been taken,by a previous owner.we read palazzolo to require equitable tolling to protect subsequent landowners who do not receive notice of a regulatory taking or who lack standing to object to such taking prior to expiration of the limitations period.for such subsequent landowners,the limitations period must begin at the time of their acquisition of property,not at the time the original taking occurred.thus,under palazzolo,mhc had one year to file its facial takings claim after it acquired the property in.because mhc filed its claim in,it exceeded the statute of limitations by five years.
arguing in the alternative,mhc then contends its claim was timely under the statute of limitations,because the injurious action occurred when the board interpreted the ordinance to apply to the nine lots in question.in mhc view,the administrative ruling below,holding leases subject to the county rent control scheme,effectively repealed or amended an express provision in the ordinance exempting such leases from rent control and thus restarted the limitations period in.see supra page describing the administrative decision.
we can not accept this claim.the board and the san luis obispo county board of supervisors,which affirmed the board decision,had no legislative power to alter or to amend the ordinance.california election law expressly provides that no ordinance adopted by initiative may be repealed or amended except by a vote of the people.county of san luis obispo,code citing cal.election code.the statute of limitations began upon mhc acquisition of the property in,not upon the administrative ruling in.mhc untimely facial claim was properly dismissed.
we turn next to the district court dismissal of mhc due process and equal protection claims 
mhc first amended complaint asserted a violation of substantive due process on the grounds that the application of the ordinance to mhc bore no rational relationship to any legitimate state purpose and served the sole purpose of transferring the value of mhc property to a select private group of tenants.this argument challenges the foundation of the rent control law and would,if accepted,require its invalidation 
the supreme court and this circuit have upheld rent control laws as rationally related to a legitimate public purpose.in pennell,d,the court concluded that a challenged ordinance represents a rational attempt to accommodate the conflicting interests of protecting tenants from burdensome rent increases while at the same time ensuring that landlords are guaranteed a fair return on their investment,id.at,adding that we have long recognized that a legitimate and rational goal of price or rate regulation is the protection of consumer welfare.id 
the ordinance challenged by mhc includes a paragraph describing its purpose,which is to protect the owners and occupiers of mobilehomes from unreasonable rent increases,while at the same time recognizing the need of park owners to receive a suitable profit.county of san luis obispo,code c.pennell makes clear that such an ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate public purpose,a point we underscored in carson harbor village 
a generally applicable ordinance will survive a substantive due process challenge if it is designed to accomplish an objective within the government police power,and if a rational relationship existed between the provisions and the purpose of the ordinances.this deferential inquiry does not focus on the ultimate effectiveness of the law,but on whether the enacting body could have rationally believed at the time of enactment that the law would promote its objective.
carson harbor village city of carson,cir,overruled on other grounds by wmx tech.miller,cir citations omitted.applying this standard in carson harbor village,we upheld an ordinance that set a maximum ceiling on rent levels that can be charged for a space in mobile home parks and established a rent review board to hear claims for increases above the ceiling.see id.at.mhc substantive due process claim lacks merit under governing law.the district court properly dismissed it 
in its equal protection challenge,mhc claims that the ordinance was created unlawfully to discriminate against a class of persons in a manner unrelated to any legitimate governmental interest.mhc claims that the ordinance singled out mobilehome owners from property owners of all other types of housing in the san luis obispo county to bear the burden and expense of providing economic benefits to tenants and allowed a ll other property owners to adjust rents to market upon a change of tenancy.
this equal protection challenge must be considered under rational basis review because mobilehome park owners are not a suspect class.see watson maryland.applying the rational basis test to occupational classifications.therefore,the equal protection clause requires only that the classification rationally further a legitimate state interest.nordlinger hahn,d.under review,where a group possesses distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the state has the authority to implement,a state decision to act on the basis of those differences does not give rise to a constitutional violation.hotel motel ass of oakland city of oakland,cir quoting bd.of trs.garrett,d internal quotation marks omitted.here,the county sought to regulate mobilehome park rents because of the shortage of spaces for the location of existing mobilehomes within the county and the high costs and impracticability of moving mobilehomes and the potential for damage resulting therefrom,among other reasons.see county of san luis obispo.these reasons appear to constitute distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the state has the authority to implement.hotel motel,at.the district court properly dismissed the equal protection claim as well.
finally,we address the petition for a writ of administrative mandamus filed by mhc in the central district of california in its petition,mhc asserted that a writ was warranted under civ.because the rent review board and board of supervisors acted in excess of their jurisdiction and in violation of mhc due process rights under the st
