the appellants seek to invalidate a monroe county ordinance limiting the use of homes as vacation rentals.we must decide what kind of changes to a proposed ordinance during the enactment process are substantial or material so that the process must start from scratch.reviewing the case on appeal from a summary judgment,the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit certified a question to us.we have exercised our discretionary jurisdiction to answer it.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons discussed below,we hold that the changes to an ordinance during the enactment process are only substantial or material if they change the ordinance general purpose.
factual and procedural history 
the board of county commissioners of monroe county enacted ordinance on february.the ordinance restricts the use of residential properties throughout monroe county as vacation rentals,defined as rentals of fewer than days.the ordinance purpose is to prevent the diversion of scarce residential housing to vacation rental use.violations result in criminal penalties.
the county first advertised the ordinance on november.the advertisement included the ordinance title modifying the existing prohibition on tourist housing including vacation rentals in all land use districts.the advertisement stated that a first public hearing was scheduled for december.at the time,a draft of the ordinance,dated september,was available to the public.
at the december hearing,the board of county commissioners considered a new draft dated that same day that was distributed to the board during the hearing.it differed from the advertised draft in several respects 
a the original draft proposed a ban on vacation rentals throughout the county,while the new draft took a approach 
b the original draft allowed an option to create where vacation rentals would be permitted,while the new draft eliminated that option and 
c the new draft included a licensing system for vacation rentals than did the original draft.
based on the input received at the hearing,the board ordered additional changes.
on january,and,the county advertised a notice of a second public hearing.this advertisement again stated the title of the ordinance,which was the same as the original title except in one respect.it stated,modifying the existing prohibition on tourist housing including vacation rentals in all residential districts instead of land use districts.
the second hearing was held on february.at that hearing,the board considered a new draft of the ordinance dated january,which had been distributed to the public on january.at the second hearing,the board also considered an errata sheet,which included additional changes to the proposed ordinance.
after four and half hours of public debate,the board approved the january draft with the proposed changes in the errata sheet.there were three main differences between the december draft and the final version 
a the december draft permitted vacation rentals in sparsely settled residential districts while the final ordinance prohibited them 
b the december draft addressed vacation rentals in commercial fishing districts,while the final ordinance did not and 
c the december draft did not refer to the commercial fishing residential district,while the final ordinance prohibited vacation rentals in that district.
the plaintiffs,elizabeth neumont,et,own property in monroe county,which they used for vacation rentals.they sued monroe county in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,challenging the ordinance based on state and federal law.the various claims sought declaratory relief as to the ordinance validity,injunctive relief to halt its effect,and compensation for damages resulting from its enforcement.count x asserted that the ordinance was void because the changes made during the enactment process were substantial or material,thereby requiring the process to begin anew.
the district court certified a class of plaintiffs,see neumont monroe county,and later dismissed several counts.see neumont monroe county,d.after discovery and several rounds of summary judgment motions,the court upheld the ordinance,granted summary judgment for monroe county on count x,and dismissed the remaining claims.neumont monroe county,d.plaintiffs appealed.
the eleventh circuit noted that federal courts address questions of federal constitutional law only as a last resort.neumont florida,cir quoting save our dunes.dep of envtl,cir.the court further noted that a state law determination on count x may remove the need to decide certain questions of federal constitutional law.id.therefore,the circuit court certified to us the following question 
whether,for purposes of florida statutes section b,a substantial or material change in a proposed ordinance during the enactment process that is,the kind of change that would require a county to start the process over is confined to a change in the original general purpose of the proposed ordinance,or whether a substantial or material change includes a change to the actual list of permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category,or a change necessary to secure legislative passage of the ordinance 
id.at.the question is one of first impression in florida.
ii.analysis 
the plaintiffs argue that monroe county modified the proposed ordinance several times during the process,and that because the changes were substantial or material,the enactment process should have been restarted.they argue that after every change to the ordinance,the proposal should have been readvertised and new public hearings held.monroe county concedes that a substantial or material change to a proposed ordinance would require such action.that requirement derives from a florida attorney general opinion concluding that if any substantial or material changes or amendments are made during the adoption process,the enactment process must start anew,with full compliance with the reading and notice requirements contained in the statute.see op.att.this conclusion is consistent with that of other authorities.see eugene mcquillin,the law of municipal corporations,ed.an ordinance amended after its publication is not rendered void if the ordinance as amended does not vary from the substance of the original ordinance.the county argues,however,that the changes to this ordinance were not substantial or material because they did not alter the ordinance general purpose.therefore,the only issue we must consider is what kind of changes to a proposed ordinance are substantial and material so as to require the process to be restarted.
the parties propose three possible definitions of substantial or material change.these are a change to the actual list of permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category a change necessary to secure legislative passage and a change in the original purpose of the ordinance.for the reasons explained below,we hold that the last change in the ordinance original most consistent with the statutory requirements for enacting an ordinance and best furthers the public interest in efficient and responsive local government.
in the following sections we a review the monroe county zoning system in general and ordinance in particular b analyze the requirements for enacting ordinances listed in section,florida statutes c adopt a definition of substantial or material change and finally d apply that definition to this case.we conclude that the general purpose approach is the proper standard.
a.the monroe county zoning system and ordinance 
we first review the monroe county zoning system.the monroe county code mcc defines categories of land use districts each category serves a different purpose.for example,an urban commercial district is intended to serve retail sales and service,professional services and resort activities.monroe county,code.an urban residential district is intended to provide areas for residential uses.id.each district also has permitted,conditional,and prohibited uses.for example,in the urban commercial district,recreational uses are limited to bowling alleys,tennis courts and swimming pools.id.a.in the commercial fishing village districts,commercial fishing is a permitted use,but wireless communications facilities are a conditional use,subject to certain conditions.
the use at issue here was vacation rentals.the ordinance defined vacation rentals as leases of fewer than days.the ordinance permits vacation rentals in certain districts.
as noted above,during the enactment process,the county considered several versions of the ordinance.between the first published notice in november and the final public hearing in february the county altered the list of land use districts where vacation rentals were permitted.for example,the original version permitted them in the sparsely settled residential districts,while the final version did not.the original version did not mention the commercial fishing residential district,while the final version prohibited vacation rentals there.finally,the original version addressed vacation rentals in of the commercial fishing districts,but the final version did not refer to them.
section,florida statutes 
article viii,section of the florida constitution authorizes counties to enact local ordinances the board of county commissioners of a county may enact,in a manner prescribed by general law,county ordinances.section,florida statutes,establishes the procedures by which ordinances may be enacted in exercising the powers conferred by,art.viii of the state constitution,counties shall adhere to the procedures prescribed herein.stat.section imposes detailed notice and hearing requirements depending on the type of ordinance proposed.three subsections are particularly relevant here section,governing the regular enactment procedure for ordinances that do not involve land use districts section a,governing ordinances that change the zoning map designation for parcels of fewer than ten acres and section b,governing ordinances that change the zoning map designation of parcels larger than ten acres,or which change the list of permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category.we review each of these subsections below.
section the regular enactment procedure 
section governs the enactment process for the vast majority of county ordinances.it provides in relevant part 
a the regular enactment procedure shall be as follows the board of county commissioners at any regular or special meeting may enact or amend any ordinance,except as provided in subsection,if notice of intent to consider such ordinance is given at least days prior to said meeting by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.a copy of such notice shall be kept available for public inspection during the regular business hours of the office of the clerk of the board of county commissioners.the notice of proposed enactment shall state the date,time,and place of the meeting the title or titles of proposed ordinances and the place or places within the county where such proposed ordinances may be inspected by the public.the notice shall also advise that interested parties may appear at the meeting and be heard with respect to the proposed ordinance.
stat.emphasis added.thus,section requires that notice of a proposed ordinance be published at least ten days before the commission meeting at which the ordinance will be considered.the notice must include the title of the proposed ordinance and the place or places within the county where such proposed ordinance may be inspected by the public.stat.thus,when enacting most ordinances,counties must allow the public to inspect drafts of all proposed regular ordinances before their enactment.
section a changes to the zoning map designation of parcels of land involving fewer than ten acres 
section a,florida statutes,prescribes the procedures to be followed in enacting zoning changes affecting fewer than ten acres of land.that section states in relevant part 
a in cases in which the proposed ordinance changes the actual zoning map designation for a parcel or parcels of land involving less than contiguous acres,the board of county commissioners,in addition to following the general notice requirements of subsection,shall direct its clerk to notify by mail each real property owner whose land will be affected the notice shall state the substance of the proposed ordinance or resolution as it affects that property owner 
a.stat.emphasis added.this subsection requires compliance with the notice requirements of subsection,described above,and requires that counties mail to each property owner affected by the proposed ordinance a summary of the proposed ordinance explaining how the proposed ordinance will affect them.
section b ordinances that change the list of permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category 
the last category of procedures applies,among other areas,to ordinances that change the list of permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category.monroe county ordinance falls within this category.section b provides in relevant part 
b in cases in which the proposed ordinance or resolution changes the actual list of permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category the board of county commissioners shall provide for public notice and hearing as follows 
the board of county commissioners shall hold two advertised public hearings on the proposed ordinance or resolution.at least one hearing shall be held after on a weekday,unless the board of county commissioners,by a majority plus one vote,elects to conduct that hearing at another time of day.the first public hearing shall be held at least days after the day that the first advertisement is published.the second hearing shall be held at least days after the first hearing and shall be advertised at least days prior to the public hearing.
the required advertisements shall be no less than columns wide by inches long in a standard size or a tabloid size newspaper,and the headline in the advertisement shall be in a type no smaller than point.the advertisement shall not be placed in that portion of the newspaper where legal notices and classified advertisements appear.the advertisement shall be placed in a newspaper of general paid circulation in the county and of general interest and readership in the community pursuant to chapter,not one of limited subject matter.it is the legislative intent that,whenever possible,the advertisement shall appear in a newspaper that is published at least days a week unless the only newspaper in the community is published less than days a week.the advertisement shall be in substantially the following form 
notice of type of change 
the name of local government unit proposes to adopt the following by ordinance or resolution title of ordinance or resolution.
a public hearing on the ordinance or resolution will be held on date and time at meeting place.
b emphasis added.
section b contains several important provisions.it requires that counties hold two public hearings on all proposed ordinances that change the list of permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category.the hearings must be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation.subsection b also contains precise details about the form of the advertisement and its placement within the newspaper edition.unlike the regular enactment procedure described in subsection,however,subsection b does not require that drafts of proposed land use ordinances be made available for public review.also unlike subsection a,subsection b does not require that counties provide notice of the substance of the proposed ordinance or its effect on property owners,and does not require counties to comply with the provisions of subsection.in fact,subsection b permits counties to provide notice of ordinances that change the permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category by their title only.this distinction will be important in deciding which definition of substantial or material change we should adopt.
defining a substantive or material change 
as noted above,the parties propose three possible definitions of substantial or material change a change to the actual list of permitted,conditional,or prohibited uses within a zoning category a
