richey worked for the city of independence from until may as a park ranger.the city terminated his employment in may,asserting that richey had violated the city personnel policies.the termination precipitated this lawsuit.
the events leading to the termination began in march,when connie knott,a park naturalist,complained to her supervisor,susan reynolds,that richey had become angry with her over matters relating to park policy.knott later told reynolds that she felt threatened by richey temper,and requested an alternate workspace away from the park.
at about the same time,richey called a human resources coordinator,cleon wiggins,and asked for a meeting to say some things that needed to be said.according to wiggins report of the call,richey first asked to meet with reynolds,knott and wiggins,or just wiggins,to discuss his relationship with knott.richey explained to wiggins that knott had inquired whether richey had a girlfriend,and had engaged in affectionate contact such as hugging or placing her head in his lap.richey told wiggins that he recently told knott that he did not like the physical contact,and that she agreed to cease that behavior.according to wiggins,richey said very emphatically that he did not want to make a claim of sexual harassment,and that he wanted only to clear the air.in a meeting with reynolds and wiggins the next day,richey alleged that knott had made inappropriate comments of a sexual nature to him,that knott had hugged him on at least two occasions,and that she had once showed up at his house unannounced on a sunday morning to take him to church.
wiggins and reynolds conducted an investigation into richey allegations about knott,and determined that they were unsupported.knott denied that she had made sexual comments to richey.she also told reynolds that richey had asked her to take him to church.she gave reynolds a map that richey had drawn for her to show her the way to his house.when jim fisher,the parks and recreation director,told richey that his allegations against knott were unsubstantiated,richey was distraught and told fisher,i guess i was wrong for doing this.richey later said that when he made this admission,he was kind of being sarcastic in a way.
as part of the investigation,fisher and others examined richey personnel file.they discovered several reports regarding previous angry outbursts by richey,dating back to.these included a documented suspension from work in august for violations of regulations concerning workplace violence after richey threatened to kill himself and his wife,summaries of confidential interviews with employees in august recounting that richey also had threatened to kill his supervisor,and a memorandum from another park employee in november regarding violent verbal outbursts and paranoid behavior by richey.
on april,fisher wrote to the city manager,robert heacock,summarizing his investigation and recommending that richey be suspended pending termination for violations of two sections of the city personnel policy.fisher described incidents during march in which richey became angry with knott over various matters,and reported that richey had made allegations of sexual harassment against knott.fisher recommendation asserted that richey violated city policy against f iling a grievance or complaint against a city employee or officer,which the employee knows to be false,explaining that richey allegations of sexual harassment were found to be without merit after investigation.the recommendation also stated that richey violated a personnel policy against t hreatening,fighting with,intimidating,coercing,or abusing other employees,because richey verbal intimidation and abuse of another employee served to create a hostile work environment at george owens nature park.
heacock approved this recommendation,and suspended richey without pay for ten days on april,pending termination.richey requested and was granted a hearing with a personnel board,comprised of five citizens of the city who were not city employees.richey was present at the may hearing along with his counsel,and he presented and witnesses.
the personnel board found that richey had committed the two violations of policy cited by fisher,and approved fisher recommendation that richey be terminated.the board specifically found that richey knowingly made false complaints and allegations against knott,and,with respect to the second violation concerning intimidation or abuse of other employees,noted that richey had previously been suspended for workplace violence issues.heacock accepted this recommendation,and terminated richey effective may.
richey sued the city and its human resources director,debra craig,under for alleged violations of his constitutional rights.richey also filed a claim under title vii,but later dropped that allegation and added a claim under the missouri human rights act alleging unlawful retaliation.the district court granted summary judgment for the city and craig,holding that neither the city nor craig had violated richey constitutional rights,and that the city had not violated the mhra.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,granting richey all reasonable inferences without resorting to speculation.johnson ready mixed concrete,cir.we will affirm if the city has shown that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
richey first argues that he was fired for opposing sex discrimination made unlawful by the mhra.the mhra makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of sex.the statute further provides that it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice to retaliate or discriminate in any manner against a person because such person has opposed sex discrimination forbidden by.to prove a violation of the mhra,a plaintiff alleging unlawful retaliation must prove that he engaged in protected activity,and that as a direct result,he suffer ed damages due to an act of reprisal.keeney hereford concrete,en banc.
the retaliation prohibition in the mhra parallels a similar provision under federal law in title vii.both statutes contains an opposition clause,which prevents employers from firing an employee for opposing an unlawful employment practice.a.the prohibitions on retaliation in the mhra and title vii are not identical in scope and purpose,keeney,at,but the differences between the statutes are not at issue here the relevant issue is whether richey was fired because he opposed any practice prohibited by the mhra.we see no analytical difference between this prohibition,and the parallel prohibition in title vii,which makes it unlawful to terminate an employee because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.a.thus,we may look to our precedents on retaliation in the title vii context for guidance in evaluating richey claim under the mhra.see carter chrysler,cir finley empiregas,cir cross cleaver,cir holding that it was not plain error to issue a combined retaliation instruction on title vii and the mhra because there does not appear to be any effective difference between the participation clauses in the mhra and title vii.
the district court concluded that richey had not met the first element of a retaliation claim,because he had not engaged in protected activity.the court observed that richey never complained of unlawful sex discrimination,and that by his own characterization,he merely sought to clear the air between himself and knott.the court then concluded,alternatively,that even if richey conduct was protected,he failed to present a submissible case that the city terminated him because of his opposition to sex discriminatio
