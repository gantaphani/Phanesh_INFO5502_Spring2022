anderson appeals from a magistrate judge order denying her motion for a new trial in her action against woodcreek venture,and three of its employees collectively,woodcreek.because the record casts into doubt whether anderson voluntarily consented to the magistrate judge jurisdiction to enter judgment as required by c,and because our appellate jurisdiction depends on the proper exercise of magistrate judge jurisdiction,id.c,we remand to the district court to determine if anderson voluntarily consented under subsection c.
anderson and her daughter rented a townhouse unit from woodcreek under the department of housing and urban development hud housing choice voucher program.by the terms of a hud addendum to the rental agreement,the housing authority of jackson county,oregon housing authority,had to approve the composition of the family residing in the unit.the housing authority granted approval only for anderson and her daughter.
in january of,woodcreek employees reported to the housing authority that anderson had a identified as wills,the father of anderson with her for more than seven days in violation of the rental agreement.anderson was subsequently served with a notice that wills must vacate the premises or fill out an application and be approved to live in the unit.without responding,wills and anderson,along with their daughter,left on a trip to california and were gone for more than a week.in their absence,woodcreek employees entered anderson unit without permission,supposedly out of a concern that they had not heard from anderson in over a week.they also sent her a notice of termination for the alleged breach of her lease agreement.
on march,anderson and wills filed,pro se,an action in the district of oregon alleging that woodcreek attempted to evict anderson and limit other dwelling privileges based on anderson and wills race,color,and gender in contravention of the fair housing act of,as amended,and the civil rights act of,and.they also accused woodcreek of violating anderson fourth amendment rights by entering her home without permission.
on the same day the action was filed,the district court clerk office issued its notice to counsel regarding assignment of presiding judicial officer notice form.the notice form designates assignment of the case to honorable john cooney,magistrate judge,and explains in part the above referenced case has been assigned to the presiding judicial officer shown below for disposition,to include the conduct of trial entry of final judgment.the marker does not correspond to an enumerated footnote,but at the bottom of the page where footnote text normally appears the notice form states 
cases initially assigned to a united states magistrate shall be administered by that judge,to include the scheduling of all discovery matters,and with the consent of the parties,the conduct of trial entry of final judgment.pursuant to,all united states magistrates in the district of oregon have been certified to exercise civil jurisdiction in assigned cases,to include trial and entry of final judgment.appeals from the entry of such judgments go directly to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit,not to a trial de novo before a district judge.therefore,parties are strongly encouraged to file a consent to trial and entry of final judgment see.b.
in response to the notice form and woodcreek motion to to make more definite and certain,anderson and wills filed their first form pleading on march.the document contained three statements in its caption opposition to defendants sic motion to dismiss and plaintiffs sic motion for leave to amend complaint,plaintiffs deny magistrates sic jurisdiction,and plaintiffs sic motion for summary judgment.the text stated in part plaintiffs wills and anderson do hereby deny magistrates sic jurisdiction.notably,both parties needed to consent to the magistrate judge authority to enter judgment for the magistrate judge to have jurisdiction over woodcreek motion to dismiss and anderson and wills summary judgment motion.as of this point,however,only woodcreek had filed the district of oregon form consent to jurisdiction by a united states magistrate judge and designation of normal appeal route consent form.
anderson and wills next pleading was filed may,and was titled in part plaintiffs motion to deny magistrates sic jurisdiction and opposition to defendants sic motion to remove plaintiff,jim dandy wills,as a party.once again,both parties were required to consent before the magistrate judge could rule dispositively on woodcreek motion to remove wills.anderson and wills continued to hold out,announcing in the text of this pleading that p ursuant to,plaintiffs do hereby deny magistrates sic jurisdiction and move the court to assign a federal district court judge to this instant case.
on june,magistrate judge cooney referred the motion to deny his jurisdiction to district court judge michael hogan for consideration and stayed the case pending judge hogan decision.judge hogan issued a terse ruling on june,this court having considered plaintiffs motion to deny magistrates jurisdiction in this matter,it is hereby ordered that plaintiff motion is denied.no reference was made to woodcreek motion to dismiss,woodcreek motion to remove plaintiff wills,or anderson and wills summary judgment motion.
nothing further occurred until july,when anderson,allegedly anxious her case would sit inactive unless she consented to the magistrate judge jurisdiction,filed,along with wills,consent forms.the magistrate judge dismissed wills from the suits and woodcreek eventually prevailed in a jury trial.anderson filed a motion for a new trial,arguing in part that her consent to magistrate judge jurisdiction was involuntary.magistrate judge cooney denied this motion on october,whereupon anderson filed this appeal.
anderson renews her involuntary consent argument before us.as this argument bears on our jurisdiction to hear her appeal,we consider it first.
the relevant sources of appellate jurisdiction over final orders issued by magistrate judges reside principally in two statutory provisions.the section directly providing for jurisdiction on appeal reads in part 
upon entry of judgment in any case referred under paragraph of this subsection,an aggrieved party may appeal directly to the appropriate united states court of appeals from the judgment of the magistrate judge in the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a district court.the consent of the parties allows a magistrate judge designated to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph of this subsection to direct the entry of a judgment of the district court in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure.
c emphasis added.the paragraph reference in section c is to section c,the provision affording the magistrate judge jurisdiction.it states in part that u pon the consent of the parties,a united states magistrate judge may conduct any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case,when specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court.id.c emphasis added see also fed.civ.establishing the procedures contemplated by section c.our appellate jurisdiction therefore depends on the magistrate judge lawful exercise of jurisdiction,nasca peoplesoft in re marriage of nasca,cir holding that the magistrate judge lack of jurisdiction a fortiori deprives this court of appellate jurisdiction,which in turn depends on proper district court designation and the voluntary consent of the parties to entry of judgment by the magistrate judge,estate of conners by meredith,cir holding that because the magistrate did not obtain party consent to enter a final order,the defendants notice of appeal from that order was a nullity see also roell withrow,d thomas,dissenting absence of consent means absence of judgment,which,in turn,means absence of appellate jurisdiction.
consent thus emerges from the statute as the touchstone of magistrate judge jurisdiction.subsection c,in addition to referring to subsection c,expressly reinforces its insistence on consensual designation of a case to a magistrate judge for disposition.this statutory structure was designed by members of congress who explicitly considered voluntary consent imperative.for example,the senate committee on the judiciary stated when recommending passage of the federal magistrate act of the bill enacting most of c current text that 
some have expressed concern that the designation of certain classes of cases for trial before magistrates might subtly coerce litigants into consenting in those cases.the bill clearly requires the voluntary consent of the parties as a prerequisite to a magistrate exercise of the new jurisdiction.the committee firmly believes that no pressure,tacit or expressed,should be applied to the litigants to induce them to consent to trial before the magistrates.

the voluntary consent requirement was designed to assuage constitutional concerns,as congress did not want to erode a litigant right to insist on a trial before an article iii judge.see dixon ylst,cir a party to a federal civil case has,subject to some exceptions,a constitutional right to proceed before an article iii judge,citing pacemaker diagnostic clinic of,instromedix,cir en banc.the house of representatives committee on the judiciary reported that consent to both the magistrate judge and his or her entry of final judgment was a primary factor of a solid constitutional foundation for creation of the federal magistrates system.no,at see also,at,reprinted in at in light of this requirement of consent,no witness at the hearings on the bill found any constitutional question that could be raised against the provision.cong.rec.statement of robert kastenmeier rebuffing a constitutional challenge to the bill by arguing in part that the magistrates jurisdiction is entirely consensual.if any party does not care to have his or her case heard by a magistrate,there is no compulsion to do so,at dissenting views of elizabeth holtzman opining that the legislation fosters too great a risk of coerced consent for it to pass constitutional muster.congress wise decision to include a robust voluntary consent prerequisite resulted in judicial approval of the legislation.we held that in light of the statutory precondition of voluntary litigant consent and the provisions for the appointment and control of the magistrates by article iii courts,the conduct of civil trials by magistrates is constitutional.pacemaker diagnostic clinic of,at.
the statutory backdrop described above has prompted us to pronounce that a clear and unambiguous expression of consent is required to vest the magistrate with authority under subsection c,alaniz cal.processors,cir per curiam,and that such consent be explicit.in re san vicente med.partners,cir see also kofoed int l of workers,local,cir where the magistrate judge has not received the full consent of the parties,he has no authority to enter judgment in the case.

notice of assignment to magistrate judge 
the initial factor leading us to question the voluntariness of anderson consent is the notice form.the notice is not to the parties but to counsel and,of course,anderson had none and could not be expected to understand the notice as would its designated recipient counsel.its relevant clause bears repeating in full the above referenced case has been assigned to the presiding judicial officer shown below for disposition,to include the conduct of trial entry of final judgment emphasis added footnote marker omitted.this provision,standing alone,permits only one reading that the magistrate judge assigned to the case is to dispose of it,including entry of final judgment.but that can not be ordered without prior consent.how does the notice form attempt to circumvent this obvious reading the somewhat contradictory paragraph at the bottom of the page tempers the language conclusiveness presuming one follows the footnote marker to it by averring that with the consent of the parties,the conduct of trial entry of final judgment will be administered by the assigned magistrate judge.the reference to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure also attempts to modify the notice form plain statement that the magistrate judge is assigned to make the final entry of judgment in the case,although a naked citation without the rule actual text does so indirectly.but then,it is specifically stated to be a notice to counsel who presumptively knows what rule b says.
read as a whole,the paragraph at the foot of the page does not completely clarify the notice form earlier unqualified assignment of anderson case for full and final disposition.at the very least,the notice form is ambiguous as to whether the assignment is partial and unclear on whether full magistrate judge jurisdiction is contingent upon the parties expressing their voluntary consent.
proceedings before the magistrate judge and district judge 
it is evident from the record that the magistrate judge,as well as the district court,did not mitigate any confusion the notice form may have sparked their response to anderson objections only seemed to compound it.anderson first form pleading opposed woodcreek motion to dismiss and moved for summary judgment.as both motions are among those upon which a magistrate judge can not,on mere designation by the district court,issue a dispositive order,b a,an order for the entry of judgment on either motion would require the parties prior consent.id.c.anderson and wills refusal was obvious their pleading caption stated in part plaintiffs deny magistrates jurisdiction,and they stated in the text that plaintiffs wills and anderson do hereby deny magistrates sic jurisdiction.clearly,there was a proper objection to magistrate judge jurisdiction,and there was no judicial response.
the next round of pleadings paralleled the previous one.this time,woodcreek moved to remove wills as a party,another motion on which an article iii judge must ultimately rule unless the parties consent otherwise.but there was no consent.on the contrary,anderson and wills again resisted.their opposition included in the caption plaintiffs sic motion to deny magistrates sic jurisdiction and declared in text that p ursuant to,plaintiffs do hereby deny magistrates sic jurisdiction and move the court to assign a federal district court judge to this instant case.a pattern emerges the motions on which woodcreek requested a ruling entailed entry of judgment,and hence required the parties prior consent nonetheless,anderson and wills unequivocally refused to sub
