donald cook challenges a city of buena park city ordinance obliging landlords to undertake eviction proceedings against all occupants of a rental unit when the chief of police suspects a tenant has engaged in or permitted illegal drug activity,crime,or a nuisance in or near the rental property.because the ordinance imposes on landlords a substantial risk of erroneous deprivation of property rights through compelled eviction litigation,unwarranted fines and penalties,and countersuits by tenants,we hold the ordinance violates procedural due process.we conclude the procedures employed by the ordinance are constitutionally infirm in three respects first,the notice requiring the landlord to institute unlawful detainer proceedings provides insufficient information to prosecute the action second,the period within which the landlord must commence eviction is too short and finally,the ordinance requires the landlord to prevail in the eviction action or face fines,penalties,a lien on his or her property,and even misdemeanor punishment.in view of these failings,we affirm the trial court judgment striking down the ordinance as unconstitutional.
factual and procedural background 
cook rented an apartment to steve bicksler beginning in.on august,police cited bicksler roommate,douglas dixon,for possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of health and safety code section.dixon thereafter participated in california drug treatment diversion program,under which a defendant plea of guilty pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute a conviction for any purpose people laino cal th,d,quoting,subd.d.on august,cook received a letter from buena park police chief richard tefank notifying him of dixon citation.the letter stated in boldface type,you may use this information to take whatever action you deem necessary.on september,cook received another letter from tefank ordering him to take action in the form of a notice to quit,a notice to vacate,or other legal remedies as required by any written rental contract with the tenant s,within ten business days and to diligently prosecute such actions,in accordance with the city narcotics and crime eviction program.buena park municipal code bpmc,the ordinance.
the ordinance provides that landlords shall not cause or knowingly permit any premises under his or her control to be used or maintained for any illegal drug activity,crime,or in such manner as to constitute a nuisance or any tenant to use or occupy premises under the landlord control,if the tenant commits,permits,maintains or is involved in any illegal drug activity,crime,or nuisance on the premises.bpmc.
if the chief of police determines the landlord has violated this provision,he may send written notice to the landlord identify ing the offending tenant s,the unit number if applicable,the specific violation s,and shall state the date s and time s of any observed criminal activity and any resulting arrest s,and shall further state that as to such tenant s the landlord is required to serve and diligently prosecute either a three day notice to quit or a thirty day notice to vacate.bpmc,b.the ordinance defines diligently prosecute to mean such prosecution by the landlord as is necessary to cause the subject rental unit to be completely vacated by all occupants.ibid.
the ordinance also provides for recovery of possession by the landlord as follows grounds for eviction.notwithstanding any provision of the buena park city code to the contrary,a landlord may bring an action to recover possession of a rental unit upon any of the following grounds.the tenant is committing or permitting to exist any illegal drug activity,crime,or nuisance on the premises or.the tenant has been convicted of a crime wherein the underlying offense involves illegal drug activity,nuisance activity or a crime on the premises.bpmc.
the landlord may appeal the chief of police determination that he or she is in violation of the ordinance,provided the appeal is taken within days of the notice of violation.the appeal is heard by the city manager,who shall cause the matter to be set for hearing.written notice of the date and time of such hearing shall be served by first class mail addressed to the landlord last known business address.following the conclusion of the hearing,the city manager may affirm,reverse or reverse subject to conditions,the police chief determination of violation.the city manager decision shall be based upon written findings and shall be final.bpmc,c.
if the landlord fails to comply within business days of the police chief notice or to file an appeal of the notice to the city manager within days,then the city may file an action for injunctive relief or utilize any other remedy provided by law to compel compliance,including but not limited to,all remedies available to abate a nuisance.bpmc,a.similarly,the city may immediately proceed to utilize the same remedies if the landlord appeal is denied.bpmc,d.a landlord first three violations of the ordinance within a period constitutes an infraction subject to varying fines,and the fourth violation is a misdemeanor.bpmc.
on october,within days of receiving the chief of police notice,cook appealed to the city manager.the city manager denied the appeal and cook sought relief in the orange county superior court,challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance.cook and the city filed for summary judgment on whether the ordinance violated procedural due process,substantive due process,equal protection,free speech,freedom of contract,or the inalienable rights and jury trial clauses of the state constitution cal,art.i.the summary judgment motions also contested whether the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad,an illegal taking of property,or preempted by provisions of state law related to controlled substance regulation health,drug diversion,and,as phrased by cook,the unlawful detainer statutes.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of cook,ruling the ordinance violated substantive due process and was overbroad,sweep ing up the innocent tenant,the landlord,and the guilty tenant into the punitive remedy of eviction.the court permanently enjoined enforcement of the ordinance,and the city now appeals.
discussion 
the city argues the trial court erred in concluding the ordinance violates substantive due process.cook contends vaguely that s ubstantive due process is implicated by violation of the rights set forth throughout the pleadings as best we can discern,cook suggests that within the penumbra of rights includ ing enjoying and possessing property and privacy,and freedom of association,there lies a substantive due process right guarding against the ordinance terms.substantive due process prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the conscience,citation,or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,citation.united states salerno,d quoting rochin california,and palko connecticut,respectively.as observed by the high court,guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and collins harker heights,d,and we therefore look first to see whether the appeal may be resolved on other grounds.
we agree with cook that the ordinance violates his right to procedural due process under the federal constitution,amend.as a threshold matter,his due process claim depends on having a protected life,liberty,or property interest at stake.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d loudermill compare smith board of medical quality assurance d.noting one need not establish a property or liberty interest as a prerequisite to invoking due process protection under cal,art.i,subd.a.the city argues cook fails this requirement because no landlord has a fundamental right to conduct business in a manner that creates,maintains or constitutes a nuisance.but the city argument is conclusory,assuming that which must be proved.in other words,whether the rental property constitutes a nuisance is precisely the question to be determined by the unlawful detainer proceedings required by the ordinance.see code civ,subd.providing for eviction of a tenant who commits a nuisance.
