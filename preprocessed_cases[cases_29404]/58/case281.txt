background 
jackie pieri and lavinia turner own residential rental properties in san francisco which they seek to remove from the rental market.small property owners of san francisco is an organization seeking to promote home ownership in san francisco.they filed a petition for writ of mandate on march,alleging the city relocation assistance ordinance ordinance,which required landlords to provide relocation assistance to their tenants when removing property from the rental market admin.code,ch,a,subd.e,facially violated the ellis act.the petition alleged the relocation ordinance was not reasonably related to the tenants need for assistance,and therefore impermissibly placed a prohibitive price on the right to withdraw property from the rental market.the trial court granted the petition,ruling that the relocation ordinance facially violated the ellis act.
ii.discussion 
the ellis act was passed in response to a ruling of the california supreme court,nash city of santa monica cal d,which permitted a city to restrict the circumstances in which owners of residential properties could evict tenants in order to withdraw from the rental market.see channing properties city of berkeley th,d channing properties.it provides that no public entity may compel the owner of any residential real property to offer,or to continue to offer,accommodations in the property for rent or lease,except for certain guestrooms or efficiency units within a residential hotel,subd.a.
the city relocation ordinance requires owners of residential rental properties who seek to withdraw from the rental market to provide monetary relocation assistance to their tenants.as pertinent here,it requires that landlords who wish to withdraw all the rental units in a building from rent or lease provide each tenant,with a maximum payment of per unit.admin.code,ch,a,subd.e.the city contends this requirement is proper under the ellis act,which provides notwithstanding section,nothing in this chapter does any of the following c diminishes or enhances any power in any public entity to mitigate any adverse impact on persons displaced by reason of the withdrawal from rent or lease of any accommodations.
the trial court concluded the language of section,subdivision c allows public entities to require mitigation only for low income residents,and that an ordinance requiring relocation assistance regardless of income offended the purposes of the ellis act by prevent ing all but the wealthiest landlords from going out of the rental business.to the extent the relocation ordinance conflicts with state law,it is preempted by the state law and is void.see reidy city and county of san francisco th,d reidy cal,art.xi.we review the trial court interpretation of the ellis act de novo.see reidy,at,d.
the trial court conclusion that the ellis act allows relocation assistance only for low income tenants was derived not from the current statutory language but from channing properties,a case interpreting an earlier version of section,subdivision c.at the time channing properties was decided,section,subdivision c provided as follows notwithstanding section,nothing in this chapter does any of the following c diminishes or enhances any power which currently exists or which may hereafter exist in any public entity to mitigate any adverse impact on persons displaced by reason of the withdrawal from rent or lease of any accommodations in any residential hotel,as defined by section of the health and safety code,which is expressly reserved,or generally used,for occupancy by lower income households,as defined by section of the health and safety code.the reference to residential hotels in paragraph is not intended by the legislature to diminish or enhance any power which currently exits or which may hereafter exist in any public entity to require those same actions for other types of accommodations.stats,ch.
the plaintiff in channing properties challenged a berkeley law requiring that landlords wishing to remove residential property from the rental market provide six months notice and pay per unit for relocation expenses.channing properties,supra,th at,d.the question facing the court was whether then section,subdivision c authorized public entities to require relocation assistance for all displaced tenants,or whether it allowed such assistance only for lower income tenants in accommodations other than residential hotels.channing properties,at,d.division two of the first appellate district noted that former section,subdivision c was a carefully worded statute affording protection to a specifically defined group,low income tenants in residential hotels.channing properties,at,d.if then subdivision c were interpreted to allow cities to require relocation assistance for all displaced tenants,regardless of income,former subdivision c would be meaningless because there would be no need to specify that such assistance could be required for low income tenants of residential hotels.an interpretation restricting the assistance authorized by then subdivision c to low income tenants retain ed subdivision c focus on lower income tenants but clarifie d that the specific reference to residential hotels in subdivision c did not preclude cities from acting to mitigate the effects of removal of rental housing on lower income tenants in other types of housing.channing properties,at,d.furthermore,according to the court,such a construction would effectuate the ellis act purpose of alleviat ing the plight of landlords because to allow relocation assistance for all tenants as a condition of removing rental housing units from the market would place a potentially insurmountable obstacle in the path of landlords wishing to leave the business.id.at,d.in the absence of any indication in the statutory language that the legislature intended to extend protection to tenants other than the lower income tenants identified in section,subdivision c,the court construed then subdivision c to apply only to lower income households.channing properties,at,d.
the legislature amended the ellis act in.section was amended to exempt certain guestrooms and efficiency units in residential hotels from the reach of the ellis act,subd.a.at the same time,section,subdivision c was amended to eliminate the references to residential hotels used for occupancy by lower income households and other types of accommodations stats,ch,and instead to provide simply that the ellis act does not diminish or enhance any public entity power to mitigate any adverse impact on persons displaced by reason of the withdrawal from rent or lease of any accommodations.
pieri argues,and the trial court agreed,that channing properties limitation on relocation assistance to lower income tenants survived the elimination of the statutory language upon which it was based.we see no basis for such a conclusion.as the court noted in channing properties,the intent shown in the wording of former section,subdivision c was to protect lower income tenants.channing properties,supra,th at,d.no such limitation on the legislative intent appears in the current statutory language.the legislature has shown that it can draft language intended to protect only lower income tenants.in eliminating such language,and in including persons displaced by reason of the withdrawal from rent or lease of any accommodations,subd.c,italics added,we can only conclude the legislature meant what it said.
we are not persuaded otherwise by pieri argument that the legislature did not express an intent to overturn the rule of channing properties.it is true that it should not be presumed that the legislative body intends to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.people davenport cal d.however,even if the court construction in channing properti
