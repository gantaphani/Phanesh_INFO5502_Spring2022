following enactment of the telecommunications act of,the federal communications commission promulgated a rule prohibiting restrictions on certain reception devices otard.the rule invalidated 
a ny restriction,including but not limited to any state or local law or regulation,including zoning,or building regulation,or any private covenant,homeowners association rule or similar restriction on property within the exclusive use or control of the antenna user where the user has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the property that impairs the installation,maintenance,or use of antennas that are designed to receive direct broadcast satellite service,video programming services via multipoint distribution services,or television broadcast signals 
preemption of local zoning regulation of satellite earth stations,implementation of section of the telecommunications act of restrictions on reception devices television broadcast service and multichannel multipoint distribution service,first otard order.in,the commission extended the prohibition,with certain exceptions,to lease provision s where the antenna user has a leasehold interest in the property.in the matter of implementation of section of the telecommunications act of on reception devices television broadcast,multichannel multipoint distribution and direct broadcast satellite services,second otard order.
several trade associations representing real estate owners and property appeal the second otard order,contending that the rule,as amended,is invalid on its face.they contend,first,that the commission exceeded its statutory authority in extending the otard rule to leased property second,that the amended rule violates the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution and third,if there is no taking,that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in extending the rule to leaseholds.finding unpersuasive these facial challenges to the amended otard rule,we deny the petition.
in promulgating the otard rules,the commission relied on of the telecommunications act of,stat.the act,which provides 
within days after the date of enactment of this act,the commission shall,pursuant to section of the communications act of,promulgate regulations to prohibit restrictions that impair a viewer ability to receive video programming services through devices designed for reception of television broadcast signals,multichannel multipoint distribution service,or direct broadcast satellite services.
the act also added a new subsection v to the communications act of,granting the commission 
exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of satellite services t he term satellite services means the distribution or broadcasting of programming or services by satellite directly to the subscriber premises without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment 
v.the act left undisturbed the broad statutory directives contained in the communications act of,including the commission mandate to make communications services available to all the people of the united states,and the commission authority to perform any and all acts,make such rules and regulations,and issue such orders as may be necessary in the execution of its functions.id.i.
as early as the,the commission had begun restricting potential barriers to the development of residential video programming.see,preemption of local zoning or other regulation of satellite earth stations.in direct response to the directives in the act,the commission promulgated rules to safeguard viewers ability to use devices designed for direct broadcast satellite services,television broadcast services,and multichannel multipoint distribution services collectively,devices.see,preemption of local zoning regulation of satellite earth stations,implementation of section of the telecommunications act of restrictions on reception devices television broadcast and multichannel multipoint distribution service,notice of proposed rulemaking.the commission adopted its first rule implementing on august.see first otard order.the first otard rule provided 
any restriction,including but not limited to any state or local law or regulation,including zoning,or building regulation,or any private covenant,homeowners association rule or similar restriction on property within the exclusive use or control of the antenna user where the user has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the property,that impairs the installation,maintenance,or use of a device is prohibited 
the prohibitions in the first otard rule applied only to property in which the user of satellite services,the viewer for purposes of had an ownership interest.despite its stated prohibition of any restriction,the rule allowed for several exceptions restrictions on devices were permissible if they served a clearly defined safety objective and were administered in a nondiscriminatory manner to other devices that we re comparable in size,weight and appearance,or if they were necessary to preserve an historic district,and if the restrictions were no more burdensome than necessary.id.b in addition,the otard rule permitted waiver by the commission upon the request of local governments or associations.see id.c.
the first otard rule left unresolved whether the prohibition should apply to property not within the exclusive use or control of a person with an ownership interest,such as common areas or rental properties.first otard order,at see also id.at.on november,after notice and comment,the commission expanded the otard prohibition to include restrictions on reception devices on rental property that is within the exclusive use or control of the tenant who has a leasehold interest in the property.see second otard order.the amended otard rule provides in relevant part 
a any restriction,including but not limited to any state or local law or regulation,including zoning,landuse,or building regulations,or any private covenant,contract provision,lease provision,homeowners association rule or similar restriction,on property within the exclusive use or control of the antenna user where the user has a direct or indirect ownership interest or leasehold interest in the property that impairs the installation,maintenance,or use of a device is prohibited 
a new language italicized.under the amended otard rule,tenants are able,subject to some restrictions,to install devices wherever they rent space outside of a building,such as balcony railings,patios,yards,gardens,or any other similar area and,in some instances,inside rental units.second otard order,at the commission did not,however,extend the otard rule to the placement of antennas on common property such as outside walls where viewers may have access but not possession and exclusive rights of use or control or restricted access areas such as rooftops where viewers generally do not have access or possession.see id.at.
following the commission denial of petitions for reconsideration of the second otard order,petitioners filed this appeal.
petitioners contend that the commission exceeded its statutory authority by extending the otard prohibition to leased property.to determine whether the commission acted within its legally delegated authority in promulgating the amended otard rule,the court employs the familiar test outlined by the supreme court in chevron,natural resources defense council,d if,through the communications act,congress has spoken directly to the precise issue presented by petitioners,that is the end of the matter,and the court defers to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if,however,the communications act is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue at hand,the commission may exercise its reasonable discretion in construing the statute id.as petitioners as the commission implicitly concedes,see second otard order,at communications act does not explicitly address the relationship,nor does it explicitly grant the commission jurisdiction over the real estate industry,an area that is normally outside the commission scope of authority.see,illinois citizens comm.for broad.fcc,cir.hence,the court focus is on whether,in implementing,the commission reasonably interpreted its statutory authority.we look to the text of the communications act of and the telecommunications act of,and to the legislative history of.
in enacting the communications act of,congress intended to confer upon the commission sweeping authority to regulate in a field of enterprise the dominant characteristic of which was the rapid pace of its unfolding.office of communication of the united church of christ,quoting national broad.united states.in accordance with this goal,the provisions of the communications act are explicitly applicable to all interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio,and the commission,being the single government agency with unified jurisdiction and regulatory power over all forms of communication,is granted broad authority to execute its mandate.united states southwestern cable,d quoting a footnotes omitted see also capital cities cable,crisp,d metropolitan council of naacp branches fcc,united video,fcc,national ass of regulatory utility comm rs fcc,wold communications,fcc.the communications act thus directs the commission to perform any and all acts,make such rules and regulations,and issue such orders as may be necessary in the execution of its functions.i see also id.r.
congress continued in the act to vest broad authority in the commission,granting the commission exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the provision of satellite services,r,and instructing the commission promptly to issue regulations to prohibit restrictions that impede viewer s from using devices id.consistent with the broad language of other sections of the commission enabling statute,congress demonstrated no intent to qualify the terms viewer and restrictions it did not specify which types of viewer s were covered,or which types of restrictions were permissible.had congress intended to qualify these terms,it clearly would have done so,especially in light of the courts expansive reading of congress previous delegations of authority to the commission.see generally commissioner keystone consol,d cannon university of chicago,d lorillard pons,d service,department of.having explicitly left a gap for the commission to fill,congress delegated to the commission the authority to elucidate by regulation and to address ambiguity in the statute,united states mead,d,quoting chevron,at,and thus to preempt state enforcement of lease provisions that place restrictions on viewers who wish to install,maintain,or use a reception device within their leasehold.second otard order,at.
the legislative history of reinforces the conclusion that congress intended in to give the commission a very broad mandate.the house committee report on states that 
the committee intends this section to preempt enforcement of state or local statutes and regulations,or state or local legal requirements,or restrictive covenants or encumbrances that prevent the use of antennae designed for reception of television broadcast signals or of satellite receivers designed for receipt of direct broadcast satellite services.existing regulations,including but not limited to,zoning laws,ordinances,restrictive covenants or homeowners association rules,shall be unenforceable to the extent contrary to this section.
at.petitioners read this statement to reflect congress intent to prohibit only restrictions affecting property owners,such as zoning restrictions,covenants,and homeowners association restrictions,thereby restoring those individuals property rights.an equally plausible reading of the house one consistent with the broad authority reflected in the commission statutory indicate congress intent to invalidate various types of private contracts under state law,such as homeowners association contracts and lease agreements,that might interfere with a viewer ability to receive certain types of satellite broadcasting signals.
petitioners essential claim is that however broad the commission mandate,it may only exercise its authority over communications and persons engaged in communications.a.this,petitioners contend,does not include either the real estate industry or the relationship,which is a legal allocation of property rights governed by state law.petitioners rely on cases in which courts have denied the commission the authority to determine the validity of contracts between commission licensees and others,regents of the.of georgia carroll,or to regulate any and all activities that substantially affect communications.illinois citizens comm.for,at see also radio station wow johnson.southwestern bell.fcc.in contrast to those cases,however,the issue here is not the extent to which a ruling by the commission affects areas that are tangential to the commission jurisdiction,such as the height and location of a building.see,illinois citizens comm.for,at.congress has expressly vested the commission with exclusive jurisdiction and authority to ensure that all viewers may access satellite services.see v act,stat.where the commission has been instructed by congress to prohibit restrictions on the provision of a regulated means of communication,it may assert jurisdiction over a party that directly furnishes those restrictions,and,in so doing,the commission may alter property rights created under state law.see louisiana pub.serv.comm fcc,d fidelity fed.savings and loan ass de la cuesta,d capital cities cable,at.new york state comm on cable television fcc,
for these reasons,we hold that the commission could reasonably construe to apply to all viewer s,including tenants,and to obligate the commission to prohibit a ny restriction,including lease provisions,that impairs the installation,maintenance,or use of a device.it follows that the court properly defers to the commission interpretation of its statutory authority.see mead,at.at chemical mfrs.ass natural resources defense council,d see also united states riverside bayview homes,d.
possibly foreseeing their fate under chevron,petitioners contend that our analysis of the amended otard rule should be guided not by chevron,but rather by the principles set forth in bell atlantic telephone companies fcc.in bell atlantic,the court declined to apply chevron deference to a commission order requiring the physical collocation of competitive access providers to the central offices of local telephone exchange companies.faced with a similar statutory silence on the precise issue at hand,see id.at,the court adopted a narrowing construction of the communications because the commission interpretation created an identifiable class of applications that would necessarily constitute a taking.id.at quoting riverside bayview homes,at.petitioners contend that,as in bell atlantic,the commission interpretation of and of its authority under the communications act creates such an identifiable class and is therefore impermissible.consistent with supreme court instruction,we disagree.
the first obstacle to petitioners takings claim arises from their effort to classify the amended otard prohibition as a per se taking under loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d.in loretto,the supreme court held that a physical intrusion by government is a property restriction of an unusually serious character for purposes of the takings clause.id.at.internal quotations omitted.the court further held that when the physical intrusion reaches the extreme form of a permanent physical occupation,a per se taking has occurred.id.thus,in loretto,the supreme court invalidated a new york statute authorizing a cable television company to place cable equipment onto a private property owner building on the grounds that the statute constituted a per se taking.id.at.petitioners contend that a tenant unauthorized use of the property,by installing a device against the express wishes of the landlord,is an invasion of the property rights that the landlord has chosen to retain in the leased property and therefore amounts to a per se taking.petitioners further contend that the amended otard rule constitutes a per se taking under loretto because it enlarges the tenant rights beyond the contractual provisions of the lease,thereby stripping landowners of property rights that they rightfully reserved,and constitutes a taking of the property owner right to exclude.none of these contentions suffices to characterize the amended otard rule as a per se taking.
first,petitioners fail to acknowledge a key factor that places the amended otard rule outside the scope of loretto consent to the occupation of the property.the loretto court emphasized that the per se taking rule is very narrow and applies only to regulations that require the landlord to suffer the physical intrusion of his building by a third party.id.at.emphasis added.unlike the building owner in loretto,whose premises were occupied without her consent,the landlord subject to the amended otard rule has ceded control of his or her property to a tenant with whom the landlord has a contractual relationship.thus,no third party stranger to the property is involved.while petitioners would label a tenant a third party intruder if the tenant uses the premises in a way that is prohibited by the lease,the supreme court has rejected this characterization.consensual occupation of the property,as distinct from a permanent physical occupation,loretto,at,occurs once the landlord voluntarily enters into a lease with the tenant.in fcc florida power,d,for example,the supreme court upheld the commission authority under the pole attachments act,to regulate pole rental fees paid to an electric utility by various cable television companies using the utility poles the court distinguished loretto on the grounds that,unlike the new york statute that allowed cable companies to access an individual property,the pole attachments act did not authorize third parties to access the utility poles,but merely regulated the terms of the rental once cable companies and the utilities agreed to the rental of the poles.required acquiescence,the court held,is at the heart of the loretto concept of occupation.id.at.it is thus the invitation,not the rent,that makes the difference.the line which separates cases from loretto is the unambiguous distinction between a commercial lessee and an interloper with a government license.id.at.emphasis added.as with the pole rentals in florida power,the landlord affected by the amended otard rule will have voluntarily ceded control of an interest in his or her property to a tenant.having ceded such possession of the property,a landlord thereby submits to the commission rightful regulation of a term of that occupation see florida power,at.
second,petitioners ignore the extensive case law upholding the government authority to regulate various aspects of the relationship without paying compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation entails,loretto,at,even though some of these regulations transfer wealth from the one who is regulated to another.yee city of escondido,d.although a landlord lease restrictions are enforceable property rights,see united states general motors,governmental restrictions on the exercise of those rights do not necessarily constitute a per se taking.for example,w hen a landowner decides to rent his land to tenants,the government may place ceilings on the rents the landowner can charge,or require the landowner to accept tenants he does not like,without creating a per se taking.yee,at.citations omitted see also pruneyard shopping center robins,d heart of atlanta motel,united states,d mcandrews fleet bank of massachusetts,cir.in light of this precedent,regulation of a single aspect of the relationship,enacted pursuant to the manifest congressional objective of safeguarding viewers access to satellite services,does not result in a per se taking.see,v.
third,the supreme court has rejected the contention that regulation of the terms of a relationship constitutes on its face an invasion of the landlord right to exclude.see yee,at.in yee,the court held that a rent control ordinance affecting the owners of a mobile home park,even when considered in light of a state law restricting the landlords right of eviction,did not constitute a taking of the landlords right to exclude.see id.the court stated that no government has required any physical invasion of petitioners property.petitioners tenants were invited by petitioners,not forced upon them by the government.id.at.citing florida power,at.consequently,w hile the right to exclude is doubtless one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property,that right was not taken from petitioners on the mere face of the regulation.id.quoting kaiser aetna united states,d.
because the amended otard rule does not amount to a compelled physical invasion of property and hence a per se taking,petitioners only potential takings claim is a regulatory taking claim.that kind of claim requires ad hoc,factual inquiries,penn central transp.new york city,d and entails complex factual assessments of the purposes and economic effects of government action.yee,at.because of this standard,the amended otard rule can not be said to create an identifiable class of applications that would necessarily constitute a regulatory taking.bell atlantic,at quoting riverside bayview homes,at.for that reason,the bell atlantic approach to statutory interpretation does not apply,and the chevron analysis of part ii does.
petitioners alternate claim that even if statutorily authorized,the amended otard rule is nonetheless an unconstitutional regulatory taking that must be set aside fails for two independent reasons.first,in general,e quitable relief is not available to enjoin an alleged taking of private property for a public use,duly authorized by law,when a suit for compensation can be brought against the sovereign subsequent to that taking.riverside bayview homes,at.quoting ruckelshaus monsanto,d see also bell atlantic,at.second,because petitioners regulatory taking claim depends upon ad hoc,factual inquiries,it can not satisfy the requirements for making the kind of facial challenge petitioners have brought here.see yee,at.gulf power united states,cir.petitioners are still free to make claims for just compensation on account of regulatory takings with respect to their individual buildings,but no such claims have been made here,nor could they be.see riverside bayview homes,at.
as an apparent afterthought,petitioners summarily contend that in the absence of a taking,the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously,and abused its discretion,in promulgating the amended otard rule.petitioners primarily quote what they consider a tautology from the second otard order removing a restriction on installing an antenna within a leasehold does not impose a duty on the landlord to relinquish property because the landlord has already voluntarily relinquished possession of the leasehold by virtue of the lease.second otard order,at.this statement,petitioners assert,demonstrates that the commission rule is purposeless or illogical if the commission has taken nothing,petitioners ask,then why is the rule necessary petitioners have misconstrued the commission position.
contrary to petitioners assertion,the commission does not argue that the landlord gave away a property right to the tenant by relinquishing possession of the property.rather,the quoted statement represents the commission position,explained in detail in the subsequent paragraphs of the second otard order,that although a landlord may retain property interests in a leasehold,a restriction on the terms that the landlord may impose on the tenant is not a physical occupation giving rise to a per se taking because the landlord has voluntarily relinquished possession of the property.see second otard order,at.
accordingly,because petitioners facial challenge fails to present an identifiable set of instances in which mere application of the amended otard rule will necessarily or even probably constitute a taking,riverside bayview homes,at,we apply chevron deference to the commission interpretation of and of its broad mandate under the communications act,and we deny the petition
