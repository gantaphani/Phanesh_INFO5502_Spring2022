this writ proceeding arises from a lawsuit brought by petitioner howard wright construction hwcc to foreclose its mechanic lien in the amount of million on property owned by real party in interest,bbic investors,llc bbic.bbic had leased the property to,and the construction work performed by petitioner consisted of improvements to convert the property from a warehouse into an adequate facility for telecommunications business.the question posed to us is whether the notice of nonresponsibility recorded and posted by bbic insulates the property from the lien for construction work undertaken by,the tenant.
procedural history 
soon after petitioner filed its complaint,it also recorded a notice of lis pendens.bbic then moved to expunge the notice of lis pendens on the grounds that bbic had no privity with petitioner,that the construction work was performed pursuant to a contract between petitioner and,and that bbic had previously recorded a notice of nonresponsibility.simultaneously,bbic moved to remove the mechanic lien on the same grounds.
in opposition to those motions,petitioner relied upon the participating owner doctrine,which makes the property owner subject to a mechanic lien,despite a notice of nonresponsibility,if the owner participates in the contract to make the improvements.the trial court concluded,however,that petitioner failed to prove bbic participation in the lessee improvements,and the court granted both the motion to expunge the lis pendens and the motion to remove the mechanic lien.petitioner now seeks review of the trial court decision on both motions.we issued an order to show cause and a temporary stay of the trial court order removing the mechanic lien.
discussion 
judicial reviewa.writ relief 
a notice of lis pendens may be expunged if the trial court finds that the has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.code civ.an order expunging a notice of lis pendens is not appealable,but it may be reviewed on a petition for writ of mandate.code civ.
the order removing the mechanic lien is in a different posture.a motion to remove a mechanic lien is recognized as a device that allows the property owner to obtain speedy relief from an unjustified lien or a lien of an unjustified amount without waiting for trial on the action to foreclose the lien.lambert superior court d.the inquiry upon such motion is likewise limited to the probable validity of the lien.id.at.however,unlike the grant of a motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens,the grant of a motion to remove a mechanic lien is essentially a judgment on the underlying foreclosure action that no lien judgment that,upon recordation,removes the lien from the public records.and,that judgment is a final,appealable judgment for which writ relief would ordinarily be denied.
however,we have concluded that in the interests of judicial economy we will undertake a review of the judgment in the foreclosure action along with the order expunging the notice of lis pendens.both the motion to expunge and the motion to remove raised the identical question of the probable validity of petitioner lien,and the trial court order disposed of the two motions simultaneously.a separate review on appeal of the order to remove the lien would be unnecessarily duplicative.moreover,the apparent legislative purpose for making an order expunging a notice of lis pendens reviewable only by writ was to expedite the review process so as not to tie up title conveyances.if we were to wait for an appeal to be perfected on the order removing the lien so as to decide the two matters together,the delay would defeat the purpose of speedy writ review.
standard of review 
our threshold task is to establish the appropriate standard of review.as already indicated,bbic motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens and motion to remove the mechanic lien both raise the probable validity of hwcc mechanic lien.the probable validity standard was added to the lis pendens statute in to override the decision in malcolm superior court cal d,and other cases holding that the trial court on a motion to expunge may not conduct a minitrial on the merits of the case.the statute changed the law to require a judicial evaluation of the merits of the underlying claim.see code,west civ.proc.supp.foll.unlike other motions,the burden is on the party opposing the motion to,the establish the probable validity of the underlying claim code civ.the must establish the probable validity of the claim by a preponderance of the evidence.code civ.
the legislature intent,reflected in the state bar report see fn,ante,was to make the standard on a motion to expunge a notice of lis pendens equivalent to the probable validity standard applicable under the attachment law code civ,and other provisions for pretrial judicial evaluation,code civ,writ of possession code civ,appointment of receiver,subd.c shareholder derivative action.code,west civ.proc.supp.foll.that is,the plaintiff must at least establish a prima facie case.if the defendant makes an appearance,the court must then consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the probable outcome of the litigation.cal.law revision comm.coms.to code civ.
we have been cited to no case law,nor has our research disclosed any,regarding the standard to be applied on appellate review of an expungement motion.we take note that the state bar report analogizes the probable validity standard in the lis pendens statute to the evaluation of the plaintiff likelihood of success for issuance of a preliminary injunction.see code,west civ.proc.supp.foll.accordingly,in determining our standard of review,we draw upon the standards applicable to the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction.the decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.it county of imperial cal d.the trial court interlocutory decision on the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail at trial reflects nothing more than the court evaluation of the controversy based on the record before it at the time of its ruling.people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d.on review of the trial court ruling,the appellate court does not reweigh conflicting evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses.the reviewing court task is simply to ensure that the trial court factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence.shoemaker county of los angeles th,d hilb,rogal hamilton ins.services robb th,d.if,however,the material facts are not disputed,then the issue becomes a question of law for our de novo review.california correctional peace officers state of california th,d moorpark homeowner vrt th,d.
in the present case,the material facts were not in conflict and were principally derived from the terms of the written lease between bbic and.the trial court ruling that hwcc failed to prove the probable validity of its mechanic lien was a decision that the evidence was insufficient to establish that bbic was a participating owner.we independently review the effect and significance of the undisputed evidence and draw our own legal conclusions.as we explain in the discussion that follows,we conclude that hwcc established the probable validity of its lien and that the trial court erred in granting bbic motions to expunge the notice of lis pendens and to remove the mechanic lien.accordingly,we will remand for further proceedings on the action to foreclose the lien.
