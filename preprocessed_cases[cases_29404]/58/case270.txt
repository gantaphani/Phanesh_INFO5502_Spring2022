introduction 
after plaintiff michele lazan was injured while on duty as a deputy sheriff for the county of riverside,she unsuccessfully filed an application for disability retirement.she later requested that the county file an application for disability retirement on her behalf under government code section.when the county refused,lazan filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate in the superior court.the court found that the county effectively separated lazan when it found that her disability prevented her from being able to perform her job duties.the court issued a writ of mandate requiring that the county file the application.
on appeal,the county argues that it had no duty under government code section to file an application for disability retirement because it did not believe that lazan was disabled.the county challenges the court finding that it separated lazan because it had offered her an alternative position with the same rank and pay.the county also challenges the court ruling on attorney fees.
we conclude that the county had a duty to apply for disability retirement because,despite its claimed belief,the county treated lazan as though she was incapable of performing her job duties because of her disability.we also reject the county other arguments and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
lazan had worked as a deputy sheriff with the county since.on june,lazan,while responding to a call,collided into another patrol car.after the accident,lazan complained of pain throughout her body,including her back and knees.her doctor prescribed some medication and placed her off work for a few days.lazan had strained or injured her back on previous occasions,including two earlier car accidents.in regards to her recent back injuries,the initial of her lumbar spine indicated moderate to severe degeneration of her and disks and tiny subligamentous protrusions at the and disks.according to the medical examiner,lazan condition was permanent and stationary and she was restricted from heavy lifting,repetitive bending,and prolonged standing and sitting.
lazan filed an application for disability retirement in.the county denied her application,finding that she was not disabled.lazan initially appealed the county ruling.in april of,lazan notified the county that she was withdrawing her appeal and requesting that the county reinstate her at the same position and salary.
after some additional correspondence,the county informed lazan that she was to report to duty at the jurupa valley station on may.lazan contacted her assigned supervisors and informed them of her work restrictions.one of her supervisors replied that the station could not accommodate a light duty position.when lazan reported for work,she gave her supervisors a memorandum detailing her diagnosis,work restrictions,and current medications.captain pete lobahn handwrote on lazan memorandum,no permanent,modified duty light duty positions exist at the jurupa valley station.we are unable to accomodate sic dep.lazan return to work in such a position.after an conversation,captain lobahn told lazan to go home.
about two months later,on july,the county sent lazan a letter stating that it had not refused to reinstate her to active duty.the county stated that,according to lazan initial medical examination,she was capable of performing her job duties as a deputy sheriff.the county stated that it had a position available for her.the county subsequently offered plaintiff a temporary clerical position in the human resources department.
meanwhile,in a letter dated on august,the county notified lazan of her potential eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits.on march,the country sent lazan another letter concerning her eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits.in the letter,the county stated that lazan eligibility was based on the determination that lazan medical condition prevented her from returning to her regular job duties.in the same letter,the county also informed lazan that it did not have a job available within her work restrictions.
after receiving these letters,lazan demanded that the county file an application for disability retirement on her behalf under government code section.the county responded by explaining that the notice was required under labor code section and requested by lazan worker compensation attorneys.according to the county,the notice did not represent a change in its position that lazan was able to perform the duties of a deputy sheriff.lazan unsuccessfully reasserted her demand under section.
on june,lazan filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate and damages.after considering the evidence,the trial court found that the county effectively separated lazan by failing to reinstate her employment.specifically,the court found that the alternative clerical position failed to satisfy the requirement that the employer provide a job with the same classification,salary,benefits,and promotional opportunities.the court also found that,despite the county assurances that it had a position available for lazan,the notices sent to her regarding the workers compensation case indicated that the county had determined that lazan disability prevented her from performing her job duties.the court granted lazan petition and issued the writ of mandate.the court entered judgment in accordance with its decision.the court permitted lazan to apply for attorney fees.

disability retirement 
the county contends that the superior court erred in finding that it had a ministerial or mandatory duty under government code section to file an application for disability retirement on lazan behalf.the county argues that,because it believed that lazan was not disabled,it had no duty to file an application.
we reject the county argument.while an employer is not required to file an application if the employee is not disabled,the evidence in the record supports the superior court finding that,in effect,the county had determined that lazan was disabled.
section provides notwithstanding any other provision of law,an employer may not separate because of disability a member otherwise eligible to retire for disability but shall apply for disability retirement of any member believed to be disabled,unless the member waives the right to retire for disability and elects to withdraw contributions or to permit contributions to remain in the fund with rights to service retirement as provided in section.
