plaintiff hazel golden appeals the judgment below,in which the district court granted summary judgment to defendants the city of columbus,ohio,and the city director of public utilities,cheryl roberto collectively the city on golden claims that the city denial of water service to tenants whose predecessors left delinquent water accounts at the premises violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and the equal credit opportunity act,et the ecoa dismissed golden claim that the same constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and dismissed golden motion for class certification.for the following reasons,we reverse the district court as to golden equal protection claim and affirm as to her due process,ecoa,and class certification claims.
background 
prior to,the city of columbus,ohio,permitted both tenants and landlords to contract for water service.although the landlord would be ultimately liable for unpaid water bills,a tenant could establish a water account in her own name by directly contracting with the city.in,officials at the city department of public utilities became concerned that permitting tenants to directly contract for water service had the effect of impeding the collection of unpaid water bills.the city code at the time did not require either the city or the contracting tenant to notify the landlord when an account was created,or when an account became delinquent.landlords complained when they were left to settle accounts they never knew were delinquent after the nonpaying tenants had vacated.these complaints caused further delays in payment.city utilities officials concluded that the city could better insure efficient payment of water bills if it alerted landlords to delinquencies as they occurred.
utilities officials also lamented the fact that the city code did not authorize the city to deny service at premises encumbered by delinquent accounts.if a tenant vacated an apartment,leaving a delinquent account,the code nevertheless permitted a new tenant to move in and establish a new water account,even if the landlord had not yet satisfied the delinquency.officials concluded that this frustrated bill collection by depriving the city of its most effective bill collection tool.with these problems in mind,the columbus city council amended the code in.as amended,the pertinent sections now read 
the city will directly bill a tenant for water and sewer service if the property owner,or authorized agent of the property owner,along with the tenant,sign a written agreement authorizing direct billing of the tenant.once a written agreement is signed,the city will simultaneously mail,to both the owner and the tenant,copies of any bills and notices concerning delinquent water and sewer charges 
direct billing of a tenant shall be in no way construed as to relieve the owner of the real estate premises of liability for water and sewer service charges.no direct billing of a tenant will be allowed where all delinquent water and sewer charges are not paid in full up until the date the direct billing agreement is accepted by the c ity,or where water or sewer service has been terminated for real estate premises.
columbus city code d,e the policy or city policy.
plaintiff hazel golden moved into a residence at hamilton avenue in columbus in either october or december of the lease between golden and her landlord,david matthews,states that the tenant is responsible for the payment of all utilities.however,according to golden,her rent included water service while she was to pay separately for gas and electricity.at the time golden began renting from matthews,he was party to a direct billing agreement with the prior tenant,sarah dean,which dean and matthews had entered into pursuant to the city policy.
starting in late december,the city began sending bills and notices to hamilton avenue addressed to sarah e dean.on december,the city sent a notice of delinquency for service provided to sarah dean between august,and november.this was followed on february,by a water notice on february,by a bill on february,by another bill and on march,by termination of water service to the residence.service recommenced on march,at the request of the city code enforcement department.golden alleges that she contacted code enforcement after first contacting the city,which explained to her that under the policy,water service would not be restored until the account was paid.this pattern repeated itself during march and early april,with the city again terminating water service on april,and recommencing it the next day at the request of code enforcement.the city terminated service for a third time on april.golden maintains that the termination permanently deprived her of water service while the city maintains that it recommenced service on may,without interruption until october when golden moved out.
each of the mailings sent to golden residence during the period december through may arrived in an enveloped marked this is your water bill.see at.each notice of delinquency and notice explains that customers have a right to request a hearing to contest the termination of service but this information is printed on the notice itself,not on the envelopes.the city water customer service coordinator,susan young,stated in an affidavit that on february,the city sent a bill or a notice addressed to water customer.at.the city does not dispute that all other bills and notices were addressed to sarah e dean.
matthews and golden signed a direct billing agreement on march.golden maintains that she sent the agreement to the city but received no response.at golden depo.in any event,matthews apparently did not pay the balance dean would have been necessary to make golden eligible for direct billing under the the record reflects that bills and notices sent after march,were still addressed to dean.see at.finally,golden admits that the city left a notice of on her door contemporaneous with terminating service but alleges that the notice did not inform her of a right to contest the termination of service.
procedural history 
on july,golden and an earlier plaintiff,nikki mara,filed a complaint in district court.the complaint,brought under,alleged that the city practice of terminating tenants water service without notice and the possibility of a hearing amounted to a denial of tenants fourteenth amendment right to procedural due process.the complaint further alleged that the city policy,which denies water service to premises encumbered by delinquent accounts,violated tenants rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and under the equal credit opportunity act ecoa,et.the complaint also alleged that the city termination of plaintiffs water service constituted a breach of the city common law duty to serve golden does not appeal the district court dismissal of this claim.the relief sought in plaintiffs complaint included a declaratory judgment and damages.the original plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification,the denial of which golden appeals.additionally,golden appeals the grant of summary judgment to the city on her procedural due process and ecoa claims and the dismissal of her equal protection claim.

merits of the due process claim 
the text of the fourteenth amendment due process clause makes clear that the state need not afford due process every time it takes an action that impacts negatively on citizens lives.the amendment makes a narrower guarantee no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.golden contends that the city denied her due process because her expectation of continued water service is property within the meaning of the due process clause alternatively,she asserts that water is a basic necessity of life and all necessities of life are property.brief of appellant at.the district court rejected both theories the court found that golden did not enjoy a contractual relationship with the city to support a claim of entitlement nor could she point to a statute that created such an entitlement.at.finally,the court dismissed golden basic necessity for life rationale,concluding that whether water is a basic necessity for life is irrelevant to the question of whether water service is a property interest under the fourteenth amendment.id.at.
in the absence of a claim that governmental action impinged on the other interests it and is well established that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment regulates only those actions of government that work a deprivation of interests enjoying the stature of property within the meaning of the due process clause.memphis light,gas water div.craft,d see also bd.of regents roth,d.but while the constitution does unequivocally protect property,nowhere does it define the term.to resolve this question,as the supreme court held in the seminal case of board of regents roth,the courts are to turn elsewhere property interests are not created by the constitution.rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.roth,at.thus for golden to have a constitutionally recognized property interest in the benefit of water service,she must have more than an abstract need or desire for it,more than a unilateral expectation of it.she must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.the supreme court has identified two bases for such legitimate claims of entitlement state statutes and contracts,express or implied,between the complaining citizen and the state or one of its agencies.id.at.see also perry sinderman,d recognizing an express or implied contract as sufficient to support a legitimate claim of entitlement goldberg kelly,d recognizing a state welfare code as supporting a legitimate claim of entitlement.
golden concedes that she is not a customer and therefore does not enjoy a contractual relationship with the city for the provision of water services.brief of appellant at.instead she relies on the supreme court decision in memphis light,gas water div.craft,d,for the proposition that all inhabitants of a city,even those who are not customers of the public utility provider,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to provision of utility service.brief of appellant at.this interpretation of craft is off the mark.in craft,the court considered utility customers procedural due process claim against the city of memphis for terminating the customers service without affording them an opportunity to contest charges about which there was a bona fide dispute.craft,at.the court found in favor of the complaining customers,because i n defining a public utility privilege to terminate for nonpayment of proper charges,tennessee decisional law draws a line between utility bills that are the subject of a bona fide dispute and those that are not.id.at.a thorough review of tennessee case law,see id.at,revealed that the state only permitted termination of service because of of undisputed charges and that a n aggrieved customer may be able to enjoin a wrongful threat to terminate,or to bring a subsequent action for damages or a refund.id.at.the availability of such remedies to utility customers who dispute charges in good faith is evidence of the state recognition of a protected interest.id.thus craft is plainly limited to utility customers moreover,as roth requires,the decision is completely determined by state law.see generally see also myers city of alcoa,cir.recognizing that the holding in craft depended entirely on tennessee law,cert.denied,d.
golden reliance on a decision of this court,mansfield apartment owners ass city of mansfield,cir,is similarly misplaced.in mansfield,this court cited craft for the point that i t is well settled that the expectation of utility services rises to the level of a legitimate claim of entitlement encompassed in the category of property interests protected by the due process clause.id.at citing craft,at.but as the district court below observed,the complainants in mansfield were property owners who had accounts with the city of mansfield utility department it was appropriate,therefore,for the mansfield court to apply craft.without evidence of a contractual relationship between golden and the city,or of a statutory entitlement to water service,it is not appropriate to do so here.but golden presents no such evidence,which,at least as to the existence of a contract,is not surprising.the city policy,established by the amendment to the code,effectively barred golden from establishing a contract with the city until matthews paid the balance left unpaid by dean.indeed,it is abundantly clear that matthews is to blame for golden predicament and ought to have been held to account under ohio law if golden representation of the lease terms is true,matthews reneged on his promise to pay for water out of her rent.further,it is undisputed that the city code makes matthews liable for delinquent accounts at premises he owns.see columbus city code e.however,a landlord failure to uphold his end of a bargain,even coupled with his failure to comply with a city code provision regarding the payment of water bills,does not constitute a violation of the due process clause by the city.
as to the second possible foundation for a property interest cognizable under the fourteenth statutory or common cites to no ohio statutes or case law in support of her argument that she has a legitimate claim of entitlement to water service.we observe infra that other circuits have held certain provisions common to statutes to be sufficient for this purpose.this circuit has not yet considered such an argument.we have applied craft in a case involving the due process claims of property owners who were water customers.see mansfield,at holding that customers expectation of continued utility service constituted a protected property interest.and,in an unpublished opinion one year before mansfield,we were similarly faithful to craft,rejecting a homeowner claim that ohio law guaranteed water services to its residents.cadle city of newton falls,wl,cir unpublished opinion.but neither mansfield nor cadle offers guidance on whether a tenant who is precluded from directly contracting for water service and from obtaining water service at all,due to nonpayment by both the prior tenant and the landlord,may state a claim for deprivation of a property interest without due process of law.
in two cases,the eleventh circuit has held that tenants may state such a claim under provisions of florida law.see james city of petersburg,cir en banc finding a protectable property interest based on florida law to the effect that a landlord could not terminate a tenant utility service but finding that because neither tenant nor landlord had established a contract with the utility,which either were allowed to do,the interest did not attach dimassimo city of clearwater,cir finding a property interest because it is clear that florida landlord and tenant act would not sanction the withdrawal of water services from tenants by their landlords because such action would constitute either the failure to provide necessary facilities for sustaining life or the constructive eviction of tenants contrary to statutory directives for such action.the ninth circuit has issued a similar ruling pursuant to provisions of oregon law.see turpen city of corvallis,cir,cert.denied,d.these circuits have taken the novel approach of recognizing a property interest in a tenant bring an action to enjoin her landlord from constructively evicting her by terminating water service or declining to pay for it.dimassimo,at turpen,at.depriving tenants of this important remedial right by failing to give proper notice before water service terminates,the courts reasoned,is a due process violation.dimassimo,at turpen,at.
we express no opinion as to whether these precedents weigh in golden favor because golden does not rely upon any provisions of ohio law in this appeal,nor did she do so in the district court.despite the clear command of the supreme court cases regarding what constitutes a cognizable property interest for fourteenth amendment purposes,golden rests her case on the bare assertion that because water is an absolute necessity of life,the city termination of her service was unconstitutional.as much as we may agree with golden premise as a policy matter,the law precludes us from adopting her conclusion.as support for the rationale,golden relies on the case of koger guarino,in which the district court flatly stated,without support,that water service is an entitlement to which the requirements of due process attach.id.at.koger appears to be the only reported federal case standing for such a proposition.although golden invokes davis weir,cir for the same point,the city in that case conceded that due process demands notice to the actual user of water.id.at.in davis,therefore,the fifth circuit did not consider whether the mere use of water service,without more,constitutes a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued service for purposes of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.in any event,it is clear that the plaintiff in koger contested the termination of his water service on substantive,rather than procedural,due process grounds.see koger.at.moreover,the third circuit rejected koger substantive due process analysis in ransom marrazzo,cir,concluding that a municipality denial of water service,if it implicates any federal right,implicates only the procedural protections of the fourteenth amendment,not its substantive guarantees see ransom,at.
in conclusion,we return to the supreme court command in roth property interests are not created by the constitution.rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understanding that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.roth,at.while there may be relevant rules or understandings under ohio law,see discussion supra,golden does not point us to any.because she bears the burden of doing so,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the city on this claim 
ii.equal protection 
standard of review 
we review the dismissal of a claim under fed.civ.b de novo,gao jenifer,cir.a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a test of the plaintiff cause of action as stated in the complaint,not a challenge to the plaintiff factual allegations.id.thus this court must assume that all allegations are true and dismiss the claim only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations,that the legal protections invoked do not provide relief for the conduct alleged.sistrunk city of strongsville,cir quoting hishon king spalding,d see also scheuer rhodes,d conley gibson,d.in addition,while liberal,this standard of review does require more than the bare assertion of legal conclusions.columbia natural resources,tatum,cir citing allard weitzman in re delorean motor,cir.in practice,a complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.allard,at quoting scheid fanny farmer candy shops,cir see also ana leon federal reserve bank,cir.per curiam holding that the statement of mere legal conclusions is not entitled to liberal rule b review,cert.denied,d.
merits of the equal protection claim 
golden complaint asserts an equal protection claim in rather general terms defendants violated plaintiffs right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment at compl.the pertinent factual allegations are similarly general defendants have established policies and customs patterns and practices of requiring plaintiffs and other consumers of and applicants for water service to comply with conditions different from similarly situated customers in order to restore water service,including but not limited to refusing to provide water service accounts to applicants who are not landowners.id.compl.the city contends that the district court properly dismissed the claim because the only dissimilar treatment it can be read to allege is dissimilar treatment as between landlords and tenants.because landlords and tenants are not similarly situated,the city argument runs,golden complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.it is true that the district court dismissed golden complaint in part on this basis.however,the remainder of the district court analysis belies the city contention that the complaint only alleges dissimilar treatment as between tenants and landlords.
the district court opinion demonstrates that it dismissed golden claim on the assumption that the complaint alleged two forms of,as between tenants and landlords and,second,as between those tenants whose circumstances permitted them to enter direct billing agreements and those whose circumstances did not.see at.we think the district court reading of the complaint was reasonable.indeed,the parties apparently read the complaint in the same broad fashion both parties briefed the tenant versus tenant classification as well as the tenant versus landlord classification in their motions before the district court.see at defendant motion for partial dismissal,plaintiff motion in response.in the end,the district court considered,and dismissed,golden equal protection claim under both theories.see id.at.we note that in the context of determining whether a plaintiff has adequately pleaded the capacity in which she seeks to hold the defendant liable,we employ a course of proceedings test such that our interpretation of the complaint will be informed by the manner in which the parties and the district court interpreted it.moore city of harriman,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.we decline,therefore,to accept the city representation that golden alleges dissimilar treatment as between two classes of tenants for the first time on appeal,see brief of appellee at,for this would be obviously inconsistent with the course of the proceedings so far.we read the complaint as alleging that the city treated two classes of tenants dissimilarly and two classes of residents,tenants and landlords,dissimilarly.we hold that,as to the former theory,golden states a claim upon which relief can be granted under our case law.
several circuits,including ours,have considered whether the equal protection clause permits a municipality to deny water service to a residence where the prior inhabitant failed to pay water bills.see city of seattle,cir ransom marrazzo,cir dimassimo city of clearwater,cir sterling vill.of maywood,cir,cert.denied,d craft memphis light,gas water,cir,aff on other grounds,d davis weir,cir.because there is no fundamental right to water service,see discussion supra part i see also mansfield apartment owners ass city of mansfield,cir,we apply rational basis scrutiny to the city water policy,at dimassimo,at.
golden alleges that the city policy irrationally treats one group of tenants those whose landlords owe the city for water service differently from another group of tenants those whose landlords do not brief of appellant at.according to golden,the city classification scheme has a determinative effect on a tenant chances of securing water service.one class established by the city policy is comprised of tenants who move into properties where there is no unpaid balance on the water account these tenants will receive water service.the other class is comprised of tenants whose properties are encumbered by the water debts of the prior tenant these tenants will be deprived of water service until they or their landlords,who are liable for the debt,pay the amount owed.although it is true that no tenant in the city may establish a direct billing agreement with the city without first securing her landlord consent,see columbus city code d,golden maintains that the city policy nevertheless divides tenants in an irrational manner because it denies water service only to those tenants whose predecessors or landlords failed to pay the water bills.we agree.
this court held nearly thirty years ago that a water service policy in memphis,similar to the policy at issue here,violated water applicants equal protection rights by irrationally dividing applicants into those who were permitted to contract for water and those who were not.craft memphis light,gas water,cir,aff on other grounds,d.in craft,the dividing line between applicants permitted to contract for service and applicants not permitted to contract was whether a water applicant predecessor owed an unpaid balance at the property if so,the applicant could not establish an account until the debt was paid.craft,at.in craft,this court relied on the fifth circuit case of davis weir,cir,which invalidated an analogous atlanta policy.davis,at.the davis court concluded that the water works has divided those who apply for its services into two categories applicants whose contemplated service address is encumbered with a debt for which they are not liable and applicants whose residence lacks the stigma of such charges.id.at.the court rejected atlanta defense that its policy facilitated the collection of unpaid bills at apartment buildings,holding that t he city has no valid governmental interest in securing revenue from innocent applicants who are forced to honor the obligations of another or face constructive eviction from their homes for lack of an essential to.id.at.the court acknowledged that atlanta policy facilitated debt collection but concluded that a debt collection scheme that divorces itself entirely from the reality of legal accountability for the debt involved,is devoid of logical relation to the collection of unpaid water bills from the defaulting debtor.id.at.
the davis court reasoning remains intact in the fifth circuit,was adopted by this circuit in craft,and has been adopted by the ninth and seventh circuits.see city of seattle,cir sterling vill.of maywood,cir.at least one circuit,the third,has rejected davis,concluding that the classification of service eligibility according to the presence or absence of encumbrances on the property survives rational relationship scrutiny because while it may be an irrational means of collecting debt from the debtor,it is a rational way of accomplishing the more general goal of collecting debts,period.ransom marrazzo,cir.having the benefit of both the third and fifth circuits approaches to consult,the ninth circuit reject ed the ransom court technical narrowing of the legislative purpose and agree d with the fifth circuit opinion in davis,at.
even if we preferred the third circuit approach to the question,we are bound by craft,as that case is still good law in this circuit.nevertheless,the city asserts that its policy is materially distinguishable from those at issue in craft,davis,and.the city contends that the only classification its policy makes is between property owners and tenants.brief of appellee at.according to the city,all tenants are treated equally since all tenants must obtain their landlords consent before establishing a direct billing agreement.the city further argues that its policy does not require tenants to pay bills for which they are not liable instead,the policy imposes financial liability on landlords only.these points,while true,are irrelevant.the critical issue is whether terminating a tenant water service is a rational means of collecting the landlord water service debt.we hold that it is not.
we do not see a meaningful distinction between the policy before us and those held unconstitutional in craft,davis,sterling,and.moreover,to the extent there are distinctions,we see no reason to depart in this case from the fifth circuit rationale in rationale which we adopted as our own in craft in practical terms,as golden own experience shows,the city policy works as follows.a tenant moves into an apartment water is available at the time the tenant moves in,so there is no reason for the tenant to question its future availability.however,at some point later the city terminates water service to the residence for the sole reason that the landlord owes the city for the prior tenant water usage.when the new tenant inquires with the city,she learns that water service will recommence only once her landlord has satisfied the debt that he alone owes.this is a debt collection scheme that divorces itself entirely from the reality of legal accountability for the debt involved,davis,at,because the person directly penalized by the scheme is not the debtor but an innocent third party with whom the debtor contracted.
the city submits that because the policy does not explicitly require tenants to pay their predecessors debts,but instead imposes that obligation on landlords,it is constitutional.whether the city goal is that it be repaid by the person who owes the debt or by the tenant who is directly affected by its collection scheme is immaterial for constitutional purposes.neither goal gives the city license to pursue payment by refusing water service to an unrelated,unobligated third party,whether that third party be the new tenant or any other stranger to the prior service agreement,at.we conclude,as the ninth circuit did in,that p ursuing payment from the prior tenant and the landlord would be rationally related to the city goal refusing service to an unobligated new tenant is not.id.to be sure,the city has at its disposal various means to recover from the landlord or the prior tenant without jeopardizing the new tenant water service.in fact,after the events that prompted golden to bring this action,the city implemented one obvious approach.under a rule adopted by the director of public utilities,tenants facing termination of water,we may assume,seeking to reinstate service already pay their rent into an escrow account maintained by the municipal court for franklin county.we express no opinion as to whether the particulars of this new rule pass constitutional muster we refer to it only to illustrate that cities in this circuit are not without means to recover water service debts merely because the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment bars them from terminating the water service of a tenant whose landlord owes water bills.
iii.equal credit opportunity act 
standard of review 
the district court granted summary judgment to the city on golden ecoa claim.we therefore review the district court judgment on this point de novo,cockrel shelby county sch,cir.in addition,we view the relevant facts in the light most favorable to golden.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
merits of the ecoa claim 
golden asserts that the policy,which authorizes direct billing of a tenant only if the landlord agrees in writing and any existing balance on the account is immediately paid,violates the ecoa,a.golden theory of liability is that the policy has the effect of rejecting a higher proportion of female and minority applicants for water service than other applicants.see brief of appellant at.this theory is based on the findings of golden expert witness to the effect that women and minorities are in the population of homeowners in the city.according to golden,because the policy permits only homeowners to directly contract for water service,the policy has a disparate impact on anyone who is among homeowners.the district court assessed the statistical evidence furnished by the expert in support of golden disparate impact claim and concluded that this evidence did not make the type of comparison necessary to state such a claim.finding that golden had failed to make out a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination,the court granted summary judgment to the city.we
