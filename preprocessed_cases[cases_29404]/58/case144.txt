john giebeler has aids.because he has aids,he is disabled and can no longer work,although he had worked and earned an adequate living until he became ill.once he was no longer earning a salary,his former apartment became too expensive for him.in addition,he needed assistance with daily matters because of his illness and so wanted to live closer to his mother.
giebeler lack of an income stream meant that he could not meet the minimum financial qualifications of the apartment complex where he sought an apartment.giebeler mother,however,did meet those standards,and offered to rent the apartment so that her son could live in it.the owners of the apartment complex refused to rent either to giebeler or to his mother,citing a management company policy against cosigners.
the question in this case is whether the fair housing amendments act fhaa,et,required the apartment owners reasonably to accommodate giebeler disability by assessing individually the risk of nonpayment created by his specific proposed financial arrangement,rather than inflexibly applying a rental policy that forbids cosigners.concluding that the statute does so require,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
john giebeler had worked as a psychiatric technician for approximately five years before becoming disabled by aids.at the time giebeler had to leave work because of his disability,he was earning approximately per year.since,giebeler has supported himself through monthly disability benefits under the social security disability insurance ssdi program and housing assistance from the housing opportunities for people with aids program hopwa.
in may,giebeler sought to move from his apartment at the elan at river oaks complex elan to an available unit at the park branham apartments branham,a rental property owned by defendants m b.giebeler wanted to move to the branham unit because the rent,per month,was less expensive than the per month rent at elan,and the branham unit was closer to his mother home.at the time giebeler inquired about the branham unit,he was receiving from ssdi per month,to per month in a hopwa subsidy,and varied amounts of financial support from his mother.he had a record of consistent and prompt payment of rent during his six years of residency at elan,and his credit record contained no negative notations.
branham resident manager jan duffus informed giebeler that he did not qualify for tenancy at branham because he did not meet the minimum income requirements.duffus stated that branham required prospective tenants to have a minimum gross monthly income equaling three times the monthly rent.for the apartment giebeler wished to rent,the minimum required income was per month,an amount less than giebeler had earned before he became ill.
after he was informed of his ineligibility,giebeler asked his mother,anne giebeler,to assist him in renting the apartment.anne giebeler went to the branham office the next day for the purpose of renting an apartment that would be occupied by her son.
like her son,anne giebeler had a credit record with no negative entries.anne giebeler had owned the same home for years and had completely paid off her mortgage.the home was located less than a mile from branham.anne giebeler income was per month.
both john giebeler and anne giebeler filled out application forms for the branham apartment,indicating that john giebeler would be the only resident.on his rental application,giebeler listed his current gross income as and his present occupation as disabled.the branham property manager rejected the applications on the basis that m b considered anne giebeler a cosigner and has a policy against allowing on lease agreements.
following the denial of his rental application,giebeler contacted aids legal services for assistance.attorney john doherty wrote a letter to the branham property manager on giebeler behalf,stating that giebeler was disabled and that,under f b of the fhaa,unlawful discrimination against disabled persons in housing includes a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.doherty letter requested a reasonable accommodation for giebeler,suggesting use of a cosigner or other alternative arrangements to meet the financial requirements for tenancy.
branham attorney responded to doherty letter by confirming the rejection of giebeler rental application and denying that federal law required them to grant giebeler request for reasonable accommodation.branham management never checked giebeler references or his rental or credit history nor inquired into anne giebeler financial qualifications or connections to the area.nor did the branham management ever ask giebeler about any additional sources of income or discuss with him any alternatives to the minimum income requirement.
in february,giebeler filed an action under the federal fhaa,the california fair employment and housing act feha,the california business and professions code,the california civil code section,and common law negligence.giebeler fhaa claim advanced three theories of discrimination disparate impact,intentional discrimination,and failure to reasonably accommodate giebeler disability through refusal to waive the policy.the district court held that giebeler had made out a prima facie case of intentional discrimination under the fhaa,violation of the california business and professions code,and violation of the feha.the court granted summary judgment for m b,however,on giebeler state law negligence claim and his fhaa disparate impact and reasonable accommodation claims.in ruling on giebeler reasonable accommodation claim,the district court held that an accommodation which remedies the economic status of a disabled person is not an accommodation as contemplated by the fha.only the grant of summary judgment for m b on giebeler reasonable accommodation claim is before us on appeal 
discussion 
the fhaa provides that it is unlawful to discriminate against disabled persons 
in the sale or rental,or to otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of 
a that buyer or renter,
b a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold,rented,or made available or 
c any person associated with that buyer or renter.
the fhaa definition of prohibited discrimination encompasses a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.f b.thus,the fhaa imposes an affirmative duty upon landlords reasonably to accommodate the needs of handicapped persons,united states california mobile home park mgmt,cir mobile home i,not only with regard to the physical accommodations,see f a c,but also with regard to the administrative policies governing rentals.
to make out a claim of discrimination based on failure to reasonably accommodate,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he suffers from a handicap as defined by the fhaa defendants knew or reasonably should have known of the plaintiff handicap accommodation of the handicap may be necessary to afford plaintiff an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling and defendants refused to make such accommodation.united states california mobile home park mgmt,cir mobile home ii.
giebeler disability 
the defendants do not dispute that giebeler is disabled for the purposes of the fhaa and that they knew of his disability,nor do they deny that they refused to make the accommodation giebeler requested.the defendants contend,rather,that the accommodation giebeler requested is not one the fhaa requires them to accord.for the purposes of our analysis of the scope of the accommodation to which giebeler may have been entitled,however,it is important to understand precisely why giebeler disability entitled him to the protections of the fhaa.
the fhaa defines handicap as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person major life activities.h.infection with hiv,the virus that causes aids,qualifies as a physical or mental impairment for the purposes of the fhaa.a bragdon abbott,d hiv infection is a disability under the ada because it substantially limits major life activities see also id.at.ginsburg,concurring human immuno deficiency virus hiv infection has been regarded as a disease limiting life itself.the disease inevitably pervades life choices education,employment,family and financial undertakings.internal citations omitted.fhaa regulations further define major life activities to include functions such as caring for one self,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.b emphasis added.
giebeler impairments,his ability to work giebeler had to leave his job as a psychiatric technician because of his illness and can no longer work.consequently,his income stream was limited to whatever he received in disability and howpa payments,supplemented by financial assistance from his mother.because of his reduced income,giebeler did not meet the minimum income defendants policies require of branham tenants.if giebeler were still able to work in the position he held before becoming ill,he would have met branham financial requirements.a direct causal link therefore existed between giebeler impairment,his inability to work,and his inability to comply with defendants minimum income requirement relying solely on his individual income.
given these undisputed facts,we must determine whether relaxation of branham policy to allow giebeler to live in an apartment rented for him by his mother constituted a reasonable accommodation required by the fhaa.
accommodation under the fhaa 
the central issue in dispute in this case is whether bending a landlord usual means of testing a prospective tenant likely ability to pay the rent over the course of the lease is an accommodation at all within the meaning of the fhaa,let alone a reasonable one.permitting giebeler to live in an apartment rented for him by his qualified mother would have adjusted for his inability,because of his disability,to earn his own income,while providing m b with substantial assurance that the full a discounted be paid monthly.branham maintains,however,that an adjustment of this kind is not the type of alteration in housing policy that congress had in mind in enacting the fhaa.noting that branham rule adversely affects many prospective tenants who can not meet the financial specifications without relying on the income or assets of a relative or friend,m b would have us hold that altering that rule to aid a disabled potential tenant does not come within the fhaa concept of accommodation because it would prefer disabled over nondisabled impecunious individuals accommodate giebeler poverty rather than his disability and increase m b financial exposure,with potential cost to the landlord should its fears that it could not collect the rent prove true.we conclude that the fhaa accommodation requirement does reach adjustments in the means of proving financial responsibility,and that each of branham arguments to the contrary runs afoul of binding case law elucidating the accommodation concept in the fhaa and related statutes.
before explaining our reasoning on the reach of the accommodation concept,we note that only reasonable accommodations are required by the fhaa.f b.there is some tendency in the case law to truncate the accommodation concept so as to preclude requirements that unreasonably burden housing providers,rather than conducting the analysis mandated by the statute.so it is important to bear in mind that a conclusion that a type of alteration to a policy is an accommodation within the meaning of the statute is only the first step in a statutory analysis.
the plain language of the fhaa provides scant guidance concerning the reach of the accommodation requirement.see f b see also f c f listing exemptions to fhaa coverage and limitations on the duty to accommodate.similarly,the fhaa legislative history and regulations provide us with little specific guidance as to the scope and limitations of accommodation under the fhaa.
the house committee report on the fhaa does state,however,that the interpretations of reasonable accommodation in rehabilitation act ra regulations and case law should be applied to the fhaa reasonable accommodation provision 
new subsection f b makes it illegal to refuse to make reasonable accommodation in rules,policies,practices,or services if necessary to permit a person with handicaps equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.the concept of reasonable accommodation has a long history in regulations and case law dealing with discrimination on the basis of handicap.footnote citing,inter alia.a discriminatory rule,policy,practice,or service is not defensible simply because that is the manner in which such rule or practice has traditionally been constituted.this section would require that changes be made to such traditional rules or practices if necessary to permit a person with handicaps an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling,at,reprinted in.
see also id.at in adopting this amendment,the committee drew on case law developed under section of the rehabilitation act of.
consistent with the report recommendation,we have applied ra regulations and case law when interpreting the fhaa reasonable accommodation provisions.see,mobile home i,at city of edmonds.state council,cir reasonable accommodation is borrowed from the caselaw interpreting the rehabilitation act of,aff city of edmonds oxford house,d.also,since the enactment of the americans with disabilities act ada,et,we have relied on ada cases in applying the ra,because,as a general matter,there is no significant difference in the analysis or rights and obligations created by the two acts.vinson thomas,cir.see also zukle regents of the of california,cir discussing applicability of ra interpretations to the ada.
the concept that policies and practices must be modified in some instances to accommodate the needs of the disabled is common to all three statutory schemes.see regulation see also vinson,at citing b,an ada regulation zukle,at.we therefore look to both ra and ada interpretations of accommodation of disabled individuals as indicative of the scope of accommodation under the fhaa.in doing so,we interpret the fhaa accommodation provisions with the specific goals of the fhaa in mind to protect the right of handicapped persons to live in the residence of their choice in the community,and to end the unnecessary exclusion of persons with handicaps from the american mainstream.city of edmonds,at internal quotations omitted.
the supreme court most extensive discussion of the overall scope of the accommodation concept appears in a recent ada case,airways barnett,d.barnett guides our analysis concerning the reach of the accommodation obligation under the fhaa,in two respects first,barnett holds that an accommodation may indeed result in a preference for disabled individuals over otherwise similarly situated nondisabled individuals.and second,barnett indicates that accommodations may adjust for the practical impact of a disability,not only for the immediate manifestations of the physical or mental impairment giving rise to the disability.
in barnett,an airline cargo handler requested,as accommodation of his back injuries,an exception to the company seniority system so that he could transfer to a less physically demanding position.id.at.the airline refused to authorize a departure from its seniority rules,contending that because the ada ensures equal treatment of persons with disabilities,any sort of preferential exception to a policy was outside the scope of the reasonable accommodations mandated by the statute.id.at.
rejecting the airline narrow interpretation of reasonable accommodation,barnett held that the ada requires reasonable accommodations necessary to meet the needs of a disabled person,so that the disabled person may enjoy the same workplace opportunities enjoyed by nondisabled persons.id.at.such reasonable accommodation in the service of equal opportunity may require preferential treatment of the disabled 
p references will sometimes prove necessary to achieve the americans with disabilities act basic equal opportunity goal.the act requires preferences in the form of reasonable accommodations that are needed for those with disabilities to obtain the same workplace opportunities that those without disabilities enjoy.by definition any special accommodation requires the employer to treat an employee with a disability differently,preferentially.and the fact that the difference in treatment violates an employer rule can not by itself place the accommodation beyond the act potential reach.
were that not so,the reasonable accommodation provision could not accomplish its intended objective many employers will have neutral rules governing the kinds of actions most needed to reasonably accommodate a worker with a disability.
the objection that branham need not permit giebeler to live in an apartment rented by his mother because other prospective tenants unable to meet the financial qualifications on their own also can not rent apartments therefore runs afoul of barnett.just as barnett was not disqualified from an adjustment to his seniority rank simply because other,nondisabled employees desired the position he sought but were barred from obtaining it by the seniority policy,so giebeler was not disqualified from an adjustment in branham financial cosigner standard simply because there were other prospective tenants similarly for reasons other than earn enough money to meet the rental company credit standards.
additionally,barnett indicates,inferentially if not expressly,that a required accommodation need not address barriers that would not be barriers but for the individual disability.barnett,at.scalia,dissenting.justice scalia maintained vigorously in his dissent in barnett that the ada eliminates workplace barriers only if a disability prevents an employee from overcoming them and does not require adjustment of rules and practices that bear no more heavily upon the disabled employee than upon though an exemption from such a rule or practice might in a sense make up for the employee disability.id.changes in seniority rules,maintained justice scalia,can not be accommodations on this understanding of the accommodation concept,as a seniority system burdens the disabled and nondisabled alike,and so is not a obstacle.id.
the majority in barnett did not accept this reasoning.id.at rejecting the position taken by justice scalia to the contrary of the opinion holding regarding preferential treatment.instead,the opinion held that in some having to do with the nature of the employer commitment to its seniority system,not with the obstacles faced by a particular disabled of a seniority system might be a required accommodation.id.at.barnett therefore recognized that the obligation to accommodate a disability can include the obligation to alter policies that can be barriers to nondisabled persons as well.
it is worth noting that giebeler inability to pay the rent without drawing on his mother financial resources was not,in justice scalia words,the result of obstacles that have nothing to do with the disability.id.at.although barnett inability to meet the seniority requirement for the position he wanted was simply the result of his tenure in his job,not of his disability,the reason giebeler could not pay the rent from his own income was that his disability prevented him from working and earning a monthly paycheck as he used to.so,applying justice scalia understanding of the accommodation concept,giebeler request that he be permitted to assure his prospective landlord of payment through his mother financial resources rather than his own would qualify as an accommodation.yet,under barnett,even if one disregards the fact that giebeler had formerly held a qualifying job and was forced to leave it because of his disability,the accommodation he seeks might still qualify as an accommodation under the fhaa,as long as adjusting branham method of judging financial responsibility would aid him in obtaining an apartment he could otherwise not inhabit because of his disability 
our cases involving fhaa challenges to generally applicable zoning policies confirm that reasonable accommodations can function to adjust for special needs that flow from the inability of disabled residents to meet otherwise applicable financial requirements.in turning point,caldwell,cir,for example,we held that the city of caldwell had unlawfully refused to accommodate disabled residents of turning point,a nonprofit homeless shelter,by refusing to waive annual review of the special use permit that allowed the shelter to house more than the maximum number of persons dictated by the area zoning policy.
in so holding,we observed that of the shelter residents had serious mental or physical disabilities that prevent these persons from maintaining employment,obtaining education or securing permanent housing.id.at.the district court had found that the maximum occupancy limit was a severe financial burden on the shelter that would eventually force it to close.id.at.relying on this finding,we reasoned that annual review of the special use process that threatened to discontinue the financially necessary waiver of the maximum occupancy rule in the unjustified and violated the fhaa reasonable accommodation mandate.id.at.
similarly,in city of edmonds washington state.code council,we held that a residence for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts that required six or more residents per house to be financially,to comply with federal requirements for loans,and to provide a supportive atmosphere for the residents,might be entitled to a variance from a zoning ordinance that restricted the number of unrelated persons who could reside in a single home in a residential neighborhood.at.we noted that zoning regulations would not always be immune from fhaa requirements 
courts must ask whether a city zoning satisfied fhaa standards,or whether a city has to alter neutral zoning policies to reasonably accommodate and integrate handicapped persons.the answers will vary depending on the facts of a given case.but these questions must be posed,or the policies the fhaa seeks to enforce will be frustrated.
id.at.thus,in city of edmonds we recognized that even when a neutral policy adverse effect on disabled persons is attributable to financial limitations faced by disabled persons in securing housing,the fhaa may require an exception to the policy as a reasonable accommodation 
there is one additional principle regarding the general nature of the concept of accommodations that is pertinent here as well accommodations need not be free of all possible cost to the landlord although,again,a landlord need not incur a cost or risk of cost that is not reasonable,a major qualification that we discuss later.
mobile home i establishes that financial considerations do not automatically disqualify a requested accommodation 
we find the effort to distinguish accommodations that have a financial cost from other accommodations unconvincing.besides the fact that reasonable accommodations requirement contains no exemption for financial costs to the landlord,footnote omitted the history of the fhaa clearly establishes that congress anticipated that landlords would have to shoulder certain costs involved,so long as they are not unduly burdensome.
id.at.cripe city of san jose,cir stating that the ada requires every type of employer to find ways to bring the disabled into its ranks,even when doing so imposes some costs and burdens arneson sullivan,cir requiring employer to expend a reasonable amount to provide a environment,and,if necessary,to provide the plaintiff with a reader to assist him in his assigned tasks as reasonable accommodations under the rehabilitation act.thus,administrative policies like branham tenant income qualifications do not escape all scrutiny under the fhaa reasonable accommodation mandate simply because they are based on financial considerations or may involve a risk of some financial cost to the landlord 
despite this solid line of supreme court and ninth circuit precedent,the district court and the defendants rely on two cases that hold that however reasonable the requested accommodation,the fhaa does not require landlords or cities to accommodate needs generated by the inability of disabled individuals to generate income by working.see salute stratford greens garden apartments,cir hemisphere building village of richton park,cir.
salute held that accommodations of one personal economic situation are outside the scope of the fhaa reasonable accommodation requirement,apparently even where the disabled individual economic status is the direct result of her disability.see at see also id.at calabresi,dissenting noting that the plaintiffs were poor as a direct result of their handicap and that t hey say that their disabilities prevent them from working,which necessarily makes them poor.the salute majority deemed it fundamental that the law addresses the accommodation of handicaps,not the alleviation of economic disadvantages that may be correlated with having handicaps.ordinarily,the duty to make reasonable accommodations is framed by the nature of the particular handicap.id.at.judge calabresi dissented,reasoning that where the individuals in question are poor because they are disabled,a reasonable adjustment of policies requiring tenants to qualify on the basis of their own income rather than on the basis of other financial resources available to them for paying rent is,like allowing a blind tenant to keep a seeing eye dog despite a rule against pets,an accommodation of a need created by the disability.maintaining that t he fhaa does not elevate the rights of the handicapped poor over the rights of the poor,id.at,the salute majority rejected judge calabresi reasoning.
the seventh circuit in hemisphere also rejected the notion that the fhaa may require accommodation of disability generated financial limitations.hemisphere reasoned that if zoning rules must be waived to make housing more affordable for the disabled,so too must building codes,minimum wage laws,or construction safety regulations that made construction of housing for the disabled more expensive 
the result that we have called absurd is avoided by confining the duty of reasonable accommodation in rules,policies,practices,or services to rules,policies,that hurt handicapped people by reason of their handicap,rather than hurt them solely by virtue of what they have in common with other people such as a limited amount of money to spend on housing.
we reject the reasoning of salute and hemisphere,despite the facial appeal of some of the reasoning of those opinions,for three reasons we find compelling 
first,both salute and hemisphere were decided before barnett,and their reasoning can not be reconciled with the supreme court analysis in that case.barnett,as we have explained,held that accommodation requirements do sometimes require preferring disabled individuals over others who are otherwise similarly situated but are not disabled and are not limited only to lowering barriers created by the disability itself.limiting accommodation to those rules,policies,that hurt handicapped people by reason of their handicap,hemisphere,at,or requiring that accommodations be framed by the nature of the particular handicap,salute,at,because t he fhaa does not elevate the rights of the handicapped poor over the rights of the nonhandicapped poor,id.at,contradicts both principles embraced by barnett 
second,the reasoning of these two opinions captures concerns that are taken into account within the analysis required by barnett and by the fhaa as we understand it.under the fhaa,as under the ra and the ada,only reasonable accommodations that do not cause undue hardship or mandate fundamental changes in a program are required.barnett held that although adjustments in seniority rules could be accommodations within the intendment of the disability statutes,such adjustments are ordinarily not reasonable accommodations,and therefore are required only in unusual circumstances.similarly,it is probable that all or most of the changes in policies that salute and hemisphere march out as inevitably mandated by the fhaa unless the economic circumstances caused by disability are cordoned off entirely from the accommodation requirement would be deemed,on examination,unreasonable ordinarily or in the run of cases,barnett,at,and therefore not required.we expect,for example,that mandating lower rents for disabled individuals would fail the kind of reasonableness inquiry conducted in barnett.but salute and hemisphere held,inconsistently with barnett,that courts should never get to the reasonableness inquiry where economic circumstances related to disability are at stake.now that barnett has been decided,that approach is foreclosed.
finally,the second circuit decision in salute and the seventh circuit decision in hemisphere are in tension with our zoning cases,already discussed,which recognize that governmental entities may be required to bend zoning and land use requirements in recognition of the need of disabled individuals for group living arrangements.see turning point,at city of edmonds,at.disabled individuals,true,may need group homes not only to have somewhere they can afford to live but also to have access to physical therapy,nursing care,and other medical needs.but those resources can be,and are,provided in individual houses or apartments to more prosperous individuals.the need to take advantage of economies of scale to make such resources available to the less is the result of the economic circumstances of the residents.
we conclude that giebeler request that he be permitted to reside in an apartment rented by his financially qualified mother is a request for an accommodation that,under the fhaa,he was entitled to receive if the adjustment both may be necessary to afford him equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling and was reasonable within the meaning of that statute.see f b.it is to those questions that we now turn.
causation and reasonableness 
to prove that an accommodation is necessary,p laintiffs must show that,but for the accommodation,they likely will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing of their choice.smith lee,at.put another way,w ithout a causal link between defendants policy and the plaintiff injury,there can be no obligation on the part of defendants to make a reasonable accommodation.mobile home ii,at.
imposition of burdensome policies,including financial policies,can interfere with disabled persons right to use and enjoyment of their dwellings,thus necessitating accommodation.see shapiro cadman towers,cir holding that a landlord failure to grant a disabled tenant an exception to first served waiting list for tenant parking substantially affected tenant use and enjoyment of her dwelling samuelson realty,finding waiver of a landlord required lease termination fee a necessary reasonable accommodation under the fhaa because i t is clear that generally applicable fees can interfere with the use and enjoyment of housing by the handicapped.while in some cases the plaintiff will not be able to show that alteration of a particular policy may be necessary to her use and enjoyment of the property,see mobile home ii,at,the causation requirement poses little hurdle in a case such as this one,where a landlord policy entirely prevents a tenant from living in a dwelling.see id.at holding that,in zoning cases,causation is not a hurdle in proving necessity of accommodation because t he city policies directly interfere with use and enjoyment because they prevent the housing from being built.
here,the causal link between branham failure to accommodate and giebeler disability is obvious.giebeler was unemployed because of his disability and therefore had insufficient income to qualify for the apartment.once branham refused to allow anne giebeler to rent an apartment for her son to live in,giebeler could not show financial ability to pay the rent and therefore could not live in the housing complex.allowing anne giebeler to rent an apartment on her son behalf,or in some other manner accommodating his inability to prove financial responsibility in the usual way,was necessary to enable giebeler to live in an apartment at branham.
in addition to causation,equal opportunity is a key component of the necessity analysis an accommodation must be possibly necessary to afford the plaintiff equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.see howard city of beavercreek,cir.m b refusal to allow anne giebeler to rent an apartment for her son denies him an opportunity for which he would otherwise be qualified.with anne giebeler as renter,giebeler could satisfy branham minimum income requirement and ensure that branham receives its monthly rent.giebeler is similarly situated to other tenants at branham in terms of the financial resources he can bring to a tenancy at branham.it is his way of demonstrating and deploying these resources that is different so defendants relaxation of their no cosigner policy may be necessary to afford giebeler equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling at branham.
reasonableness 
a burden of proof we have not decided previously whether the plaintiff or the defendant in an fhaa case bears the burden of showing whether a proposed accommodation is reasonable.there is,however,both ra and ada precedent on the question.
under the ra case law,a plaintiff requesting accommodation bears the initial burden of producing evidence that a reasonable accommodation was possible.vinson,at.once evidence of the possibility is produced,the burden shifts to the other party to produce rebuttal evidence that the requested accommodation is not reasonable.id.
in the ada employment context,barnett articulates the applicable burden of proof slightly differently barnett places the burden of showing the reasonableness of an accommodation on the plaintiff.see at.barnett stresses,however,that the plaintiff need only show that an accommodation seems reasonable on its face,ordinarily or in the run of cases.id.at.once the plaintiff has made this showing,the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the accommodation would cause undue hardship in the particular circumstances.id.at.if the plaintiff can not make the initial showing that the requested accommodation is reasonable in the run of cases,he nonetheless remains free to show that special circumstances warrant a finding that the requested accommodation is reasonable on the particular facts.id.at.thus,under barnett,circumstances may make it reasonable for certain defendants to make accommodations even where such accommodations are not reasonable in most cases.
as we have already observed,this court ordinarily applies ra case law in applying the reasonable accommodation provisions of the fhaa,but also generally applies ra and ada case law interchangeably.that interaction leaves us a bit up in the air at this juncture,as barnett may have application to the ra mode of proof and therefore the mode of proof to be applied in fhaa cases.vinson was filed four days after barnett,and,not surprisingly,does not discuss the barnett mode of proving the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation.there is no need in this case,though,to decide whether vinson and barnett state essentially the same allocation of burdens or differ in a way likely to be outcome determinative in some instances either description of the burden allocation leads to the same result in this case giebeler requested accommodation was reasonable.
b merits of the reasonableness analysis ordinarily,an accommodation is reasonable under the fhaa when it imposes no fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or undue financial or administrative burdens.howard,at quoting southeastern community college davis,d see also pga tour,martin,d holding,in an ada reasonable accommodation case,that where a rule is peripheral to the nature of defendants activities,it may be waived in individual cases without working a fundamental alteration.
in this case,giebeler has met his burden of demonstrating that the particular accommodation he an eligible relative to rent an apartment for reasonable on its face,ordinarily or in the run of cases.barnett,at.he has also met his burden,as articulated in vinson,of producing evidence showing that the accommodation was reasonable and possible.vinson,at.
the record reveals that,as one would expect,the purpose of m b minimum income requirement is to ensure that tenants have sufficient income to pay rent consistently and promptly.this interest is,of course,considerable.however,allowing a financially eligible relative to rent an apartment for a disabled individual who,except for his current financial circumstances,is qualified to be a tenant does not unreasonably threaten this interest.
the rental arrangement requested by giebeler would not require branham to accept less rent,would not otherwise alter the essential obligations of tenancy at branham such as appropriate behavior and care of the premises,and would provide a lessee with the proper financial qualifications and credit history.as the official renter of the apartment,anne giebeler would be primarily responsible for the rent,thereby obviating the need for m b to first go to her son to collect rent before pursuing her for unpaid rent.rentals by parents for children are not unusual in most rental markets.see,schanz village apartments.landlord refused to rent to a disabled individual with serious credit problems or allow a nonrelated guarantor,but would have allowed him to live there if a blood relative cosigned the lease boyd lefrak organization,cir apartment complex would have allowed a financially ineligible prospective tenant to rent if he obtained an eligible cosigner.even if m b does not ordinarily permit such rentals at the branham complex,asking a landlord to accept an alternative way of proving financial responsibility acceptable to many other landlords is likely to be reasonable in the run of cases.
indeed,the fhaa recognizes that nondisabled persons may choose to rent apartments for occupancy by disabled persons and protects these arrangements i t shall be unlawful t o discriminate in the sale or rental,or to otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold,rented,or made available.f.thus,the fhaa appears to protect not just disabled people who buy or rent their own residences,but also disabled people who reside in a residence rented by a person,the arrangement giebeler sought in this case.
giebeler made the necessary initial showing that the requested accommodation was reasonable on the particular facts of this case.barnett,at.whether waiver of a no cosigner policy would be reasonable accommodation in the run of cases is a question we do not decide.branham,however,failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that in the particular circumstances of this case the requested accommodation would cause it to suffer undue hardship.id.at.branham also failed to carry its burden as articulated in vinson of rebutting the showing made by giebeler that the requested accommodation was in fact reasonable.vinson,at.
there is no evidence in the record demonstrating that m b is in any way unusual among landlords in its need to insist that the resident alone rather than a relative sign the lease and take responsibility for paying the rent.the particular parent seeking to rent for her disabled child,anne giebeler,presented no unusual risks either.although,like any other such parent,she would not have lived,she was both a good credit risk and easy to track down her income,based on monthly pension checks,was a reliable and ample source of rent funds and she had an unblemished credit record anne giebeler also had significant assets,including a home which she had owned and resided in for years and for which she had paid off the mortgage in full.her home is located less than a mile from the branham complex.in short,by allowing anne giebeler to rent the apartment so that her disabled son could live in it,branham would not assume any substantial financial or administrative risk or burden.
even if one views the requested arrangement as the defendants,as a cosignership,requiring waiver of the partnership requested accommodation was still
