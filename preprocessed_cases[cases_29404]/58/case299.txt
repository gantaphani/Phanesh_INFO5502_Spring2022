sherwood partners,as assignee for the benefit of creditors of photopoint usa,and appeal from the judgment in these consolidated actions arising from a dispute concerning a substantial security deposit under a commercial lease between as lessor and photopoint as lessee.the central issues in the appeals are whether the court below correctly ruled that failed to return the security deposit as required by civil code section but that was entitled to offset the amount of the security deposit it withheld against the even greater amount of damages it sustained on account of photopoint breach of the lease,and therefore photopoint sustained no actual damages and was not entitled to return of the deposit.
we conclude that violated section by retaining the security deposit to cover its damages for future rent owed under the lease,because section allows a security deposit to be applied only against unpaid rent that has accrued as of the date called for in the statute for the return of the deposit.we hold that parties to a commercial lease can waive section to provide that a security deposit may be held and applied against future rent damages,but that no such waiver was made in the lease in this case.we hold further that the amount of the security deposit wrongly retained can not be offset against its future rent damages because that result would enable to profit from its violation of section.the judgment must therefore be reversed.
background 
the lease in question was for a term beginning on april.the lease defined security deposit to mean cash in the amount of,a sum equal to one month base rent,as provided in section.a of the lease,and the letter of credit required under section.section.b stipulated that,in addition to the cash security deposit,photopoint would arrange for issuance by a bank of an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of as beneficiary in the amount of,a sum equal to months base rent.photopoint was obligated to cause the issuing bank to immediately restore any amount drawn on the letter of credit.provided photopoint was not in default under the lease,the letter of credit was to be reduced by the original the end of each year in the lease term.pursuant to this provision,the letter of credit was reduced on march,to the sum of.
photopoint failed to pay rent due under the lease for the months of april,may,june,and july.as a result,caused the bank to draw down the letter of credit by on may,and on june.photopoint did not cause the bank to restore these amounts to the letter of credit.on june,photopoint executed a general assignment for the benefit of creditors to sherwood as assignee,an event of default under the lease.on july,caused the bank to pay the remaining on the letter of credit.on or about august,served on photopoint a notice of belief of abandonment,and a notice to quit containing an election to forfeit the lease.
on august,filed an unlawful detainer action against photopoint super.city and county.in november,sherwood as photopoint assignee sued super.city and county,seeking return of the security deposit,including the letter of credit funds,retained by.amended the complaint in case to replace the unlawful detainer count with a cause of action for damages for breach of the lease,and sherwood intervened in that case.
the cases were consolidated for trial and tried to the court on stipulated facts.it was stipulated that had not returned any funds referred to in section of the lease.it was further stipulated that was damaged as a result of photopoint breach of the lease in the amount of,which included the base rent of per month from july through june,and less per month from july through april.
the court excluded parol evidence at trial,and ruled that was entitled to pursue its rights of setoff.the court found that photopoint was entitled to a credit for the security deposit and letter of credit funds retained against the damages sustained.the court found that was required to return the security deposit and letter of credit funds to photopoint within the time frame provided by civil code section,but that photopoint sustained no actual damages as a result of the statutory violation because those funds could be applied against damages.the court awarded photopoint a statutory penalty of for violation of section.the court entered a net judgment of in favor of,representing damages of,less the security deposit and letter of credit funds of and the statutory penalty.
ii.discussion 
security deposits in commercial leases are governed by section.as of the date of the judgment herein,section,subdivision c provided that a security deposit could be applied to remedy tenant defaults in the payment of rent,to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant,or to clean the premises upon termination of the tenancy.italics added.if the deposit was used to cover only defaults in the payment of rent,then the balance was to be returned to the tenant within two weeks after the landlord receives possession of the premises.ibid.no issue is presented in this case regarding amounts to clean,or repair damages to,the premises.the dispute is about the meaning of rent in the statute.
sherwood argues that defaults in the payment of rent means the unpaid rent that has accrued when the security deposit is required to be returned.takes the position that rent includes not only rent,but also future rent damages the landlord could recover under section,the rent owed for the remainder of the lease term,less the rental loss the tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided a california lessor with abandoned premises has two mutually exclusive remedies deem the lease terminated and seek damages pursuant to,or,under,continue to perform under the lease and seek rent as it becomes due.in re lomax bankr th cir.through the termination of the lease upon abandonment,converts a landlord continuing right to rent under the lease into a damage claim for rent lost through the tenant abandonment.id.at.
in view,the deadline for return of a security deposit under section only limits the time within which a landlord exercising its rights under section must estimate its damages for future lost rent.under this scenario,if the deposit would be insufficient to cover the anticipated section damages,the landlord could retain it on the other hand,if it appeared that the deposit would exceed the damages,the excess would have to be refunded.here,for example,indicates the rental market was falling when it received possession of the premises,and asserts it was clear at that point that the damages for future lost rent would exceed the amount of the security deposit.under section,subdivision f,a landlord who retains a security deposit in violation of the statute and does so in bad faith is liable for up to in damages in addition to any actual damages the tenant sustains.thus,under argument,if the landlord guessed wrong,and retained more of the security deposit than was required to cover future rent damages,the excess would eventually be refunded as actual damages to the tenant if the landlord acted in bad faith,the tenant could be awarded additional damages of.
no authority supports reading of section,and its interpretation is contrary to the statute language and purpose.whereas section affords a summary procedure granberry islay investments cal th,d,describing section,the security deposit statute for residential leases that is to be completed shortly after the landlord recovery of possession,section contemplates a court action in which damages are adjudicated see california safety center,jax car sales d.any estimate of section damages within the limited timeframe of section would necessarily be speculative.if the rent to be offset against the security deposit must be calculated and the excess returned within two weeks after the premises are surrendered to the landlord,the offset clearly is limited to rent due through the time of surrender.italics added james,landlord beware will a security deposit survive a bankruptcy cal.moreover,if construction of section were adopted,landlords could retain security deposits well beyond the statutory deadline in every case,on the ground that the deposit might not cover prospective damages,and could do so with relative impunity given the modest penalty for acting in bad faith.such a result would thwart the statutory purpose of compelling the prompt refund of security deposits.see granberry islay investments,supra,at,d.
sherwood construction of section is supported by the decision in public employees retirement system winston d.the tenant in winston vacated the premises on may,and was found to have been constructively evicted on that date.the landlord retained the security deposit and sued the tenant for over in unpaid future rent and other damages under the lease.the trial court found that the landlord was entitled to damages of,plus interest.the issue in the appeal was whether the security deposit could be offset against the judgment,in which case the landlord would have obtained a net recovery and been the prevailing party,or whether the security deposit had to be offset against the rent owed as of may,two weeks following the constructive eviction,pursuant to section,subdivision c,in which case the landlord would have owed the tenant money as of that date and the tenant would have been the prevailing party.
the winston court held that the statutory language unambiguously provides that the lessor must credit the deposit against any rent owing within two weeks following the termination of the lease,at which time the lessee becomes entitled to the balance,if any.section,subdivision c makes no reference to the application of the deposit towards the amount of any judgment against the lessee.public employees retirement system winston,supra,d at.this conclusion is directly at odds with reading of the statute.under interpretation,the landlord in winston would have been able to keep the security deposit because it was far less than the unpaid future rent and other damages over the landlord thought was due under the lease,and the result would have been a credit of less a penalty of up to if the landlord retained that amount in bad faith against the judgment,rather than a credit against the rent that was owed two weeks after the landlord recovered possession of the premises.
sherwood interpretation of section is also supported by the timing of the statute enactment and the evolution of the statute language.since section went into effect before section,the term rent as used in section can not plausibly be taken to refer to future rent damages under section.section was originally enacted as section,which became effective january.see stats,ch.section,however,did not go into effect until july.stats,ch.before section became effective,a landlord had no right to terminate a lease for a tenant breach,and then sue for lost rent if the lease were terminated due to the tenant breach,the landlord right to the remaining rent terminated as well.recommendation relating to real property leases cal.law revision com,hereafter recommendation.it thus appears that the word rent as used in section means unpaid rent that has accrued under the lease,and does not include section damages for the loss of rent payable after the lease is terminated.see in re lomax,supra,at distinguishing between the real property right to rent and the contract right to damages for lost rent arising from termination of the lease.
the purpose of recent amendments to section,subdivision c provides further support for sherwood position.section,subdivision c now allows the landlord to retain a security deposit of up to one month rent for up to days to remedy defaults in the payment of rent according to a committee report on this change,the retention time was increased from two weeks to days because landlords needed more time to calculate common area maintenance cam charges assessed as additional rent in commercial leases.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.june.the report explained that u nder the current requirement commercial landlords often can not determine the cam charges in that time and must therefore return all of the tenant security deposit even though the cam charges are still owing.this in turn forces the landlord to try to collect the cam charges from a departed tenant.if the former tenant does not voluntarily pay,the landlord only recourse is to sue in court to enforce the debt.id.at,italics added.the italicized language indicates that it is not permissible for a landlord to keep a security deposit beyond the statutory time limit,even if an additional amount is certain to be determined to be due to the landlord thereafter,much less that it would be permissible,as claims,to apply the deposit to an unliquidated amount that may subsequently become due.
argues that to exclude section damages from rent under section would effectively negate section,which provides that,after a lease is terminated pursuant to section and if certain conditions are met,including an advance payment by the tenant of over one month rent under the original lease,the tenant is to receive written notice from the landlord of the reletting of the premises and the term and rent under the new lease.an advance payment for purposes of section is defined,like a security deposit under section,to include money paid to the landlord to secure performance under the lease,subd.a,subd.a.argues that there would be no point to section unless the landlord is allowed to retain the former tenant security deposit as security for future rent damages under section.however,a former tenant exposed to such damages will have an interest in the landlord efforts to mitigate them by reletting the premises,whether or not the landlord retains the security deposit.section does not in any way affect the right of the lessor to recover damages nor the right of a lessee to recover prepaid rent,a security deposit,or other payment.the section is included merely to provide a means whereby the lessee whose lease has been terminated under section may obtain information concerning the length of the term of the new lease and the rent provided in the new lease.recommendation,supra,cal.law revision com,at.
submits that section should not be interpreted so as to strip the landlord of its rights under sections and.notes that,upon termination of a lease under section,the landlord is immediately vested with the right to recover its damages under that section,including past and future unpaid rent.however,the existence of that right does not depend on a rule that would allow retention of a security deposit for application against possible future rent damages.as for section,we agree with that it is appropriate to retain the deposit so as to utilize the remedy provided under that statute,and our reading of section does not prevent that recourse.under section,when the tenant breaches the lease and abandons the premises,the landlord may,if certain conditions are met,elect not to terminate the tenant right to possession and instead continue to enforce its rights under the lease,including the right to collect the rent as it becomes due.because the tenant in that event retains the right to sublet the premises or assign its interest in the lease,subd.b,the landlord does not receive possession of the premises within the meaning of section,the duty to return the security deposit does not arise,and the landlord can continue to apply the deposit against the rent as it accrues.
cites cases predating the enactment of sections and for the proposition that a landlord may retain a security deposit until the damages from the tenant breach of the lease are ascertained.see,thompson swiryn d,tenant is not entitled,upon breach of a lease,to the return of a deposit made to secure performance of the lease the lessor may look to the fund for damages proved and the lessee may recover the balance gallagher mcmann,the landlord is entitled to retain the deposit until the complete discharge of the obligation which the same is intended to secure.cases decided before the advent of the right to recover future rent damages under section can provide no definitive rule governing security for the use of that remedy and,in any event,those decisions have been abrogated insofar as they conflict with section.section specifies the obligations against which a security deposit can be applied,and directs that the balance of the deposit remaining after those deductions be refunded promptly to the tenant.as the court observed in people ex rel.smith parkmerced d,disapproved on another point in kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,with respect to the statute governing security deposits for residential leases,section restricts the use of a security deposit to specifically defined purposes,smith,supra,at,and requires that the deposit be returned to the extent it is not necessary for those limited purposes.since those observations apply equally to section,reliance on cases for a contrary rule is misplaced.
the more recent cases cited by trinity management services,supra,cal th,d,and california safety center,jax car sales,supra,d.also inapposite.kraus clarified the meaning of the term security as used in section,subdivision b kraus trinity management services,supra,at,d,california safety center clarified the damages recoverable for unpaid rent during the time periods specified in section,subdivisions a,a,and a california safety center,jax car sales,supra,at.neither case concerns section or contains any reasoning that supports position.
accordingly we conclude that the words defaults in the payment of rent in section refer only to unpaid rent that has accrued as of the time the security deposit is required to be returned,and do not refer to future rent damages the landlord may thereafter recover under section.
b.the lease 
bases a series of arguments against the finding that it violated section on the terms of its lease with photopoint.these contentions,like those advanced by as to the meaning of the statute,are unpersuasive.
the letter of credit 
contends that the portion of the security deposit represented by the letter of credit was not a payment or deposit of money within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and was thus excepted from the statute.notes that section,subdivision a,has no language like that of section,subdivision a,which defines an advance payment under a lease as moneys deposited with the landlord to secure performance of the lease,or other payment that is the substantial equivalent of such a deposit.thus submits that the letter of credit could not be deemed a security deposit on the theory that it was substantially equivalent to money.also relies on the independence principle applicable to letters of rule that the issuer obligation to honor a draw on the letter of credit is entirely separate from any underlying contract between the issuer customer and the letter of credit beneficiary western security bank superior court cal th,d,and on cases holding that a letter of credit and its proceeds are not property of the bankruptcy estate of the issuer customer in matter of marine distributors,cir,in re farm fresh supermarkets of maryland.
we are not called upon to decide whether a letter of credit constitutes a payment or deposit of money for purposes of section because had drawn the entire amount of the letter of credit before the security deposit was due to be returned,and was thus holding only money at the relevant point.nor does the independence of letters of credit have any bearing on photopoint right to the return of that money under the lease and the law governing the lease.this conclusion is supported by the decision in in re graham square,cir.
the debtor in graham square sought financing from a bank,and arranged for a letter of credit in the bank favor to cover the loan commitment fee.the bank approved the loan,but the debtor was unable to consummate the loan agreement.the bank drew on the letter of credit to pay the commitment fee,and the debtor filed for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy trustee sued the bank to recover the proceeds of the letter of credit on the theory that the commitment fee was an impermissible penalty under applicable state contract law.the bankruptcy and district courts held that the trustee had no right to recover the fee because the fee had been paid through a letter of credit and recovery was barred by the independence principle.the circuit court disagreed 
critically,and of great importance here,the doctrine of independence protects only the distribution of the proceeds of the letter of credit.it prohibits an attack on the issuing bank distribution to the beneficiary and does not address claims respecting the underlying contract.in these cases the trustee has not challenged the distribution of the proceeds by the issuer,but instead,has challenged the bank right to retain the commitment fee and has brought an action on the underlying contract between the debtor and the bank.
while the fee was paid through the vehicle of a standby letter of credit,and may thus be considered proceeds of the letter of credit,it is significant that the bank has already received those funds.it is one thing to attempt to prevent the distribution of the proceeds of a letter of credit,an attempt the doctrine of independence is designed to prevent but it is quite another to bring an action on the underlying contract that created the letter of credit.
if the debtor had paid the bank the commitment fee in cash,the debtor could seek a refund by challenging the fee provision in the underlying contract as an illegal penalty.all of the bank arguments aside,there is no principled reason for allowing a challenge to the underlying contract when the fee is paid in cash,and not allowing such a challenge after the fee is paid via a standby letter of credit.in other words,challenging the distribution of the proceeds of a letter of credit is different than challenging the underlying contract.the ultimate result may be the same refund of the fee,but in one case the method of recovery is permissible and in the other it is barred.in re graham square,supra,at.
this reasoning is persuasive and applies equally here.in this case,as in graham square,it is significant that the proceeds of the letter of credit have been distributed.sherwood is seeking to enforce photopoint state law rights under the latter contract with sherwood is not challenging right to draw on the letter of credit.thus,the independence principle is inapplicable,and it is irrelevant that the security deposit originated as a letter of credit.
contends that the requirements of section were waived under various provisions of the lease.sherwood maintained in its briefs that a tenant could not waive the benefits of section,but abandoned that claim at oral argument in the appeal.sherwood is right to concede that a tenant under a commercial lease may effectively agree to waive the protections of section.that conclusion is consistent with cases holding that commercial tenants may waive their rights under the civil code,lee placer title th,d right to quiet enjoyment folberg clara kinney d.right to notice of rent default,and with california public policy of enable ing and facilitate ing freedom of contract by the parties to commercial real property leases,subd.a.since the legislature has expressly prohibited waivers of section protections for residential security deposits,subd.a,its failure to do so with respect to commercial security deposits indicates that waivers are permissible as to those deposits.see hersh state bar cal d,disparities in statutes dealing with the same subject matter are presumed to be intentional williams county of san joaquin d.see also.
in view of our holding that tenants can agree to waive section,there is no substance to the suggestion in petition for rehearing that our decision will hurt start up companies.reasons that landlords will be less likely to rent to new businesses without the protection large security deposits can provide against defaults in the payment of rent,and apparently presumes that our decision will preclude that protection.however,parties can plan around section should they desire to do so.the question is whether that planning occurred here.
the lease in this case did not provide generally that its terms were to govern to the extent that they conflicted with applicable statutes.the lease stipulated that photopoint was waiving its rights under certain specified statutes,but section was not among the statutes mentioned.admits that the lease contains no explicit waiver of section,but argues that such a waiver can be implied from its terms.
contends that,given the sheer size of the security deposit,it must have been intended to serve as security for the payment of rent that would be owed after photopoint defaulted.while we would agree with that assertion,the problem for is that a waiver of section was not the only means by which the whole of the security deposit could have been applied against future rent under the lease.the lease gave the option to proceed under section,keep the lease in effect,and continue to collect the rent as it became due.as previously explained,the security deposit could have been retained in that situation because would not have received possession of the premises.thus,if had followed section,it could have applied the security deposit against the monthly rent as it became due until the deposit was exhausted.instead,it elected under section to terminate the lease and photopoint right of possession thereunder,and thereby triggered the duty to return the security deposit as provided in section.since the lease provided a way to apply the security deposit against future rent without a waiver of section,no such waiver need be implied to effectuate the large security deposit.
searches the security deposit and remedies sections of the lease for an implicit waiver of section.as previously indicated,the lease defines security deposit to mean the cash deposit and the letter of credit.the security deposit section reads in full as follows 
security deposit 
a.the security deposit shall be in the amount of.the security deposit shall be delivered to landlord upon the execution of this lease by tenant and shall be held by landlord without liability for interest unless required by law as security for the performance of tenant obligations.the security deposit is not an advance payment of rent or a measure of tenant liability for damages.landlord may,from time to time,without prejudice to any other remedy,use all or a portion of the security deposit to satisfy past due rent or to cure any uncured default by tenant,subject to the expiration of any applicable notice and cure period provided in the lease.if landlord uses the security deposit,tenant shall on demand restore the security deposit to its original amount.landlord shall return any unapplied portion of the security deposit to tenant within days after the later to occur of the date tenant surrenders possession of the premises to landlord in accordance with this lease or the termination date.if landlord transfers its interest in the premises,landlord may assign the security deposit to the transferee and,following the assignment,landlord shall have no further liability for the return of the security deposit.landlord shall not be required to keep the security deposit separate from its other accounts.
b.in addition to,and not in lieu of,the cash security deposit provided for in section.a,tenant shall deliver to landlord a sight draft letter of credit in the original principal amount of,permitting partial draws issued by a bank permitting draws in san francisco,california and which shall be substantially in the form of exhibit e attached hereto.the letter of credit shall provide that it shall be renewed annually with a final expiration date days beyond the scheduled termination date unless the issuing bank provides written notice to landlord that it is not being renewed,in which case landlord shall have the right to draw down the letter of credit and hold,apply and return such proceeds in accordance with section.a.in the event any amounts are drawn on the letter of credit,tenant shall immediately cause the issuing bank to restore such amount.the letter of credit shall provide that on each anniversary date of the commencement date it shall be reduced by,provided if landlord gives the issuing bank notice that tenant is then in default under this lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period,then such reduction shall be delayed until such time as landlord gives the issuing bank notice that such default is cured.italics added.
we discern nothing in the relevant language of these sections,which we have italicized,that could reasonably be interpreted to constitute an implicit waiver of section so as to authorize retention of any portion of the security deposit for application against future rent damages under section.to the contrary,the only provision that specifies how the security deposit may be applied,which states that it may be used to satisfy past due rent,and uncured defaults after notice and the opportunity to cure,is consistent with our interpretation of section.both the lease and the statute refer to liquidated amounts owed under the lease,not damages subject to proof for future rent.since there is no evidence that photopoint was given notice and an opportunity to cure any defaults,the lease by its terms allowed the security deposit to be applied only against past due rent.thus,under the lease and section,was required to return the security deposit within the time specified after receipt of possession of the premises,less only the rent past due at that point.
contends that section.a limitation on the use of the security deposit to cover past due rent does not apply to the portion of the security deposit represented by the letter of credit,because section.b provides that the proceeds of the letter of credit are to be applied in accordance with section.a only in the situation where the letter of credit is drawn after the issuing bank advises that the letter of credit will not be renewed.however,nothing in the lease suggests that the letter of credit proceeds can be applied in any manner other than the one specified in section.section.a states that the security deposit can be used to satisfy past due rent,and section defines security deposit to include the letter of credit furnished under section.b.the lease thus clearly and unambiguously limits the application of the letter of credit funds to past due rent.as we read the sentence in section.b on which relies,it simply confirms that the letter of credit proceeds are to be held,applied and returned as provided in section.a when the letter of credit is drawn because it will not be renewed,as well as when it is drawn because of a photopoint default.the sentence thus reinforces our interpretation of the permissible use of the security deposit under the lease.
contends that the lease implicitly waives section because section.a states that the deposit is to be returned within days after the later of the surrender of the premises or the date the lease is terminated in accordance with the lease,and section.b states that the letter of credit is to have a final termination date days beyond the scheduled termination date of april.the termination date specified in a letter of credit that is to be renewed annually during the term of the lease would need to be a date on or after the end of the scheduled lease term.thus,that the letter of credit would not by its terms expire before the end of the scheduled term of the lease says nothing about when proceeds of the letter of credit were due to be returned to photopoint.the return period specified in section.a did not effectively waive the whole of section as urges,it merely specified a longer period for retention of the security deposit days after surrender or termination in accordance with the lease,than the period specified in the statute two weeks after receipt of possession of the premises.however,this provision of section.a only waived section to that limited extent it did not allow to retain the security deposit beyond days for application against future rent damages under section.
attempt to find an implicit waiver of section in the remedies section of the lease is also unavailing.the full text of this section is set out in the margin the provisions of section.merely restate rights under section they do not expand rights under that statute or section.under lease section.and section,was,as it says,immediately vested with the right to recover all damages under the lease,including damages for future rent determined in accordance with the statute.but as we have indicated,the security deposit statute can not be read to permit retention of the deposit pending the trial of those damages.we note that in the middle of lease section,which provides for waivers of rights under section relief from forfeiture by full compensation,and code of civil procedure sections,subdivision c five days to reinstate after unlawful detainer judgment and relief from forfeiture because of hardship,there is language stating that photopoint waives any and all rights conferred by any and all other laws and rules of law from time to time in effect.however,this language can not in context be taken to refer to a waiver of all applicable law,including section,and advances no argument based on section.
the remedies provisions further support our view of the permissible uses of the security deposit under the lease.section.a provides for the exercise of rights under section to continue the lease in effect after photopoint breach and abandonment,and to recover the rent as it thereafter became procedure,as we have said,would have enabled,over time,to apply all of the security deposit to unpaid rent,and obviated the need for a waiver of section for that purpose.section,which the parties set out in capital letters,undermines claim that photopoint implicitly waived its section rights.that provision shows that when the parties intended to provide for waivers of statutory rights they knew how to do so very explicitly 
notes finally that,under section.i of the lease,photopoint obligation to pay rent survived the early termination of the lease.this section provides the expiration of the term,whether by lapse of time or otherwise,shall not relieve either party of any obligations which accrued prior to or which may continue to accrue after the expiration or early termination of this lease.without limiting the scope of the prior sentence,it is agreed that tenant obligations under sections rent,leasehold improvements,indemnity and waiver of claims,remedies,holding over,and surrender of premises shall survive the expiration or early termination of this lease.
the fact that,pursuant to this section,monthly rent would continue to accrue after early termination of the lease is of no assistance to.this section does not give any greater rights than those bestowed by section.it is true of course that a lessor election to forfeit the lessee rights under a lease because of the lessee default,or even a judgment in unlawful detainer declaring a forfeiture of the lessee rights,does not relieve the lessee of the obligations imposed by the lease.that is the precise effect of section section abrogates the common law rule that the lessee obligation to pay rent depends on the continued existence of the term.desert plaza partnership waddell d,italics omitted.moreover,as we have said,could have applied the security deposit against the rent as it accrued if had used the remedy provided in section.
accordingly,there was no waiver of section in the lease.indeed,the parties agreed to an extension of the time specified in the statute within which the security deposit had to be returned.
parol evidence 
contends that the court erred in granting sherwood motion to preclude from introducing parol evidence to show an understanding between and photopoint that,if the latter breached the lease,the security deposit could be applied against future as well as past due rent.sought to submit testimony from the real estate agent who acted for and photopoint in the lease negotiations that it was the general intent and it was the general climate in the market that existed,that letters of credit were being issued to protect landlords from tenants going out of business and making sure that you were going to get months of rent,or a year rent,or whatever a certain landlord was comfortable with.wanted to introduce testimony from photopoint chief financial officer,who understood that the letter of credit was there to protect the landlord,and that would look to the security deposit to address damages flowing from a default.also wanted to present testimony from one of its managers that sherwood contacted him in and indicated that it was seeking a replacement tenant in order to negotiate a return of part of the letter of credit funds.
section.k of the lease,under the heading miscellaneous,stated that all understandings and agreements previously made between the parties are superseded by this lease,and neither party is relying upon any warranty,statement or representation not contained in this lease.this lease may be modified only by a written agreement signed by landlord and tenant.section of the lease,under the heading entire agreement,provided that this lease and the following exhibits and attachments constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all prior agreements and understandings related to the premises where,as here,the parties to a written contract have agreed to it as an integration a complete and final embodiment of the terms of an evidence can not be used to add to or vary its terms.masterson sine cal d,see code civ,subds.a and b.
argues that it was offering parol evidence merely to interpret the agreement,not to vary or add to its terms.the test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.pacific gas thomas drayage.cal d.the evidence in question was being offered to show that and photopoint intended for the security deposit to be available for application against future rent under the lease if photopoint defaulted.however,the evidence was unnecessary for that purpose because,as we have acknowledged,that intention was reasonably apparent from the size of the security deposit alone.the question is not whether the parties intended to permit the security deposit to be used for future rent,it is whether they intended to waive section in order to facilitate that use.this is so,again,because the parties had,by making available in the lease the use of the section remedy lessor may continue lease in effect,given a means of applying the deposit against the future rent as it accrued,without any waiver of section.
whether the language of an agreement is reasonably susceptible to a proposed interpretation is a question of law.winet price th,d.as a matter of law,the language of the lease in this case can not reasonably be interpreted as waiving section.the lease states in relevant part that the security deposit may be used,in accordance with section,to satisfy past due rent.those words are clear and can not be taken to refer to future rent.accordingly,the court correctly granted the motion to exclude the parol evidence.
the trial court determined that although had not returned the security deposit as required under section,could nonetheless offset the deposit against the damages it sustained as a result of photopoint breach of the lease.in its statement of decision and judgment,the court concluded that was entitled to pursue its rights of setoff pursuant to code of civil procedure section and granberry islay investments,supra,cal th,d.code of civil procedure section does not create a substantive right to raise setoff as a defense to a claim for monetary relief,but merely describes the procedures to be followed in raising this defense.granberry,supra,at,d.the arguments on the setoff issue are centered on the granberry case.
the controversy in granberry arose under section,the security deposit statute for residential leases.the issue was whether a landlord who in good faith fails to comply with the requirements of this statute may nevertheless recover damages for unpaid rent,repairs,and cleaning in a subsequent judicial proceeding.granberry islay investments,supra,cal th at,d.the landlords in granberry owned or operated over residential units,charged tenants an extra for the first days of occupancy,and never returned any part of that amount to the tenants.approximately tenants paid about million in premiums,and a class of former tenants sued for return of those premiums on the ground that they were security deposits within the meaning of section.under section the landlord was required,within three weeks of the date the tenant vacated the premises,to provide the tenant with a written accounting for any portion of the security deposit the landlord retained if the landlord failed to provide the accounting within this period the entire deposit had to be returned.the landlords in granberry did not furnish the accountings,and it was determined that they had,in good faith,failed to return the premiums as required by section.the question presented in the case was whether the landlords could nevertheless offset the premiums against damages for unpaid rent,repairs,and against which security deposits could be applied under section,subdivision b.see granberry islay investments,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
the court held that a landlord who has in good faith failed to return a security deposit as required by section can nonetheless recover damages for unpaid rent,repairs,and cleaning in a subsequent judicial proceeding.granberry islay investments,supra,cal th at,d.the court reasoned that the mere fact that the landlord has lost the right to take advantage of the summary procedure of section,subdivision f,does not lead to the conclusion that he has lost all right to claim damages for unpaid rent,repair,and cleaning,whether through setoff or otherwise.granberry,supra,at,d.the tenants argued that to allow the landlords to raise setoff as a defense would be inconsistent with the equitable principle that an individual should not profit from his own wrong,because landlords may use this defense to keep all or part of the security deposits they retained in violation of section,subdivision f.id.at,d.while the court recognize d the importance of this equitable principle see,and while it did not doubt that this principle may bar setoff on the particular facts of many individual cases,it does not justify an absolute bar to the right to a setoff in all cases.ibid.the court observed in this regard that a landlord that seeks setoff after good faith noncompliance with the procedures described in section,subdivision f,does not profit from his own wrong,because he can not set off any damages he could not have recovered if he had complied with section,subdivision f.id.at,d.
we read this last statement,as does sherwood,to mean that a landlord that in good faith violates the security deposit statute may offset against its damages only those amounts which it properly could have claimed of the security deposit in the first place.here,wrongly retained the security deposit to cover future rent against which the deposit could not have been applied under section thereby profited from its own wrong unlike the landlords in granberry.to allow the offset against future rent damages accomplished by the net judgment in this case would enable to profit from its violation of section at the expense of the other creditors of photopoint.if sherwood were allowed a separate judgment,it would be in a position to marshal an asset of photopoint for the benefit of all of photopoint creditors,not just.a setoff simply eliminates a superfluous exchange of money between the parties.jess herrmann cal d.there would be no such exchange in this instance because,like other photopoint creditors,is entitled only to a pro rata distribution of photopoint assets,not a dollar for dollar recovery of its damages.entry of the net judgment thus resulted in an inequitable windfall to id.at,and separate judgments are required.
time for return of the deposit 
in view of the court ruling on the setoff issue,it was not required to determine precisely when was required to return the security deposit.no evidence on the issue was presented other than the notice to quit and the notice of belief of abandonment served on photopoint on or about august.the notice to quit stated that if photopoint did not vacate and deliver possession of the premises,would initiate legal proceedings to declare a forfeiture of the lease,and to recover possession of the premises,rent,and damages.the notice to quit further stated elects to declare the forfeiture of the lease under which you hold possession of the premises.the notice of belief of abandonment,given pursuant to section advised that the premises would be deemed abandoned under section and the lease would terminate on september,unless,before that date,received written notice from photopoint stating that photopoint did not intend to abandon the property.
reports in its briefs that,after photopoint vacated the premises sometime in july,sherwood moved in to review documents and marshal photopoint assets.indicates that sherwood eventually vacated the property but never turned over the keys or advised of its intentions with respect to the lease.says that this caused it to serve the notice to quit and notice of belief of abandonment.the record shows that filed its unlawful detainer action against photopoint on august.
as we have said,section.a of the lease effectively amended the statutory time for return of the deposit.section,subdivision c required that the balance of the security deposit remaining after application toward default in the payment of rent be returned to the tenant within two weeks after the landlord received possession of the premises receipt of possession meaning,in our view,termination of the lease pursuant to section,either by the tenant breach and abandonment or by termination of the tenant right of possession.section.a of the lease provided a longer,deadline,measured from a different date the later of photopoint surrender of possession of the premises in accordance with this lease,and the termination date,which is defined in section.e to mean april,or the date of early termination in accordance with this lease.the situation is further complicated by section,which gives a tenant assignee for the benefit of creditors the right to occupy the premises for up to days after the assignment,if the assignee pays the monthly rent when due 
the parties have not briefed the issue of when the security deposit was due to be returned under the lease,and that date is not a pure question of law on which we can appropriately rule in the first instance.the date needs to be determined by the trial court,after the parties are afforded an opportunity to submit further argument and evidence.however,the briefs do raise arguments on the lease termination that can be dealt with here.
had the right,under the lease and section,to terminate the lease by terminating photopoint right of possession.in the absence of proof that photopoint responded to the notice of belief of abandonment,the lease terminated on september,as stated in that notice,subd.a in re lomax,supra,at.that termination was unquestionably a termination in accordance with this lease within the meaning of section.a,which would have started the running of the days in the absence of evidence that sherwood timely paid the rent required to exercise its right of continued occupancy as photopoint assignee,there is no merit to suggestion that the existence of that right prevented the lease from being terminated in accordance with its terms on september.
sherwood contends that the premises must have been abandoned,and the lease therefore terminated,by august,the date of the notice of belief of abandonment.see,subd.b such notice may be given only when the lessor reasonably believes that the tenant has abandoned.however,the lease specifies that the days begin to run from surrender or termination of the lease in accordance with its terms,not from the time of breach and abandonment.sherwood argues that the lease was terminated on august,days after service of the notice to quit.however,termination in accordance with this lease apparently refers to termination of photopoint right of possession,a right that was not extinguished through the notice to quit.see california safety center,jax car sales,supra,d at,fn.tenant can remain in possession until unlawful detainer judgment is rendered.these points do not preclude sherwood from attempting to establish,when the case is returned to the trial court,that the period for return of the security deposit under the lease began to run before september.
iii.disposition 
the judgment is reversed.
unless otherwise indicated,all further statutory references are to the civil code.
section formerly provided in part a any payment or deposit of money the primary function of which is to secure the performance of a rental agreement for other than residential property or any part of the agreement,other than a payment or deposit,including an advance payment of rent,made to secure the execution of a rental agreement,shall be governed by the provisions of this section.with respect to residential property,the provisions of section shall prevail.b any such payment or deposit of money shall be held by the landlord for the tenant who is party to the agreement.the claim of a tenant to the payment or deposit shall be prior to the claim of any creditor of the landlord,except a trustee in bankruptcy.c the landlord may claim of the payment or deposit only those amounts as are reasonably necessary to remedy tenant defaults in the payment of rent,to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant,or to clean the premises upon termination of the tenancy,if the payment or deposit is made for any or all of those specific purposes.where the claim of the landlord upon the payment or deposit is only for defaults in the payment of rent,then any remaining portion of the payment or deposit shall be returned to the tenant no later than two weeks after the date the landlord receives possession of the premises.where the claim of the landlord upon the payment or deposit includes amounts reasonably necessary to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant or to clean the premises,then any remaining portion of the payment or deposit shall be returned to the tenant at a time as may be mutually agreed upon by landlord and tenant,but in no event later than days from the date the landlord receives possession of the premises.f the bad faith retention by a landlord or transferee of a payment or deposit or any portion thereof,in violation of this section,may subject the landlord or the transferee to damages not to exceed two hundred dollars,in addition to any actual damages.g this section is declarative of existing law and therefore operative as to all tenancies,leases,or rental agreements for other than residential property created or renewed on or after january.stats,ch.
section provides in part a except as otherwise provided in section,if a lessee of real property breaches the lease and abandons the property before the end of the term or if his right to possession is terminated by the lessor because of a breach of the lease,the lease terminates.upon such termination,the lessor may recover from the lessee the worth at the time of award of the unpaid rent which had been earned at time of termination the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the lessee proves could be reasonably avoided and any other amount necessary to compensate the lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by the lessee failure to perform his obligations under the lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.
section provides in part a the remedy described in this section is available only if the lease provides for this remedy b even though a lessee of real property has breached the lease and abandoned the property,the lease continues in effect for so long as the lessor does not terminate the lessee right to possession,and the lessor may enforce all the lessor rights and remedies under the lease,including the right to recover the rent as it becomes due under the lease,if any of the specified conditions concerning assignment and subletting by the tenant is satisfied.
the statute now reads c the landlord may claim of the payment or deposit only those amounts as are reasonably necessary to remedy tenant defaults in the payment of rent,to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant,or to clean the premises upon termination of the tenancy,if the payment or deposit is made for any or all of those specific purposes.if the claim of the landlord upon the payment or deposit is only for defaults in the payment of rent and the security deposit equals no more than one month rent plus a deposit amount clearly described as the payment of the last month rent,then any remaining portion of the payment or deposit shall be returned to the tenant at a time as may be mutually agreed upon by landlord and tenant,but in no event later than days from the date the landlord receives possession of the premises.if the claim of the landlord upon the payment or deposit is only for defaults in the payment of rent and the security deposit exceeds the amount of one month rent plus a deposit amount clearly described as the payment of the last month rent,then any remaining portion of the payment or deposit in excess of an amount equal to one month rent shall be returned to the tenant no later than two weeks after the date the landlord receives possession of the premises,with the remainder to be returned or accounted for within days from the date the landlord receives possession of the premises.if the claim of the landlord upon the payment or deposit includes amounts reasonably necessary to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant or to clean the premises,then any remaining portion of the payment or deposit shall be returned to the tenant at a time as may be mutually agreed upon by landlord and tenant,but in no event later than days from the date the landlord receives possession of the premises.
other arguments in the petition for rehearing are either improperly advanced for the first time in the petition gentis safeguard business systems,th,d or adequately addressed in our discussion.the principal new argument is that section is preempted by the current bankruptcy code.while we need not and do not reach this belated contention,we note that the petition does not identify precisely how much of the field of tenant security deposit law congress has allegedly intended to occupy,and that the argument rests on the unsupported assumption that section would not be applied in a proposition no reported case has considered,and at least one commentary has rejected james,supra.at.
