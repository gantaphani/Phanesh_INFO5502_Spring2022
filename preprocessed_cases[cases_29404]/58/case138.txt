topa equities,topa owns an apartment building in los angeles,california.in,topa entered a federal program by which the government subsidized topa mortgage interest payments in return for topa charging rents.in,topa left the government program.it wanted to raise its rents to market levels.standing in its way,however,was los angeles rent stabilization ordinance larso,which regulates rents so as to safeguard tenants from excessive rent increases.under larso,the rents topa had been charging while a participant in the federal program could not be raised until existing tenancies terminated.
seeking relief from larso,topa filed the present lawsuit against the city of los angeles.topa contended that it was not subject to larso because larso was preempted by federal law.the district court disagreed,and granted summary judgment in favor of the city.topa appeals.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.larso is a generally applicable rent control ordinance that does not unduly interfere with federal housing programs.it is not expressly preempted by federal law,nor is it preempted on conflict grounds.
background 
federal housing statutes 
in,congress enacted the national housing act nha to provide a decent home and suitable living environment for every american family.in,congress added section to the nha f or the purpose of reducing rentals for lower income families.under section,the federal government enters into agreements with property owners by which it provides mortgage interest subsidies to owners who are willing to charge rents.id.in,hud promulgated regulations that permit participants,after years in the federal program,to prepay their subsidized mortgages,exit the program,and free themselves from federal rent control.a ii.
in,congress passed the emergency low income housing preservation act elihpa out of concern that the stock of low income housing would be depleted if property owners left the federal rent control program after just years.note.elihpa effectively placed a moratorium on participants ability to prepay their mortgages and leave the federal program.id.
in,congress replaced elihpa with the low income housing preservation and resident homeownership act lihprha.lihprha imposed stringent requirements upon property owners who wanted to prepay their mortgages and exit the federal program.id.a.at the same time,lihprha provided incentives for property owners to stay in the program.see id.lihprha also expressly preempted state laws that restrict or inhibit the prepayment of any subsidized mortgage,or are limited only to eligible low income housing for which the owner has prepaid the mortgage.id.a.lihprha provided,however,that its preemption provision would not prevent the establishment,continuing in effect,or enforcement of any law or regulation of any state relating to rent control to the extent such law or regulation is of general applicability.id.b.
in,congress eliminated the prepayment restrictions imposed by lihprha by enacting the housing opportunity program extension act hope,stat.hope permits property owners to prepay their mortgages after years,but prohibits them from raising rents for days after exiting the program.see note.hope contains no preemption provision nor does it mention lihprha preemption provision.after enacting hope,congress ceased funding the additional incentives provided by lihprha.
in,los angeles enacted larso to regulate rents so as to safeguard tenants from excessive rent increases,while at the same time providing owners with just and reasonable returns from their rental units.los angeles municipal code.larso caps the maximum rent owners may charge for a unit based on the current rent for that unit.id.for new units,owners may establish initial rents at market level,but thereafter must comply with larso maximum rent provisions.id.larso also contains a vacancy decontrol provision that permits owners to raise the rent for a unit to market level after the tenancy for that unit has terminated.id.in addition,to ensure that owners receive a reasonable return on each unit,larso allows owners to petition for permission to charge higher rents.id.properties that participate in federal programs under the nha are exempt from larso.id.
in,los angeles amended larso maximum rent and vacancy decontrol provisions.the amended ordinance provides that w here a rental unit was exempt from the provisions of this chapter the maximum rent shall be the amount of rent last charged for the rental unit while it was exempt.id.the amended ordinance also provided that larso vacancy decontrol provision would not apply i f a rental unit is vacated as a result of the termination of the regulation of the rental unit under any local,state,or federal program.id.it is these amendments to larso that topa challenges in this litigation.
when topa entered the federal nha section rent control program back in,it obtained a,mortgage in return for charging rents.topa prepaid its subsidized mortgage in and exited the federal program.the housing authority of los angeles then informed topa that it was subject to the larso amendments and,until vacancies occurred,it would have to keep its rents at the levels it had been charging under the federal program.this litigation followed.the issues presented in this appeal are whether federal law expressly preempts the larso amendments,and if not whether those amendments are preempted on conflict grounds.
ii.discussion 
the supremacy clause of the constitution provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi.applying this provision in the federal preemption context,we have identified three instances in which federal law preempts state law express congress explicitly defines the extent to which its enactments preempt state law field state law attempts to regulate conduct in a field that congress intended the federal law exclusively to occupy and conflict it is impossible to comply with both state and federal requirements,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.williamson dynamics,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
express preemption 
lihprha contains an express preemption provision which preempts any law or regulation that restricts or inhibits the prepayment of any mortgage described in section of this title.a.los angeles contends this preemption provision has been repealed by hope,and as a result we need not concern ourselves with it.we disagree.hope does not expressly or impliedly repeal lihprha preemption provision.hope neither mentions lihprha,nor is it irreconcilable with it.see firebaugh canal united states,cir t he intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest,and in the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention to repeal,the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.internal citation and quotation omitted see also ins,cir.
while it is true that congress has,since enacting hope,ceased funding lihprha incentive programs,that inaction has no effect on lihprha express preemption provision.that provision is extant.in so resolving this issue,we join the eighth circuit,which is the only other circuit to address it.forest park ii hadley,cir the fact that congress no longer funds the incentive programs established by lihprha does not mean that the prepayment provisions contained therein are irrelevant or that the statute is no longer the law.with regard to whether lihprha actually preempts larso,we distinguish forest park ii later in this opinion.
the question thus becomes whether lihprha express preemption provision set forth in a preempts the larso amendments.we conclude it does not,because the larso amendments do not restrict or inhibit the prepayment of federally subsidized mortgages,and are exempt from the express preemption provision of a by the language of b.
the terms restrict or inhibit which appear in a are not defined by the statute therefore,we construe them in accordance with their ordinary or natural meaning.united states velte,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t
