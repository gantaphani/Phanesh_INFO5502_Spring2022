hawaii governor linda lingle hawaii appeals the district court holding on remand that section c of act of the hawaii state legislature act or the act effects a regulatory taking in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.chevron usa,chevron challenged the act,which,inter alia,proscribes the maximum rent that oil companies can collect from dealers who lease service stations.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
in response to concerns about the highly concentrated wholesale gasoline market in hawaii and the resulting high cost of gasoline to consumers,the hawaii legislature enacted act in.act,among other things,regulates the maximum rent an oil company can charge dealers who lease its service stations.more specifically,act caps the rent that chevron and other oil companies can collect from at of the dealer profit on gasoline sales and of the dealer gross sales on products other than gasoline,plus a percentage increase equal to any increase the oil company may be required to pay on its ground lease.
chevron is one of two gasoline refiners and one of six wholesalers in hawaii.at the retail level,chevron sells most of its gasoline through stations,which are leased to independent dealers.chevron leases service stations to dealers in hawaii.from through the end of,chevron relied on estimated gasoline sales to calculate the rent owed by the.after determining that the amount of gross rent receipts was not satisfactory,chevron initiated a new nationwide dealer rental program in january,restructuring the manner in which it calculated lease rates.this program,which the parties agree would be in effect in hawaii but for act,requires the to pay a monthly rent,consisting of an escalating percentage of the dealer gross margin on actual,rather than estimated,gasoline sales.as noted,act,in contrast,establishes a maximum regulated rent of of gross margin.
although chevron maintains that act prevents it,through rental payments alone,from recovering its rental expenses,it concedes that over the past years,chevron has never fully recovered its expenses relating to dealer stations from rental income alone.instead,chevron relies on its supply contracts to earn a profit.dealers who choose to rent a station from chevron must as a condition of their lease agree to purchase from chevron all the product necessary to satisfy demand at the station for chevron gasoline.the price is unilaterally set by chevron.
both the lease agreement and supply contract permit the to transfer his or her occupancy rights upon obtaining chevron written consent and paying a transfer fee set by chevron.act does not prohibit such transfers,nor limit the price at which they can occur.
chevron moved for partial summary judgment on its claim that act effects an unconstitutional regulatory taking because it fails to substantially advance a legitimate state interest.hawaii responded by filing a cross motion for summary judgment on all of chevron claims.the district court resolved the motions in chevron favor.chevron usa,cayetano,d.
hawaii appealed the district court decision,challenging the standard used to evaluate chevron regulatory takings claim and the court application of that standard.chevron usa,cayetano,cir,cert.denied,d chevron i.we relied primarily on the supreme court decision in yee city of escondido,d,and our opinion in richardson city and county of honolulu,cir,cert.denied,d,to hold that the district court applied the proper standard.id.these cases teach that application of the substantially advances test is appropriate where a rent control ordinance creates the possibility that an incumbent lessee will be able to capture the value of the decreased rent in the form of a premium.we observed that genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether act failed to substantially advance its purpose of lowering retail gasoline prices,thus effecting a regulatory taking.id.at a challenged regulatory action substantially advances its interest if it bears a reasonable relationship to that interest.we vacated the district court decision and remanded for additional factual development and of the parties witnesses on issues,including whether will capture a premium based on the increased value of their leaseholds and whether oil companies will compensate for act by increasing wholesale prices.id.at.
in a petition for rehearing,hawaii asserted for the first time that chevron challenge to act should be analyzed under the due process clause,not the takings clause.we denied hawaii petition for rehearing the supreme court subsequently denied hawaii petition for certiorari.
on remand,the district court considered the parties stipulations of fact and the testimony of expert witnesses.the district court held that act was unconstitutional and issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law.chevron usa,cayetano,d.the court made a fact finding that rather than decreasing the retail price of gasoline in hawaii,act would cause prices to increase.id.at.
on appeal,hawaii argues that the district court should have analyzed chevron claim under the due process clause rather than the takings clause the court misapplied the requirement that act substantially advance a legitimate state interest and even if the district court application of the law was correct,it clearly erred in finding that act does not,in fact,substantially advance hawaii interest in reducing retail gasoline prices.
the first two of hawaii arguments are barred as law of the case.the law of the case doctrine provides that the decision of an appellate court on a legal issue must be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case.bernhardt los angeles county,cir citation omitted.the doctrine applies to our explicit decisions as well as those issues decided by necessary implication.id.it is a discretionary doctrine with three recognized exceptions the earlier decision is clearly erroneous and its enforcement would work a manifest injustice intervening controlling authority makes reconsideration appropriate or substantially different evidence was adduced at a subsequent trial.in re rainbow magazine,cir.only the first two exceptions potentially apply to hawaii arguments.
chevron i bars hawaii argument that chevron must challenge act under the due process clause 
hawaii first argues that chevron challenge to hawaii rent control ordinance properly lies under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,not the takings clause of the fifth amendment.hawaii maintains that claims challenging the validity of a government action based on its failure to substantially advance a legitimate government interest must be resolved using due process principles.
we explicitly addressed and rejected this argument when it was raised for the first time in hawaii petition for rehearing,and implicitly did so in chevron i when we endorsed the substantially advances test over the more deferential test urged by hawaii.see at.in its prior appeal,hawaii maintained that the appropriate inquiry was whether the legislature rationally could have believed the act would substantially advance a legitimate purpose,the test typically applied to substantive due process challenges to economic legislation.id.at emphasis added.our conclusion that this more deferential,due process standard does not apply to regulatory takings claims challenging land use regulations,including rent control ordinances like act,logically stands as a rejection of hawaii current argument that such a challenge must be brought under the due process clause.see id.at,explaining that in hawaii housing authority midkiff,d,the court applied the more deferential test only because it involved claims of an actual physical taking.this is also consistent with our opinion refusal to accept the concurring opinion argument that the supreme court established such a rule in pennell city of san jose,d.id.at.concluding that pennell did not intimate in any way that rent control provisions should only be analyzed under the due process clause.rather,the court determined that the takings clause claim was premature and then analyzed the due process clause claim under the due process reasonableness test emphasis added.
the law of the case doctrine therefore bars hawaii argument unless one of the recognized exceptions applies.
hawaii relies primarily on the supreme court opinion in eastern enterprises apfel,d to argue that our decision in chevron i was clearly erroneous and will work a manifest injustice.in eastern enterprises,the supreme court holds that the coal industry retiree health benefit act the coal act,which requires coal operators to fund health benefits for retired employees and their dependents,is unconstitutional.at.plurality opinion.an operator challenges the law on both due process and takings grounds.id.at.four justices conclude that the coal act violates the takings clause because it imposes severe,unanticipated retroactive liability on the operator and do not proceed to address the operator due process claim.id.at,joined by rehnquist,scalia thomas,jj.justice kennedy concurs in the plurality judgment but disagrees with the court analysis he concludes that the coal act violates the due process clause,not the takings clause.id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment,dissenting in part.the four remaining justices dissent,concluding that the act violates neither the takings clause nor the due process clause.id.at.stevens,dissenting,joined by souter,ginsberg breyer,jj.breyer,dissenting,joined by,stevens,souter ginsberg,jj.
as an initial matter,eastern enterprises does not involve the type of regulatory takings claim at issue here.the supreme court applies the test set forth in penn central transportation city of new york,d,which focuses on the economic impact of a challenged law,not the substantially advances test.eastern enterprises,at.furthermore,the disagreement between the plurality and the other five justices over whether the challenge to the coal act is properly viewed as a due process or takings claim focuses on the following limited question,inapplicable to this case whether a regulatory takings claim requires that the challenged regulation affect a specific property right or interest.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment,dissenting in part observing that the takings clause is inappropriate because the coal act does not operate upon or alter an identified property interest,and it is not applicable to or measured by a property interest.the plurality endorses a more expansive view encompassing government regulations,like the coal act,that result in a considerable financial burden,at.the other five justices would limit the regulatory takings doctrine to laws affecting a protected property interest.id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment,dissenting in part breyer,dissenting.
largely ignoring this issue,hawaii relies in part on the following statement in justice kennedy opinion to support its argument that a majority of the supreme court has repudiated substantially advances takings claims 
the imprecision of our regulatory takings doctrine does open the door to normative considerations about the wisdom of government decisions.see,agins city of tiburon cite omitted zoning constitutes a taking if it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests.this sort of analysis is in uneasy tension with our basic understanding of the takings clause,which has not been understood to be a substantive or absolute limit on the government power to act.
at.justice kennedy statement is in the context of a dispute over the proper scope of the regulatory takings doctrine.indeed,it is immediately preceded by the following if the plurality is adopting its novel and expansive concept of a taking in order to avoid making a normative judgment about the coal act,it fails in the attempt for it must make the normative judgment in all events.id.citations omitted.justice kennedy is merely highlighting the already expansive and inconsistent nature of the court precedent.see id.at.neither justice kennedy nor any of the other justices expresses the opinion that takings claims based on the substantially advances theory are no longer valid.
the varying opinions in eastern enterprises suggest confusion over the relationship between due process and takings claims.they do not require us to abandon our holding in chevron i,let alone render it clearly erroneous.see,of bituminous contractors,apfel,concluding that the inability of a majority of the court to agree on a single rationale for the result renders eastern enterprises of no precedential value outside of the specific facts of that case 
supreme court opinions filed after eastern enterprises do not stand as a repudiation of regulatory takings claims based on the substantially advances theory.see preservation council,tahoe regional planning agency,d city of monterey del monte dunes,d.in del monte dunes,the supreme court upholds a jury verdict against the city of monterey on a regulatory takings claim that includes the theory that the city repeated rejection of a development plan does not substantially advance a legitimate government interest.at.the court granted certiorari to address the question whether the court of appeals impermissibly based its decision on a standard that allowed the jury to reweigh the reasonableness of the city land use decision.id.at.although the court does not directly address the propriety of the substantially advances test because the city failed to object to its inclusion in the court jury instructions,id.at.scalia,concurring,the opinion of the court states that the trial court instructions are consistent with our previous general discussions of regulatory takings liability.id.emphasis added.in preservation council,the court addresses a regulatory takings claim brought by an association of landowners based on a planning agency temporary moratorium on development.the court limits its review to the theory argued by the association in the court of appeals but notes that c onsiderations of fairness and justice could support a regulatory taking under several theories,including that the moratoria did not substantially advance a legitimate state interest.at.emphasis added.although dicta,the statement clearly indicates that substantially advances claims remain viable under the takings clause.
our opinions are consistent with supreme court teaching.the takings clause supercedes any substantive due process challenges when a law is challenged as a regulatory taking.see armendariz penman,cir see also esplanade,llc city of seattle,cir rejecting a claim that eastern enterprises overruled armendariz weinberg whatcom county,cir applying armendariz buckles king county,cir same.we recently applied the substantially advances test to a regulatory takings claim in hotel motel association of oakland,et city of oakland,cir,asking whether city maintenance and habitability requirements substantially advance a legitimate government interest.
hawaii cites no case chevron i that brings our use of the takings clause in that case into doubt.see rainbow magazine,at.to the contrary,subsequent opinions of the supreme court and this circuit support chevron see,council,at.esplanade properties,llc,at.
hawaii reliance on brown legal foundation of washington,d,which affirms washington legal foundation legal foundation of washington,cir en banc,is misplaced.brown involves,inter alia,the question whether a law requiring lawyers client funds to be deposited into an interest bearing trust account is properly analyzed as a regulatory or per se taking.at see also washington legal foundation,at.the supreme court has no reason to address regulatory takings based on a substantially advances theory or the question whether such claims should be brought under the takings clause or the due process clause.
the law of the case doctrine now bars hawaii argument that chevron challenge properly lies under the due process clause.we previously addressed hawaii argument in chevron i and none of the exceptions to the doctrine are available to hawaii.
chevron i bars hawaii argument that act should be reviewed under a more deferential standard 
hawaii next argues that we erred in chevron i by concluding that a given regulation substantially advances a legitimate state interest if it bears a reasonable relationship to that interest and by instructing that chevron can establish the lack of such a relationship by showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the regulation will not in fact accomplish its stated purpose.hawaii maintains that even if chevron challenge to act is viewed as a claim under the takings clause,the more deferential,rational basis test applied in due process cases is,whether hawaii rationally could have believed that act could have substantially advanced a legitimate government purpose.we explicitly rejected these arguments as part of hawaii prior appeal,at hawaii has not justified departing from the law of the case.
in chevron i we hold that the substantially advances test requires a reasonable relationship between a legitimate public purpose and the means used to effectuate that purpose.id.at citing and quoting from del monte dunes,at.our adoption of the reasonable relationship,as well as the preponderance of the evidence standard,is based on the jury instructions the supreme court approves in del monte dunes.at quoting instructions.this reasonable relationship test calls for an intermediate level of review,more stringent than the rational basis test used in the due process context,see id.at distinguishing physical takings cases,which use a test drawn from due process,but less stringent than the rough proportionality test used in the context of exactions under the takings clause.id.at citing del monte dunes,at.as limiting the rough proportionality test to exaction context but commenting positively on jury instruction using reasonable relationship language see also dolan city of tigard,d stating that the reasonable relationship test represents an intermediate level of scrutiny.hawaii argument that our decision in chevron i is clearly erroneous is without merit.
the supreme court specifically rejects the standard proposed by hawaii.nollan california coastal comm n,d.nollan is an exactions case in which the court states that w e have required that the regulation substantially advance the legitimate state interest sought to be achieved citing agins,not that the state could rationally have decided that the measure adopted might achieve the state objective.at.internal quotations omitted.in yee city of escondido,the supreme court suggests that this intermediate analysis is applicable to challenges involving rent control ordinances,like hawaii,that permit the capture of a premium,d.although the court in yee does not reach the regulatory takings issue because it is not properly presented for review,the court does state that the possibility of a premium,might have some bearing on whether the ordinance causes a regulatory taking because it may shed light on whether there is a sufficient nexus between the desired ends and the means employed.id.citing nollan.relying on this language,we hold in richardson city and county of honolulu that land use regulations,including rent control ordinances that permit the capture of a premium,do not effect a regulatory taking if they substantially further a legitimate state interest.at citing and quoting from yee.
we explain in chevron i that hawaii reliance on hawaii housing authority midkiff,d and keystone bituminous coal ass de benedictis,d,as support for using the more deferential rational basis review,is misplaced.the supreme court reviews the challenged actions in those cases more deferentially because they involve physical takings.chevron i,at observing that in the case of a physical taking the government intends to take the property and is willing to pay compensation citing richardson,at.hawaii presents no compelling reasons to rely on those opinions now.moreover,hawaii misses the fact that we incorporate this more deferential approach in the regulatory takings context when we review the state legitimate purpose the higher scrutiny is reserved for the fit.
hawaii argument that we apply a more deferential standard in commercial builders of northern california city of sacramento,cir,is also misplaced.in commercial builders,we apply the intermediate rational relationship test.id.at.our holding that a regulatory taking does not exist is based on evidence that the ordinance was implemented only after a detailed study revealed a substantial connection between development and the problem to be addressed.id.at emphasis added id.at beezer,dissenting sacramento has commissioned a study that demonstrates at best a tenuous and theoretical connection between commercial development and housing needs.plaintiffs in commercial builders were unable to rebut the conclusion that commercial development is related to an increase in the need for housing.id.at.in contrast,we held chevron claim fit for trial because the plaintiff on summary judgment adduced some evidence rebutting the state evidence and conclusions.the question now is whether that evidence is sufficient to justify the trial court judgment in this case.hawaii fails to establish that our application of the reasonable relationship test or the preponderance of the evidence standard constitutes clear error.
hawaii also fails to point to any intervening authority that prohibits chevron i use of the reasonable relationship test or preponderance of the evidence standard.the law of the case doctrine bars hawaii arguments 
hawaii argues that even if the district court applied the correct legal standard,it erred in concluding that act does not in fact substantially advance a legitimate state interest.the district court on remand heard testimony from john umbeck,on behalf of chevron,and keith leffler,on behalf of hawaii.based on their testimony,the court made the following relevant findings of fact oil companies will raise wholesale prices to offset any decrease in rent imposed by act,thereby causing an increase in retail prices,chevron usa,d at a preponderance of the evidence establishes that act will enable to sell their leaseholds at a premium,id.at instead of decreasing retail gasoline prices by maintaining the presence of in the market,act will increase gasoline prices by reducing the number of,id.at.based on these findings,the district court concluded that act does not substantially advance a legitimate state interest.id.at.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.stratosphere litigation llc grand casinos,cir.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.id.
hawaii does not challenge the district court conclusion of law that act fails to advance hawaii goal of lowering retail gas prices,see chevron usa,d at,it focuses instead on whether act advances another purported,maintaining the existence of an independent body of gas station operators by preventing oil companies from raising rents to levels that would drive out of business.the contention that hawaii passed act to promote the viability of for their own sake without regard to retail prices is inconsistent with the express views of the hawaii legislature in enacting act.the act legislative findings and declarations state that 
because hawaii is physically small and a geographically remote economy,certain of its markets tend to be concentrated in a highly competitive market,market prices tend to rise above competitive levels.market prices persistently above competitive levels are harmful to consumers and the public.
emphasis added.act failed to include a similar statement of legislative intent expressing a concern for.hawaii current argument is also inconsistent with its position throughout this litigation and the testimony of its expert.the district court found that while the legislature was mindful of the need to protect lessee dealers,this consideration was essentially a step toward the ultimate goal of reducing gasoline prices for hawaii consumers.chevron usa,d at.we accepted this characterization in chevron i when we stated that the district court found the purpose of act is to reduc e gasoline prices for hawaii consumers and that o n appeal,the parties do not contest this finding.at emphasis added.our prior opinion observes that whether act substantially advances its purpose certainly depends on whether it will in fact lead to lower prices.id.at.hawaii expert,keith leffler,himself acknowledged the legislative connection between protecting and the ultimate goal of lowering retail prices in his testimony before the district court the lease rent cap imposed by act is likely to lessen the adverse competitive effects that result from the highly concentrated gasoline markets in hawaii by maintaining the viability of independent dealers and thereby benefit consumers by reducing gasoline prices below what they would be otherwise.the district court properly viewed hawaii concern over maintaining a network of independent as a means to reducing retail gas prices,not an end in itself.
the district court analyzed the efficacy of maintaining independent in the context of hawaii purpose for enacting the act and found that act did not substantially advance hawaii interest in lower retail gas prices.relying on the declaration and trial testimony of leffler,the court found that act actually penalizes oil companies for maintaining stations,stating that in the long term there will ultimately be fewer stations than there would be without act as oil companies decide where and what type of distribution avenues in which to invest.chevron usa,d at.
although the court observed that act does preclude oil companies from raising rents to levels designed to drive out of business,id.at,it found that there is no evidence that,but for act,chevron or any other oil company would try to drive its out of business in hawaii by charging excessive rent.id.citing the trial testimony of leffler that at the time act went into effect,chevron charged relatively low rental prices.hawaii maintains that this statement indicates that the district court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the legislature on the question whether the legislature goal in enacting act was legitimate.hawaii is correct that the substantially advances test reserves its heightened scrutiny for the state purported means,not its goal.clearly,the preservation of was not the legislature ultimate goal.the court scrutiny was appropriate.
based on the testimony of the parties experts,the district court also made findings with respect to two factual questions we directed be resolved on effect of act on wholesale prices and the possibility that will capture a premium.chevron i,at.the district court found that the oil companies will offset the impact of act in part by increasing wholesale prices,which in turn will cause an increase in retail prices.chevron usa,d at.on this point,the court was persuaded by the testimony of umbeck who testified that oil company pricing involves a search for the optimal balance between various revenue streams a reduction in rental income,therefore,would necessarily effect how chevron sets its wholesale prices.id.the district court discounted the contrary opinion of leffler that act would not cause chevron to increase wholesale prices because prices were already maximized.id.
regarding premiums,the court found that chevron established by a preponderance of the evidence that the reduced rent mandated by the act will not flow to consumers in the form of reduced retail prices but instead will allow to capture a premium on their leaseholds.id.at.the parties stipulated that all other factors remaining constant,act would likely cause the market value of leaseholds to increase.at trial,moreover,the parties experts agreed that the alone would realize any such increase it would not be passed on to consumers in the form of lower retail prices.because the court credited umbeck testimony that chevron increase in wholesale prices as a result of act would only partially offset the decrease in its rental income,the court concluded that the remaining amount will inure to as a premium on the value of their leaseholds.id.at.in so finding,the court adopted umbeck view of the relevant economic market over the view of leffler.id.
based on all the evidence adduced at trial,the district court concluded that act will not substantially advance a reduction in the retail price of gasoline.the court factual findings and conclusions of law are consistent with the views of the parties experts and are not clearly erroneous.
it is argued that our application of the substantially advances test to the facts of this case improperly interprets the supreme court decision in yee city of escondido,d.the argument maintains that even assuming yee permits application of the substantially advances test to a rent control ordinance where there is only the possibility of a premium,as this court did in richardson and chevron i the test is inapplicable here where the testimony is that in all likelihood,a premium will not exist 
the argument relies on excerpts from the following colloquy between the court and chevron expert,umbert,as support for the proposition that there is probably no premium created by act 
the witness chevron would try to raise the wholesale price to recoup as much of the lost rent as they could a t the stations where they raise the price those stations will have a reduction in volume of gasoline they sell if the dealer raises his retail prices 
the court then,if the offset is not total,might consumers in deed sic benefit from act because,if the increase in the wholesale price is less than the decrease in rent,then the lessee dealer overall cost would go down.
the witness no,no.the dealers overall revenues are going to fall because he going to be selling gasoline e ven if the oil company does recover all of the rent reduction,that does not mean the dealer is going to benefit because the whole revenue stream is smaller.in fact,in all likelihood both the dealer would lose and the oil company would lose.
the reduction in rent by suppose the oil companies do not raise their dtw for a second and they just lower rent to the dealer.there is no reason in our economic theory to believe that the retail prices would fall.that is,the dealer would just pocket the difference.
the court why is that 
the witness it actually an opinion shared by leffler and myself and all economics text books.and that is that a fixed commitment to pay dollars each month in the form of rent does not affect the decision on how much gasoline to sell or what price to charge at the retail pump.but,when wholesale price goes up,then the incentive for the dealer to reduce his volume in order to save some of these variable costs will lead him to raise prices.
the opinion shared by the experts was not that will fail to benefit as a result of act rather,umbreck was explaining the belief that,all things remaining equal,any reduction in rental fixed costs realized by the dealers would not be passed on to consumers in the form of reduced retail prices.hawaii counsel made this clear during closing argument when he did not deny that may capture a premium while it is true that incumbent dealers could try to charge a premium and a prospective purchaser could agree to pay that premium,we do not believe that it will have any impact on the retail price of gasoline simply because the rent gap permits to stay in business longer,increasing competition and lowering prices.
furthermore,umbreck testimony that in all likelihood will not benefit under act was based on an uncertain assumption about market behavior.specifically,that chevron increase in wholesale prices and the resulting drop in sales would combine for a loss to that is greater than the benefit realized by the reduced rent.neither expert testified that this would necessarily occur.indeed,in its opinion,the district court stated that i mplicit in umbreck opinion that chevron would raise wholesale gasoline prices is the assumption that chevron will risk a drop in sales volume in the hope that it will be outweighed by the increase in wholesale price.chevron,d at.that same uncertainty about market reaction accounts for the possibility that will retain a benefit from the reduced rent,a premium.
at issue in this case is the constitutionality of act,which controls the rent an oil company can charge its.there are two different constitutional tests that could conceivably apply to act.the first is the reasonablene
