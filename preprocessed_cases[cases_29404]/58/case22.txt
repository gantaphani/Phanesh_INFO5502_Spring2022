as explained more fully below,we affirm the district court dismissal of mangino first amendment retaliation claim,as the criminal summonses on which it is premised were supported by probable cause,the issuance of the fire prevention violation order on which it is premised was otherwise justified,and mangino has not made any argument that the issuance of the fire prevention violation order was significantly more serious than other action poulos had discretion to take affirm the district court dismissal of mangino claim on grounds because,at the time of the alleged conduct,although there was a clearly established right to be free from abuse of process under new york law,there was no clearly established right to be free from abuse of process where probable cause existed and affirm the district court denial of mangino motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial because it is clear that,when read in context,the district court jury instructions were not erroneous.
