background 
in august of,communities entered into a purchase agreement for both diablo mobile lodge and adobe mobile lodge for and,respectively.pursuant to the terms of the agreement,communities made a down payment of and obtained a option to close escrow on both parks.communities down payment was refundable only if the parks operating expenses were not as had been represented by the seller.at the time the agreement was entered into,the city had not enacted a mobilehome park rent control ordinance.
in november,communities noticed a per month per space rent increase at adobe and a per space increase at diablo.on january,before the notice periods for the increases were complete,the city council adopted a moratorium on all mobilehome space rent increases.communities closed escrow on the purchase of the parks in august.on october,while the rent freeze was still in effect,the city enacted mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance ordinance,codified as concord municipal code section et,providing for permanent rent regulation.
pursuant to the ordinance,rents at adobe and diablo were forced to reflect the rate charged on january.concord,subd.the ordinance provided for a general annual adjustment gaa of rents once per year at a rate of percent of the consumer price index cpi for the year.however,the ordinance required a park owner to obtain approval of the board to obtain a s pecial r ent i ncrease in excess of the percent of cpi adjustment.furthermore,the ordinance operates under the presumption that the park owner net operating income noi in the unregulated market of the base year provided it with a fair and reasonable return.the ordinance also establishes a base rent adjustment mechanism under which the presumption that the base year noi provided a fair and reasonable return may be rebutted.under section,subdivision c,the presumption of a fair and reasonable return based on the base year noi may be rebutted if t he rents charged by the park owner in the base year were significantly below the rents for mobilehome spaces in the city with comparable amenities,because of unique or extraordinary circumstances.
in the adobe park earned less in gross income than the sum of its operating expenses and debt service,while the diablo park lost more than.in april of,communities noticed a special rent increase at the adobe park of per month per space,and an increase of at the diablo park.at the same time,communities filed petitions with the city pursuant to the ordinance in order to have the increases approved.concord.the board granted a per space maintenance of net operating income mnoi rent increase at the adobe park and a per space mnoi rent increase to diablo as contemplated under the ordinance gaa of percent of cpi increase.communities appealed the board decisions and the city council affirmed the board decisions.
on may,communities filed a petition on behalf of each park for a writ of administrative mandate with the contra costa county superior court challenging the city decisions.the superior court granted the writs and remanded communities petitions for a special rent increase back to the board based on its finding that the board improperly failed to consider and make findings regarding petitioner evidence and argument that challenged the validity of base year rents as a measure of a fair and reasonable return.
at the remand hearing the board heard evidence pertaining to whether the base rents at adobe and diablo should be adjusted.both the city mobilehome park appraisal expert,james brabant,as well as communities expert appraiser,gerald taylor,opined that the parks purchase prices were reasonable and consistent with market indicators and that base rents at adobe and diablo were below the base rents of comparable parks.according to brabant,the average space rent at the adobe park in was,and the average rent at the diablo park was.brabant concluded that the space rents for both adobe and diablo in the base year were per month lower than those in the city parks with comparable amenities.furthermore,brabant stated that the adobe and diablo base year rents were at least to percent lower than comparable rents in the area and that this was a significant amount.taylor also found the difference between the adobe and diablo parks base rents from the rents of parks with comparable amenities to be significant.taylor was of the opinion that the market value of the space rent at adobe park in was,which was to more than the rate adobe was charging tenants at the time.taylor also stated that the market value of the space rent at the diablo park in was,which exceeded the amount tenants were actually charged during that year by between and.both brabant and taylor opined that the adobe and diablo parks were most comparable to town and country mobilehome park,which was also owned by communities.in,town and country average space rents were,and the high end of the range of rents being charged was.
brabant stated that as per a market rate study he conducted,which incorporated data and inspections of all the city parks,the most recent space rent increase had been effective may.the adjustment made at that time totaled percent plus per month which had been a negotiated adjustment to bring the rents closer to a market level.communities principal,richard hall,testified that base rents in were significantly below market because the previous owner,thompson,built the parks and was free and clear of debt from as early as,had taxes and did want any government involvement.joe mitchell,a tenant at the adobe park,testified that thompson had told him he was real satisfied with the rents he was charging and that why he did increase it.furthermore,hall stated that in his opinion the market rent in for adobe was per space while diablo was per space.
the board found that the space rents in the base year at adobe and diablo were not significantly below the rents for mobilehome parks in the city with comparable amenities.the board also determined that communities failed to establish that its lower rents were due to any unique or extraordinary circumstances.therefore the board denied communities requests for base rent increases.communities appealed to the city council,which affirmed the board decisions.communities then filed a second petition for writ of administrative mandamus for each park.
the superior court entered judgments denying communities writ petitions.it held that there was no substantial evidence in the record to support the board finding that rents at adobe and diablo were not significantly below the rents for mobilehome space in the city parks with comparable amenities.however,the superior court also found that despite the fact that the prior owner owned the land free and clear of debt and raised rents according to his own personal criteria rather than based on market prices,communities had failed to show that the low rents were caused by unique or extraordinary circumstances.furthermore,the superior court held that the words unique or extraordinary within the ordinance call for a totally subjective determination by the board.
discussion 
standard of review 
we commence our analysis with a statement of the appropriate standard of review since the parties disagree as to what standard of review governs their dispute.on appeal from a writ of administrative mandamus an appellate court must determine whether the decision of an administrative agency will substantially affect vested,fundamental rights.bixby pierno cal d.when the administrative decision neither involves nor substantially affects such a right,the trial court must review the whole administrative record to determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the agency committed any errors of law.id.at.
i f a rent control commission renders a decision denying a just and reasonable return on property,the decision involves an unconstitutional deprivation of a property right.san marcos mobilehome park owners city of san marcos d.however,the possible constitutional invalidity of the administrative decision does not mean that every time a rent control board evaluates a particular proposed rent increase,it is deciding an owner fundamental rights,italics omitted.when determining what rights are fundamental for administrative review purposes,the court must determine if the right fundamentally affects the life situation of the individual to require independent review or whether it merely impacts an area of economic privilege in a less than fundamental manner.see berlinghieri department of motor vehicles cal d.
in analyzing the fundamental nature of the right asserted,the court manifest s slighter sensitivity to the preservation of purely economic privileges bixby pierno,supra,cal d at.the requested rent increases fall into the less sensitive category of the preservation of purely economic privileges that do not substantially and fundamentally impact the individual.san marcos mobilehome park owners city of san marcos,supra,d at.a substantial evidence standard is proper when reviewing the decision of a rent control board because the owner proposed rent increases do not involve an administrative decision which substantially affects fundamental rights.ibid.merely deciding that the standard is substantial evidence,however,is not sufficient to end the inquiry,because a pplication of the test inherently requires that the reviewing court first determine the question,substantial evidence of what westwinds mobile home park mobilehome park rental review bd.th,d,quoting yee mobilehome park rental review bd.th,d.
therefore,the issue presented is whether the board decisions not to adjust communities base year rent at the adobe and diablo parks was supported by substantial evidence that could give rise to the conclusion that communities was receiving a fair rate of return on its equity investment.
ii.base year rents were significantly below market value 
city contends that there was substantial evidence that the parks base year rents were not significantly below comparable rents.this contention lacks merit.
price controls on rent are within the city police power if they are reasonably calculated both to eliminate excessive rents and to provide the owner with a just and reasonable return on its property.birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d.the critical questions are not whether the base date rents establish a fair and reasonable return and whether the base date rents are within a range of rents which can be charged.rather the question is whether the base date rents can reasonably be deemed to reflect general market conditions.vega city of west hollywood d.after base date rents are established which reflect general market conditions,the rents which are then established must provide the landlord with the requisite just and reasonable return.ibid.a property owner must be permitted,pursuant to the principles discussed in birkenfeld,to start rent calculations with a base date rent similar to other comparable properties.id.at.
t o be just and reasonable a rate of return must be high enough to encourage good management including adequate maintenance of services,to furnish a reward for efficiency,to discourage the flight of capital from the rental housing market,and to enable operators to maintain and support their credit.oceanside mobilehome park owners city of oceanside d.a just and reasonable return is one which is generally commensurate with returns on investments in other enterprises having corresponding risks.on the other hand,it is also one which is not so high as to defeat the purposes of rent control and excessive rents.ibid.a lthough a fixed profit amount may produce a reasonable or fair return on investment for investments such as bonds,an investment in rental units contemplates a higher risk and hence,in times of high inflation and when viewed in the long term,demands more than mere maintenance of an existing profit amount.fisher city of berkeley cal d.however,s ome lessening of appreciation is a necessary consequence of any rent control,since future appreciation is to a significant extent a function of increased rental income.cotati alliance for better housing city of cotati d.the fact that the value of the property is reduced does not mean that the regulation is invalid.central transp.new york city,d diminution in property value,standing alone,can not establish a taking.
the superior court correctly held that the board determination that the base rents at diablo and adobe were not significantly low was not supported by substantial evidence.in fact,there is no evidence in the proceedings before the board from which it could have concluded that the base rents at the two parks were anything but significantly below market value.both the city expert as well as communities effectively stated that the base rents at diablo and adobe were at least to percent below rents for mobilehome spaces with comparable amenities and both concluded that this percentage was significant.as the superior court stated,t here is no conflicting evidence in the record.communities correctly points out that none of the board members were technically qualified to dispute the conclusions of the city and communities expert appraisers.
in whispering pines mobile home park,city of scotts valley d,the only evidence before the rent control commission as to what constituted a fair rate of return was the testimony of an expert who compared the expected return on a mobilehome park to that expected on utility stocks and concluded that percent was the absolute minimum rate of return which was fair or adequate for investment in such a park.the commission and the trial court disregarded the expert on the basis of the experience and knowledge of members of the commission in local real estate matters.id.at.thereafter,the appellate court granted the landowners writ of mandate id.at and held that it was a matter of expert opinion what rate of return on a mobilehome park is fair.id.at.similarly,the city board ignored the testimony of both experts and failed to recognize any authority upon which their conclusions were based.thus,the board determination as to the threshold of significantly below fair market rates could only have been premised upon personal experience and knowledge of real estate.
similarly,in yee mobilehome park rental review,supra,th at pages,d,the court held that the board award of a base year rent increase that resulted in a percent return on investment was not substantively supported because there was no evidence that like investments involving similar risks,with similar capital appreciation and tax benefits to the owners produced similar returns.thus,there was no evidence that a percent return on investment was a fair return.by the same token,there was no evidence that even after the gaa adjustment,communities percent return at the adobe park or its percent return at the diablo park was a fair return on its investment.
