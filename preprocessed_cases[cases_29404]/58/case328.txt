in the summer of,a jewish organization received vague threats of violence against its members.on august,a appeared at the organization summer camp and,armed with a gun,opened fire,wounding at least one child.in this action,the child and his family seek to hold the organization liable for allegedly failing to provide adequate security measures.
the trial court dismissed the action on demurrer,concluding that the organization did not have a duty to prevent such a crime.we affirm because the violent criminal assault was not reasonably foreseeable,and imposing liability based on vague threats of violence,absent prior armed assaults or other incidents of a similar nature,would impose an unfair burden on the organization.
background 
after two successful demurrers,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.for purposes of our review,we must accept as true the following allegations.see blank kirwan cal d.
in june,eleanor and charles kadish the kadishes enrolled their sons,benjamin age and joshua age,in a summer camp,camp valley chai,run by the jewish community centers of greater los angeles jcc.the jcc operated several centers in the los angeles area.the kadishes children were to be dropped off at the west valley center and bused to the north valley center in granada hills,where the camp is located.the kadishes entrusted the jcc with the custody and safekeeping of their children.
camp valley chai,as described in the camp brochure,is where the children play.the camp offered three programs,each for a different age group.the brochure described the aleph program,for children entering kindergarten and the first grade,as follows activities are evenly paced to provide an program that is exciting but not.with a ratio of one staff to six campers,children will receive close attention and direction.campers will also participate in events.activities are specifically geared to the interests and abilities of this age group,which include singing,arts crafts,judaica,games,drama,swimming,and more.campers also participate in specialty days that combine fun and imagination with learning about american and jewish life.
according to the brochure,the bet program,for children entering the second through the fifth grades,included sports,dancing,arts crafts,swimming,singing,cooking,field trips,and judaic programming.with a ratio of one staff to six campers,children engage in events,as well as events.bet campers have the opportunity to attend a overnight.
the gimmel program,for children entering the sixth through the eighth grades,provided an summer filled with new experiences,field trips,and more each session will include a overnight,swimming,trips to the beach,amusement parks,and other cool places.special camp events and projects encourage a connection to jewish culture,themes,and values.
the brochure stated that a t camp valley chai,our goal is to find and expose the personal talents within each and every camper.our staff strives to create an atmosphere of fun,friendship,sharing,group and individual achievement.according to the brochure,campers would enjoy a safe camping experience set in a secure environment at the camp expansive camp site.
but,during the summer of,all was not safe and secure for jewish organizations.attacks at synagogues and jewish community centers in the united states were planned and carried out.jewish organizations across the country referred to the summer of as the summer of hate.the league sent notices to jewish groups throughout the nation advising them to increase security.the west coast office of the league notified jewish organizations that there was a strong potential of violence against their members.
from june to august,the west valley center and the north valley center received anonymous telephone calls threatening their members with physical violence.the north valley center,located one block from an exit off the freeway,had a large sign identifying it as a jewish facility.the center had no locks on the entry door,no security guards,and no emergency evacuation plan,notwithstanding that the jcc had implemented those precautions at other locations.dating back to at least,the league and groups within the jcc had recommended that the north valley center adopt security measures.
beginning in early,buford furrow,an individual with publicly avowed views,began traveling and observing jewish facilities in southern california with the purpose of shooting and killing jews.on the evening of august,furrow sat outside the north valley center watching people come and go.no one asked him why he was there.he chose the north valley center as the site for his war on jews because it,unlike other jcc facilities,had no security precautions.on august,furrow entered the north valley center and shot benjamin.his brother,joshua,was not shot but perceived benjamin shooting.
on april,the kadishes filed this action on behalf of themselves and their children,naming as defendants the jcc,the north valley center,and the west valley center collectively jcc.benjamin asserted a cause of action for negligence,alleging that a lack of security measures allowed furrow to shoot him.joshua brought a cause of action for negligence,alleging that he had been in the line of fire and had perceived the assault on his brother.the kadishes alleged a cause of action for negligence based on the emotional distress they suffered as a result of the injury to their children.they also alleged a cause of action for breach of contract,claiming that the jcc failed to provide a safe and secure camping environment.
the jcc demurred to the complaint,contending that it did not have a duty to protect campers from violent criminal assaults.plaintiffs filed opposition.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.a first amended complaint was filed,much like the original.another demurrer was filed,opposed,and sustained with leave to amend.plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,which was also challenged by demurrer.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.on may,the trial court entered an order dismissing the case.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer that was sustained,we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts that are properly pleaded and determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.blank kirwan,supra,cal d at,accord,zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.in the construction of a pleading,for the purpose of determining its effect,its allegations must be liberally construed,with a view to substantial justice between the parties.code civ.

more than three decades ago,in rowland christian cal d,rowland,our supreme court stated that the determination of whether a property owner is liable for injuries to persons on the property involves the balancing of a number of considerations the major ones are the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendants conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendants conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved

in mark pacific gas electric cal d,the light from a street lamp post was so bright it disturbed the sleep of nearby residents,and they complained to the utility company,pge.notwithstanding efforts by pge to reduce the glare,the light continued to cause problems.eventually,the residents resorted to and unscrewed the light bulb.pge sent an employee who screwed the bulb back in place.each time this was done,the residents unscrewed the bulb.thus,pge knew that someone was tampering with the light.on one occasion,a resident attempted to remove the bulb,touched an uninsulated wire,and was electrocuted.in a suit for wrongful death,the trial court granted a nonsuit for pge.
the supreme court reversed,applying the rowland factors.see mark pacific gas electric,supra,cal d at fns.the court stated that harm to decedent was certainly foreseeable,given pg e knowledge of tampering with high voltage wiring,and a clear causal relationship existed between the accident and pg e asserted negligence in failing to warn of or repair the hazard.although pg e may have been morally without blame,imposition of liability would enhance the policy of preventing future accidents.finally,imposition of liability does not seem unduly burdensome to pg e considering the probable availability of insurance covering accidents of this nature which are not likely to recur with great frequency.id.at,fn.
the rowland factors were later applied in peterson san francisco community college dist.cal d.there,a student was assaulted as she went up a stairway in the school parking lot.an unidentified man jumped from behind thick and untrimmed foliage and trees and attempted to rape her.she escaped but sustained physical and emotional injuries.the school district knew that other assaults of a similar nature had occurred in the area but did not publicize the prior incidents or warn the student that she was in danger of being attacked.the student sued the school district and its agents.the trial court dismissed the action on demurrer.
the supreme court reversed,stating an examination of the policies discussed in rowland,supra,cal d,and other cases compels the conclusion that the defendants did in fact owe the plaintiff a duty of care.first,the allegations,if proved,suggest that harm to the plaintiff was clearly foreseeable.in light of the alleged prior similar incidents in the same area,the defendants were on notice that any woman who might use the stairs or the parking lot would be a potential target.secondly,it is undisputed that plaintiff suffered injury.third,given that the defendants were in control of the premises and that they were aware of the prior assaults,it is clear that failure to apprise students of those incidents,to trim the foliage,or to take other protective measures closely connects the defendants conduct with plaintiffs injury.these factors,if established,also indicate that there is moral blame attached to the defendants failure to take steps to avert the foreseeable harm.imposing a duty under these circumstances also furthers the policy of preventing future harm.finally,the duty here does not place an intolerable burden on the defendants.peterson san francisco community college,supra,cal d at.
in lopez mcdonald d.mcdonald,a restaurant had been the site of several crimes,including robbery,petty theft,vandalism,and grand theft.crime statistics showed that numerous assaults and batteries had been committed in the surrounding area.the crime problem was so serious that a private security company contacted mcdonald corporate office,recommending that security guards be hired.a mcdonald official declined,saying,we do want to spend any money.there is no problem,we do need it anyways.id.at.a nearby jack in the box employed security guards.
two months after mcdonald decided not to hire security guards,an individual armed with a semiautomatic rifle,a semiautomatic pistol,and a shotgun entered the restaurant and immediately opened fire,killing people and wounding others.in a suit brought by survivors and surviving family members of the victims,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of mcdonald.
the court of appeal affirmed on the ground that the rowland factors and specifically the unforeseeability of the unique,horrific event require negligence liability to be restricted here.first,as to the foreseeability of harm to plaintiffs,the and property crimes of the type shown by the history of its operations,or the general activity which had occurred in the vicinity bear no relationship to purposeful homicide or assassination t he likelihood of this unprecedented murderous assault was so remote and unexpected that,as a matter of law,the general character of mcdonald nonfeasance did not facilitate its happening 
plaintiffs reliance on the evidence of mostly crimes on and nearby the restaurant premises and the crime rate in the surrounding area,to show the event here was reasonably foreseeable,is misplaced t he predominantly character of the crimes is simply probative of the foreseeability of such crimes n ot only was the assailant crime not,but the narrow focus on slaughter and the assailant motive are unrelated to the areas general crime rate as a matter of law.
w ithin the context of the criminal conduct involved here,no moral blame attaches to mcdonald nonfeasance.further,although the policy of preventing future harm is great,the extent of the burden to mcdonald and the consequences to the community of imposing a duty to protect against murderers is onerous.mcdonald,supra,d at,fns.omitted see thai stang d.imposing a duty to protect against shootings would place an onerous burden on business owners no duty imposed parsons crown disposal cal th,fn,d,no duty of care imposed where duty would place onerous burden on defendant and others.
in ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,d,ann,the plaintiff was raped in a shopping center where she worked.she filed suit against the property owners,alleging that security guards should have been hired to patrol the premises.evidence showed that transients often loitered in the common areas,causing tenants and employees to be concerned about safety.the merchants association had requested that the property owners provide security patrols but none were provided.bank robberies and purse snatchings had occurred on the premises,but the property owners did not know about them.in the two years before the rape,violent crimes had occurred in the census tract in which the shopping center was located.
the property owners moved for summary judgment,contending they owed no duty to the plaintiff,primarily because the rape was unforeseeable.the trial court granted the motion.the supreme court,citing the rowland factors see ann,supra,cal th at fn,d,agreed,explaining 
california law requires landowners to maintain land in their possession and control in a reasonably safe condition in the case of a landlord,this general duty of maintenance,which is owed to tenants and patrons,has been held to include the duty to take reasonable steps to secure common areas against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties that are likely to occur in the absence of such precautionary measures 
a s frequently recognized,a duty to take affirmative action to control the wrongful acts of a third party will be imposed only where such conduct can be reasonably anticipated in this,as in other areas of tort law,foreseeability is a crucial factor in determining the existence of duty 
turning to the question of the scope of a landlords duty to provide protection from foreseeable third party crime,we have recognized that the scope of the duty is determined in part by balancing the foreseeability of the harm against the burden of the duty to be imposed i n cases where the burden of preventing future harm is great,a high degree of foreseeability may be required on the other hand,in cases where there are strong policy reasons for preventing the harm,or the harm can be prevented by simple means,a lesser degree of foreseeability may be required.or,as one appellate court has accurately explained,duty in such circumstances is determined by a balancing of foreseeability of the criminal acts against the burdensomeness,vagueness,and efficacy of the proposed security measures 
no one really knows why people commit crime,hence no one really knows what is adequate deterrence in any given situation a high degree of foreseeability is required in order to find that the scope of a landlord duty of care includes the hiring of security guards t he requisite degree of foreseeability rarely,if ever,can be proven in the absence of prior similar incidents of violent crime on the landowners premises.to hold otherwise would be to impose an unfair burden upon landlords and,in effect,would force landlords to become the insurers of public safety,contrary to policy in this state.ann,supra,cal th at,d,citations and fn.omitted.
the principles announced in ann were applied in sharon arman,cal th,d,sharon,disapproved on another point in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,footnote.in sharon,the plaintiff was sexually assaulted at gunpoint in a commercial parking garage located under an office building.no physical assaults or crimes had occurred in the garage during the years preceding the assault,although a bank on the ground floor had been robbed seven times in the two years before the assault.it was not unusual for lights in the garage to be out,causing areas to be dark.a security camera had not been working for several months.
the plaintiff sued the property owner and the company that managed the garage,alleging that the lack of security measures resulted in the assault.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.the supreme court concluded that there was no liability,stating 
t he record remains deficient in establishing the foreseeability of violent attacks such as the one against plaintiff.viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff,it shows that robbers repeatedly targeted a bank on the ground floor of the subject premises in the month period preceding the sexual assault.apart from those incidents,there is no evidence of other prior crimes against property or persons on the premises,either in the office building or in the underground parking garage.since sexual assault is not a reasonably foreseeable risk associated with bank robberies,the bank robberies did not portend the vicious assault committed upon plaintiff.
it is difficult to quarrel with the abstract proposition that the provision of improved lighting and maintenance,operational surveillance cameras and periodic of the tenant garage might have diminished the risk of criminal attacks occurring in the garage.but absent any prior similar incidents or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults in that location,we can not conclude defendants were required to secure the area against such crime.sharon,supra,cal th at,d,citation omitted.
rowland and its progeny have been cited or applied in several other cases.see,zelig county of los angeles,supra,cal th,d,county not liable where,in connection with spousal and child support proceedings,father shot mother to death in county courthouse saelzler advanced group cal th,d,landlord not liable for assault on plaintiff,who was delivering package to tenant,absent proof that lack of security was substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries kentucky fried chicken of,superior court cal th,d,proprietor of business has no duty to comply with armed robbers demand for money even if compliance would avoid increasing risk of harm to customers alcaraz vece cal th,d,owner of private residential property may be liable to tenant for dangerous condition on adjacent public property controlled by owner claxton atlantic richfield th,d nonsuit reversed where plaintiff was attacked at gas station by gang members who had previously assaulted other customers and robbed gas station manager foreseeability turns on prior similar incidents,not identical incidents eric betty th,d citing cases.
in determining whether the jcc had a duty to protect plaintiffs from harm,we balance two important and competing policy concerns society interest in compensating persons injured by another criminal acts,and its reluctance to impose unrealistic financial burdens on property owners conducting legitimate business enterprises on their premises.saelzler advanced group,supra,cal th at,d.
with the foregoing case law and policy concerns in mind,we now apply the rowland factors 
foreseeability 
in examining the critical element of foreseeability of harm,we must adhere to the rule that f oreseeability supports a duty only to the extent the foreseeability is reasonable in other words,a duty to take affirmative action to control the wrongful acts of a third party will be imposed only where such conduct can be reasonably anticipated basically,t he reasonableness standard is a test which determines if,in the opinion of a court,the degree of foreseeability is high enough to charge the defendant with the duty to act on it.juarez boy scouts of america,th,d juarez,citations omitted.
a lmost any result is foreseeable with the benefit of hindsight.for that reason,foreseeability is not coterminous with duty a court may find that no duty exists,despite foreseeability of harm,because of other rowland factors sakiyama amf bowling centers,th,citations omitted.
in the present case,there were no prior incidents at the north valley center that would make furrows shooting spree foreseeable.see sharon,supra,cal th at ann,supra,cal th at,d,mcdonald,supra,d at.that would end our inquiry,but for the threats of harm to jcc members.threats of criminal acts may make the acts foreseeable to the property owner,who may be able to take security measures to prevent the threatened harm,depending upon the contents of the threat,including its specificity.
thus,we must determine whether the shooting at the north valley center was foreseeable in light of the threats to jcc members.for that purpose,we examine the pertinent allegations of the complaint.more than years before the incident at the north valley center,jewish organizations,including individuals within the jcc and the anti defamation league,were aware of the threat of violence against members of jewish organizations and had recommended that the north valley center adopt security measures.nationwide,jewish organizations referred to the summer of as the summer of hate.in the two and months before furrows attack,the north valley center received anonymous telephone calls,threatening physical violence against its members.
we conclude that these vague threats were not sufficiently specific so as to require that security measures be adopted to prevent a maniac from shooting children at a summer camp.plaintiffs did not allege any specifics about the,what,when,where,or how.anonymous threats of such a vague nature do not provide an organization with guidance about what,when,and where precautions,if any,should be taken,nor against whom.and a bsolute safety is not an achievable goal.nola university of southern california th,d.
further,the threats made in this injure jcc not convey the kind or degree of the crime actually gunman attempted murder of children attending camp valley chai.some threats dated back two and months,and because they were of a general nature and had not been carried out,they could be reasonably deemed to be crank calls,empty threats,or threats not directed at the children.
there is no contention that,before the attack,furrow threatened to harm jcc members or children attending camp.it is not alleged that he made any of the anonymous telephone threats received within two and months of the attack.furrows armed assault took the north valley center completely by surprise.
a general concern about secur
