cornelia maddrey appeals from a superior court judge order,on a writ of certiorari,confirming a justice of the peace court order of possession to her landlord arbor management,compton town associates,lp compton.split authority in delaware courts over where common law writs of certiorari lie,and how those writs in justice of the peace court summary possession cases should be reviewed,prompts us to answer three important questions for practitioners.we note at the outset that the general assembly has provided in the delaware code for statutory writs of certiorari for the superior court to review the decisions of certain administrative agencies,such as the state fire prevention commission or a municipal board of adjustment this case addresses common law writs of certiorari and does not address those statutory writs of certiorari.
first,the superior court has original and exclusive jurisdiction among trial courts under the delaware constitution to issue common law writs of certiorari to inferior tribunals,including the justice of the peace court,in all cases,regardless of subject matter.second,the superior court scope of review on common law writs of certiorari issued to any inferior tribunal in any type of case,is limited to errors on the face of the record.in this case,the delaware general assembly clearly intended the justice of peace court to process landlord tenant summary possession cases quickly and summarily.the delaware code provides that a party aggrieved by an initial single judge judgment in a summary possession hearing may request a trial de novo before a three judge justice of the peace panel there the statutory process ends.while the common law writ of certiorari is available to correct errors on the face of the record,the general assembly intent would be frustrated by using that narrow review improperly to conduct the functional equivalent of traditional appellate review in superior court.third,the record reviewable by the superior court on a common law writ of certiorari consists only of the complaint initiating the proceeding,any written answer or response,and the docket entries.the justice of the peace court hearing transcripts are not properly part of the record to be forwarded to the superior court in response to the superior court issuance of a writ of certiorari.although the superior court judgment from which this appeal is taken does not address all the issues we consider in this opinion,we nonetheless affirm that judgment.
cornelia maddrey rented a unit from compton from march until november.in a march,letter,compton informed maddrey that it was terminating her rental agreement for cause.her grandson,who lived with her,and an accomplice were wanted in connection with a shooting near the rental complex,thus facially violating a provision of maddrey rental agreement.on april,compton filed a complaint for summary possession against maddrey in justice of the peace court number.the general assembly mandates exclusive jurisdiction in justice of the peace court for summary possession proceedings after a trial,the justice of the peace entered judgment against maddrey who then,as a matter of right,requested a trial de novo before a three judge justice of the peace panel pursuant to.a that panel,in turn,issued a judgment for possession for compton on october.the docket entry from the justice of the peace court summarizing that proceeding reads 
the three judge panel is satisfied that the plaintiff arbor management has proven by a preponderance of the evidence,their right to terminate the lease with defendant,maddrey and regain possession of the rental unit.therefore judgment is awarded in favor of the plaintiff arbor management and against defendant cornelia maddrey for posession sic and court costs.
the statutory framework for summary possession actions in the delaware code,title,chapter,provides for no further direct appeals as a consequence,maddrey,believing the justice of the peace court erred,filed a petition requesting that the superior court issue a writ of certiorari,an extraordinary common law writ directed to the justice of the peace court.
a superior court judge confirmed the justice of the peace court decision he held that the justice of the peace court finding that compton met its burden of proof was not appropriately reviewable in a certiorari proceeding,and that the justice of the peace court properly admitted the evidence proffered to it.the superior court judge also opined that the petition for the writ of certiorari should have been filed in the court of common pleas and not in superior court,but he addressed the petition nonetheless in the interest of judicial efficiency maddrey appeals from the superior court order,arguing that the superior court judge erroneously failed to conclude that the three judge justice of the peace panel erred,by applying an incorrect burden of proof in the action and improperly admitting material evidence that affected the outcome of the case.maddrey argues that these errors were errors of law properly reviewable by the superior court on a writ of certiorari.both parties to this appeal agree that the superior court has original and exclusive jurisdiction to issue the writ of certiorari and to review the justice of the peace summary possession record.
discussion 
trial court jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari 
the first issue we address is which trial courts have jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari directed to the justice of the peace court in summary possession cases.the superior court has issued inconsistent opinions on this issue.that inconsistency has caused much confusion in the bar over where to file petitions for writs of certiorari,both generally and in summary possession cases.chelsea on the square apts.justice of the peace court,suggests,without analysis or explanation,that the court of common pleas may issue a writ of certiorari to the justice of the peace court in summary possession cases however,in howell justice of the peace court,a different superior court judge concluded that superior court had jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari directed to the justice of the peace court in summary possession cases 
the superior court,as the descendent of both the supreme court and court of common pleas,has both original and exclusive trial court jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari directed to the justice of the peace courts.before,the supreme court and the court of common pleas were delaware trial courts of law these two courts were statutorily vested with the same jurisdiction as the justices of the king bench,common pleas,and chancellor of the exchequer of england the english law courts had the power to issue writs of certiorari and thus,before,the supreme court and the court of common pleas had concurrent jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari the delaware constitution of,however,eliminated the court of common pleas and vested a new superior court with the same jurisdiction as the supreme court and court of common pleas like its predecessor trial court,the superior court had the same jurisdiction as the king bench,common pleas,and chancellor of the exchequer of england in addition,since at least,the general assembly,by statute,explicitly vested in the superior court jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari 
the constitution superseded the constitution.under article iv,of the delaware constitution of,the current superior court shall have jurisdiction of all causes of a civil nature,real,personal and mixed,at common law and all the other jurisdiction and powers vested by the laws of this state in the formerly existing superior court in rash allen in,the superior court,sitting as a court in banc,held that 
from this review of the constitutional provisions of our state,it is manifest that since,the power of the superior court to issue writs of certiorari,and hear causes thereon,has been and is constitutional and such being the case we think it will not be seriously contended that a jurisdiction which is constitutional could be taken away by statute 
thus,the genesis of the superior court authority to issue writs of certiorari is constitutional.no statute may strip the superior court of that power.indeed,the delaware general assembly has explicitly,although perhaps redundantly vested the superior court with that power by statute del provides that the superior court may frame and issue all remedial writs,including writs of habeas corpus and certiorari therefore,and from any perspective,the superior court jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari can not be questioned.
current confusion arises over whether del has altered the superior court exclusive jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari.it is clear,given the plain meaning of the constitution of,that no general assembly may,by statute,divest superior court of its authority to issue writs of certiorari to inferior tribunals.but did the general assembly by enacting del intend to grant the court of common pleas concurrent jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari to the justice of the peace court the modern court of common pleas became a constitutional court under article vi,of the delaware constitution of in that provision mandates that the court of common pleas shall have all the jurisdiction and powers vested by the laws of this state thus,the general assembly may,by statute,determine the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas.
the only statute addressing the processing of writs in the court of common pleas is,which predates the court of common pleas change in status from a statutory to a constitutional court section does not vest the court of common pleas with any statutory authority to issue a writ of certiorari to the justice of the peace court that statutory language simply provides 
the court shall have all the powers of a court of record possessed by the superior court of the state in the endorsement of its writs,rules,processes,the attendance of witnesses,the requiring of security for costs from nonresident plaintiffs,the production of documents,books and records and the production of all other necessary evidence 
in the legal context,endorsement or indorsement refers to t he placing of a signature,sometimes with an additional notation,on the back of a negotiable instrument to transfer or guarantee the instrument or to acknowledge payment or t he signature or notation itself.in the ordinary context,endorsement means essentially the same thing,with definitions including a n act of endorsing,s omething,as a signature or voucher,that endorses or validates,s anction approbation,or a n amendment to a contract,as an insurance policy,allowing a change in the original terms.
applying these definitions,both the superior court in howell and the court of common pleas in brandywine determined that the only reasonable way to interpret this provision is to conclude that where the court of common pleas does have power to issue writs,those writs should be accorded the same power and legal weight as those writs issued by the superior court we agree with this interpretation.but.does not grant the court of common pleas authority to issue writs.that statute merely provides the court of common pleas the same power to endorse its own writs,only those writs statutes explicitly authorize the court of common pleas to issue.if elsewhere the court of common pleas were separately granted the authority to issue a writ of certiorari to inferior tribunals,it could endorse that writ with the same legal effect and in the same manner as the superior court endorses its own writs.
does not independently vest authority in the court of common pleas to issue a writ of certiorari.it only directs that the court of common pleas handle its writs in the same way superior court does.unlike the comparable empowering statutes governing the superior court.or the supreme court,does not address any specific writs.in no provision of the chapter treating the court of common pleas does the delaware code even imply that writs of certiorari would be included other provisions of the code,however,do identify specific writs that can be issued by the courts in general the general assembly has defined the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas with regard to certain writs and of the superior court and family court with regard to others the exclusion of writs of certiorari from the statutes that do grant jurisdiction to the courts generally,and to the court of common pleas specifically,evidences the general assembly intent,consistent with the constitution of,to limit the power to issue writs of certiorari to the supreme court and the superior court.
therefore,the superior court has original,and exclusive,trial court jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari to the justice of the peace court in summary possession cases.the superior court has original and exclusive trial court jurisdiction to issue common law writs of certiorari to all inferior tribunals.the court of common pleas can not issue common law writs of certiorari for any purpose.although now a constitutional court,common pleas has no current power to issue statutory writs of certiorari.
ii.issues reviewable on a common law writ of certiorari 
this case presents the opportunity for us to reaffirm and further clarify the role of the common law writ of certiorari as a method of limited review in the delaware court system.although the structure of the court system and the jurisdiction of various courts to review the decisions of inferior tribunals have evolved over delaware history,the common law writ of certiorari has not changed.the general assembly has provided in the delaware code for statutory writs of certiorari,enabling the superior court to review the decisions of certain administrative agencies,such as the state fire prevention commission or a political subdivision board of adjustment here,we address only common law writs of certiorari,and not particular statutory writs of certiorari or the scope of review the general assembly provided for each by statute 
a writ of certiorari is one of the oldest common law writs and its origins are obscure in the history of medieval england the writ is simply a form that calls up,for review,the record from the lower court or tribunal.the purpose of the writ is to permit a higher court to review the conduct of a lower tribunal of record.a writ of certiorari is not a substitute for,or the functional equivalent of,an appeal review on a writ of certiorari issued by the superior court differs fundamentally from appellate review because review on certiorari is on the record and the reviewing court may not weigh evidence or review the lower tribunal factual findings.
petitioners for a writ of certiorari must satisfy two threshold conditions the judgment must be final and there can be no other available basis for review those requirements are met here.there is no dispute that the decision of the three judge panel of the justice of the peace court constituted the final trial adjudication of the summary possession complaint.the general assembly,importantly,intended it to be so.summary is not a word susceptible to many meanings.there is no statutory right to appeal from this decision 
if the petition meets the threshold requirements for the writ of certiorari,the court must determine if the petition raises the type of claim reviewable on certiorari the reviewing court does not consider the merits of the case.it considers only those issues historically considered at common law namely,whether the lower tribunal committed errors of law,exceeded its jurisdiction,or proceeded irregularly evaluating whether relief from the judgment below would be appropriate on each of these three issues,we explained in christiana town center,llc new castle county,that a decision will be reversed for an error of law committed by the lower tribunal when the record affirmatively shows that the lower tribunal has proceeded illegally or manifestly contrary to law.reversal on jurisdictional grounds is appropriate only if the record fails to show that the matter was within the lower tribunal personal and subject matter jurisdiction.reversal for irregularities of proceedings occurs if the lower tribunal failed to create an adequate record for review.
the common law writ of certiorari is directed narrowly for limited review of any type of case from any inferior tribunal.the case law in delaware is clear on this point nonetheless,it is suggested that we should endorse morphing that narrow review into full blown intermediate appellate review in circumstances where no further appeals are available.ordinarily,justice of the peace court judgments are appealable to the court of common pleas de novo review on a writ of certiorari,however,is understandably narrow,because in most instances there is available the much more comprehensive and attractive but for the expense trial de novo.in summary possession cases,however,no de novo trial option is available.from this it does not follow,however,that the writ of certiorari should be broader when issued in summary possession cases merely because there is no appeal option available.in the summary possession statute,the general assembly could not have been clearer that summary possession cases should end quickly without further evidentiary review.a party can appeal the initial justice of the peace ruling to a three person justice of the peace panel the general assembly demands that trial options end there.that definitive ending is not subject to even traditional appellate review.
the instant case suggests that common law writs of certiorari are being sought as an end run around the general assembly clearly expressed intent that no traditional appellate review lies in summary possession cases after a three judge hearing in the justice of the peace court has concluded.common law writs of certiorari in this context can not,therefore,be the functional equivalent of an appeal.the general assembly could have provided for ordinary review de novo,traditional appellate review on the record or statutorily defined certiorari review.they did none of the above.to allow common law writs of certiorari to be used to prolong summary possession actions defeats the clear legislative intent to end those proceedings quickly.landlords need to know whether they may move forward and tenants need to know whether they may remain on the premises for the balance of the lease or whether they must move on.delay serves neither party.
nevertheless,common law writs of certiorari may still direct inquiry to the three issues described fundamental errors that appear on the face of the record of the summary possession proceeding and do not contemplate evidentiary review.according to woolley on delaware practice,it is a general rule that on certiorari the reviewing court is confined to the consideration of the record returned in obedience to the writ,by which error,if any,must appear in castner state,we noted,u nder principles of law well established in this state,certiorari involves a review of only such errors as appear on the face of the record being considered.
on a common law writ of certiorari,the superior court can not look behind the face of the record.rather,it can only review the record for the purpose of confirming an irregularity in asserting jurisdiction,an improper exercise of its power or the declaration of an improper remedy by the inferior tribunal.for a court to do anything more,such as combing the transcript for an erroneous evidentiary ruling as maddrey asks us to sanction in this case,converts the limited certiorari review of summary possession into an impermissible full appellate review that is inconsistent with both the function of the common law writ and the general assembly intent to terminate landlord tenant possession disputes summarily.
as an example of an error properly reviewable on a writ of certiorari,the superior court can consider irregularities shown in the docket entries.in this case,one docket entry reads,the three judge panel is satisfied that the plaintiff arbor management has proven by a preponderance of the evidence however,if that docket entry had instead read,the three judge panel is satisfied that defendant cornelia maddrey has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt,that docket entry would show on the face of the record an error of law in the proceeding.the panel shift of the burden of proof to the defendant and changing preponderance of the evidence to beyond a reasonable doubt would have been an error of law apparent on the face of the record.justices of the peace should,in every case insure that the docket sheet,in order to create a reviewable record,reflects a short statement of the decision as was done here that explains who prevailed and the burden of proof applied.similarly,the proper service of the complaint and an irregularity of process,a lack of jurisdiction,or a remedy ordered outside of statutory authority would also be reviewable from the face of the record.
iii.record reviewable on a writ of certiorari 
the scope of review on a common law writ of certiorari drives our determination of what is properly considered to be the record in these cases maddrey argues that failing to review the entire record would frustrate the certiorari process.indeed it would,depending on what constitutes the record for review on certiorari as opposed to functional intermediate appellate review.however,as the superior court wrote in rodenhiser department of public safety in,i t is settled in this jurisdiction that the evidence before the lower tribunal is not a proper part of the record in a common law certiorari proceeding.it is the common law writ of certiorari that the superior court issues to the justice of the peace court in summary possession cases.accordingly,in these cases the evidence presented to the justice of peace court,including the testimony reflected in the transcript,is not a proper part of the record subject to superior court review.
the general assembly did not design the justice of the peace court,a statutory court,to be reviewed on a full record.indeed,in all civil actions except summary possession,an appeal de novo is available.therefore,only the record appropriate for common law certiorari review need be returned to superior court in response to the writ.that record is nothing more than the initial papers,limited to the complaint initiating the proceeding,the answer or response if required,and the docket entries.thus,the official record delivered by the justice of the peace court to the superior court in response to the issuance of a common law writ of certiorari does not properly include a transcript of the evidentiary proceedings.in this case,the justice of the peace court sent a transcript,together with the other papers,to the superior court.apparently that court has done so routinely ever since it has had the capability to make a transcript.however,what is actually put in the box does not make the record the record is what legally should be in the box.the justice of the peace court must not send evidentiary hearing transcripts to the superior court,because the superior court may not properly consider hearing transcripts in performing its limited duty on common law certiorari.
in castner,we noted that reviewing the transcript to evaluate the basis for the lower tribunal decision necessarily contemplates that the court will weigh and evaluate the evidence.castner implies that it would enlarge certiorari as a device to circumvent the requisites of the appellate jurisdiction of this court as established by the constitution.in later cases,we have also explained that certiorari review is limited to errors which appear on the face of the record and does not embrace an evaluation of the evidence considered by the inferior tribunal.further,t he transcript of the evidence below is not part of the reviewable record and the court can not examine the transcript in order to evaluate the adequacy of the evidence which supports the superior court conclusion rendered below.castner explanation of narrow review on common law certiorari drives our conclusion today to limit the actual record to a necessarily,correspondingly limited record for return to superior court.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the superior court is affirmed.
et.the statute provides for no de novo or on the record.
