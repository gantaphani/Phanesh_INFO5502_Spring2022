the ellis act,et provides a statutory procedure allowing a landlord to remove rental units from the market and leave the landlord,if necessary,evict tenants.civil code section provides for an affirmative defense to eviction,as well as an independent action for damages,when the eviction is in retaliation for the exercise of a tenant rights.this case raises the issue whether a tenant facing eviction under the ellis act may raise an affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction under civil code section,when the landlord has complied with the procedural requirements of the ellis act to remove rental units from the market.we conclude that the legislature did not intend that the ellis act allow a tenant to prevent a landlord from removing property from the rental market by resisting eviction through an affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction.but the tenant retains the right to an independent action for damages provided by the retaliatory eviction statute.
petitioner joel drouet owns rental property in san francisco.he withdrew his rental property from the rental market under the ellis act,and filed an unlawful detainer action to evict his tenants,real parties in interest jim broustis and ivy mcclelland,when they would not move out.real parties raised the affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction.petitioner moved for summary adjudication of that affirmative defense in his favor,on the ground that the defense was not legally available in ellis act proceedings.the trial court denied petitioner motion.petitioner sought writ review in the appellate division of the san francisco superior court.in a published opinion,the appellate division disagreed with the trial court and issued the writ to compel the trial court to grant the motion on the ground that the defense was unavailable.
we transferred this case from the appellate division pursuant to california rules of court,rule,in order to settle an important question of law.we agree with the appellate division and grant the petition for writ of mandate.
the material facts are essentially undisputed.petitioner owns a apartment building at san carlos street in san francisco.real parties rented the unit at san carlos,a apartment,on a basis.real party broustis lived in the unit for years.by the time of the proceedings below,real party mcclelland had lived with broustis for approximately one year.
apparently,the relationship was strained.the appellate division noted that petitioner and real party broustis have had conflicts for many years,and that the conditions of the apartment purportedly required real party broustis to make several repairs and deduct them from his rent.in their opposition to the motion for summary judgment,and in answers to interrogatories,real parties claimed that in april they informed petitioner that they believed they had been overcharged for garbage bills since,and were going to deduct this amount from their august rent.real parties also orally complained about needed repairs to the shower,stairs,and sewage line.petitioner did not dispute these factual allegations in his reply to the opposition 
on august,petitioner commenced ellis act proceedings on the san carlos rental units by filing a notice of intent to withdraw residential rental units from the rental market and a memorandum of notice regarding withdrawal of rental unit from rent or lease with the san francisco residential rent stabilization and arbitration board board 
on that same day,and pursuant to civil code section,petitioner served on real parties a written termination notice to quit the premises and deliver up possession by october.the notice of intent and memorandum of notice were attached to the termination notice.petitioner then filed a second notice of intent and memorandum of notice with the board,indicating that he had taken the appropriate steps to terminate all tenancies in the property by giving proper notice to his tenants of the termination of their tenancies.on september,petitioner recorded a copy of the memorandum of notice with the board,and recorded another copy with the recorder office of the city and county of san francisco.
it is undisputed that petitioner complied with all procedural requirements of the ellis act.nevertheless,real parties did not quit the premises by october.
on october,petitioner filed a complaint for unlawful detainer in the san francisco superior court,sitting as a court of limited civil jurisdiction.the complaint alleged that petitioner had complied with the ellis act to remove the units from the rental market but that real parties remained in possession despite being served with notice to quit.real parties answered the complaint and alleged four affirmative defenses,including retaliatory eviction.petitioner moved for summary adjudication on each of the four affirmative defenses.the superior court granted the motion in part but denied it with regard to retaliatory eviction.
petitioner then sought a writ of mandate in the appellate division of the san francisco superior court,to compel the trial court to set aside the denial of summary adjudication on the ground that the defense of retaliatory eviction is legally unavailable in ellis act unlawful detainer proceedings.after briefing and oral argument,the appellate division held that the defense of retaliatory eviction was not available and issued the writ of mandate to compel the trial court to reverse its denial of petitioner motion for summary adjudication.we granted transfer.
ii.discussion 
in a writ proceeding challenging a denial of summary adjudication,we review the trial court ruling de novo.buss superior court cal th,d,dyer superior court th,d.in the present case there are no disputed issues of fact material to the legal issue of whether the affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction is available in an unlawful detainer proceeding filed under the ellis act.thus,our task is to decide that legal issue on the undisputed facts and determine whether petitioner is entitled to summary adjudication as a matter of law.th at,d.
we begin at the headwaters of any ellis act discussion nash city of santa monica cal d,nash.nash addressed the validity of a provision of the santa monica city charter which severely restricted the removal of rental units from the housing market.id.at.the charter provision was enacted in response to a severe shortage of rental housing caused by the demolition derby,a period in which santa monica landlords demolished over rental units and converted hundreds of others to condominiums.id.at.
to alleviate the rental housing shortage,the charter provision required a permit from the santa monica rent control board before any landlord could demolish or convert rental units.such a permit was granted only if the rent control board found that the units were not occupied by,or could not be afforded by,persons of low or moderate income removal of the rental units from the market would not adversely affect the housing supply and the landlord could not make a reasonable return on his investment.nash,supra,cal d at.
nash,a santa monica landlord,decided to leave the business of rental housing and tear down his buildings.nash was not eligible for a demolition permit because his tenants were of low or moderate income,and the demolition of the building would,as nash conceded,adversely affect the housing supply.nash,supra,cal d at.nash sought a writ of mandate in the los angeles superior court,which ruled in his favor.id.at.
on the city appeal,the supreme court reversed.the court rejected nash argument that he had a right to go out of the apartment rental business,but the city of santa monica was forcing him to remain in that business against his will.nash,supra,cal d at.the supreme court reasoned that nash was free to relinquish personal involvement with the rental property by hiring a property manager withholding units from the rental market as they became vacant or selling the property to someone willing to continue in the rental housing business.id.at.the court further held that the restrictions imposed on nash by the charter provision were indirect and minimal,and constituted a permissible form of regulation of property ownership to satisfy santa monica legitimate goal of maintaining adequate rental housing.id.at.
in response to the nash decision,the legislature enacted the ellis act in the act.stats,ch.the legislature,under the apparent impression that the nash court had denied the existence of a fundamental right to cease doing business as a landlord citation,passed the ellis act to alleviate the plight of landlords.bullock city and county of san francisco d.
the core provision of the act states no public entity shall,by statute,ordinance,or regulation,or by administrative action implementing any statute,ordinance or regulation,compel the owner of any residential real property to offer,or to continue to offer,accommodations in the property for rent or lease,subd.a.the ellis act primarily focuses on rental accommodations in apartment buildings,subd.b valnes santa monica rent control bd.d.
the act provides that a public entity which has a rent control ordinance in effect may impose certain procedural requirements on a landlord removal of rental units the landlord may be required to provide written notice to the public entity,and state under penalty of perjury the number and location of the rental units,the amounts of applicable rents,and the names of all tenants,subd.a.the public entity may also require the landlord to record with the county recorder a memorandum summarizing the provisions of the notice,save for provisions such as tenants names which are deemed confidential,and certifying that legally proper actions have been initiated to terminate existing tenancies,subd.b.
as it read at the time of the proceedings pertinent to this case,the act provided that the relationship would continue through a grace period following the filing of a memorandum of notice certifying that the landlord had taken steps to terminate a tenancy.until that grace period expired,the tenancy would not be terminated,and the rental accommodations would remain on the rental market.t he date on which the accommodations are withdrawn from rent or lease for purposes of the act is days from the date of delivery of that memorandum of notice to the public entity,former subd.a.the act was amended in to move the provision just quoted from subdivision a to subdivision b to extend the grace period to days and to further extend it to one year for a tenant who is over or disabled and who has lived in the rental unit for at least one year,provided that certain conditions are met.stats,ch.under current law,and subject to the exception of more disabled or elderly tenants,the rental accommodations are considered withdrawn from the rental market days after the delivery of the landlord memorandum of notice to the public entity.
the act also provides that a public entity may require notice to tenants displaced by the ellis act,subd.c.however,the public entity can not require a notice period in excess of the statutory grace period.channing properties city of berkeley th,d channing.
in the event that a tenant refuses to quit possession of the premises,the landlord may institute unlawful detainer proceedings under the act.in such a proceeding the tenant or lessee may appear and answer or demur pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure and may assert by way of defense that the owner has not complied with the applicable provisions of this chapter,the ellis act,or statutes,ordinances,or regulations of public entities adopted to implement this chapter,as authorized by this chapter.noncompliance is the only defense specifically referenced as an eviction defense in the ellis act.
to safeguard tenants,the ellis act bristles with remedies for pretextual removals of rental units.concerned that the ellis act might provide landlords with a loophole to circumvent rent control laws,the legislature included certain provisions to forestall evictions under the pretext of going out of business.friedman et,cal.practice guide the rutter group.if a landlord pretextually invokes the ellis act to go out of the rental business permanently,but then subsequently offers the removed units for rent within two years of the date of removal,the landlord faces a host of adverse consequences.
the ellis act allows a public entity to provide the following safeguards against such pretextual evictions.upon return to the rental market,the removed units are subject to the same rent controls that would have been applicable had they not been removed,subject to rent adjustments permitted by the rent control law,subds.a,b.the owner is liable to the displaced tenants for both actual and punitive damages,subd.a.the public entity may institute a civil proceeding against the owner for punitive damages based on the displacement of the tenants,subd.a.
in addition,the displaced tenants have a right of first refusal the owner must first offer a returned unit to the tenant displaced therefrom,provided that the tenant,within days of displacement,has given the owner written notice of the desire to consider an offer to renew the tenancy and an address to which such an offer could be directed,subd.a.the public entity is empowered to extend the life of the right of first refusal for up to years,subd.b.if the removed units are demolished,and the landlord rebuilds rental units on the same property and places them on the market within five years of the original removal,the new units are subject to local rent controls on the basis of a fair and reasonable return,even if the local rent control law ordinarily exempts new construction,subd.c.
the ellis act includes a statement expressing legislative intent it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this chapter to supersede any holding or portion of any holding in nash city of santa monica cal d,to the extent that the holding,or portion of the holding,conflicts with this chapter,so as to permit landlords to go out of business.but in the next sentence the legislature set forth a litany of limitations on the scope of the ellis act provisions however,this act is not otherwise intended to do any of the following 
a interfere with local governmental authority over land use,including regulation of the conversion of existing housing to condominiums or other subdivided interests or to other nonresidential use following its withdrawal from rent or lease under this chapter.
b preempt local or municipal environmental or land use regulations,procedures,or controls that govern the demolition and redevelopment of residential property.
c override procedural protections designed to prevent abuse of the right to evict tenants.
d permit an owner to withdraw from rent or lease less than all of the accommodations,as defined by section.
e grant to any public entity any power which it does not possess independent of this chapter to control or establish a system of control on the price at which accommodations may be offered for rent or lease,or to diminish any such power which that public entity may possess,except as specifically provided in this chapter.
f alter in any way either section relating to the withdrawal of accommodations which comprise a mobilehome park from rent or lease or subdivision f of section of the civil code relating to a change of use of a mobilehome park,italics added.
another provision of the act,section,contains further limitations on the scope of the legislation.that section provides that n otwithstanding section,nothing in this chapter has any effect on a public entity power to enforce residential rental contracts,subd.a to regulate land use through planning,zoning,or subdivision map approvals,subd.b see city of santa monica yarmark d.yarmark or to mitigate the adverse impact of the ellis act on certain tenants by requiring the owner to pay relocation assistance authorized by the act,subd.c see yarmark,supra,d at.channing,supra,th at,d.
of particular significance to the present case,section further provides that nothing in this chapter s upersedes any provision of chapter commencing with section of this division,part commencing with section of division of title of this code,chapter commencing with section of part of division of the business and professions code,part commencing with section of division of the civil code,title commencing with section of part of division of the civil code,chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure,or division commencing with section of the health and safety code,subd.d.
a review of the statutes cited in section,subdivision d,reveals that the ellis act specifically does not supersede the relocation assistance act,designed to provide relocation assistance for persons and businesses displaced by programs and projects of a public entity,including acquisition and demolition,the california fair employment and housing act feha which,inter alia,forbids discrimination in housing on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,marital status,national origin,ancestry,familial status,disability,or sexual orientation,statutes prohibiting unfair business practices the portion of the civil code entitled personal rights,which includes the unruh civil rights act,et and its prohibition of discrimination by business establishments on the basis of sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,or medical condition,the portion of the civil code regulating the hiring of property,which includes the statutes governing the landlord duty to provide tenantable housing,as well as civil code section,the retaliatory eviction statute the unlawful detainer statutes and the community redevelopment law.
judicial construction of the ellis act has generally viewed the act in relation to local ordinances rather than these numerous state statutes.courts have uniformly construed the ellis act as a state law of preemptive effect,preventing local governments from imposing any additional requirements,external to the act,on a landlord decision to go out of the rental business.see,los angeles lincoln place investors,city of los angeles th,d bullock city and county of san francisco,supra,d at.yarmark,supra,d at.as stated,the purpose of the act was to prevent local governments from enacting legislation which would prevent a landlord from removing property from the rental market.
the yarmark court,the first to construe the ellis act,explained it is from the language of the act that the legislature intended to accomplish at least two objectives.the first is to prevent public entities from acting in a manner inconsistent with the act such as to prevent landlords from withdrawing units and evicting tenants so they may go out of business.and the second is to allow landlords to utilize the summary eviction procedures in order to go out of business without the restraint of substantive defenses provided by local rent control ordinances.yarmark,supra,d at,italics added.in passing the ellis act,the legislature has explicitly indicated it will tolerate no local measures providing substantive grounds for defenses in unlawful detainer actions brought by landlords who wish to go out of business.those substantive defenses are invalid to the extent they conflict with the ellis act.citation.id.at.
in short,a local rent control law or other measure may not impose an additional substantive burden on the landlord right to remove rental units under the ellis act.thus,a local rent control law may not require a landlord seeking to go out of business to either prove the rental units are uninhabitable and incapable of being made fit for habitation in an economically feasible manner,or else promise to develop new multifamily rental property subject to rent control and to some extent affordable by low income tenants.yarmark,supra,d at.see javidzad city of santa monica d.
likewise,a city ordinance may not condition the demolition of buildings removed under the ellis act on a finding that demolition would not be materially detrimental to neighborhood housing needs that demolition involved only a hazardous,unstable or unrepairable structure or that the landlord had promised to replace the demolished structure with the same number of housing units.first presbyterian church city of berkeley th,d.neither can a local ordinance require a longer period of notice to tenants than the ellis act grace period discussed above channing,supra,th at,d or require the landlord to provide relocation assistance beyond that authorized by the act in section,subdivision c.th at,d.
but the present case does not involve a burden external to the ellis act imposed on a landlord by a local ordinance.rather,the question we face is whether the ellis act itself provides that the defense of retaliatory eviction contained in another state law applies to eviction proceedings commenced under the act.thus,while we acknowledge the preemptive effect of the ellis act over such local ordinances,we must decide,as a matter of statutory construction,whether the provisions of the ellis act would permit a retaliatory eviction defense to an unlawful detainer action or would exclude that defense as a matter of law.in other words,once a landlord has properly invoked the ellis act,and triggered the final days of the tenancy,can a tenant remain and challenge the landlord right to evict on the ground that the landlord reasons for invoking the ellis act violate the retaliatory eviction statute 
we first examine that statute terms.civil code section,part of the statutory scheme which generally governs relationships,provides for an affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction in an unlawful detainer action.this defense arises when a tenant who is not in default of rent is evicted in retaliation for the exercise of certain enumerated tenant rights.these rights include the giving of good faith notice to the landlord of the intent to repair and deduct under civil code section,or the making of a complaint about the untenantability of the premises to the landlord or to a housing agency,subd.a.
such a defense of retaliatory eviction arises if the landlord tries to evict the tenant within days of the tenant exercise of applicable tenant rights.in addition,the defense may not be invoked more than once in any period,subd.b.generally,the tenant has both the initial burden of producing evidence and the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the landlord acted with a retaliatory motive,and the landlord is free to present evidence of a,legally valid reason for the eviction.friedman et,cal.practice guide,supra,to see western land office,cervantes d.
in addition to the affirmative defense to an unlawful detainer action,an aggrieved tenant has an independent action for monetary damages,consisting of actual damages plus punitive damages of up to for each retaliatory act committed with fraud,oppression,or malice,subds.f,g friedman et,cal.practice guide,supra,to see rich schwab th,d.
we now turn to our exercise of statutory construction to explain why the defense of retaliatory eviction is not available in an ellis act unlawful detainer proceeding,but the tenant retains the right to an independent damage action.
the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.irvine th,d.to determine the intent of legislation,we first consult the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.dafonte,cal th,d.where the statutory wording is clear a court should not add to or alter it to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.irvine,supra,th at,d.furthermore,statutory language must be viewed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,quoting johnstone richardson d.
the issue before us is one of first impression.as we pass through these uncharted waters,the polestar of our journey is the intent of the legislature.each side to this litigation offers a tempting solution of ease and facility.neither simple solution is tenable,and either,if adhered to,would draw us from our proper course and defeat the policies of the opposing statutes.
real parties argue that the plain language of the ellis act preserves a tenant right to the affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction in an ellis act unlawful detainer.they point to section,subdivision d,which explicitly states that the ellis act does not supersede that portion of the civil code which includes civil code section.they conclude that because the legislature used the term supersede in this provision,it intended to expressly retain the affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction in proceedings under the ellis act.
the argument has some persuasion at first blush.supersede is a word of ordinary common meaning,which has been repeatedly recognized by courts.webster dictionary ed,unabridged,page,defines supersede to mean to sit above,be superior to,to make void or useless,especially by a superior power to make unnecessary or superfluous county of ventura george d,quoting county of los angeles ferguson d.see woodmansee lowery d,in re nunez bankr th cir,the dictionary defines supersede as to cause to be set aside or to replace fowler weiss,the plain meaning of supersede is t o make obsolete,inferior,or outmoded to make void annul,override to make superfluous or unnecessary to take the place of to take precedence over.
we acknowledge that the legislature is presumed to have been aware of existing judicial constructions of terms,and to have adopted those meanings in framing subsequent statutes.bullock city and county of san francisco,supra,d at.we could conclude that,by the plain language of the ellis act and the ordinary accepted meaning of supersede,the legislature has shown no intent that the act supplant,make void,or override civil code section in its,had the legislature intended that the affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction would not apply to ellis act evictions,it could have so indicated in clear and explicit language.we further note that a credible argument could also be made that section,subdivision c,was meant to preserve the retaliatory eviction defense in ellis act proceedings as a procedural protection designed to prevent abuse of the right to evict tenants.but the legislature did not set forth anywhere what it meant by a procedural protection.
the issue before us does not lend itself to such a simple solution.in the ellis act context it would be a superficial act of interpretation to conclude that the use of the term supersede,in reference to a broad and detailed statutory scheme of the civil code,necessarily meant that a particular eviction in a single applicable.the legislature did not single out section,but broadly referenced title,which includes sections through.
we look to the various textual provisions of the ellis act in the light of the act overall nature and obvious,the legislative intent underlying the act.see moyer workmen comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.rules of construction direct us to construe the ellis act and the retaliatory eviction statute together,to give effect to that overriding legislative intent.see select base materials board of equal.cal d.to apply that portion of the retaliatory eviction statute which provides for an affirmative defense against eviction would frustrate the clearly enunciated legislative intent of the ellis,that a landlord should have the right to go out of the rental business,within the act specified time periods and under its specific procedural requirements.i n construing a statute the courts will construe the statute with a view to promoting rather than to defeating its general purpose and the policy behind it.city of costa mesa mckenzie d.
this brings us to the second oversimplification from which we steer clear.petitioner suggests the ellis act bestows upon landlords an unqualified right to go out of the rental market.we disagree.
an apartment is as much a castle to a renter as a home is to its owner.the ellis act right to go out of business is not a license for landlords to act in cavalier disregard of their tenants.the legislature has imposed numerous restrictions on the landlord right to go out of business.the right is not,as petitioner and some decisions describe it,unfettered.yarmark,supra,d at.see first presbyterian church city of berkeley,supra,th at,d los angeles lincoln place investors,city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.on the contrary,the use of the term unfettered is an unfortunate misnomer.
the yarmark court took the term from a senate judiciary committee analysis written when the ellis act was in its embryonic stage.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended april.the act then consisted of a mere lines of more than the main section of the act,section.the act did not contain the numerous,detailed provisions which were later added to limit the act scope,current section,subdivisions b through d,current section,and the various provisions penalizing pretextual evictions.bill reg.sess.as amended april.the use of the term unfettered is an unhelpful anachronism which inaccurately characterizes the landlord right to go out of business,and which impedes an appropriate analysis of legislative intent 
like virtually all rights,the landlord right to cease being a landlord is subject to the fetters and restrictions demanded by a complex society of competing values and interests.for instance,in its judgment the legislature has provided that a landlord can not go out of business selectively,by some units but not others.the legislature has also provided that a landlord can not go out of business as a pretext without suffering serious penalties.
there is a fundamental distinction between an ellis act unlawful detainer proceeding and one which is filed in the ordinary course of the typical relationship.in the latter case the landlord remains in the rental business.perhaps the landlord may have failed to fulfill the legal obligation to provide habitable premises,or the landlord may have retaliated against a tenant by initiating an unlawful detainer proceeding in response to an assertion of tenant rights.but the landlord is still in the rental market,using the property to generate income from a commercial enterprise,and does not want to leave the market.in that situation the policies and sanctions of the retaliatory eviction statute,including its obvious deterrent effect,apply in full force because the landlord remains a deterrable actor in the rental market.
but in this case the landlord has left the rental market by the procedural mechanism authorized by the legislature.while the former tenant has a grace period within which to relocate,the tenant must expeditiously surrender possession by the expiration of that time unless the landlord has violated ellis act tenancy termination procedures.in the typical ellis act case,the tenancy ceases to exist days from such filing because the rental units are legally removed from the market.the relationship no longer exists.petitioner then stands as a property owner seeking to remove from a producing property a former tenant who has lost the right of possession.because the relationship no longer exists,there is no tenancy for the lessee to pay for,or rent to increase,or services to decrease within the meaning of civil code section,subdivision a.
we strive to construe statutes to reach a reasonable legislatively intended result see deyoung city of san diego d,disapproved on another ground in yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,and to harmonize competing statutes to effectuate the legislative policy.i f a court can by any fair interpretation find a reasonable field of operation for two allegedly inconsistent statutes without destroying or preventing their intent or meaning from being operative,the court should do so.sutherland,statutory construction ed.criteria of interpretation,footnote omitted.it is unreasonable to conclude that in the process of making broad references to entire systems of statutes in the ellis act,the legislature intended the defense of retaliatory eviction to apply to unlawful detainer proceedings under the the landlord has ceased to use the property as an asset.to conclude otherwise would erect an unintended,massive and daunting barrier between the right to go out of the landlord business and the practical ability to bring that right to fruition in accordance with the purpose of the ellis act.
moreover,we note that civil code section,subdivision d,provides that nothing in the s
