factual and procedural history 
defendant is an idaho corporation,originally incorporated as christ gospel mission,for the purposes of provid ing for the worship of god,the teaching and preaching of the word of god,the winning of people to a personal faith in the lord jesus christ and in the spiritual improvement of mankind,and to extend the ministry of the gospel unto all the earth.to those ends,defendant operates two services that are relevant here.first,defendant has a residential drug treatment program that provides an intensive,residential recovery program for people with chemical dependency or alcoholism.second,defendant runs homeless shelters to return the poor,needy and homeless to society as,productive citizens.plaintiff cowles participated in the drug treatment program.plaintiff chinn stayed from time to time in defendant homeless shelters.
a.the residential drug treatment program and plaintiff cowles 
defendant requires all participants in its residential drug treatment program to be,or to desire to be,christian.they must engage in a wide range of christian activities,including worship services,bible study,public and private prayer,religious singing,and public bible reading.defendant does not charge a fee for attending its drug treatment program.
a program policies and description form and a program house rules and procedures pamphlet apprise potential participants of what will be expected.the program entails a full year of treatment to help to develop a relationship with god,themselves,and others through classes,counseling,and group interaction.the program description expressly states that participants must engage in bible study and attend church services each week.
the program places heavy restrictions on participants other activities.for example,they may not make phone calls or receive mail during the first month.thereafter,they may receive visitors only on sundays between and.they may leave defendant facility only if the staff grants them a pass,which is earned through good behavior.participants may not work for an outside employer during at least the first nine months of their treatment.
cowles wrote a letter to defendant in november.she stated that she had been charged with possession of methamphetamine.the judge presiding over her criminal proceeding sentenced her to a year in the county jail,but she recommended that cowles enroll in defendant drug treatment program.if cowles enrolled in the program,the judge stated that she would order cowles release on probation pending her successful completion of the program.otherwise,cowles had to serve out her sentence.
in her letter to defendant,cowles gave the impression that she understood the religious nature of defendant program and that she desired to participate in the program because of its religious nature.she wrote i am searching for guidance and knowledge and peace.when i have had god in my life things were perfect but i had an inner peace i miss very much i am focused on changing my life through god and spiritual growth.cowles asked defendant to put her on the program waiting list and to contact her as soon as possible.
defendant staff interviewed cowles on march.they told cowles about the program rules and intense,curriculum.they also provided cowles with a copy of the program description.defendant formally accepted cowles into its drug treatment program on march.
true to the description of its program,defendant required cowles to participate in religious activities she could not read secular books or listen to secular music.she had to attend church every sunday and,if she refused to attend defendant services,she could go to one of only four other nearby churches that defendant had approved.she also had to attend daily services,where she had to sing hymns in the choir,pray silently and out loud,recite bible verses,and allow the laying on of hands.on a regular basis,she was required to cast out demons in the facility,using oil and holy water.on may,plaintiff had to participate in the national day of prayer at the idaho capitol building.
on three occasions cowles became so upset by these practices that she ran out of the room crying.at those times,defendant women ministry director told cowles that she would go to hell and would be left behind if she did not accept jesus christ as her personal savior.when cowles asked if she could graduate from the program without converting to christianity,defendant staff told her that graduation without conversion had never happened.
at times cowles heard defendant staff ridicule mormons.the pastor who led many of defendant religious services called mormons crazy.when a mormon woman entered the program,a staff member vowed to straighten her out.within a month,the woman was baptized into defendant faith.
in late may or early june,about three months after her acceptance into the program,cowles asked to transfer to a different,treatment facility.purportedly in retaliation for making that request,the women ministry director restricted cowles activities and required that she place all of her telephone calls to her lawyer on speaker phone so that defendant staff could listen to them.other participants told cowles that defendant staff had encouraged them to make false allegations against cowles and to exclude cowles because she was not christian.
in addition to the alleged abuse that she received for not accepting christianity,cowles also alleges that she experienced sex discrimination.she could not work outside defendant facility or visit with her year old son except during the two hours on sundays set aside for visitation.plaintiff alleges that similarly situated men in the drug treatment program could work for outside employers and could have more frequent family visits.
on june,the women ministry director wrote to cowles lawyer.she asked that cowles be removed from defendant program immediately and placed elsewhere because cowles was not in agreement with the biblically based curriculum and classes that are required in the program.cowles remained in the program,however,for two more months.
on august,the director called cowles to her office and asked cowles whether she was christian.cowles confirmed that she was not.on august,the director contacted cowles probation officer to report that cowles could not complete the program.cowles went back to jail.
cowles eventually filed a complaint with the federal department of housing and urban development hud,alleging that defendant had discriminated against her because of her sex and religion while she attended defendant drug treatment program.cowles further alleged that defendant had engaged in unlawful retaliation after cowles complained to defendant staff about the program religious components.hud investigated and found that,a lthough cowles was directed to defendant program by the court,she was aware that it was faith based.moreover,hud determined that the fha religious exemption permitted defendant to reserve its program for christians,so cowles could not base a viable fha claim on those activities.
hud rejected cowles sex discrimination claim because it lacked evidentiary support.cowles acknowledged that she has never talked to any man who participated in defendant program and was not able to personally observe any differences between the program for men and the program for women.
finally,hud rejected cowles retaliation claim because a letter that cowles wrote to the state court contradicted her claim.according to hud,the letter said 
i need the judge to know the program was great.i was the one displaced.that there
