background 
legal framework 
there are two provisions in both the state and federal constitutions that protect owners of private property from overly restrictive governmental regulation.the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions guarantee property owners due process of law when the state deprive s them of property.cal,art.i.t he takings clauses guarantee property owners just compensation when their property is taken for public use.cal,art.i,amend.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.these provisions prohibit government from depriving a person of property without due process of law.citations.these provisions guarantee appropriate procedural protections citation and also place some substantive limitations on legislative measures citations.the latter described as substantive due government from enacting legislation that is arbitrary or discriminatory or lacks a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose.citation.in the context of price control,which includes rent control,courts generally find that a regulation bears a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose so long as the law does not deprive investors of a fair return and thereby become confiscatory.id.at,d.
government regulation may effect a taking of property if it goes too far.penna.coal mahon.such a regulatory taking entitles the property owner to bring an inverse condemnation action,and if it prevails,the regulatory agency must either withdraw the regulation or pay just compensation.citation.even if the agency withdraws the regulation,the property owner may have a right to just compensation for the temporary taking while the regulation was in effect.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.
in kavanau the supreme court examined a rent control ordinance enacted by the city of santa monica.that ordinance limited rent increases to no more than percent in a given year.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.in a preceding action,the court of appeal held that the percent limit violated kavanau right to due process,and kavanau obtained a writ of mandate prohibiting the city from applying the limit to his property.id.at,d.that holding was not challenged and kavanau then brought a second action seeking damages from the city.id.at,d.the supreme court found that kavanau had failed to state a cause of action for inverse condemnation because there was no physical invasion of his property,and the regulation had not deprived him of substantially all economically beneficial or productive use of his property.id.at,d,quoting lucas south carolina coastal council,d.the court rejected kavanau argument that because he lost rental income as a direct result of the rent board unconstitutional application of its percent limit,he has suffered a taking requiring just compensation.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained that kavanau had a remedy available to application to the rent board for a future increase in rents to cover the rental income lost while the unconstitutional provision was in therefore had not suffered a violation of his right to obtain a fair return on the value of his property.id.at,d.t his remedy,as opposed to an award of damages against the rent board,places the cost of compensating kavanau roughly on those tenants who benefited from unconstitutionally low rents.id.at,d.the court concluded that a landowner could not state a cause of action for inverse condemnation if the owner could be compensated for the losses flowing from the due process violation through an adjustment of future rents under the rent regulation process.id.at,d.
in galland,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court considered whether a landlord could recover damages against a government agency under united states code section for imposition of a confiscatorily low rent ceiling.it concluded that a kavanau adjustment would preclude section damages if it is adequate to prevent constitutional injury by compensating for previous excessively low rent ceilings.galland,supra,at,d.the court stated,however,that unreasonable costs,in the form of administrative and attorney fees,imposed on landlords seeking rent increases,may themselves be the basis of a section claim if either of two conditions is present the costs imposed are part of a government effort to deliberately flout established law,deliberately obstruct legitimate rent increases or the landlord suffers confiscation as a result of the imposition of such costs.id.at,d.
factual background 
hillsboro complaint,filed september,alleges as follows.in,the city adopted ordinance,which established rent control for mobile home parks including rancho grande mobilehome park,which is owned by hillsboro.hillsboro believed the ordinance to be invalid but did not collect annual rent increases over and above those authorized by ordinance.in,hillsboro noticed a rent increase over and above the rents allowed by the ordinance.hillsboro notified tenants that it would not seek to enforce the additional rent unless authorized to do so by a court or by the city.it notified tenants in their monthly bills of the running total of noticed rent uncollected.the ordinance was amended on january.in,a federal court entered judgment in hillsboro favor,ruling that the ordinance as originally drafted violated the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution because it did not provide a method for a landlord to collect a return on capital improvements.the city continued to enforce the ordinance while it appealed that decision.on july,the ninth circuit court of appeals held that the city appeal was moot because the ordinance had been amended.on july,hillsboro filed a second action in federal court seeking a declaration that the city was wrongfully enforcing the ordinance,to which the city responded that the amendments cured any constitutional defects in the ordinance.in december,the federal court held that the amendments had corrected the constitutional defect in the ordinance and entered judgment in the city favor.
the present complaint alleges that on august,hillsboro filed with the city of rohnert park an application for a rent increase to compensate it for the city of rohnert park unlawful rent roll back and the enforcement of unlawful rent control rents from january,through january.the application sought a rent increase for the city unlawfully imposed rent levels from through january.
the correspondence between counsel for hillsboro and the city attorney for rohnert park that preceded the litigation is incorporated as attachments to the complaint.on september,the city attorney wrote to hillsboro,stating that the city had received hillsboro application for a rent increase to compensate it for the city of rohnert park unlawful rent roll back and the enforcement of unlawful rent control rents from january,through january.the city attorney stated that the application will not be referred to the mobile home rent review board since the board has no jurisdiction to hear such an application the letter set forth five reasons why the city attorney asserted the rent board did not have jurisdiction.first,the governing regulations contemplate only two types of petitions for rent increases petition for noi net operating income increase when annual adjustment does not provide a landlord with a fair and reasonable return and capital improvement second,a request for a kavanau adjustment is premature because there has not been a determination by a court that,during a specific period of time,the city mobile home rent review rent control system either effected an unconstitutional taking of private property or a violation of section.there has been no determination by any court that during the period,the operation of the city mobile home rent review ordinance was confiscatory,as related to the a formulation of the roll back b the operation of the annual general adjustment or c the operation of any part of the ordinance other than its omission of a capital improvement pass through.third,hillsboro waived its claim for damages at the conclusion of the federal litigation.fourth,the city attorney disagreed that the federal court voided the ordinance.finally,the city attorney made an additional argument interpreting the federal court decision and argued that it had not,in fact,found the ordinance to be void.
in the following year,hillsboro and the city attorney exchanged correspondence in which hillsboro continued to insist that it was entitled to a prospective rent increase under kavanau without having to show that it was entitled to either an noi adjustment or a capital improvement,and the city attorney steadfastly refused to forward the request for a rent increase to the rent board,citing the reasons listed above.
on september,hillsboro filed its complaint,alleging a cause of action for inverse condemnation and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.the complaint sought a writ of mandate directing the rent board to consider its application.the city demurred to the complaint and the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,ruling that each of plaintiffs claims are precluded by applicable statute of limitations.plaintiffs claims are either precluded by the statute of limitations for takings claims travis county of santa cruz cal th,d,or the statute of limitations for a challenge to an ordinance set out in code of civil procedure section a.moreover,plaintiffs have not alleged any valid causes of action for a kavanau increase.the prerequisites for kavanau damages are a formal adjudication that an ordinance deprived a property owner of a fair return.citation.that allegation has not been can plaintiff make this allegation because plaintiff has not exhausted all of its administrative remedies.
discussion 
when reviewing a judgment dismissing a complaint after the granting of a demurrer without leave to amend,courts must assume the truth of the complaint properly pleaded or implied factual allegations.blank kirwan cal d.courts must also consider judicially noticed matters.ibid.in addition,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and read it in context.ibid.if the trial court has sustained the demurrer,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to state a cause of action.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d.
statute of limitations 
the city argues,and the trial court held,that hillsboro complaint is barred by the statute of limitations.a demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be,but is not necessarily,barred.citation.in order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer,the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint it is not enough that the complaint shows that the action may be barred.guardian north bay,superior court th,d.the city reasons that the complaint is a challenge to the facial constitutionality of the ordinance and as such had to be brought within five years from the date that the ordinance was passed.see hensler city of glendale cal th,d,statute of limitations for regulatory takings challenges.certain of hillsboro causes of action unquestionably are facial attacks on the validity of the ordinance and are thus untimely.others defy precise characterization.
the first four causes of action allege explicitly that as written the original ordinance is unconstitutional.these causes of action are thus barred.hensler city of glendale,supra,cal th at,d.the fifth cause of action,while couched in language that suggests it is a challenge to the ordinance as it was applied to hillsboro,seeks a declaration that the ordinance as amended provides no provision for payment of damages and that the ordinance as amended is invalid due to its failure to provide a remedy for damages.the sixth cause of action alleges inverse condemnation,and requests just compensation for the taking of hillsboro property.the seventh cause of action alleges that the city has violated hillsboro right to due process and seeks a declaration that by the city deliberate and deliberate obstructions it has flouted the law in a deliberate manner and interfered with hillsboro property rights and rights entitling hillsboro to an award of damages against the city.the eighth,ninth,and tenth causes of action purport to seek a writ of mandate in which the court will either set the kavanau rent increase according to proof,command the city to formulate an adequate kavanau adjustment remedy,or command the city to perform its duty to hold a hearing upon hillsboro kavanau application.
when these latter claims accrued is subject to question.if they are construed as facial challenges to the amended ordinance,the action accrued when the ordinance was amended in january.in that case they are untimely.hensler city of glendale,supra,cal th at,d.on the other hand,the damage alleged by hillsboro is that it was denied the ability to charge increased rents from through.while that alleged damage occurred during those years,an action seeking relief from a regulatory taking can not be brought until the responsible administrative body has denied relief to the property owner.a claim that the application of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.williamson planning comm hamilton bank,d.u ntil there has been a final,definitive position regarding how the regulations will be applied to the land,a court can not determine whether a compensable taking has occurred.hensler city of glendale,supra,at,d.therefore,hillsboro claim for inverse condemnation may not have accrued until the city definitively rejected its attempt to obtain a kavanau adjustment.we need not resolve the limitations issue,however,since the trial court correctly concluded that hillsboro has not made the allegat
