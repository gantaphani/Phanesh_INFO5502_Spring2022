tenant andrew gombiner appeals from the court judgment following a trial involving his residential lease of a home owned by landlord daniel swartz.because the trial court erroneously found los angeles rent stabilization ordinance,et did not apply to the dispute,we reverse and remand.
facts and proceedings 
in,landlord daniel swartz landlord converted the house he owned at sunset plaza drive in los angeles into two residential units designated as and sunset plaza drive in january,tenant andrew gombiner tenant signed a lease for sunset plaza drive,agreeing to pay per month for the first year and per month for the second.at the time,landlord did not tell his new tenant that the structure ground floor was landlord separate residence in which he was living under the address sunset plaza drive.
in july,tenant sued landlord for fraud and related causes of action for misrepresenting the property as a home by not disclosing the building second residence.lasc case no.bc.in february,the parties settled the lawsuit.under their settlement,landlord paid tenant.in addition,they signed amendment to their lease,extending the term of the lease months to august while leaving the rent at per month.as part of the settlement,tenant promised not to complain to any governmental authorities about matters covered by the settlement,and promised not to interfere with landlord efforts to restore the property to a residence.in july,both parties signed amendment to the lease,raising the monthly rent to and making the lease terminable by either party upon notice.
in january,troubles reemerged between landlord and tenant.expressing displeasure with landlord delay in repairing his broken water heater,tenant paid to fix the heater and deducted the repair costs from that month rent.demanding that tenant pay his rent in full,landlord assessed a charge of against tenant for late payment of rent the lease allowed,however,a late fee of only.
following landlord demand,tenant informed landlord that he believed los angeles rent stabilization ordinance rso applied to the property,making landlord unilateral increase in the late payment fee illegal.in addition,tenant insisted that landlord reimburse tenant for in unauthorized rent increases that landlord had collected from tenant in violation of the rso.landlord reacted by serving tenant with a notice to pay the late fee or quit the property.landlord also simultaneously exercised his right to give tenant notice of termination of the lease.when giving notice,landlord told tenant that if tenant approaches the city or any related governmental agency regarding the premises tenant will be liable for return of the settlement payment and further subject to a penalty for breaching the settlement agreement.
a little over a week later,tenant sued landlord.we refer to this lawsuit as the civil action to distinguish it from the unlawful detainer action between the parties.the gist of tenant complaint was landlord had violated the rso by overcharging tenant for rent.landlord,alleging causes of action against tenant for breach of the settlement agreement and for promissory fraud from tenant undisclosed intention not to adhere to the settlement agreement.in addition to,landlord filed an unlawful detainer action against tenant to regain possession of the property.
while the civil action remained pending,the honorable judith abrams presided over the unlawful detainer trial in august.judge abrams found landlord had spent tens of thousands of dollars and possibly more to create two separate residential units within the erstwhile structure.each unit had its own full kitchen,laundry area,driveway,mailbox,and garbage pickup location.landlord and tenant used separate entries and exits,had their own telephone and cable television lines,and did not interact while in their homes.based on the property condition and use,judge abrams found the building was a duplex.entering judgment for tenant,judge abrams ruled the duplex was subject to the rso,which limited rent increases to approximately percent a year during the period at issue in these proceedings.in november,the appellate department of the superior court affirmed judge abrams.in doing so,it noted the residence did not retain its essential character as a residence.substantial remodeling was done to create two truly separate and complete units.
following his victory in the unlawful detainer trial,tenant stopped paying rent to offset the unauthorized excess rent that landlord had collected from him.in crediting past overpayments against his current rent obligation,tenant relied on the authority of minelian manzella d,which permitted a tenant to recover unauthorized excess rent payments by withholding current rent.id.at.landlord thereafter filed a second unlawful detainer action against tenant.in response,tenant filed a first amended complaint in the civil action adding a cause of action for retaliatory eviction and pleading the res judicata effect of judge abrams finding that the property was a duplex subject to the rso.
in february,the parties stipulated to a bifurcated court and jury trial in the civil action before the honorable mary ann murphy,whose rulings and judgment are at issue in this appeal.as to nonjury matters,they agreed the trial court could rely on the parties briefs to decide the legality under the rso of the rent increases in the february settlement agreement and lease amendments.they further agreed the court could decide based on the parties evidence whether landlord had restored the property to a residence exempt from the rso.
the court phase by the place in february and march.at the end of phase,the court found the february settlement and two lease amendments did not violate the rso because the parties were sophisticated professionals who knew about the ordinance and had negotiated their agreements at arm length represented by counsel and supervised by a retired superior court judge.the court also found landlord had restored the property to a residence as of november.based on the trial court findings in phase,landlord filed a second amended adding a cause of action for breach of the lease.he argued tenant refusal to pay rent since judge abrams ruling in august lacked legal justification because phase established the lawfulness of those increases.
phase of the trial was tried to a jury.based on its phase rulings,the court prohibited tenant from informing the jury that judge abrams had found the rent increases violated the rso.to the contrary,the court instructed the jury that the negotiated rent increases in the settlement agreement and second lease amendment meant tenant could not claim that he overpaid rent.in addition,the court barred tenant from telling the jury that he had withheld rent payments to offset the rent increases.the court reasoned that tenant had assumed the risk of his own error in judgment in choosing not to pay rent based on judge abrams findings and he must live with the consequences of his error.
the jury issued a verdict with interrogatories.it found landlord breached the lease by overcharging tenant in late fees in,and awarded tenant statutory damages of three times the overcharge.it also found landlord had retaliated against tenant for exercising his rights,but determined tenant suffered no damages from the retaliation.the jury further found that for his part tenant had breached the lease by not paying in back rent.the jury also found tenant had breached either the do not report or do not interfere or both provisions of the settlement agreement,entitling landlord to a refund of the he paid under the settlement plus an additional in damages.after calculating prejudgment interest,attorney fees and costs,the court awarded a net recovery to landlord of more than.this appeal followed.
discussion 
illegality of rent increases 
in the unlawful detainer action,judge abrams found the property was a duplex.the unlawful detainer action arose from landlord service of a notice to tenant to terminate the tenancy and move out.judge abrams concluded the property was a duplex based on evidence of the property condition that the parties introduced during the unlawful detainer trial.the property status as a duplex was important because it answered what judge abrams called the only issue at trial which was whether the subject property is or is not subject the rso.judge abrams factual findings about the property included the following 
the property had two addresses.
each unit had its own full kitchen.tenant kitchen contained a refrigerator,sink,dishwasher,microwave,and stove,cabinets,and related small appliances.landlord kitchen contained a refrigerator,sink,dishwasher,microwave,cooktop,and cabinets.
tenant unit was about square feet,with four bedrooms,a den,three and bathrooms,a living room,dining room,laundry,and billiard room.
landlord unit was about square feet,with its own living room,bedroom,closet,and bathroom.
the occupant of each unit had no right of access to the other unit.
each unit had its own mailbox.
each unit had its own driveway and curbside address.
based on the foregoing facts,judge abrams found the property is a duplex and is being used as a duplex.because the property was a duplex,she concluded los angeles rso applied to it.and because the rso applied,she concluded landlord termination notice to tenant was invalid since it violated the rso.
the appellate department of the superior court affirmed judge abrams decision,and landlord suggests no basis for attacking her decision.the trial court here nevertheless rejected judge abrams findings out of hand,declaring it would not be considering them.denying any collateral estoppel value whatsoever to judge abrams findings,judge murphy told the parties first of all,another superior court opinion i would not be considering.it not precedent.it not the court of appeal.and because the appellate department decision was unpublished it is not something i have to follow.
the res judicata effect of an unlawful detainer proceeding is narrow,but is not nonexistent.generally speaking,an unlawful detainer judgment has limited res judicata force because it typically follows a summary proceeding focused only on deciding a party right to immediate possession of property.pelletier alameda yacht harbor d.but when litigants to an unlawful detainer proceeding fully try other issues besides the right of possession,the unlawful detainer judgment is conclusive as to those other litigated issues.vella hudgins cal d,pelletier alameda yacht harbor,supra,at.here,the parties litigated to final judgment the rsos applicability to the property.the rso imposes a statutory cap on the amount of rent a landlord may collect,subd.a it shall be unlawful for any landlord to demand,accept or retain more than the maximum adjusted rent permitted pursuant to this chapter or regulation or orders adopted pursuant to this chapter,b violation of rso a misdemeanor.the trial court therefore erred here in disregarding the effect of judge abrams findings as they applied to the rsos limits on the amount of rent landlord could collect from tenant.
the trial court compounded its error when it concluded the parties could by mutual agreement exempt the property from the rsos requirements in their february settlement and amendments to the lease.the rso prohibits any person from accept ing or retain ing rent that exceeds the rent set under the rsos provisions,a see also,amended effective april,unlawful for any landlord to accept or retain more than the maximum adjusted rent permitted under the rso.it follows that a landlord can not,even with the tenant acquiescence or by mutual agreement,circumvent that which the law prohibits an agreement that violates the law is void and unenforceable,any portion of contract that violates law is void a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.see gruzen henry d.because property did not have city of pasadena certificate of occupancy,rental agreement was void in unlawful detainer proceeding when pasadena ordinance criminalized leasing uncertificated property.
landlord asserts the rent increases under the settlement agreement and lease amendments are enforceable because parties may settle lawsuits involving rent control.city of los angeles superior court d,fn.see credit finance mox,settlement of case involving usury,recognizing usury,like rent control,is legally regulated in the public interest.landlord assertion fails,however,because it glosses over the difference between settling a dispute over,for example,the calculation of the correct amount of a rent increase versus a settlement in which violation of the ordinance is itself an element of the settlement.see credit finance mox,supra,recognizes distinction between settlement of usury claim versus entering into a usurious settlement.
by misperceiving the parties having a right to exempt the duplex from the rso limits on lawful rent,the court misinstructed the jury.first,the court instructed the jury that the settlement agreement meant tenant could not claim landlord charged more rent than the rso allowed.the court misinstruction eviscerated tenant cause of action to recover excess rent paid in violation of the rso.second,the court barred tenant from arguing to the jury that he had withheld rent to recover his rent overpayments.that misinstruction made landlord victory in his cause of action for breach of the lease a virtually foregone conclusion.indeed,the jury submitted a written question to the court during jury deliberations revealing the jury incomprehension of tenant behavior,asking why did landlord not force out tenant after several months of unpaid rent what specifically justified the two years without rent 
the jury verdicts involving breach of the lease and recovery of excess rent are fatally flawed.the unlawful detainer action established that the property was a duplex subject to the rso limits.those limits remained in place until the property resumed its condition as a residence,which phase i established was november.the jury should have had before it the question of whether tenant properly withheld rent in light of the finding of maximum rent made by judge abrams.the court should have instructed the jury on the effect of the earlier judgment.because it did not do so,the court broke both the sword and shield that the rso handed to tenant the sword to attack the excess rent as violating the rso,and the shield to defend against the charge that he had breached the lease by not paying rent.consequently,we must remand this matter for retrial of tenant cause of action to recover excess rent and landlord cause of action for breach of the lease.in that retrial,the court shall instruct the jury that the rso limited the rent increases landlord could impose while the property was a duplex to about percent a year.it will fall upon the parties to introduce evidence of the precise amount the rent adjustment commission allowed for any particular year.the court shall further instruct the jury that any rent increase greater than the amount permitted under the rso is unlawful,and thus,uncollectable,regardless of any private agreement or settlement between the tenant and landlord.
restoring property to residence 
tenant contends the trial court finding that landlord had restored the property as of november to its original condition of a residence was error.he argued the finding violated the res judicata effect of judge abrams conclusion that the property was a duplex.he cites no authority,however,that a property condition can not change.it follows,therefore,that,at least theoretically,judge abrams finding that the property was a duplex and the trial court finding that landlord had restored the property to a residence can be equally correct.
although tenant does not frame his contention as such,it amounts to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence that the property had been restored to a residence.when a party challenges on appeal the sufficiency of evidence,the party must discuss all the evidence supporting the court ruling or the party waives the point.foreman clark fallon cal d,nwosu uba th,d.here,tenant briefly summarizes the court reasons for concluding the property was a residence,but does not explain how those facts were unsupported by the record or legally irrelevant.for example,two
