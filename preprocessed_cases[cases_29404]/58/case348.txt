introduction 
proposition g is a san francisco ordinance that restricts a property owner ability to evict a tenant from a residential rental unit so that the unit can be used as a residence by the owner or a close family member.several property owners and three associations the plaintiffs sued the city and county of san francisco the city and others alleging,among other things,that proposition g is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to them.
the superior court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend as to each of the causes of action challenging the constitutionality of proposition g.we find that plaintiffs have alleged,or may well be able to allege,sufficient facts to support their claim that proposition g constitutes a taking of their property without just compensation in violation of the state and federal constitutions.therefore,we reverse the part of the judgment that is based on the trial court ruling sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.
ii.statement of facts 
proposition g 
the grounds pursuant to which a san francisco landlord may recover possession of a residential rental unit from a tenant are set forth in section of the san francisco residential rent stabilization and arbitration ordinance.admin.code,ch,hereafter section or.at a november election,the voters of san francisco enacted proposition g,which amended section by restricting the ability of an owner of residential rental property to evict tenants to enable the owner or owner relatives to move into a rental unit.
before proposition g was passed,section generally provided that any landlord with a sufficient ownership interest in a building could recover possession of a rental unit for use as a principal residence by the owner or owner close relative for a period of at least continuance months.section also contained a temporary moratorium precluding evictions of certain categories of elderly,disabled or catastrophically ill tenants so that the owner could use units occupied by those tenants as a principal residence for the owner or owner close relative 
proposition g amended section by,among other things,imposing the following restrictions 
the restriction a landlord may recover possession of a rental unit f or the landlord use or occupancy as his or her principal residence for a period of at least continuous months,subd.a i.once a landlord has successfully recovered possession of a rental unit for use as his or her principal residence,no other current or future landlords may recover possession of any other unit in the building for this purpose,subd.a vi.this restriction substantially altered the property owner previously unqualified right to recover a unit for purposes of owner occupancy.indeed,one owner exercise of the right to recover possession for owner occupancy can effectively extinguish this right with respect to all other current and future owners of the building 
the family occupancy restriction a landlord may recover possession of a rental unit for use or occupancy as a principal residence of a landlord close relative for a period of at least months,in the same building in which the landlord resides as his or her principal place of residency,or in a building in which the landlord is simultaneously seeking possession of a rental unit,subd.a ii.this restriction also substantially altered a previously unqualified right.under this provision,an owner can recover possession of a unit on behalf of a family member only if the owner will also live in the building.
the tenant protection restriction a landlord may not recover possession of a rental unit for use as a principal residence by the landlord or the landlord relative if any tenant in the rental unit is a years of age or older and has lived in the unit for or more years,or b disabled and has been residing in the unit for or more years,or c catastrophically ill and has been residing in the unit for or more years,subd.i.this restriction made permanent the temporary moratorium set forth in the prior version of section 
section applies to all landlords and tenants of rental units which are broadly defined as a ll residential dwelling units in the city together with the land and appurtenant buildings thereto,and all housing services,privileges,furnishings and facilities supplied in connection with the use or occupancy thereof,including garage and parking facilities,subd.r.several categories of housing accommodations are expressly excluded from this definition,and therefore not subject to proposition for example,the statutory definition excludes various forms of temporary housing,such as hotels,motels,and hospitals,and certain types of housing.perhaps the broadest category of excluded housing are rental units in a structure for which a certificate of occupancy was first issued after june,subd.r res.rent stab.arbit.board rules and,e.thus,the proposition g restrictions do not apply to residential rental property built after june.
in its brief to this court,the city stated that proposition g applies only to residential rental properties with three or more units.the city then filed an errata re respondent brief in which it stated that proposition g applies to buildings with two or more units.at oral argument,however,the city concurred with plaintiffs contention that single family dwellings are not excluded from the definition of rental units to which section applies,subd.r.
a tenant or the city rent board may bring a civil action for damages and other relief against a landlord who allegedly violates section.a violation of section can also constitute a misdemeanor,subds.e f.
b.the complaint 
on april,plaintiffs filed a first amended petition for writ of mandate and other relief and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief and for damages for inverse condemnation the complaint.in addition to challenging proposition g,plaintiffs also alleged that section of the san francisco planning code hereafter section or was invalid for several reasons.section,an ordinance which the lower court ultimately found to be invalid,imposed restrictions on a landlord right to remove his or her property from the rental market by,among other things,requiring certain owners to obtain conditional use permits before converting their property to residential housing 
the plaintiffs 
plaintiff keli cwynar cwynar owns part of a building in san francisco as a tenant in common with a married couple,sam and susan blum.cwynar and the blums purchased the property on october,at which time all three units were occupied by tenants.the blums currently reside in one of the units.cwynar would like to occupy one of the other two units as her principal residence,but she is prohibited by proposition g from evicting the tenants from either of the other two units.cwynar is also prohibited from recovering possession of one of the units for her sister to live in,as she had intended to do.
plaintiff cliff cox cox owns part of a building in san francisco as a tenant in common with his close friends bobby and louise crotwell.cox is a retired disabled school teacher who suffers from aids.louise crotwell is a nurse and bobby crotwell is a school teacher.the crotwells have two children.cox and the crotwells purchased the property in september with the intention that all of them would live in the same building so that louise crotwell could help take care of cox.each unit in the building is approximately square feet in size,too small to accommodate the crotwell family or cox.cox and the crotwells each intended to convert two of the units into one.all of the units are occupied by tenants.therefore,both cox and the crotwells are precluded by proposition g from residing in the building they own.
plaintiffs scott and caroline brooks the brooks,tran tran,christopher rankin rankin,and simon berry berry,along with craig greenfield,purchased a building in san francisco on february,with the intent that all would reside there.before purchasing the building,each of these plaintiffs was a tenant living in san francisco.the brookses moved into a vacant unit.however,since two of the units were occupied at the time the property was purchased,proposition g precluded these plaintiffs from recovering possession of those two units.therefore,these plaintiffs exercised their rights under the ellis act and initiated proceedings to remove their property from the rental market.however,tran and greenfield,and rankin and berry could not move into the two units without first complying with section,which required them to obtain a conditional use permit.thus,these plaintiffs could not live in their property or rent the units to tenants.
plaintiff mike howard howard owns a building in san francisco.howard would like to move his into the ground floor unit of that building which is located approximately block away from his home.however,howard is precluded by proposition g from evicting tenants from any of the units in the building he owns so his can move in.
plaintiff ed corvi corvi,a san francisco resident,owns a building in san francisco.one of the units is occupied by two of corvi sons.one of these sons is engaged to be married and wishes to live in another unit with his new wife.however,proposition g prohibits corvi from evicting tenants from any of the other units for this purpose.
plaintiff richard worner worner owns a building in san francisco.worner,a san francisco resident,purchased the building in and has lived there in the past but does not reside in the building at this time.worner would like his adult son to move into the basement unit of this building but is prohibited by proposition g from evicting the tenant in that unit.
plaintiff yasin salma salma,a san francisco resident for years,purchased a building in san francisco in june with the intention that his four children could each move into their own units.for example,one of salma daughters who just graduated from college would like to move into a unit that is occupied by a tenant whom salma believes is years of age or older and is the beneficiary of multiple trusts including one worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.proposition g prohibits salma from evicting any tenant so that any of his children can move into the building.
plaintiff greater association of san francisco realtors is an association of licensed real estate brokers and agents who depend for their livelihood upon the sale and management of real property in san francisco.plaintiff san francisco apartment association is an association of persons and entities who own residential apartment buildings in san francisco.plaintiff coalition for better housing is a trade organization of real property owners representing over residential units in san francisco.
claims pertaining to proposition g 
the first four causes of action in the complaint pertain to proposition plaintiffs allege that proposition g is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to them.they seek a writ of mandate,prohibition,certiorari or other appropriate relief first cause of action,declaratory relief second cause of action,injunctive relief third cause of action,and damages for inverse condemnation fourth cause of action.
in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that proposition g violates numerous distinct provisions of the federal and state constitutions.they allege that the proposition constitutes a taking of their private property for public use without just compensation,that it violates their fundamental right to live in property they own,that it violates equal protection,substantive and procedural due process,the right to travel and the right to structure and determine one family living arrangement.they also allege that proposition g illegally subjects them to civil and criminal liability for exercising their constitutional rights and that it is unconstitutionally vague.plaintiffs further allege that proposition g unconstitutionally impairs the obligations of contracts and violates their right to privacy.
in the fourth cause of action for inverse condemnation,plaintiffs allege two distinct theories in support of their takings claim.first,they allege that proposition g forces plaintiffs to suffer a physical invasion and occupation of their unique real property against their wishes and therefore constitutes a taking of plaintiffs private property for public use without just compensation.second,plaintiffs allege they have suffered a regulatory taking of their private property because they have been deprived of essential attributes of ownership of their private property including the right to possess and occupy it and to exclude others from it.the complaint alleges that proposition g compels the plaintiffs to rent their property to others when they desire for themselves or their family to principally reside in it.
proceedings in the lower court 
on may,the city filed a notice of demurrer and demurrer to the complaint.the city argued that each cause of action failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.in an order filed july,the lower court sustained the city demurrer to the first four causes of action without leave to amend.the court order states the court finds that on all bases alleged,plaintiffs can not state causes of action attacking the constitutional validity of proposition g 
the court also rejected plaintiffs contention that section was unconstitutional.however,the court ultimately prohibited the city from enforcing section based on its findings that the provision was preempted by the ellis act and that it was an illegal amendment to proposition 
on january,the court entered judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate prohibiting the city from enforcing section and dismissing plaintiffs remaining causes of action.plaintiffs appealed from the portion of the judgment sustaining the city demurrer without leave to amend to the first four causes of action pertaining to proposition 
iii.discussion 
standard of review and issue on appeal 
when a judgment is based on an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the appellant can establish error by showing either that the demurrer was erroneously sustained or that sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend was an abuse of discretion.smith county of kern th,d.sustaining a demurrer constitutes error if the complaint contains allegations that state a cause of action under any legal theory.saunders cariss d.sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is unwarranted,and ordinarily constitutes an abuse of discretion,if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.
in reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer we assume the truth of all properly pleaded material allegations of the complaint citations and give it a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.careau security pacific business credit,d.we must accept as true not only all facts alleged in the complaint but also facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.citation.smith county of kern,supra,th at,d.
in the present case,plaintiffs contend that proposition g violates numerous provisions of the state and federal constitutions.however,they have not set forth their distinct constitutional claims in separate causes of action instead,each cause of action seeks different forms of relief.furthermore,the only legal theories articulated in plaintiffs pleadings pertain to their takings claim perhaps for this reason,the parties have focused primarily on that claim.
in ruling on the city demurrer,the trial court did not address any specific constitutional provision.rather,the court simply held,without offering any analysis,that plaintiffs can not prove that proposition g is unconstitutional under any theory.
under these circumstances,we will limit our analysis of this case to the question of whether plaintiffs have alleged or can allege a violation of the takings clauses.because we answer this question in the affirmative,we conclude the demurrer should not have been sustained.
taking of property without just compensation 
our state and federal constitutions guarantee property owners just compensation when their property is taken for public use.cal,art.i,amend.kavanau santa monica rent control bd.cal th,d,kavanau.the determination that governmental action constitutes a taking is,in essence,a determination that the public at large,rather than a single owner,must bear the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest.agins city of tiburon,d agins.the question in any case where government action is challenged as violative of the right to just compensation,is whether the uncompensated obligations and restrictions imposed by the governmental action force individual property owners to bear more than a just share of obligations which are rightfully those of society at large.seawall associates city of new york,seawall.
there is no set formula applicable to all cases for determining when a regulation goes too far and effects a taking.loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d loretto.indeed,the united states supreme court has concluded that the inquiry in any particular case is essentially ad hoc citation and a question of degree that can not be disposed of by general propositions citation.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.however,over the years,rules have emerged to assist courts in evaluating takings claims.
a per se rule can be applied to two discrete categories of regulatory action which constitute takings as a matter of law.lucas south carolina coastal council,d lucas kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.first,government action that effectuates a permanent physical invasion of property,no matter how slight,constitutes a per se taking.loretto,supra,at.lucas,supra,at.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.second,regulatory action that deprives an owner of all economically beneficial or productive use of land effects a taking as a matter of law.lucas,supra,at.agins,supra,at.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.
government conduct that does not fall into a per se category may,nevertheless,constitute a regulatory taking.such regulations must be evaluated under the ad hoc analysis courts have traditionally employed.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d,yee city of escondido,d yee.two basic tests have been developed to assist courts in applying this essentially analysis.the first test focuses on the government purpose for enacting the regulation.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.under this formula,a regulation of property effects a taking if it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests.id.at,d,quoting agins,supra,at.see also nollan california coastal comm,d nollan santa monica beach,superior court cal th,d,santa monica beach.the second test focuses on the impact of the regulation on the property owner.under this test,a variety of factors may be relevant depending on the facts of the case at issue there is no comprehensive list to be mechanically applied.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.
as the united states supreme court has recently confirmed,when evaluating a regulatory takings claim,these factors should be considered and applied in light of the purpose of the takings clause,which is to prevent the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.citation.palazzolo rhode island,d.
in the present case,plaintiffs allege that proposition g constitutes both a per se physical taking and a regulatory taking.these are not separate claims.yee,supra,at.they are,rather,separate arguments in support of a single the ordinance effects an unconstitutional taking.id.at.as we will explain,we believe plaintiffs have alleged or can allege facts sufficient to support both of these arguments.
plaintiffs per se physical taking theory 
plaintiffs contend that proposition g constitutes a per se physical taking because it effectively grants tenants lifetime tenancies in plaintiffs buildings by depriving plaintiffs of their rights to both occupy their own property and to exclude others from their property so close family members may occupy it.
the united states supreme court first applied a per se rule to find a physical taking in loretto,supra,d.the challenged regulation was a new york law that required a landlord to permit installation of cable facilities on his or her rental property.the loretto court found the regulation effectuated a physical taking by applying the rule that a permanent physical occupation authorized by government is a taking without regard to the public interests that it may serve.id.at.
in the course of its discussion,the loretto court identified two questions that must be answered in the affirmative in order to find a physical taking.first,is the occupation of the property direct government authorized conduct outside the property itself may affect its use but does not amount to a physical invasion.loretto,supra,at.second,is the occupation permanent a law which effects a transitory invasion rather than a permanent one may be a taking but it does not amount to a per se physical taking.ibid.as the loretto court explained,t he permanence and absolute exclusivity of a physical occupation distinguish it from temporary limitations on the right to exclude.id.at,fn.
in the present case,plaintiffs have alleged that proposition g restriction and family occupancy restriction effectuate government authorized direct physical occupations of property that plaintiffs own and wish to use as a family residence.for example,the restriction forces plaintiff cwynar to permit someone else to live in and directly occupy a unit in her building where she would otherwise live.other plaintiffs are precluded by the family member restriction from removing tenants from units in buildings they own so that close family members can make those units their homes.
the complaint does not expressly state that the physical occupation about which plaintiffs complain is permanent,although clearly that is plaintiffs claim.they argue that proposition g has the effect of granting tenants lifetime tenancies while,at the same time,permanently depriving plaintiffs of their right to occupy substantial portions of their property.
there is authority that an eviction control regulation can satisfy the permanency requirement of a per se physical taking if the regulatory scheme gives the tenant a potentially endless leasehold and also denies the landlord the right to recover possession for personal use.ross city of berkeley,ross physical taking resulted from regulation that precluded owner from taking possession of commercial property after expiration of the tenant lease for the purposes of owner occupancy rivera cobian chinea,cir disapproved on other grounds in gilbert city of cambridge cir,fn.regulation preventing owner from taking possession of commercial property for personal use constituted a taking seawall,supra,at loss of possessory interests,including the right to exclude,resulting from tenancies coerced by the government would constitute a per se physical taking.in such a case,the prohibition on recovery of possession effectively extinguish es the plaintiffs possessory interest in a permanent manner.ross,supra.at.
we have found no california case which squarely holds that an eviction protection statute which nullifies an owner right to occupy his own property can constitute a per se physical taking.however,bakanauskas urdan d,supports such a rule.in that case,division three of this court rejected a tenant effort to resist eviction by a landlord who intended to use the rental unit as a personal residence.the bakanauskas court recognized that,without such a right,a landlord could be deprived,possibly indefinitely,of his or her own property which he or she desires,for personal reasons,to occupy as a personal residence,while the benefits of the property as a residence could be enjoyed indefinitely by the tenant.such a result would render the statute unconstitutionally confiscatory.id.at.
the city cites two cases in which courts in other jurisdictions rejected claims that eviction control provisions constituted per se physical takings.see troy renna cir troy dawson higgins,dawson.however,the eviction control measures at issue in those cases were significantly more limited than the proposition g restrictions in this case.troy,supra,at class of tenants protected from eviction upon conversion of unit to condominium limited by age,disability,length of tenancy and income dawson,supra,at provision precluding eviction for personal use applied only to units occupied by individuals who had been tenants in building for at least twenty years.the very different statutory schemes at issue in troy and dawson were found not to effectuate permanent occupations of landlord properties.troy,supra,at dawson,supra,at.however,we do not interpret either case as holding that an eviction control provision could never have such an effect.
as noted above,the complaint does not presently contain allegations that the physical occupation of plaintiffs property authorized by proposition g is permanent.however,the ross and seawall decisions lead us to conclude that plaintiffs may be able to satisfy the permanency requirement of a per se physical taking if they can show that proposition g effectuates coerced tenancies which effectively extinguish plaintiffs right to occupy substantial portions of their property.
the city maintains that plaintiffs can not make such a showing because the occupation of plaintiffs property by tenants is not coerced as a matter of law.we do not share the city certainty that no such showing can be made.
according to the city,proposition g does not authorize coerced tenancies because plaintiffs or their predecessors in interest voluntarily rented their property to the tenants protected by proposition g,and plaintiffs are free to exercise their rights under the ellis act to evict all of their tenants and to move into their own property.however,this argument overlooks the fact that at least some plaintiffs have alleged that they never voluntarily rented the property they now wish to possess.for example,when cwynar purchased her property she allegedly had both the intent and the right to evict the tenant in the unit she wished to occupy.proposition g now precludes her from exercising her ownership right to live in that unit.in addition,the city assumption that the right to withdraw from the rental market precludes plaintiffs from alleging coercion misses the mark.these plaintiffs have alleged that they wish to live in part of the property they own and to rent out another part and that such an arrangement was possible prior to proposition plaintiffs are now forced to permit someone else to live in a unit they wish to occupy.since plaintiffs do not have the option to cease renting only the units that were allegedly taken from them,the ellis act does not prevent them from alleging a forced occupation of their private property.
the city contends that yee,supra,at page,supports its position that plaintiffs who are landlords by choice,not by force,simply can not establish a compelled physical occupation of their property.yee involved a takings challenge to a mobile home rent control law which required mobile home park owners to set back rents for mobile home pads to levels and prohibited rent increases without approval of the city counsel.id.at.the yee court affirmed the sustaining of a demurrer to a complaint,filed by owners of a mobile home park,on the very narrow ground that plaintiffs failed to allege facts to support their claim that the rent control statute,on its face,constituted a per se physical taking.id.at.
the yee plaintiffs complaint about the rent control law was that the government had deprived them of the ability to determine who would be their tenants.existing law effectively precluded the yee plaintiffs from terminating the tenancy of a mobile home owner when the owner sold his home.according to the yee plaintiffs,the new rent control law was unconstitutional because it deprived them of the only mechanism they had to control the sale of a home located in their park,the ability to threaten to increase the rent for the mobile home pad.the yee court held that the plaintiffs did not have a per se right to compensation based on their inability to exclude particular individuals.yee,supra,at.
the yee court rejected the contention that the challenged law authorized a physical taking of the plaintiffs property.a per se physical taking results only from government authorization of a compelled physical invasion of property.yee,supra,at.the challenged law did not expressly compel plaintiffs to allow tenants to occupy their property.rather,it regulated the use of that property by regulating the relationship between landlord and tenant.id.at.the yee plaintiffs attempted to argue that the statutory scheme had the effect of forcing them to continue to rent their property.however,the court declined to address this argument since plaintiffs had not pleaded an as applied challenge to the statutory scheme.ibid.thus,while the yee court acknowledged that the right to exclude is one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property,it concluded that right had not been taken from the yee plaintiffs on the mere face of the escondido ordinance.ibid.
contrary to the city contention,yee does not preclude the plaintiffs in the present case from pleading and attempting to prove that proposition g authorizes a physical taking of their property.yee addressed a narrow facial challenge to a purely economic rent control law.in contrast to yee,the present case involves an as applied challenge to a statute that expressly restricts a property owner right to exclude others and to live in property that he or she owns.plaintiffs theory in this case is not that they have a constitutional right to choose their tenants but rather that they have a constitutional right to live in their own property.their claim is that they have suffered a physical taking with respect to the part of their property that proposition g precludes them from occupying.
the yee court did not expressly or implicitly overrule the line of authority we have already discussed recognizing that an eviction control ordinance may,under certain circumstances constitute a physical taking.to the contrary,the court acknowledged that a physical taking might be caused by a statute that,on its face or as applied,compel s a landowner over objection to rent his property or to refrain in perpetuity from terminating a tenancy.yee,supra,at.thus,the plaintiffs in this case are entitled to the opportunity to prove that proposition g is an unconstitutional taking as applied to them by showing that the challenged ordinance has the effect of compelling them to rent property or to refrain in perpetuity from terminating a tenancy.
the city focuses on the language in yee underscoring the requirement of a government compelled physical invasion of property.yee,supra,at.indeed,the element of government coercion is crucial.however,yee does not support the proposition that the option of leaving the rental market altogether is a mechanism for government coercion.the city overlooks the fact that the challenged statute in yee was a purely economic price control.in that context,the fact that the yee plaintiffs voluntarily rented their property necessarily established there was no physical occupation.here by contrast,the plaintiffs claim is that the challenged statute itself precludes owners from living in their own property by compelling them to rent property to someone else against their will.in this context,the fact that the property was voluntarily rented at some time in the past does not preclude the plaintiffs from pleading and proving government coercion.
the city contends that the ellis act necessarily counteracts the allegedly coercive aspects of proposition g.we disagree this contention is premised on a basic misunderstanding of the government coercion element of a physical takings claim.if a statute authorizes a compelled physical invasion of a landlord property,it is no answer to say that the landlord can avoid the invasion by ceasing to be a landlord.in this regard,the yee court expressly affirmed the rule first announced in loretto that a landlord ability to rent his property may not be conditioned on his forfeiting the right to compensation for a physical occupation.yee,supra,at,quoting loretto,supra,at,fn.as the court explained in loretto,t he right of a property owner to exclude a stranger physical occupation of his land can not be so easily manipulated.loretto,supra,at,fn.the city argues that this rule applies only to the initial occupancy and once the landlord has consented to that physical occupation,the government may force him to tolerate the occupation until he removes his property from the rental market.in our opinion,neither yee nor loretto support this proposition.
according to the city,the yee court rejected petitioners argument because,unlike loretto,where the court found a physical taking,the initial occupancy in yee had been at the invitation of the property owner.but the yee court did not hold or intimate that government coercion is relevant only if it corresponds to the initial physical occupation of the premises.in fact,as noted above,the court acknowledged that a statute compelling a landlord to refrain in perpetuity from terminating a tenancy might constitute a physical taking.yee,supra,at.see also florida power,d rejecting takings challenge to statute regulating amount a utility could charge a cable company to rent space on utility pole but acknowledging potential constitutional problem if regulation was interpreted as compelling utility to enter into,renew or refrain from terminating rental agreements.
nor does loretto support the city contention that the coercion must correspond to the initial occupation.in that case,the court struck down a statute requiring landlords to permit installation of cable equipment on their property.loretto,supra,d.but,contrary to the city contention,the initial attachment of cable equipment to the loretto plaintiff property was expressly authorized by the loretto plaintiff predecessor in interest.loretto,supra,at.notwithstanding that fact,the loretto court found the statute effected a physical taking of the loretto plaintiff property.
thus,contrary to the city contention,plaintiffs status as voluntary landlords does not preclude them from establishing that proposition g,as applied to them,effects a permanent physical taking of the portions of their property that they are precluded from occupying.the question is not whether the property owner is a landlord by choice.the question is whether the regulation at issue authorizes a compelled permanent physical occupation of the landlord property.the government must pay compensation when a regulation amounts to a physical taking whether or not the property at issue is owned by an individual who has chosen to be a landlord.see,loretto,supra,at.
we,of course,are not ruling that proposition g in fact constitutes a physical taking,but only that,at this stage of the proceedings,such a possibility can not be ruled out.put another way,we conclude that the plaintiffs may be able to allege that proposition g,as applied to them,effects a per se physical taking of their property.to do so,they must allege facts establishing not only coercion,but also permanent occupation of their rental property.though alleging such a claim will be difficult,it is the city contends and the trial court impossible task.
regulatory takings theories 
as we have explained,regulatory takings cases consist of ad hoc inquiries.the two general tests we have extracted from this body of case law are interrelated,and are sometimes combined into one test.see,kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.we keep them separate here for the sake of clarity and to illustrate that both tests support the conclusion that plaintiffs may be able to show that proposition g constitutes a regulatory taking.
the governmental purpose 
a property owner can prove that a regulation of his or her private property constitutes a taking by showing that the regulation does not substantially advance a legitimate state interest.agins,supra,at.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.there must be a sufficient nexus between the effect of the ordinance and the objectives it is supposed to advance.yee,supra,at.in the present case,the parties disagree as to how close this nexus must be.
the city contends that this substantially advance requirement is equivalent to the rational basis standard of review.we disagree.the united states supreme court has expressly stated that this standard is not the same as that applied to due process or equal protection claims we have required that the regulation substantially advance the legitimate state interest sought to be achieved,citation not that the state could rationally have decided that the measure adopted might achieve the state objective.nollan,supra,at,fn.
there is confusion among the courts as to how to apply the substantially advance requirement.different levels of scrutiny may be appropriate depending on the type of regulation at issue.santa monica beach,supra,cal th at,d.for example,courts have applied a heightened level of scrutiny to discretionary governmental determinations requiring owners to dedicate property or pay fees as a condition for an otherwise lawful use of property.see,ehrlich city of culver city cal th,d,ehrlich.at the other extreme,generally applicable zoning or price control regulations are sometimes subject to a more deferential review.santa monica beach,supra,cal th at,d.
the city contends it is entitled to deferential review because proposition g is a generally applicable rent control law.we disagree on both counts.first,proposition g clearly is not a typical rent control law.it does not regulate rents or any other economic aspect of the relationship.rather,proposition g precludes evictions from property the owner wishes to reclaim for personal use.as such,proposition g directly implicates property owners possessory rights.second,proposition g is not generally applicable,as the city contends.for example,it does not apply to rental units in buildings constructed after june,although it apparently does apply to homes built before that date.furthermore,owners who must comply with the proposition g restrictions are not subject to identical treatment.for example,a landlord who owns a building by him or herself is assured of a place to live in his or her property.do not enjoy that same right.further,an owner who resides in his or her building can evict a tenant from another unit in order to provide a home for a close family member.owners do not enjoy that same right.
in our view,the governmental justification for enacting proposition g should be closely scrutinized.it is not a,evenly applied regulation.it directly affects the possessory property rights of an apparently arbitrary category of property owners.the united states supreme court has cautioned that a regulation which affects a physical invasion of any degree merits special scrutiny.loretto,supra,at.our own supreme court agrees that t here is no question that the takings clause is specially protective of property against physical occupation or invasion ehrlich,supra,cal th at,d.
in any event,regardless of the degree of deference to which the measure is entitled,this record does not establish that,as a matter of law,proposition g substantially advances a legitimate government interest.plaintiffs have not conceded that any such interest is served,and the city submitted no evidence in the lower court to show that the substantially advance requirement is satisfied.indeed,in its memorandum in support of its demurrer,the city took the position that proposition g substantially advances a legitimate government interest on its face but the city position was and is based on the mischaracterization of this regulation as rent control.in our view,proposition g is not an ordinary rent control law it is not a price or rate regulation.proposition g restricts an owner right to use his or her property as a family home.
in its appellate brief,the city identifies three governmental interests maintaining a reasonable balance of and rental housing preserving affordable housing and avoiding displacement of,elderly and disabled tenants from their homes.we agree that these goals are certainly legitimate.courts have consistently recognized the state legitimate interest in providing and preserving affordable housing.see,leavenworth properties city and county of san francisco d.santa monica pines,rent control board cal d,disapproved on other grounds in city of west hollywood beverly towers,cal d.furthermore,although the city did not present any such evidence to the lower court,we have little doubt it could show that the stock of affordable rental housing in san francisco has diminished to the prejudice of low income,elderly,and disabled tenants.
the question here,however,concerns the means established by the local law purportedly to achieve th ese end s.in other words,can it be said that imposing the burdens of the regulation on the property owners substantially advances one of the aims articulated by the city.seawall,supra,at.
the city has not identified any evidence to support its claim that proposition g achieves a reasonable balance between and rental housing.and plaintiffs argue no such balance is achieved because the regulation does not adequately take into account the property owner individual need or special circumstance.plaintiffs allegations which,of course,we must accept for purposes of this review also suggest that the restriction favors wealthier individuals who can afford to purchase a building on their own.those individuals will always have access to a residential unit of some kind in their building.
as to its second goal,the city argues that,b y preventing landlords from evicting their tenants for owner,proposition g ensures that the apartments of such tenants will remain part of the city affordable rental housing stock.italics added.but,as the city has acknowledged,one consequence of proposition g is that,in order for more than one owner to live in the residential rental property,the entire property will have to be withdrawn from the rental market.this consequence of proposition g,which is demonstrated by the pleadings in this case,could conceivably result in a reduction of the city rental housing stock.
nor does this record support the conclusion that,as a matter of law,proposition g ensures that rental housing will be affordable.as we have already explained,proposition g is not a price or rate regulation and thus can not be routinely approved as rent control.the complaint allegations indicate that proposition g may actually reduce the amount of affordable housing in san francisco by,among other things,preventing residents with moderate incomes from ever buying rental property in this city because of the financial consequences of the restriction precluding property owners from providing housing to their children and other close relatives and unduly benefiting some high income tenants by granting them perpetual rights to occupy units that owners want to recover for personal use.
the city third goal offers only a partial justification for proposition on its face,the restriction substantially advances the city goal of avoiding displacement of elderly and disabled tenants many of whom may have low incomes.however,this and other provisions of proposition g may also have the effect of displacing elderly,ill,or disabled property owners relatives of property owners who are desperately in need of a home.furthermore,there is no evidence,nor even an argument advanced by the city,that this goal is advanced by the restriction or the family occupancy restriction which plaintiffs also challenge.
at this pleadings stage in the litigation,whether the restrictions imposed by proposition g substantially advance legitimate state interests is still an open question.thus,plaintiffs should not have been denied the opportunity to establish a regulatory taking by showing that these restrictions do not,in fact,advance legitimate state interests 
furthermore,even if the city does ultimately establish that proposition g substantially advances legitimate state interests,plaintiffs could still show that this regulation constitutes a regulatory taking.in other words,government is not automatically excused from liability under takings clauses simply because it acts in pursuit of an important public purpose.florida rock industries,united states.to so hold would eviscerate the plain language of the takings clause,and would be inconsistent with supreme court guidance.it is necessary that the government act in a good cause,but it is not sufficient.the takings clause already assumes the government is acting in the public interest nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.id.at.
the balancing test 
the takings clause is intended to preclude government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.armstrong united states,d.as noted above,several factors may be utilized by the property owner to show that the regulatory burden imposed on him is unconstitutional.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.
in the present case,the allegations in the complaint implicate several relevant factors which support plaintiffs contention that proposition g imposes a disproportionate burden on them by essentially requiring them to forfeit their own homes in order to create public housing.
when evaluating a regulatory takings claim it is appropriate to consider,among other things,the character of the governmental action at issue and the extent to which that action interferes with the property owner reasonable and primary expectations as to the use of his property.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to support their contention that proposition g substantially interferes with their reasonable and primary ownership expectations.plaintiffs have alleged that proposition g forces plaintiffs to suffer a substantial interference with their rightful use and enjoyment of their properties in conflict with their reasonable expectation that they their close relatives could occupy said properties plaintiffs have also alleged that proposition g has deprived them of essential attributes of ownership of their private property including the right to possess and occupy it and to exclude others from it.
another factor relevant to this inquiry is whether the regulation provides the property owner any benefits or rights that mitigate whatever financial burdens the law has imposed.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiffs contend they have been provided no such rights or benefits and the city does not dispute this.plaintiffs also contend that proposition g lacks any mitigation measure,any property owner hardship provision and any procedure for individualized consideration or treatment of a property owner.although some of the restrictions imposed by the proposition g amendments to section are subject to limited hardship exceptions,plaintiffs validly complain that there is no meaningful mechanism in the regulation for adequately considering or attempting to prevent possible unfair hardship to some property owners.
furthermore,the burden imposed on all property owners subject to the proposition g restrictions is clearly significant.under the traditional conception of property,the most important of the various rights of an owner is the right of possession which includes the right to exclude others from occupying or using the space.citation.seawall,supra,at.property rights in a physical thing include the rights to possess,use and dispose of it.loretto,supra,at.plaintiffs have alleged that proposition g has seriously abridged if not destroyed these important property rights.
the city offers us three grounds upon which,it contends,we can sustain the trial court conclusion that plaintiffs can not establish a regulatory taking as a matter of law.first,the city argues that government conduct resulting in the abridgement of a possessory ownership right does not offend the takings clause unless the abridgment is so complete that it effectuates a per se physical taking.but the governing authority is to the contrary.w hether the regulation extinguish es a fundamental attribute of ownership is clearly a relevant factor in a regulatory takings analysis.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.while a permanent physical invasion is always a taking,a physical invasion short of that must be evaluated under the ad hoc approach.loretto,supra,at.
second,the city argues that plaintiffs can not establish that proposition g is a regulatory taking because plaintiffs have not been denied all economically viable use of their property.but a r
