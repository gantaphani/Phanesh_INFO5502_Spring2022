plaintiffs christie and justin hjelm when referred to collectively,the hjelms leased an apartment in a large complex from prometheus real estate group prometheus.their apartment became infested with bedbugs,and the complex had an ongoing raw sewage problem,the upshot of which was that the hjelms and their children were forced to leave.the hjelms sued prometheus,and a jury returned a verdict for them.the trial court then awarded the hjelms their attorney fees based on civil code section.we affirm.
background 
in may,the hjelms signed a residential lease agreement,renting apartment in the chesapeake point apartments,san mateo the property.as prometheus itself describes it,the hjelms entered into a residential lease with prometheus for the property the hjelms signed the lease without any negotiation,indeed,while they were still out of state in their former home,the lease having been mailed to them.
the lease was a standard lease.the basic agreement was seven pages long and,with various addenda,it totaled pages.as discussed in detail below,the lease and one addendum had three provisions allowing prometheus to recover attorney fees,all of them,allowing fees only to prometheus.
in june,the hjelms moved into apartment.fifteen months later,they moved out,their apartment plagued by a bedbug infestation that prometheus failed to address,not to mention that there was raw sewage on the property.
in september,the hjelms filed suit against prometheus.the operative first amended complaint complaint alleged seven causes of action,styled as follows negligence premises liability constructive eviction breach of warranty of habitability negligent infliction of emotional distress breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and nuisance.the complaint referred to prometheus duty under the lease to provide the hjelms safe and habitable premises,illustrated,for example,by the cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment,which specifically alleged that through the lease of the premises,as well as implicit in plaintiffs tenancy,the hjelms were entitled to quiet enjoyment of their tenancy as it is defined by civil code.the prayer sought damages and among other things attorney fees pursuant to contract and statute.
prometheus filed a general denial that included numerous affirmative defenses,some relevant only to contract claims,illustrated by the fifteenth,which alleged that plaintiffs substantially and materially breached the contract complained of prior to commencement of this action,which conduct extinguishes the right to maintain the instant action.the thirteenth affirmative defense alleged that the applicable statute of limitations were code of civil procedure sections contract and breach of written lease.
prometheus filed two motions for summary adjudication on the issue of the hjelms entitlement to attorney fees.both motions were denied,the trial court concluding that civil code section section applied,to render the attorney fees provisions reciprocal should the hjelms prevail at trial.thus,for example,the second order held in pertinent part as follows while defendant argues at length that the multiple attorney fees provisions contained in the parties written lease are applicable only in specific circumstances,plaintiffs are correct in pointing out that these circumstances cover nearly every situation in which the landlord would be aggrieved.there is no reciprocal remedy for any situation in which the tenant is the injured party.the court notes that paragraph of the lease,which contains an attorney fee provision,contains this language resident s shall further indemnify,defend and hold harmless management from and against all claims arising from any breach of default in the performance of any obligation on resident s part to be performed under the terms of the rental agreement.such a attorney fee provision is in violation of civil code a.trope katz cal th.
the case proceeded to jury trial,with the honorable joseph bergeron presiding.trial began on march,with testimony taken over eight days.on april,the jury returned a verdict for the hjelms on all counts,awarding economic damage to the hjelms in the amount of damage to christine hjelm of and damage to justin hjelm of.prometheus did not ask for any clarification of the damages.
judge bergeron entered judgment on april,and the hjelms gave notice of entry on april.
on april,prometheus filed a notice of intention to move for new trial.judge bergeron denied it by order of june.
meanwhile,on april,the hjelms filed a motion for attorney fees.the original moving papers totaled some pages,including a lengthy declaration and a supplemental declaration from the hjelms attorney supporting the amount sought.prometheus filed lengthy opposition,and the hjelms a reply.the motion came on for hearing on june,following which judge bergeron permitted prometheus to file a supplemental brief concerning a new case it had cited at the hearing,addressing an issue of apportionment,a brief that was filed.
meanwhile,following the june hearing,three minute orders were entered that day.one denied a new trial.another,that pertinent here,ordered that plaintiff motion for an order,awarding reasonable attorney fees is granted.amount of attorneys fees to be determined after further briefing by counsel.
on june,judge bergeron filed two formal orders,one denying prometheus motion to tax costs,the other denying prometheus motion for new trial.he also filed a final judgment after verdict which,as pertinent here,recited that he granted the hjelms motion for an order awarding reasonable attorney fees in the amount of the court finds that the amount of fees requested is reasonable.therefore,the hjelms are awarded in attorney fees.
on august,prometheus filed its notice of appeal.
discussion 
introduction 
prometheus has filed a appellant opening brief.it has two arguments.the first,comprising some percent of the argument,is that the attorney fee award was incorrect and should be reversed.the second is that the underlying verdict should be reversed.since the second argument,if successful,would render the attorney fee award and the first argument moot,we begin with it.and conclude it can not succeed the appeal as to the verdict is untimely,not to mention premised on a factual representation in utter disregard of the rules of appellate procedure.
no appeal of the verdict can succeed 
as noted above,judgment on the jury verdict was entered on april.notice of entry was served on april and filed on april.so,under the general rule,any appeal would have to be filed within sixty days.cal.rules of court,rule.however,on april,prometheus moved for a new trial.and,as noted,judge bergeron denied it by minute order of june.an order denying new trial was approved by prometheus counsel on june and filed on june.thus california rules of court,rule b b governed the time to appeal if any party serves and files a valid notice of intention to move for a new trial,the following extensions of time apply if the motion for a new trial is denied,the time to appeal from the judgment is extended for all parties until the earliest of a days after the superior court clerk or a party serves an order denying the motion or a notice of entry of that order rule,subd.b a b days after denial of the motion by operation of law,subd.b b.thus,the time to appeal expired on july.
on june,judge bergeron also entered a new judgment that restated the denial of the motion for new trial and awarded the hjelms attorney fees.
prometheus filed its notice of appeal august.that appeal was timely to attack the attorney fee award.but not the verdict.and judge bergeron second judgment does not help prometheus.
torres city of san diego th torres is on point.and dispositive.there,city retirement board members obtained summary judgment on their claims the city had to pay for their defense in an action against them filed by the city attorney.the city filed a late notice of appeal,and the court of appeal dismissed it.the trial court later issued an order awarding attorney fees.the city appealed again,which appeal included an attack on the summary judgment.the court of appeal dismissed the appeal to the extent it concerned the summary judgment.discussing the effect of a second judgment,the court began by noting that the effect of an amended judgment on the appeal time period depends on whether the amendment substantially changes the judgment or,instead,simply corrects a clerical error.id.at,quoting eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals writs the rutter group,to.and the court concluded,it is well settled,however,that w here the judgment is modified merely to add costs,attorney fees and interest,the original judgment is not substantially changed and the time to appeal it is therefore not affected.accord,laraway pasadena unified school dist.th.
dakota payphone,llc alcarez th,discusses torres and its holding at length 
in torres,supra,th,the issue was whether the amendment of the judgment to include an amount for attorney fees and costs was a substantial amendment,enabling the court to consider the propriety of granting summary judgment.id.at.again citing the rutter group treatise on civil appeals and writs,the torres court concluded that there is no substantial modification to a judgment when it is merely amended to add costs,attorney fees and interest.torres,supra,th at.the cases that have developed this rule with respect to attorney fees and interest appear to find ultimate support for their position in the line of cases that hold that postjudgment awards of attorney fees,costs and interest are separately appealable matters collateral to the actual judgment if they are not included therein.see robinson city of yucaipa th,fourth,div.two grant list lathrop th,norman krug real estate investments,praszker d.in light of these rulings and the line of cases that they represent,it makes sense to conclude that a separately appealable order after final judgment does not substantially modify the judgment itself for purposes of computing the time in which to file a notice of appeal.any problem the parties might have with the amendment can be pursued through a separate appeal of the postjudgment order.
in sum,to the extent the appeal sought to attack the verdict,it was too late.but even if it were not,we would refuse to consider it,because prometheus brief violates settled rules of appellate procedure.
to put the issue in context,prometheus brief statement of facts refers to the hjelms contention that their apartment was uninhabitable,ignoring,of course,all the evidence in the case supporting the facts of the bedbug infestation.prometheus brief then goes on to discuss the companies it hired to address the problem,and on which it relied,ignoring,along the way,just what prometheus own responsibility was and how it was not met.
and as to the raw sewage issue,this is how prometheus brief describes it another issue at trial was the hjelms complaint of sewage in the common area behind their apartment.citations.hjelm testified that she and her husband had reported the sewage issue to prometheus,but neither she nor her husband provided a written complaint.citation.she further testified that prometheus scheduled a time to fix the sewer line and that its maintenance employees responded to her complaints,although ineffectively in her opinion.citation asserting that prometheus maintenance employees would use little tools,but not fix anything.the evidence further showed that prometheus was seeking a solution for repairing the sewer line citation,but the issue was not resolved during the hjelms tenancy.citation.
then,in its argument asserting there was no evidence that prometheus breached the standard of care applicable to property managers,prometheus fundamentally argues that the hjelms provided no expert witness,at least not one with the required qualifications.as prometheus sums up at one point,t hus,while kaae testimony may have been relevant to the standard of care applicable to professionals in the pest control industry,it was not relevant to the property management industry.prometheus says the same thing about the sewer line,and then sums up by reference to its expert,who,it claims,provided the only competent expert testimony on the subject of property management.
prometheus argument has several fundamental flaws.
to begin with,prometheus may be content to call itself a property manager.the fact is,it signed the lease.
second,prometheus cites nothing supporting the proposition that one needs expert testimony to support a claim that bedbug infestation raw sewage on the property may violate the warranty of habitability or the covenant of quiet enjoyment.put otherwise,is that not something that might be within the knowledge of an average juror 
third,and most fundamentally,prometheus brief ignores all the evidence and much there was in the trial about prior complaints about bedbugs and about the lack of training prometheus gave to its employees about how to address the issue.a few illustrations should suffice.
prometheus employee jennifer lau testified that the tenants of made several complaints about bedbugs.terminex employee joel pangilinan testified that the bedbug infestation was severe.
the hjelms expert on bedbugs,richard kaae,confirmed that prometheus had not followed its own bedbug policy in this case indeed,that its bedbug policy was inadequate,even if it had been followed.because bedbug detection is so difficult,it should not be left to prometheus untrained maintenance crew.
the evidence also established that prometheus failed to adequately train their management personnel,and that there was such significant turnover that new employees often did not even have the ability to consult with their predecessors.kevin song,the property manager at the complex in august,testified that he received very little training or support from management.when he began his job,he learned that one of the buildings had a bedbug infestation that had not been addressed for over a year.he had no prior experience dealing with bedbugs,and was unaware of prometheus bedbug policy.
multiple witnesses testified to observing the raw sewage on the property behind the apartment buildings.lau testified that she called for support to clean up raw sewage upon seeing toilet paper floating up onto the property grounds,and cleaned it up herself on at least one occasion.song said that prometheus just fixed the sewage in a patchwork way.all this was against the background that prometheus own expert,david saldivar,conceded that raw sewage is a public health and safety emergency.
none of this is mentioned in prometheus brief,which recites the facts favorable to it.such conduct is not to be condoned,as we said in in re marriage of davenport th,going on to explain why 
california rules of court,rule a c provides that an appellant opening brief shall p rovide a summary of the significant facts and the leading california appellate practice guide instructs about this before addressing the legal issues,your brief should accurately and fairly state the critical facts including the evidence,free of bias,and likewise as to the applicable law.misstatements,misrepresentations material omissions of the relevant facts or law can instantly undo an otherwise effective brief,waiving issues and arguments it will certainly cast doubt on your credibility,may draw sanctions citation,and may well cause you to lose the case eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,italics omitted.prometheus brief ignores such instruction.
the brief also ignores the precept that all evidence must be viewed most favorably to the hjelms and in support of the verdict.nestle city of santa monica cal d,foreman clark fallon cal d.
what prometheus attempts here is merely to reargue the facts as it would have them,an argumentative presentation that not only violates the rules noted above,but also disregards the admonition that it is not to merely reassert its position at trial.conderback,standard oil d,accord,albaugh shasta power cal d.in sum,prometheus brief manifests a treatment of the record that disregards the most fundamental rules of appellate review.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.as justice mosk well put it,such factual presentation is but an attempt to reargue on appeal those factual issues decided adversely to it at the trial level,contrary to established precepts of appellate review.as such,it is doomed to fail.hasson ford motor cal d.
and fail it does,as we deem the argument waived.see schmidlin city of palo alto th,where a party presents only facts and inferences favorable to his or her position,the contention that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence may be deemed waived nwosu uba th.
the attorney fee award was proper 
background and introduction to the issue 
as mentioned,two different provisions in the lease provided for attorney fees,paragraph and,as follows 
paragraph resident s agrees that if they fail to vacate past the ending date of a proper notice to terminate by either party,sic shall become a holdover tenancy commencing with the first day after the expiration of the notice period,and that resident s shall be responsible for all losses suffered by management and displaced tenants who anticipated taking occupancy at the end of the notice period,including attorney fees and costs.
paragraph this agreement is made on the express condition that management is to be free from all liability or loss caused by resident s,or resident s guests,agents or invitees,improper,negligent or intentional acts or omissions resident s hereby covenants and agrees to indemnify,hold harmless,and defend management against all claims,losses or liabilities by resident s or resident s agents or invitees,unless such claim,loss or liability is solely as a result of management gross negligence or willful misconduct.such indemnification shall include and apply to attorney fees,investigator costs,and other costs actually incurred by management.resident s shall further indemnify,defend and hold harmless management from and against any and all claims arising from any breach or default in the performance of any obligation on resident s part to be performed under the terms of this rental agreement.
the mold addendum also had a fee provision resident agrees to defend,indemnify and hold harmless management from claims,liabilities,losses,damages and expenses including attorneys fees,that they incur that are related to the resident breach of the resident obligations to management.
in light of these provisions giving prometheus the right to recover attorney fees if it were to sue the hjelms,the hjelms sought attorney fees under section.judge bergeron agreed,and awarded the hjelms fees.
prometheus appeals,its fundamental argument being that section does not apply,an argument with three,described by prometheus as follows 
the hjelms asserted no contract claims,so section did not apply.
the hjelms elected and accepted a distinctive tort remedy,emotional distress damages,so their action was not on a contract under section 
the lease contained three narrow attorney fee provisions that did not apply to the hjelms noncontract claims.
section and its application 
section provides in pertinent part in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs,subd.a.
the primary purpose of section is to establish mutuality of remedy when a contractual provision makes recovery of attorneys fees available to only one party,and to prevent the oppressive use of attorneys fee provisions.trope katz,supra,cal th at santisas goodin cal th.the section reflects legislative intent that equitable considerations must prevail over both the bargaining power of the parties and the technical rules of contractual construction.international industries,olen cal d.so,to achieve its goal,section generally must apply in favor of the party prevailing on a contract claim whenever that party would have been liable under the contract for attorney fees had the other party prevailed.scott blount,cal th,accord,santisas,supra,at.in short,section was enacted to avoid the perceived unfairness of attorney fee provisions.international billing services,emigh th.
finally,and fundamentally,california courts liberally construe the term on a contract as used within section.citation.as long as the action involve s a contract it is on the contract within the meaning of section.citations.dell merk,franzia th,care,century convalescent centers,d.
the hjelms sued on a contract 
prometheus first argument is that section did not apply because the hjelms alleged no contract claims.prometheus is wrong.
among other things,the hjelms sued for breach of the warranty of habitability.such claim can be a contract action with contract damages.see generally witkin,summary of cal.law.ed.real property,fairchild park th.
prometheus recognizes this principle,but attempts to distinguish it away,its opening brief stating as follows moreover,while a claim for breach of the warranty of habitability or breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment may sound in contract,the facts necessary to support such claims may also be pled in tort.see stoiber honeychuck d,assuming appropriate pleadings of fact,a tenant may state a cause of action in tort against his landlord for damages resulting from a breach of the implied warranty of habitability see also green superior court cal d,recognizing a common law implied warranty of habitability in residential leases in california.here,the hjelms pled facts sounding in tort only and they sought tort damages with respect to all seven of their claims,including breach of warranty of habitability and breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment.citations specifically seeking damages for emotional distress.
prometheus attempt at distinction is myopic the hjelms claims were not in tort only.erlach sierra asset servicing,llc th persuasively shows why.there,in a demurrer case,the court of appeal summed up its discussion and its holding for plaintiffs as follows here,the complaint contains causes of action for breach of the warranty of habitability in various forms violation of california civil code section tortious violation for breach of the warranty of habitability intentional infliction of extreme emotional distress negligent infliction of extreme emotional distress and negligence violation of duty to maintain habitable conditions.based on the foregoing,we can not say as a matter of law that these causes of action are not viable.erlach sierra asset servicing,llc,supra,at.so,the warranty of habitability claim can take many forms,as the hjelms demonstrated here.
in sum,the claim for breach of warranty of habitability was on the contract.so,too,the claim for constructive eviction.it,too,arises from the lease,as conceded by prometheus counsel below,conceding that apportionment under proposition was not proper because constructive eviction is not a tort claim.
beeman burling d is instructive.there,a plaintiff brought a wrongful eviction action under a housing ordinance,and was awarded economic damages,emotional distress damages,and punitive damages.the court held that the plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees under section because his action was fundamentally based upon the lease.id.at see also bruckman parliament escrow d,action was on a contract even though it also contained negligence claims.
in sum,courts have found claims to be on a contract in a variety of circumstances extending beyond a direct breach of contract claim.see,in re tobacco cases i th,action for declaratory and injunctive relief to enforce consent decree kachlon markowitz th,equitable action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and quiet title based on violations of the terms of a promissory note and deed of trust mitchell land improvement ristorante ferrantelli,th,unlawful detainer action based on a lessee breach of covenants in a lease.
summing up in a lengthy exposition of the law,the court in douglas barnhart,cmc fabricators,th,distilled the following principle an action or cause of action is on a contract for purposes of section if the action or cause of action involves an agreement,in the sense that the action or cause of action arises out of,is based upon,or relates to an agreement by seeking to define or interpret its terms or to determine or enforce a party rights or duties under the agreement,and the agreement contains an attorney fees clause.
prometheus second is that the hjelms elected and accepted distinctive tort remedies,so their action was not on a contract within the meaning of section.prometheus is wrong again.
the argument begins this way in addition to alleging tort claims only,the hjelms elected distinctive tort remedies they sought,and were awarded,emotional distress damages,further barring section application here.perry robertson d at perry fairchild park th,fairchild stoiber honeychuck,supra,d at stoiber.this is a less than accurate description of the record.
while the hjelms were in fact awarded emotional distress damages,this does not mean they elected distinctive tort remedies.they elected nothing.as noted,the hjelms complaint alleged contract claims.the jury was instructed on contract claims.the lawyers argued contract claims.and the jury in fact awarded the hjelms economic damages,not just damages for emotional distress.
prometheus states that the trial court instructed the jury as to negligence,but not breach of contract.rt.had prometheus read a few pages later in the instructions,however,it would come upon the special instructions,which included these 
every lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord promises to allow the tenant to quiet enjoyment of the premises.if the defendant prometheus real estate group act or omissions substantially interfered with christie hjelm and justin hjelm right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy,the defendant,prometheus real estate group,has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
if defendant prometheus real estate group acts or omissions affected christie hjelm and justin hjelm use or enjoyment of the property and the hjelms were compelled to vacate,there is a constructive eviction and christie hjelm and justin hjelm are not liable for the remaining portion of rent under the lease.
under the implied warranty of habitability in a residential lease,the defendant,prometheus real estate group,promised that premises leased to christie hjelm and justin hjelm would be maintained in a habitable state for the duration of the lease.defendant,prometheus real estate group,was required to maintain a building,grounds,and all area of the all area under its control clean,sanitary,and free from all accumulations of debris,filth,rubbish,garbage,rodents,and vermin.
if you decide that christie hjelm and justin hjelm have proven their claim against prometheus real estate group,you must decide how much money will reasonably compensate christie hjelm and justin hjelm for the harm.this compensation is called damages.the amount of damages must include an award for each item of harm that was caused by prometheus real estate group wrongful conduct,even if that particular harm could not have been anticipated.
christie hjelm and justin hjelm do not have to prove the exact amount of damages that will provide reasonable compensation for the harm however,you must not speculate or guess in awarding damages.the damages claimed by christie hjelm and justin hjelm for the harm caused by prometheus real estate group fall into two categories called economic damages and noneconomic damages.you will be asked on the verdict form to state the two categories of damages separately.
the following are the items of economic damages claimed by christie hjelm and justin hjelm property damage moving expenses and lost earnings.
christie hjelm and justin hjelm seek damages from prometheus real estate group under more than one legal theory however,each item of damages may be awarded only once regardless of the number of legal theories alleged.you will be asked to decide whether prometheus real estate group is liable to christie hjelm and justin hjelm under the following reasonable theories negligence premises liability constructive eviction breach of the implied warranty of habitability negligent infliction of emotional distress breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment nuisance.
economic damages are recovered sic recoverable under the following legal theories negligence premises liability constructive eviction breach of the implied warranty of habitability breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.
noneconomic damages are recovered sic recoverable under the following legal theories negligence premises liability constructive eviction breach of the implied warranty of habitability negligent infliction of emotional distress breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and nuisance.
the jury verdict included findings for the hjelms on multiple theories,including their claims for constructive eviction,breach of the warranty of habitability,and breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.and the jury answered y es,the hjelms were damaged under each theory,in answers to questions,and.
the penultimate page of the verdict reads as follows 
if christie hjelm and justin hjelm have proved any damages,then please proceed below.
if you answered yes to any of the following questions question no,or,please answer the following section 
what are christie hjelm and justin hjelm total economic damages

total economic damages 
if you answered yes to any of the following questions question no,please answer the following section 
what are christie hjelm total damages 
loss for christie hjelm 
past noneconomic loss,including 
mental suffering and emotional distress 
future noneconomic loss,including 
mental suffering and emotional distress 
total damages for christie hjelm 
in sum and in short,the hjelms sued on theories that included contract.the jury found for the hjelms on those theories,and that prometheus breach or violation caused damage.those theories included constructive eviction.there is no doubt that is a contract claim,as prometheus own counsel acknowledged below,in the post instruction argument conference,where prometheus was arguing,however belatedly,for proposition apportionment.and prometheus counsel said,w e only asking for a portion as to the tort causes of action.constructive eviction is a contract claim.we not asking for an apportionment on that.
the three cases cited by prometheus are not to the contrary indeed,they support the hjelms.
perry,supra,d,the primary case on which prometheus relies,was an action by perry against her real estate broker and salespersons,claiming she received inadequate compensation for the sale of her home due to their negligence in drafting the written sales agreement.the complaint was in a single count,the court noted,with allegations adequate to tender both the tort and contract claims for relief.id.at.perry won and the trial court awarded her attorney fees.defendants appealed,and the court of appeal affirmed,ending its opinion with this the question is whether plaintiff may pursue a breach of contract theory of remedy when defendants have negligently failed to adequately perform a contractual undertaking.such an action is one to enforce the provisions of the contract.for the reasons given,we hold that when the prevailing plaintiff in such an action has not elected a distinctive remedy in tort,such an action may be,and here is,on a contract within the meaning of section.id.at.
prometheus reliance on the observation in the case that perry did not pursue damages for personal injuries,a characteristic tort remedy has nothing to do with the case here,where the hjelms did pursue both contract and tort claims.prometheus reliance on perry is hard to understand.its reliance on fairchild is astonishing.
in fairchild,supra,th,a tenant was successful in suing his landlord,but the trial court denied him attorney fees.the court of appeal reversed.doing so,this is how the court described the issue the landlord contends that the tenants are not entitled to attorney fees under the lease because they prevailed
