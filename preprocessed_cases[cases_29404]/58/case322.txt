the ordinance the city of san jose the city has enacted and administers a mobilehome rent control ordinance the ordinance.san jose municipal code,tit,ch.the ordinance seeks to protect mobilehome park residents from unreasonable rent increases.residents may forgo those protections by voluntarily entering leases,which are exempt from rent control,subd.
summary of proceedings below plaintiff complaint for unfair business practices alleged that defendants violated the ordinance by unlawfully forcing mobilehome park tenants to accept leases in order to avoid rent control.following a lengthy bench trial,the court concluded that defendants had violated the ordinance and that those violations constituted unfair business practices.the court entered judgment against defendants,which requires them to pay in restitution and in civil penalties.

as we explain below,we affirm the judgment.
background 
for context,we begin with a brief overview of mobilehome tenancies.against that backdrop,we set forth the factual and procedural history relevant to this appeal.
mobilehome tenancies 
in california,mobilehome tenancies are governed by the mobilehome residency law,et the law extensively regulates the relationship between mobilehome park owners and residents.greening johnson th,d.
the protections afforded by the mobilehome residency law reflect legislative recognition of the unique nature of mobilehome tenancies.see,subd.a.ordinarily,mobilehome park tenants own their homes but rent the spaces they occupy.see,subd.once a mobilehome is in place in a park,it is difficult to relocate,subd.d yee escondido,d greening johnson,supra,th at,d rancho santa paula mobilehome park,evans th,d.its owner thus is more likely to be a resident.rancho santa paula mobilehome park,evans,supra,th at,d.in many cases,mobilehome park tenants have limited and undesirable options if they find living in the park no longer desirable,practical,or possible ibid.
given the singular nature of mobilehome tenancies,mobilehome park tenants are particularly vulnerable both to eviction and to rent increases.for that reason,california mobilehome residency law protects mobilehome owners against arbitrary evictions.see,yee escondido,supra,at.the state law affords these protections even to mobilehome park residents in tenancies.locally,the ordinance offers such residents protection from unreasonable rent increases.see.residents may forgo the ordinance rent safeguards by voluntarily entering rental agreements with terms longer than one year,which are exempt from rent control under the local act,subd.see also.
ii.factual background 
starting in,defendants entered into a number of leases for lots in their respective mobilehome parks.some of the leases included renewal provisions that resulted in effective terms as long as years.defendants leases fell into two categories.
one category of leases consists of those that defendants made directly with residents of their parks direct leases 
in the second category are leases that defendants made with mobilehome dealers dealer leases.two dealers were parties to the dealer leases at issue here new horizon mobile homes and united mobile homes.consistent with common practice,the dealers placed new mobilehomes for sale in spaces in defendants parks.the dealers signed leases for those spaces.upon sale of the mobilehome sited there,the purchaser the prospective resident of the park was required to assume the dealer lease or to sign a new lease with similar terms.as lessees,the dealers customers were not protected by the rent control provisions of the ordinance.
iii.procedural history 
acting through the santa clara county district attorney,plaintiff filed this civil action for unfair business practices in december.in addition to defendants,the complaint named a mobilehome dealership,new horizon mobile homes,and its owner,faramarz john naimi in august,plaintiff filed an amended and supplemental complaint.
in may,defendants demurred to the amended complaint and also moved to strike part of its prayer.in july,the court overruled defendants demurrer,denied their motion to strike,and ordered them to answer the complaint 
in july,defendants against the city,asserting that the ordinance effected an unconstitutional taking.the trial court bifurcated proceedings on the 
in december,plaintiff moved for leave to further amend its complaint by adjusting the dates in the third and fourth causes of action and by revising the prayer.the court later granted the motion,when plaintiff renewed it during trial.as amended,the complaint asserted nine causes of action,all alleging unfair business practices in violation of state statutes.bus,et.
the matter proceeded to court trial.opening statements were heard on january.in the ensuing weeks,dozens of witnesses testified,and more than exhibits were received in evidence.closing arguments were made on february.
the court issued its notice of intended decision shortly thereafter.the court announced its intent to render judgment for plaintiff and against defendants on the third and fourth causes of action of the amended complaint,concluding none of the other claims set forth in the complaint were proved.
both parties requested a statement of decision.in may,the court issued two statements of decision,one in response to each side request 
as relevant here,the court concluded that the dealer leases were not exempt from the ordinance.defendants nonetheless required prospective tenants purchasing new mobile homes from united mobilehomes and new horizon to assume dealer leases or sign new leases with the identical terms.by thus enforcing the dealer leases against consumers,the court explained,defendants violated ordinance provisions that prohibit park owners from requiring prospective tenants to sign leases as a condition of tenancy.the court further determined those violations of the ordinance constituted separate and independent violations of the unfair practices law.the court also found that defendants conspired with the dealers to violate the ordinance and the statute.
the court determined that violations occurring as early as january,were actionable.it first explained those leases were never exempt.defendants committed an unlawful business practice each time they collected rents on those leases.it further explained the statute of limitations does not begin to run on wrongful acts committed pursuant to a civil conspiracy until the completion of the last overt act of that conspiracy.citation.therefore,the statute of limitations has not begun to run on defendants violations of business and professions code section because defendants are still enforcing their unlawful leases.
in june,the court entered judgment,which it modified later that month.the judgment includes a permanent injunction that prohibits defendants from charging rents in excess of permissible amounts under the rent control provisions of the ordinance.the judgment also requires defendants to pay in restitution,divided among more than affected tenants in specified amounts.in addition,the judgment imposes civil penalties totaling against defendant beaumont investments and against defendant san jose investments.
in august,the court denied defendants motions to vacate the judgment and for a new trial.
in september,defendants filed their notice of appeal from the modified judgment and from the denial of their posttrial motions.in october,this court denied defendants petition for a writ of supersedeas,by which they sought a stay of the injunctive provisions of the judgment pending resolution of this appeal.shortly thereafter,we dismissed the appeal for failure to file the required california rules of court,rule statement we later reinstated it on defendants motion.the appeal now stands fully briefed,argued and ready for our resolution.
contentions 
defendants make the following contentions in this appeal 
i.the trial court erred in finding that the dealer leases violated the ordinance.
ii.the trial court erred in imposing the civil penalties.the court was without jurisdiction to determine and punish ordinance violations in the first instance,absent prior administrative notice of violation and an opportunity to cure.alternatively,even if the court had jurisdiction to impose civil penalties,it abused its discretion by setting penalties that were excessive under the circumstances.
iii.the trial court erred in ordering restitution.the court erred as a matter of law in partially rescinding the leases.as a result,the court employed an erroneous restitution formula.
iv.the trial court erred in resolving the limitations issue,because it applied the wrong legal standard in finding a civil conspiracy.
discussion 
we address defendants contentions in turn,starting in each instance with a discussion of the general legal principles that inform our analysis.
violation of ordinance 
the judgment rests in the first instance on the trial court determination that defendants violated the ordinance by using unlawful dealer leases to avoid rent control.defendants assign this determination as error.to analyze defendants claim of error,we must construe the ordinance.
standard of review 
interpretation of the municipal rent control ordinance presents a question of law for our independent review.we interpret ordinances by the same rules applicable to statutes.citation.statutory interpretation is ultimately a judicial function.carson harbor village,city of carson mobilehome park rental review bd.th,d.
rules of construction 
we begin our analysis with familiar rules of statutory construction.pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law,fair employment housing com.cal d.in determining legislative intent,we first look to the statutory language itself.ibid.see also,diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.
c.the ordinance 
the question before us is whether the dealer leases violate the ordinance.answering that question requires resort to the applicable portions of the ordinance.
we first consider section hereafter section of the ordinance both parties agree that section is relevant to the analysis here.that section exempts from rent control those mobilehome tenancies governed by voluntary rental agreements that meet certain enumerated criteria,subd.a hereafter section.
in this case,the provision critical requirement is that the space must be used for the personal and actual residence of the mobilehome owner.defendants do not dispute the plain meaning of that requirement.nor do they claim that the requirement was met to the contrary,defendants apparently concede that the dealers who signed the leases did not personally and actually reside in the mobilehomes they placed for sale in defendants parks.
defendants assertion that the dealer leases were exempt from rent control instead rests on another provision of the ordinance,section hereafter section according to defendants,section,subd.d hereafter section expands the universe of exempt lessees.defendants bolster that claim with arguments based on ordinance language,on policy,and on evidence suggesting that the city agrees with defendants interpretation,that evidence being an august memorandum by an assistant city attorney.not surprisingly,plaintiff disagrees.in support of its view,plaintiff analyzes the ordinance language and structure,refers us to its stated purpose,and questions defendants reliance on the city attorney memorandum.
as we explain below,we reject defendants interpretation of the ordinance,based on our analysis of the ordinance language,structure,and purpose.defendants evidence does not convince us otherwise.additionally,we find further support for our determination in state statutory law.
in support of their claim that section expands the universe of exempt lessees,defendants first rely on linguistic differences between that section and section.defendants point out that section refers only to mobilehome owners in describing renters who may enter exempt agreements.by contrast,defendants observe,section recognizes the right of a mobilehome owner,mobilehome tenant,prospective mobilehome owner or prospective mobilehome tenant to enter into an exempt lease described in section.given the inclusion of additional parties,defendants conclude,section differentiates a mobilehome owner from a mobilehome tenant.if this differentiation is to be given meaning,as it must,then clearly the ordinance is distinguishing between a tenant residing in the mobilehome and a owner of the mobilehome.
we find that argument unpersuasive.first,in our view,the provision inclusion of mobilehome tenants as well as mobilehome owners is explained by resort to the ordinance definitions of those terms.a mobilehome tenant is defined as one who rents or leases a mobilehome from a mobilehome owner,italics added.a mobilehome owner is one with the right to use a mobilehome lot,italics added.a mobilehome owner who rents his mobilehome to another becomes a landlord within the meaning of the ordinance.defining landlord to include a mobilehome park owner,mobilehome owner,lessor or sublessor who receives or is entitled to receive rent for the use or occupancy of a mobilehome or a mobilehome lot.second,it appears to us that the inclusion of prospective owners or tenants in section simply reflects the understanding that a rental agreement may precede occupancy by the mobilehome ultimate resident.see defining mobilehome resident as a person,including a mobilehome owner or mobilehome tenant,who occupies a mobilehome.
the enumeration of the wider variety of potential rentpayers listed in section is simply unnecessary in section.within the context of section,a mobilehome owner can only mean a mobilehome park tenant.the two are one and the same,because section governs the lease of a mobilehome lot to one who personally and actually resides in his mobilehome on that lot.thus,for purposes of section,the lessor will always be the park owner the owner of the lot and the lessee will always be the mobilehome owner who personally resides there,friedman et,cal.practice guide the rutter group,for purposes of mobilehome residency law,distinction between park homeowners and residents is significant id,mobilehome residency law provisions governing rental agreements do not apply to residents who lease from park owners both a mobilehome and its lot.
with the foregoing understanding of the provisions distinct contexts,it becomes clear that the linguistic differences between the two sections do not compel or even suggest the conclusion that the latter expands the former.
defendants further argue the very language of section shows that it expands on section.section refers to the leases described in section.the term described refers only to the type of rental or lease agreement,not the identity of the parties to the lease.
that argument likewise is without merit.the leases described in section are those that meet the criteria enumerated in that section.one of those criteria is the requirement of personal and actual residence by the person renting the lot.regardless of whether the party obliged to pay the landlord is denominated a mobilehome owner or tenant,current or prospective,the rentpayer must use the space for his actual and personal residence.nothing in section alters that residency requirement,either expressly or by implication.to the contrary,by referring to the leases described in section,section necessarily incorporates the prior section residency requirement.
another aspect of section language bolsters our conclusion that it was not intended to expand the universe of available exemptions.the subdivision expressly limits its operation to the section in which it is contained,with this introduction nothing in this section shall preclude section leases,italics added.
in short,from the language of section,we conclude that the provision does not expand the universe of exempt leases under the ordinance.
our interpretation of section in relation to section is further buttressed by an examination of the structure of the ordinance and of the place that each section occupies within it,gomes county of mendocino th,d statutes read together and considered in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.as codified,the ordinance consists of parts.
part of the ordinance is entitled exemptions.it describes three specific exemptions from the ordinance rent control provisions.one of those three exemptions is for leases,as described in section.part also includes a provision that places the burden of proving an exemption on the landlord.
part of the ordinance is entitled enforcement.it includes section,captioned waiver of rights.that section begins with the pronouncement that any waiver of renters rights is void except as provided in section,subd.other sections of part outlaw and punish certain landlord behavior.
given this structure and the distinct character of part exemptions and part enforcement,we are further persuaded that the city did not intend section to expand the ordinance limited universe of exemptions.
policy and purpose 
our interpretation of the ordinance derives from its plain language in the context of its structure.defendants nevertheless resist that interpretation on policy grounds,asserting that from a policy perspective,it is nonsensical to allow a mobilehome park tenant,who may not be very sophisticated to enter exempt leases,while prohibiting relatively more savvy mobilehome dealers from doing so.for its part,plaintiff points out that one of the ordinance express purposes is reasonable rent for mobilehome park residents.see.
initially,we question the implicit premise that policy arguments may overcome the plain language of a statute.see,cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,fn,d,reliance on statutory purpose while ignoring statutory language is improper,people ex rel.lockyer fremont general th,d rejecting policy arguments that ignore the legislature plain expression of public policy.in any event,in our view,plaintiff has the better of the policy arguments the ordinance explicit purpose of protection for mobilehome park residents thus further supports our conclusion that the residency requirement of section retains its vitality,unaffected by section.
in pressing their contrary interpretation of the ordinance,defendants rely heavily on a memorandum by an assistant city attorney,which was placed in evidence at trial.according to defendants,the memorandum is evidence both of the city actual practice and of its interpretation of its own ordinance,to wit,that the dealer leases are exempt from rent control under the ordinance.
defendants reliance on the memorandum is misplaced.we agree with the trial court analysis of this issue,as set forth in its statement of decision.first,as the trial court concluded,the dealer leases at the heart of this action are not the same as the dealer pullouts analyzed in the memorandum furthermore,even if the two types of dealer transactions were equivalent,the memorandum is entitled to persuasive value at most.as the matter is a question of law,we are not bound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court interpretation.village trailer park,santa monica rent control bd.th,d,quoting burden snowden cal th,d.finally,whatever persuasive value the memorandum may have was eroded by a memorandum from the same assistant city attorney.that later in response to defendants request for an opinion on the precise issue presented that the dealer leases are not exempt under the ordinance.the trial court took judicial notice of the memorandum,finding it a persuasive expression of the views of the city of san jose that the dealer leases were not exempt.
though neither party argues it,we find further support for our interpretation of the ordinance in the mobilehome residency law,et one provision of that law delineates the limited circumstances under which a mobilehome rental agreement is exempt from local rent control measures.village trailer park,santa monica rent control,supra,th at,d.one condition for exemption under that provision is that the homeowner must use the rental as a personal residence,subd.a.see also.presumably,any local attempt to expand the limited universe of state law exemptions would be vulnerable to challenge on preemption grounds,mobilepark west homeowners escondido mobilepark west th,d local ordinance impermissibly contradicts state law by adding additional requirements for exemption village trailer park,santa monica rent control,supra,th at,d local ordinance does not conflict with state law regarding exemption from rent control.our construction of the ordinance comports with its validity,consistent with statutory construction rules.see,kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,where possible,court must construe statute to preserve its validity montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d same construction of ordinance.
conclusion 
the express language of section establishes actual and personal residency of a mobilehome as a prerequisite to a lease exempt from rent control under the ordinance.the residency requirement of section is not altered by section d.the ordinance structure,its stated purpose,and state law all further bolster the conclusion that personal residency is a necessary prerequisite for exemption from rent control.because the dealer leases failed to meet the residency requirement,they were not exempt.the trial court thus correctly determined that the dealer leases violate the ordinance.
ii.civil penalties 
by violating the ordinance,the trial court concluded,defendants engaged in unfair business practices.as a consequence,the court imposed statutory civil penalties.defendants challenge that award here.
statutory authority 
defendants argue initially that the court lacked statutory authority to adjudicate violations and to award civil penalties.plaintiff disputes that argument.
standard of review 
the parties dispute over the trial court statutory authority presents a question of law,which we review de novo.see,richman santa monica rent control bd.th,fn,d applicability of the petris act.
unfair competition law bus,et.
the trial court determined that defendants violated california statutory prohibitions against unfair business practices,a scheme commonly called the unfair competition law or ucl.bus,et see,witkin,summary of cal.law supp.equity.a ucl action may be predicated on violations of the false advertising law.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d.

petris act,
in challenging the trial court authority to adjudicate statutory violations of the unfair business practices act,defendants rely on civil code section that section is part of a statute that is sometimes referred to as the petris act,see sego santa monica rent control bd.th,d.
the purpose of the petris act is to exempt landlords who attempt good faith compliance with a rent control law from fines and penalties.richman santa monica rent control,supra,th at,d.the statute explicitly sets forth the intent of the legislature to limit the imposition of penalties and sanctions against an owner of residential rental units where that person has attempted in good faith to fully comply with the regulatory processes,subd.a.the cited regulatory processes appear to be those related to the registration of rents and to the establishment of rent levels.see,subd.b describing the affected rent control ordinances as those requiring the registration of rents,subd.c permitting the restoration of rent increases for landlord good faith attempt to comply with the registration requirements,subd.e referring to compliance with applicable local rental registration requirements,subd.g describing the affected rent control ordinances as those requiring the periodic registration of rents,see also,subd.a describing the affected rent control ordinances as those requiring the registration of rents and requiring such ordinances to provide for the establishment and certification of permissible rent levels for the registered rental units,see generally moskovitz et,cal.practice ed,in a jurisdiction that requires registration of rent,civil code,subd.b,prohibits the assessment of penalties against a landlord in substantial compliance with the local ordinance.the act thus protects landlords who inadvertently make registration mistakes or who innocently establish rents at improper levels.see,sego santa monica rent control,supra,th at,d discussing the two purposes of the legislation,as described by its author,to avoid excessive fines for landlords who did not register correctly or did not fill in all the blanks,and to address a complaint by landlords that proper rent levels are often difficult to establish and that any mistake may subject the owner to severe penalties.
the act provides that a residential landlord who is in substantial compliance with a local rent control ordinance as described in the statute shall not be assessed a penalty or any other sanction for noncompliance with the ordinance,subd.b.the statutory definition of substantial compliance includes a residential landlord who has made a good faith attempt to comply with the ordinance but is not in full compliance,and has,after receiving notice of a deficiency from the local agency,cured the defect in a timely manner,as reasonably determined by the local agency.ibid.the term local agency means the public entity responsible for the implementation of the ordinance ibid.
according to defendants,the trial court lacks authority to award civil penalties for rent control violations until the administrative procedure envisioned by the petris act takes place.that procedure requires notice of deficiency by the designated local agency,determination of compliance by that agency,and an opportunity to cure.see,subd.b.because plaintiff failed to exhaust this administrative remedy,defendants contend,the trial court was without jurisdiction to award sanctions or penalties against them.
plaintiff disagrees.first,plaintiff argues,the act does not create an administrative procedure.furthermore,according to plaintiff,defendants were never in substantial compliance with the ordinance,as required under the petris act.lastly,plaintiff asserts,even assuming defendants were entitled to an administrative process by the act,the trial court nevertheless had jurisdiction to award civil penalties.
we first question whether the petris act even applies to the ordinance at issue here.for one thing,as noted above,language in the act itself strongly suggests its limitation only to those jurisdictions where registration of rents is required,subds.b,c,e,g,subd.a.that suggestion is borne out by legislative history materials concerning the petris act,as furnished by the legislative intent service although the ordinance requires the payment of annual fees,it contains no registration requirement of the type apparently contemplated by the petris act.for another thing,apart from the registration issue,we wonder whether the act was intended to apply to mobilehome parks rent schemes at all.the act legislative history suggests that it was not meant to govern mobilehome rent control ordinances 
in any event,even assuming the petris act applies to disputes arising under the ordinance,nothing in the act either creates an administrative procedure or mandates its exhaustion as a precondition to judicial intervention.as defendants themselves acknowledge,the statute does not require a regulating agency to adopt such a procedure,nor does civil code section create such a procedure.rather,defendants argue,the statute does prohibit the award of sanctions or penalties if such a procedure is not adopted and followed.
exhaustion and primary jurisdiction 
to assess defendants argument that plaintiff resort to judicial action impermissibly bypassed procedural and jurisdictional protections,we must consider and apply two related doctrines of administrative law exhaustion and primary jurisdiction.
exhaustion applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course.primary jurisdiction,on the other hand,applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts,and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which,under a regulatory scheme,have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.united states western pac,d,quoted in farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the primary jurisdiction doctrine is sometimes called the prior resort or the preliminary jurisdiction doctrine.farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
as our state high court has observed,courts have often confused the two closely related concepts farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d.both are essentially doctrines of comity between courts and agencies.they are two sides of the timing coin each determines whether an action may be brought in a court or whether an agency proceeding,or further agency proceeding,is necessary.exhaustion applies where an agency alone has exclusive jurisdiction over a case primary jurisdiction where both a court and an agency have the legal capacity to deal with the matter.id.at,d,quoting schwartz,administrative law.
the policy reasons behind the two doctrines are similar and overlapping.the exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy,courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision and judicial efficiency,overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.citations.t he primary jurisdiction doctrine advances two related policies it enhances court decisionmaking and efficiency by allowing courts to take advantage of administrative expertise,and it helps assure uniform application of regulatory laws.citations.farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
application 
in this case,the governing principle is primary jurisdiction,not exhaustion.see farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
this is not a case where plaintiff bypassed an available administrative procedure.no such procedure existed.in the absence of an available administrative remedy,the exhaustion doctrine does not apply,farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d,as to count of the people complaint,exhaustion doctrine would have applied,since the statute provided for an administrative proceeding by contrast,as to count of the complaint,there was no exhaustion issue,because no administrative procedure was available as to that count.
nor do we agree with defendants that the petris act requires the local agency to adopt and use such a procedure as a precondition to the imposition of statutory civil penalties for unfair business practices.because it sweeps so broadly,the unfair practices act applies to many situations in which no administrative process is available to address the challenged practice.farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
in this case,plaintiff claim that defendants violated the unfair practices law is originally cognizable in the courts,and thus it triggers application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine.farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d.in applying the doctrine,a threshold question is whether the trial court has discretion to stay the judicial action pending an administrative determination.id.at,d.if the particular legislative scheme forecloses judicial discretion under the doctrine,the court must adjudicate the action before it.ibid.otherwise,the court has discretion either to hear the action or to stay it until available administrative processes are first invoked and completed.ibid.
here,the trial properly exercised its discretion to adjudicate the action before it.no rigid formula exists for applying the primary jurisdiction doctrine citation.farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d,citing united states western pac,supra,at.instead,resolution generally hinges on a court determination of the extent to which the policies noted above are implicated in a given case.citations.ibid.those and not have been served in this case by staying the judicial action in favor of administrative action.
the critical issue here was whether the dealer leases were exempt.to resolve that issue,the trial judge was required to construe the ordinance,an inherently judicial function.c ourts are the ultimate arbiters of the construction of a statute.citation.an administrative agency can not alter or enlarge the legislation,and an erroneous administrative construction does not govern the court interpretation of the statute.citation.hewlett squaw valley ski th,d.this case turns on a question of statutory interpretation,a matter with which courts have considerable experience and which does not necessitate deferral to another agency.citation.id.at,d.in this case,neither efficiency nor uniformity would be enhanced by administrative expertise.farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d,mathew zaheri mitsubishi motor sales th,d exhaustion of administrative remedy not required where the agency possesses no greater expertise to consider the controversy than a judicial forum.the trial court thus acted properly in deciding the matter in the first instance.
nor do we perceive any inherent unfairness in requiring defendants to answer in a judicial forum in the first instance,notwithstanding their claim that they should have been given notice of violation and an opportunity to cure before the imposition of penalties.a landlord who has ignored the dictates of state and local law can not legitimately argue it has no notice of its wrongdoing until an administrative body or court rules on the issue.village trailer park,santa monica rent control,supra,th at,d rejecting landlord due process claim.
to sum up,we conclude that the trial court was authorized to adjudicate the statutory violations in the first instance.
each violation of the unfair practices law and each violation of the false advertising law is punishable by a civil penalty in the maximum amount of.bus,subd.a unfair practices law,subd.a false advertising law.in this case,the court found more than separate statutory violations it assessed civil penalties totaling against defendants.defendants contend that the trial court miscalculated the number of violations and that the penalties it assessed are excessive.
standard of review 
the statute requires a court to impose a penalty for each unlawful business practice committed.hewlett squaw valley ski,supra,th at,d.see bus,subd.b court shall impose a civil penalty for each violation of this chapter,subd.b same.see also,people national association of realtors d.the duty to impose a penalty for each violation is mandatory.however,the amount of the penalty lies within the court discretion.citation.hewlett squaw valley ski,supra,th at,d.accord,people murrison th,d.
number of violations 
the amount of the penalty depends in the first instance on the number of violations committed.people superior court cal d,jayhill.it is up to the courts to determine what constitutes a violation ibid.business and professions code s ections and fail to specify what constitutes a single violation,leaving it to the courts to determine appropriate penalties on a basis.citation.people toomey d.
in this case,the trial court counted statutory violations arising from two different patterns of conduct on defendants part.the court first considered defendants actions in obtaining the unlawful leases.the court concluded that each time defendants forced a tenant to accept the conditions of a dealer lease,they violated the unfair practices law.bus.the court found violations on that basis.the court next addressed the defendants monthly collections of rent.the court determined that each time defendants collected rent under the leases,they violated both the unfair practices law and the false advertising law.bus.by the court calculation,defendants had unlawfully collected excess monthly rent approximately times since january.the court thus found violations of business and professions code section unlawful rent collections plus unlawful leases and violations of business and professions code section all unlawful rent collections,for a total of separate statutory violations.
defendants assign that calculation as error.they argue that appellate courts have uniformly ruled that the number of violations is determined by the number of people affected,not the number of misrepresentations or as in this case number of monthly rent checks paid.defendants thus urge that the starting point should be the number of.they observe that only approximately spaces in the mobilehome parks were governed by the dealer leases found in violation of the ordinance.
in contending for a per person rather than a per act calculation,defendants rely on our high court decision in jayhill.jayhill,supra,cal d at.in jayhill,the defendants encyclopedia sellers made at least separate misrepresentations to each prospective purchaser.the attorney general argued that each misrepresentation constituted a separate violation.the california supreme court disagreed,saying we believe the legislature intended that the number of violations is to be determined by the number of persons to whom the misrepresentations were made,and not the number of separately identifiable misrepresentations involved.ibid.as we explain,defendants reliance on jayhill is misplaced in this case.
certainly,in many cases,it will be proper to calculate violations on a per victim basis.people ex rel.smith parkmerced d,citing jayhill,supra,cal d at,disapproved on another ground in kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th at,d,see also,people toomey,supra,d at.no error in calculating violations based on number of sales of misleading coupons people dollar systems,d.no error in basing penalty on more than misleading car rental contracts plus other conduct people morse th,d no error in calculating violations based on number of people solicited by for legal services.
however,as a number of courts have recognized,it is unlikely that jayhill intended to establish a test for determining the number of violations applicable to all situations.people superior court olson d,citing people bestline products,d.instead,determining what qualifies as a single violation depends on the type of violation involved,the number of victims and the repetition of the conduct constituting the brief,the circumstances of the case.people witzerman d.see also,people superior court olson,supra,d at.in the context of a misleading newspaper advertisement,a reasonable interpretation would be that a single publication constitutes a minimum of one violation with as many additional violations as there are persons who read the advertisement or who responded to the advertisement people casa blanca convalescent homes,d.in the context of nursing home violations,it was reasonable both to aggregate certain multiple species of violations into a single act and to punish certain single egregious acts or conditions.
in light of these authorities,we reject defendants contention that the number of violations must always be calculated on a per victim rather than a per act basis.to the contrary,in a proper case,a single act in violation of regulations may constitute an unlawful business violation for which a penalty of up to may be imposed.citations.people casa blanca convalescent homes,supra,d at,disapproved on another ground in communications los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,see also,people national association of realtors,supra,d at.each act may be subject to separate punishment.
given the circumstances of this case,the trial court did not err in calculating the number of statutory violations based on defendants actions as well as the number of affected tenants.first,each unlawful act was a separate,discrete event.each dealer lease violated the ordinance.each collection of unauthorized rent violated the ordinance.furthermore,each unlawful the collection of excess rent each designed to enrich defendants at the expense of the affected tenants.the trial court method of calculating violations thus is reasonably related to the gain or the opportunity for gain achieved by defendants unlawful scheme.people superior court olson,supra,d at.accord,people national association of realtors,supra,d at.finally,the trial court method of counting each individual unlawful act as a separate violation properly takes into account the nature and extent of the public injury that defendants inflicted in this case.people superior court olson,supra,d at.people national association of realtors,supra,d at.for these reasons,the trial court was fully justified in counting each of defendants discrete unlawful acts as a separate statutory violation.
amount of penalty 
having determined that defendants were guilty of more than statutory violations,the court proceeded to assess civil penalties totaling.in setting the amount,the court expressly considered the relevant statutory factors.
the statutes direct in assessing the amount of the civil penalty,the court shall consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case,including,but not limited to,the following the nature and seriousness of the misconduct,the number of violations,the persistence of the misconduct,the length of time over which the misconduct occurred,the willfulness of the defendant misconduct,and the defendant assets,liabilities,and net worth.bus,subd.b unfair practices law see also,subd.b false advertising law identical language.
applying those factors,the trial court observed that defendants violated the ordinance for years,that they knew or should have known that they were violating the ordinance,that they collected an estimated million in rents over that time,and that an undetermined but substantial number of tenants had been forced from their homes as a result of defendants unlawful practices.however,the court assessment was tempered by its finding that defendants conduct was not unfair or fraudulent but merely unlawful.
the court set the penalty at,which it identified as the approximate amount of excess rent defendants had collected over the relevant time period.in doing so,the court noted that the maximum penalty authorized by the statutes would exceed million violations at per violation.however,the court recognized,such a penalty would be so disproportionate to the illicit gains obtained by defendants as to constitute an excessive fine.see,hale morgan cal d.the court then discussed a more reasonable range of penalties as suggested by the ordinance and relevant case law under the statutes.the court noted that the ordinance permits treble damages to private litigants,but it chose to assess a lower penalty in light of its determination that defendants conduct was only unlawful,not unfair or fraudulent.the court explicitly set the penalty without assigning a specific dollar amount for each violation.it divided the penalty between the two defendants based on the number of affected tenants who rented space in each park.
defendants attack the penalty as excessive.they argue that the reported decisions illustrate why the penalty in this case should be minimal.
we find no merit in that argument.in our view,the penalty imposed in this case is minimal considering the number of violations,the continuing nature of defendants conduct,and the resulting injury to tenants.the penalty assessed here averages approximately per violation divided by violations.that amount is reasonable,if not lenient given the great number of victims,the economic benefit to appellant from the marketing scheme,and the continuing nature of the unlawful business practices.people toomey,supra,d at.upholding penalty of see also,hewlett squaw valley ski,supra,th at,d upholding penalty of,which the court deemed modest in light of defendant egregious behavior people dollar systems,supra,d at.under the circumstances,civil penalty was abundantly justified.higher penalties have been affirmed in many cases.see,people ex rel.van de kamp cappuccio,d,violations based on underweight squid per violation people ex rel.smith parkmerced,supra,d at.tenants charged illegal fees per violation people bestline products,supra,d at.prospective distributors misled approximately per violation people casa blanca convalescent homes,supra,d at.in penalties for violations more than fair and reasonable.if anything,the published decisions teach that the trial court discretion in setting civil penalties generally will be upheld.in fact,we are aware of only two reported appellate decisions faulting the trial court civil penalty decision.in one,the matter was remanded because the trial court set the number of violations too low.people superior court olson,supra,d at.the trial court erred in concluding that dissemination of a false or deceptive advertisement through a single edition of a newspaper can constitute but one violation of each statute as a matter of law.in the other,the appellate court reversed because the trial court imposed no penalty despite finding of a violation.people national association of realtors,supra,d at.the duty to impose a penalty for each violation is mandatory therefore,the court abused its discretion in not imposing any penalty.
in assessing a civil penalty for unfair business practices,the trial court must manifestly act reasonably in light of all pertinent factors people superior court olson,supra,d at.the court certainly did so in this case.its approach was thorough,considered,and measured.the resulting penalty was reasonable and the trial court acted well within its discretion in imposing it.
iii.restitution 
in addition to the civil penalties it imposed,the court ordered defendants to pay restitution to tenants affected by defendants violations of the ordinance.the court ordered restitution of all rents charged to tenants in unlawful leases,plus prejudgment interest on those amounts.the court also ordered defendants to pay restitution to certain tenants for the diminution in value of their leasehold interests resulting from defendants unlawful business practices.
defendants challenge the restitution order on two related grounds.first,defendants claim,the court erred as a matter of law in partially rescinding the unlawful leases.they argue that the court was required to rescind the leases in their entirety.furthermore,according to defendants,the court employed an erroneous restitution formula,which failed to restore the parties to the status quo ante and which was premised on an unconstitutional rent control scheme.
rescission 
the first prong of defendants attack on the trial court remedy is based on their rescission claim.according to defendants because the leases were found to be illegal,the leases must be wholly rescinded and the parties placed back in their original bargaining positions.
defendants argument is without merit.it both misapprehends the trial court order in this case and confuses the remedies available for different civil wrongs.
the trial court did not rescind the wholly or partially.as the court correctly observed,there is no reason to rescind the leases,even solely for purposes of calculating restitution.plaintiff suit is based on violations of the ordinance and,by extension,section.it is based on statute,not on contract.
the trial court thus properly distinguished rescission from restitution.the two remedies are distinct.gardiner solder supalloy,d.
simply put,rescission stands as a contract remedy.see,procedure for rescinding contract,relief available after contract rescission.rescission is generally understood to mean the unmaking of a contract.black law dict.ed,defining rescission.the remedy of rescission necessarily involves a repudiation of the contract.lobdell miller d,see generally,runyan pacific air industries,cal d,discussing the development of the law of rescission.within the confines of contract law,rescission is a broad remedy.it is essential to recognize that rescission is a commodious remedy available to redress various wrongs each of which,generically,is sharply distinguishable from the others.rescission by agreement,for instance,is contractual in nature rescission for illegality,finally,is a remedy which enables a party,in the circumstances specified,to procure restitutionary relief with respect to a contract which was never enforceable.recommendation a study relating to rescission of contracts cal.law revision com,fn.
in an appropriate contract action,rescission may be followed by restitution,after rescission of a contract,the aggrieved party shall be awarded complete relief,including restitution of benefits runyan pacific air industries,supra,cal at.here,for example,the affected tenants presumably could have sued to rescind the leases on the ground of illegality and to recover restitutionary damages.instead,the people of the state of california brought this action to establish statutory violations.
in a statutory action such as this one,rescission is not a necessary predicate to granting restitution,parkmerced,supra,d at.tenants entitled to restitution for ucl violation no indication that leases were rescinded epstein frank d.despite usurious interest rate,promissory note not rescinded elmers shapiro d,seller who violated price control statute was liable for restitution of overcharge even though buyer never offered to rescind.
to sum up,the rescission remedy typically applies only in contract actions.this is not a contract action.the trial court therefore acted properly in declining to rescind the illegal leases in whole or in part.
restitution 
defendants next challenge the restitution formula employed by the trial court.
first,defendants contend,the restitution order is flawed because it fails to accomplish the fundamental object of restitution,which is to place the parties in the same position they would have been in before the challenged contract was entered into.
as with their rescission argument,defendants restitution argument fails to differentiate between contractual and statutory remedies.as explained above,restitution may be awarded in contract actions.but it is also available as a remedy to redress statutory violations.restitution is an ambiguous term,sometimes referring to the disgorging of something which has been taken and at times referring to compensation for injury done.calamari perillo,the law of contracts ed,quoted in black law,supra,defining restitution.see generally,restitution,introductory note,contracts,com.
in a suit for violation of the unfair competition law,orders for restitution are those compelling a ucl defendant to return money obtained through an unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the property was taken kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th at,d.such restitutionary relief is explicitly authorized by statute.the court may make such orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property acquired by means of such unfair competition.bus.
where restitution is ordered as a means of redressing a statutory violation,the courts are not concerned with restoring the violator to the status quo ante.the focus instead is on the victim.the status quo ante to be achieved by the restitution order was to again place the victim in possession of that money.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d,italics added ucl violation.the object of statutory restitution is to restore the status quo by returning to the plaintiff funds in which he or she has an ownership interest.korea supply lockheed martin,supra,cal th at,d,italics added ucl violation.the purpose of the civil remedy is to allow recovery of the excess paid and to prohibit the seller from receiving and keeping such excess.elmers shapiro,supra,d at,price control violation.moreover,in contrast to contract restitution,statutory restitution is not solely intended to benefit the victims by the return of money,but instead is designed to penalize a defendant for past unlawful conduct and thereby deter future violations.citations.people toomey,supra,d at.ucl violations.
in this case,the trial court required defendants to disgorge unauthorized rents and to restore that money to the affected tenants.as the court explained,it made that order to avoid unjustly enriching defendants and to compensate tenants who paid rents.quite properly,the court also recognized the deterrent value of the order.the purpose of such orders is to deter future violations of the unfair trade practice statute and to foreclose retention by the violator of its gains.citations.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,quoting fletcher security pacific national bank cal d,and also citing jayhill,supra,cal d at fn.
as our high court recently confirmed,the trial court discretion to award restitution under the ucl is very broad.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d.there was no abuse of that discretion in this case.the trial court carefully crafted restitution remedy is based on appropriate factors,and it accomplishes the statutory objective of restoring to the victims sums acquired through defendants unfair practices.the trial court was not required to place defendants in the status quo ante.the order for restitution in this case is proper under the unfair competition law.
defendants nevertheless argue that the restitution order should be set aside on another ground.as defendants put it an additional reason for employing a market rent as the initial rent,quite apart from restoring the status quo ante,is that vacancy control is unconstitutional.courts sitting in equity should refrain from imposing unconstitutional measures in fashioning restitution.in support of their argument,defendants cite richardson city and county of honolulu cir richardson.
the trial court rejected that argument below on several grounds.among other things,the trial judge recognized that california courts have declined to follow richardson.see,montclair parkowners city of montclair,supra,th at,d.see also,sandpiper mobile village city of carpinteria th,d california courts have upheld vacancy control as legitimate economic regulation.as a procedural matter,the court also observed that defendants failed to raise their richardson claim in this proceeding,although it was raised in the bifurcated.in light of the court procedural finding,we will defer addressing the merits of defendants richardson claim here.we will address that claim if and as necessary to our resolution of the appeal in the bifurcated proceeding.
in sum,neither of the grounds advanced by defendants in their challenge to the restitution order compels its reversal.the trial court did not err in fashioning its restitution remedy.
iv.statute of limitations 
defendants final contention relates to the trial court determination that the statute of limitations had not run with respect to early violations.
the statute of limitations on the statutory claims is four years.bus.plaintiff brought this action in december.the trial court nevertheless imposed liability on defendants for statutory violations committed as early as january.the court did so based on its finding that defendants conspired with the dealers to violate the ordinance and the statute.the court explained the statute of limitations does not begin to run on wrongful acts committed pursuant to a civil conspiracy until completion of the last overt act of that conspiracy.citation.therefore,the statute of limitations has not begun to run on defendants violations of business and professions code section because defendants are still enforcing their unlawful leases.
defendants assert that the trial court erred in finding a civil conspiracy,because it ignored the requirement of knowledge of the wrongfulness of the acts.
conspiracy general principles 
conspiracy is not a cause of action,but a legal doctrine that imposes liability on persons who,although not actually committing a tort themselves,share with the immediate tortfeasors a common plan or design in its perpetration.citation.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d.
liability for civil conspiracy generally requires three elements formation of the conspiracy an agreement to commit wrongful acts operation of the conspiracy commission of the wrongful acts and damage resulting from operation of the conspiracy.applied equipment litton saudi arabia,supra,cal th at,d,kidron movie acquisition th,d.
in addition to those three elements,it has been said that participants in a conspiracy also must know that their conduct is wrongful.as our high court has stated,one harmed by a conspiracy is entitled to damages from those defendants who concurred in the tortious scheme with knowledge of its unlawful purpose.wyatt union mortgage cal d,see also,kidron movie acquisition,supra,th at,d conspiring defendants must have actual knowledge of the wrongful nature of the scheme.however,to the extent that knowledge of the scheme unlawful purpose is required,it may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances,including the nature of the acts done,the relation of the parties,and the interests of the defendants.wyatt union mortgage,supra,cal d at,people tierney d.in criminal indictment for conspiracy to violate false advertising and other laws,the evidence warrants the inference that all respondents knew that what they were doing was wrong.
effect on limitations period 
proof of a civil conspiracy triggers the last overt act doctrine.wyatt union mortgage,supra,cal d at.under that doctrine,the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the final act in furtherance of the conspiracy has been committed.ibid.statute did not begin to run until defendant collection of the final loan payment shortly before trial.
application 
here,the trial court rejected defendants contention that knowledge of wrongfulness was required to support the finding of a civil conspiracy.noting that the statutory violation is a strict liability offense,the court concluded there is no need to prove that the parties knew that the act was illegal.
assuming without deciding that that conclusion was erroneous,the record nevertheless contains sufficient evidence from which such knowledge of the scheme unlawfulness may be inferred.see,wyatt union mortgage,supra,cal d at.thus,for example,there was testimony that defendants used the dealer leases to avoid rent control.there was also testimony that the dealers and defendants employees even signed such leases retroactively.the record also demonstrates that the economic interests of the defendants were served by the scheme.in short,under all the circumstances,defendants knowledge of the unlawfulness of their actions may be inferred.ibid.
accrual of the statute of limitations 
the evidence provides adequate support for the trial court finding of a civil conspiracy.each month collection of excess rent constitutes an overt act in furtherance of that conspiracy,wyatt union mortgage,supra,cal d at,collection of each loan payment.defendants were still collecting unlawful rent right up through the trial of this case.thus,when the trial court issued its statement of decision,defendants had not yet committed the last overt act of their conspiracy and the statute of limitations had not yet accrued.ibid.
under these circumstances,the trial court acted properly in imposing statutory liability for actions occurring as early as january.
conclusion 
we find no merit in any of defendants contentions.our conclusions as to each may be summarized as follows 
i.as properly construed,the ordinance requires actual and personal residency in a mobilehome as a predicate to exemption from rent control.the dealer leases failed to meet the residency requirement.the court thus correctly determined that the dealer leases violate the ordinance.
ii.notwithstanding the petris act,the trial court was authorized to adjudicate the statutory violations and to impose civil penalties in the first instance.the court did not err in calculating the number of statutory violations,nor was the resulting penalty excessive in amount.
iii.the trial court was not required to rescind the leases as a predicate to its statutory restitution remedy.its restitution formula properly considered the circumstances of the case.
iv.given the evidence of a civil conspiracy,the trial court acted properly in rejecting defendants statute of limitations defense.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.plaintiff shall have costs on appeal.
further section references are to chapter of title of the san jose municipal code unless otherwise stated.
the direct leases are not at issue in this appeal.the trial court concluded that plaintiff failed to prove its allegations of unfair business practices except in connection with the dealer leases.plaintiff has not appealed that determination.
the other named defendants are not parties to this appeal.
the record on appeal does not contain defendants answer.
in the bifurcated,the trial court eventually sustained the city demurrer to the third amended.it later entered a judgment of dismissal,which is the subject of a separate appeal in this court.beaumont investments,city of san jose.
because plaintiff did not appeal,we discuss only the statement of decision issued in response to defendants request.
