principal life insurance company,equity fc,and petula associates,a subsidiary of principal,collectively principal appeal the district court dismissal of principal action for declaratory relief relating to a material dispute over a rent recalculation provision in a ground lease.the district court concluded that the case was not ripe for adjudication and thus that it lacked jurisdiction.because the district court arrived at this conclusion by mistakenly applying a ripeness standard derived from cases involving administrative agencies,we reverse the district court jurisdictional determination.
this case presents an actual controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,and with sufficient immediacy ordinarily to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.nevertheless,the district court had discretion to accept jurisdiction or not depending on an application of the brillhart factors.brillhart excess ins.because the district court did not articulate reasons for its provisional declination to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to brillhart and its progeny,we remand to allow the district court to address the relevant factors and then to exercise its discretion.consequently,we vacate also the award of fees and costs.
background 
the chester robinson trust,kay bell,thea wood,dee hanson,and constance,chester,and lynn robinson collectively,the robinsons own property in washington county,oregon.in,they entered into a ground lease agreement with mtr company,which assigned its interest in the ground lease to koll interreal a year later.during lease renegotiations between koll interreal and the robinsons in,it became apparent to both parties that they disagreed as to the interpretation of section of the ground lease,which is a pivotal rent recalculation provision.
section of the ground lease provides for rent adjustment in the year and year of the lease term.the robinsons contended that two critical variables affecting the amount of rent will change when the rent is recalculated in the and years the base property value of the land and the ratio for recalculating the rental amount.koll interreal,on the other hand,claimed that only the ratio variable would change.this dispute affects not only the amount of rent,but also the commercial value of the lease.
unable to resolve the dispute in,koll interreal and the robinsons agreed to preserve their respective positions and resolve it in the future.the dispute was memorialized in a lease amendment.with full knowledge of the existence of this dispute,a subsidiary of principal purchased a portion of koll interreal interest in the ground lease in.
principal attempted to sell its entire interest in the ground lease for the first and only time in,creating a portfolio of properties that included it.two investors,transwestern and ps business parks,made offers on the leasehold interest.principal pursued the transwestern offer because it was significantly higher and offered a smoother closing.during those sale negotiations,transwestern sought a reduction in price because of the unresolved lease dispute with the robinsons and attempted also to resolve the dispute with the robinsons.these attempts at resolving the contract dispute proved fruitless,and transwestern withdrew its offer.principal has made no other attempts to sell the interest.
without a definitive way to calculate the value of the lease,principal found itself unable to make a reasonable business decision as to what to do with it,sell it,develop the property,or purchase the property.accordingly,principal sought a declaratory judgment,asking the district court to resolve the controversy and to declare that principal interpretation of section is correct.
the district court determined that a substantial controversy exists between the parties,but it determined nevertheless that it lacked jurisdiction because principal had failed to prove that it would suffer a direct and immediate hardship that is more than possible financial loss.moreover,the district court noted that it would decline to exercise jurisdiction even if it had it because d iscretionary access to judicial resources should be reserved for those controversies that parties do not invite.
principal moved the district court to reconsider,arguing that this hardship standard derived from cases involving administrative agencies and was inappropriate in an insular private party contract action.the district court maintained its original position regarding ripeness,and again asserted that even if the case were ripe,the court would decline to exercise jurisdiction,citing its earlier statement regarding controversies that parties do not invite.

appropriate standard for determining ripeness 
the requirement that a case or controversy exist under the declaratory judgment act is identical to article iii constitutional case or controversy requirement.kearns,at.if a case is not ripe for review,then there is no case or controversy,and the court lacks jurisdiction.id.consequently,the first question we must answer is what standard should be applied to determine whether this private contract dispute is ripe.
the district court applied a standard unique to cases involving administrative agencies and,as a result,found that it lacked jurisdiction.in the context of administrative actions,the prudential aspect of the ripeness doctrine is whether administrative action is ripe requires the court to evaluate the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.we further announced in western oil gas ass sonoma county,cir,reh g denied,that the hardship element of the abbott labs standard is not met unless a litigant shows that withholding review would result in direct and immediate hardship and would entail more than possible financial loss.
