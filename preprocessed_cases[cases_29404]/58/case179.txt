we must decide in this case whether a municipality state court action for declaratory relief respecting the constitutionality of a mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance,filed in response to a federal court declaratory relief action brought by park owners respecting the same ordinance,constitutes a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp within the purview of code of civil procedure section section the statute.we conclude it does not 
background 
in,the city of cotati city adopted a mobilehome park rent stabilization program.cotati ord,adding ch.to cotati.after city enacted the program,gene cashman and others,owners of mobilehome parks collectively owners,sued city in the united states district court for the northern district of california.owners sought declaratory relief,an injunction,and damages allegedly resulting from city ordinance.in requesting a declaratory judgment,owners alleged that the following question is in actual controversy between the parties whether city effects an uncompensated regulatory taking by implementing and enforcing the ordinance,in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
subsequently,city sued owners in sonoma county superior court.city complaint outlined a cause of action for declaratory relief.city alleged that an actual controversy has arisen and now exists between city and owners relative to their respective rights and duties in that city contends that the mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance and resolution are valid and enforceable,both on their face and as construed by city.on the other hand,owners contend that said ordinance,on its face is unenforceable,invalid,and void as effecting an unconstitutional taking on information and belief,city also alleged that owners contended the ordinance effected a taking in violation of the california constitution.city sought a judgment declaring the respective rights and duties of the parties under the ordinance in question and that the ordinance is constitutional,valid,and enforceable on its face and as applied to owners.after the state court action was filed,city filed a motion in federal court asking that owners action be dismissed on abstention grounds.younger harris,d.
owners shortly thereafter moved in state court,under the statute,to strike city complaint.owners argued that city filing of its state court action arose from owners filing of their earlier federal action and,therefore,fell within the ambit of the statute.as evidence that city state court action was a slapp,owners pointed to references in city complaint to owners contention in the federal action that city ordinance constituted a taking.
city concedes that its purpose in filing the state court action was to gain a more favorable forum in which to litigate the constitutionality of its mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance.certain potentially applicable state law decisions on mobilehome park rent regulation,city notes,were favorable to its position in the underlying dispute.see montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d sandpiper mobile village city of carpinteria th,d.city also concedes that in filing the state court action it intended subsequently to seek to persuade the federal court to abstain from hearing owners suit.
the trial court ruled in favor of owners on the motion.noting that city action was filed shortly after owners federal action,involved the exact contention made by owners therein,and named only owners as defendants,the trial court concluded owners had,at the outset,carried their burden to show that the action arose out of owners right of petition under the constitution as defined in section.see,subd.b.having concluded that owners had carried their initial burden,the trial court considered whether city had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its claim.concluding city had not,the trial court granted owners motion and ordered city action dismissed.the court of appeal reversed.we granted owners petition for review.
discussion 
section provides,inter alia,that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,subd.e.
owners in their petition asked us to address two a defendant in order to prevail on an motion must demonstrate that the targeted action was intended to chill the defendant free speech or petition rights and whether a moving defendant must show that the action had the effect of chilling such rights.we conclude that defendants moving under the statute have neither burden.nevertheless,because city action arose from the underlying controversy respecting the validity of city ordinance rather than from owners federal lawsuit,we further conclude that city action was not subject to a special motion to strike under section.
intent to chill 
city states that it filed this action in an attempt to obtain a more favorable forum than federal court in which to litigate the constitutionality of its mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance.city initial goal was to use the state action to persuade the federal court to abstain in favor of the state proceeding.city in fact filed a motion in federal district court asking that the federal action be dismissed on a number of grounds,including abstention in favor of the state action.a secondary,alternative goal,city claims,was to try to obtain a quick favorable decision upholding the ordinance which then could be used for res judicata purposes in the federal court.owners argue that city real intention in filing this action went beyond the desire for a favorable forum.owners speculate city actually hoped to discourage owners from continuing to litigate by burdening them with defending a new,costly,and duplicative lawsuit in a second jurisdiction.
whether city subjective motivations for filing this action were,in reality,primarily as city describes them,or primarily in accordance with owners speculation,can not be ascertained with certainty from the record.as owners ultimately concede,city subjective intent will probably never be known.fortunately,the question of subjective intent is not relevant.as discussed in detail in equilon,supra,cal th,d,the statute,construed in accordance with its plain language,incorporates no pleading or proof requirement.id.at,d.consequently,a defendant who meets its burden under the statute of demonstrating that a targeted cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b faces no additional requirement of proving the plaintiff subjective intent.equilon,supra,at,d.
chilling effect 
the same considerations of law and policy,generally,that bar judicial imposition on the statute of an proof requirement bar judicial imposition of a proof requirement.see equilon,supra,cal th at,d,see also briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,briggs rejecting judicial imposition of a public interest proof requirement.here,as in equilon,supra,cal th,d,the plain language of the statute and indicia of legislative intent preclude any such requirement.
thus,section nowhere states that,in order to prevail on an motion,a defendant must demonstrate that the cause of action complained of has had,or will have,the actual effect of chilling the defendant exercise of speech or petition rights.nor is there anything in section operative sections implying or even suggesting
