appellant johnson owns an undivided interest in real property located at union street in san francisco and,with another individual,has an exclusive right to occupy unit in that building.in,johnson and his of union street hired an attorney to help them evict the tenants occupying unit.their attorney prepared a notice in september that stated,in part,the owner is aware of circumstances that might entitle you to receive payment under san francisco administrative code section a e.should you claim a right to relocation assistance,demand is hereby made that you provide counsel for owner any and all information that you may rely on to claim said entitlement pursuant to the government code or san francisco rent ordinance,including the factual and legal basis for your belief.according to johnson,he lacked sufficient information to comply with the belief requirement 
appellant sposf is an organization of renters and small property owners that advocates home ownership in san francisco.sposf includes members who have invoked the ellis act and who plan to do so in the future.at least one member of the organization has served termination notices with the same language found to be defective in johnson unlawful detainer action.
appellants filed their complaint on may.they alleged that the belief requirement is facially invalid because it is not authorized by the ellis act.the complaint sought a writ of mandate and declaratory relief.appellants filed a motion for an order granting their petition for writ of mandate,arguing that the belief requirement is preempted by the ellis act and can not be harmonized with the act.the city opposed the petition,arguing that writ relief was not appropriate and that the belief requirement was not preempted 
the trial court denied appellants petition for a writ of mandate,finding that the ellis act did not preempt the belief requirement.the trial court also found that writ relief was not appropriate because disputes were unlikely to arise in the future because it is easy to comply with the belief requirement,and owners may adjudicate any disputes that do arise in the course of unlawful detainer proceedings.the trial court entered judgment and appellants timely appealed.

b.the ellis act.
the legislature enacted the ellis act following the california supreme court opinion in nash city of santa monica cal d,upholding a city ordinance that required owners of residential rental property to obtain a permit before they could remove property from the rental market.t he act was intended to overrule the nash decision so as to permit landlords the unfettered right to remove all residential rental units from the market,consistent,of course,with guidelines as set forth in the act and adopted by local governments in accordance thereto.city of santa monica yarmark d.yarmark.the act does not diminish or enhance a local government ability to mitigate any adverse impact on persons displaced by reason of the withdrawal from rent or lease of any accommodations,subd.c.it likewise does not interfere with a local government ability to regulate land use or override procedural protections designed to prevent abuse of the right to evict tenants,subd.c.
a tenant facing an unlawful detainer action under the ellis act may assert as a defense that his or her landlord failed to comply with the provisions of the act or any statutes,ordinances,or regulations adopted pursuant to the act.
c.the ellis act preempts the belief requirement.
a city or county may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations that do not conflict with general law.cal,art.xi.if local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by the state law and is void.citation.a conflict exists when the local legislation contradicts state law.local legislation contradicts state law when it is inimical to it.citations.reidy city and county of san francisco th,d.
a conflict between local ordinance and state law exists if the local law duplicates,contradicts,or regulates an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.yarmark,supra,d at.the first step in a preemption analysis is to determine whether the local regulation explicitly conflicts with any provision of state law.citation.if the local legislation does not expressly contradict or duplicate state law,its validity must be evaluated under implied preemption principles.in determining whether the legislature has preempted by implication to the exclusion of local regulation we must look to the whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme.there are three tests the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the municipality.citation.citation.id.at.see also channing properties city of berkeley th,d channing properties.placing requirements on landlords that are inconsistent with their right to go out of business under the ellis act imposes a prohibitive price on the exercise of the right under the act.javidzad city of santa monica d.
in yarmark,supra,d,the court considered amendments to the santa monica city charter that prohibited landlords from evicting tenants where they could make a fair return unless the rental units they owned were uninhabitable or unless the landlords promised to develop new multifamily dwelling units subject to rent control.yarmark,supra,at.the court held that the charter amendments were preempted because they directly contradicted an area fully occupied by the ellis act,which permits landlords to leave the rental market even if they could make a fair return and the property is habitable.id.at.the ellis act imposes limits on a city right to exercise its police power to create substantive defenses for use in summary eviction proceedings.id.at.while the ellis act does not prohibit local governments from providing procedural protections designed to prevent abuse of the right to evict tenants,subd.c,it completely occupies the field of substantive eviction controls over landlords who wish to withdraw all units from the residential rental market.yarmark,supra,at.
appellants argue that the ellis act preempts the belief requirement because the local ordinance is a substantive limit on the right to withdraw units from the rental market and because the requirement is not authorized by the act.while the question is a close one,we conclude that the ellis act preempts the belief requirement because the requirement creates an impermissible substantive defense in summary eviction proceedings that is not permissible under the ellis act.
we recognize that many cases finding preemption of local eviction ordinances involve requirements far more onerous than the belief requirement,in that they completely barred landlords from exiting the rental market in some result clearly prohibited by the ellis act,reidy city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d requirement that residential hotel owners provide replacement units or pay fee before removal of units from rental market preempted by ellis act first presbyterian church city of berkeley th,d requirement that demolition of residential building be approved only where demolition would not detrimentally affect housing needs clearly conflicts with ellis act and is facially preempted channing properties,supra,th at,d requirement that landlords give tenants six months notice of ellis act eviction preempted by act,which contemplates a notice javidzad city of santa monica,supra,d at.requirement that landlord obtain removal permit before withdrawing controlled rental unit from housing market directly conflicts with ellis act.by contrast,landlords who comply with the belief requirement are not otherwise prevented from exiting the rental market.johnson himself acknowledges that he eventually served a new ellis act termination notice that complied with the requirement the relevant inquiry here,however,is whether the belief requirement conflicts with the ellis act.channing properties,supra,th at,d.
section provides detailed guidance regarding local statutes,ordinances or regulations that may be enacted requiring property owners to give notice to public entities and tenants of the intent to exit the rental market.section,subdivision c,contains the ellis act provision regarding notice to tenants in channing properties,the court considered a challenge to berkeley requirement that landlords provide six months notice to tenants that they intended to withdraw units from the rental market.channing properties,supra,th at,d.the court concluded that such a requirement conflicted with a provision in section that permitted a landlord to remove a property from the rental market days after serving a memorandum regarding the removal on the relevant public entity.channing properties,supra,at,d.by carefully spelling out certain types of notice which public entities may require,the act clearly indicates that only these types are authorized and other,additional notice requirements are not permissible.id.at,d.the city mistakenly characterizes this language as dicta and claims that the channing properties court found preemption because of a contradiction with an express provision of the ellis act.in fact,there was no express provision that public entities could require no more than days notice to tenants instead,the court was required to consider the provision in the statute regarding notice to tenants in conjunction with a provision regarding notice to public entities,which specified a timetable.id.at,d.
moreover,we do not agree with the city claim that complying with the belief requirement could not be easier.the belief requirement on its face requires landlords to inform their tenants whether they believe the tenants are entitled to reimbursement based on their age or disability.admin.code a,subd.e c.in some instances,the landlord may not know whether his or her tenant is over years of age.we do not believe the burden to state whether the tenant is over should be on the landlord rather than on the tenant,who could presumably demonstrate his or her age by simply providing a copy of a driver license or other identification.
the requirement that the landlord state a belief regarding a tenant entitlement to relocation payment based on his or her disability within the meaning of section is particularly troubling.admin.code.a,subd.e c.section defines disability as including any physical or mental disability as defined in section.section,in turn,includes an exhaustive list of potential mental and physical disabilities we agree with appellants that complying with the belief requirement could be overly burdensome where a landlord lacks access to sufficient or accurate information or where the tenant may not be forthcoming about having a disability.conducting an investigation as to whether a tenant has a disability would be especially onerous in light of the fact it is unlawful f or the owner of any housing accommodation to make or cause to be made any written or oral inquiry concerning the disability of any person seeking to rent or lease any housing accommodation,subd.b.
the city responds that landlords are under no affirmative duty to investigate whether tenants are entitled to relocation payments and that they are required to state their belief about such entitlements only where they possess such a belief.but the administrative code does not place such a limitation on the belief requirement.even if there was such a limitation,stating that a landlord does not have a belief regarding a tenant entitlement to relocation payments necessarily puts the landlord subjective state of mind at issue.as the city acknowledges,failure to comply with the belief requirement is a substantive defense in an unlawful detainer action.appellants point to several ways that a statement under the belief requirement could complicate unlawful detainer proceedings the tenant could contest the accuracy of the landlord belief or lack thereof the tenant could challenge the landlord determination of what constitutes a disability the landlord statement under the belief requirement may be binding on the owner,even if he or she mistakenly believes that his or her tenants are owed more than they actually are or the tenant might have a claim against the landlord if the landlord mistakenly suggests the tenant has a disability.the city does not address these potential complications,other than to say that landlords may easily avoid this eviction defense by replacing a defective termination notice with one that complies with the belief requirement.it claims that landlords typically are able to comply with the belief requirement even if they do not have a belief about entitlement to payment and do not conduct an investigation,pointing to three notices served by the same owner and submitted to the rent board stating that the owner did not have information to indicate the tenants were due a payment,as examples of compliance.while it may be true the city is not aware of anyone who has claimed such termination notices violate the belief requirement,the record does not reveal whether the tenants who received the notices actually challenged the owner belief.
the city argues,and the trial court agreed,that the belief requirement is designed to ensure that when the landlord and tenant agree on the amount of relocation assistance to which the tenant is entitled,the tenant is no longer forced to spend her time collecting documentary proof of her right to relocation assistance.instead,she may immediately turn to the more pressing business of finding a new place to live.italics added.this statement simply ignores the fact that the landlord and tenant may not agree in all instances on the amount of relocation assistance.by placing the burden on the landlord to state his or her belief about the tenant entitlement to assistance without first requiring the tenant to offer some showing of entitlement,the belief requirement places a prohibitive price on a landlord right to exit the rental market.javidzad city of santa monica,supra,d at.
the city defends the belief requirement as a permissible means to mitigate any adverse impact on persons displaced by reason of the withdrawal from rent or lease of any accommodations,subd.c.appellants do not challenge the other provisions of the city rent ordinance that truly mitigate the adverse impacts on displaced tenants the requirements that landlords inform ten
