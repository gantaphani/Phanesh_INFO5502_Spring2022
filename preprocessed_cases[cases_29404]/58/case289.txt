defendant and appellant city of los angeles the city appeals a judgment in a declaratory relief action invalidating a municipal ordinance.
the city adopted an ordinance prohibiting a landlord,after termination or nonrenewal of a section housing contract with the city housing authority,from charging the tenant more than the tenant portion of the rent under the former contract,without any limitation as to time.we conclude the ordinance conflicts with,and is preempted by,civil code section,which provides that for a period of days following receipt of the notice of termination or nonrenewal of the contract,a tenant shall not be obligated to pay more than the tenant portion of the rent under the former contract.
therefore,the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
overview of section housing program 
the housing assistance program commonly known as section is funded by the united states department of housing and urban development hud to provide rental assistance to senior citizens,disabled or handicapped persons and very low income tenants.hud channels money to housing authorities,provides technical assistance and training,and monitors housing authority compliance with program requirements and goals.rather than being provided with a specific unit at a subsidized housing site,section receive vouchers to contract for housing with participating landlords.locally,section is administered by the housing authority of the city of los angeles housing authority.
because the need for section vouchers greatly exceeds their availability,applicants are assigned to a waiting list.when an eligible applicant reaches the top of the waiting list,the applicant receives a voucher.the voucher assists the applicant in renting a privately owned dwelling.the dwelling the applicant chooses must meet section housing quality standards and the owner of the dwelling must agree to abide by regulations.section tenants pay about percent of their income towards their rent and hud,via the housing authority,pays the rest of the rent to the owner.
the section tenant finds housing much like anyone else.the section tenant must pay a portion of the rent,adhere to the lease and hud lease addendum requirements,and cooperate with the housing authority in annual inspections and income and rent reviews.
the section owner functions as a landlord in the private rental market.the owner signs a lease with the section tenant which includes a hud addendum and also signs a housing assistance payments hap contract with the housing authority.pursuant to the hap contract,the housing authority makes housing assistance payments to the section owner.
in response to removal of numerous housing units from section program,city council adopts an ordinance prohibiting a landlord from terminating or not renewing its rental assistance contract with the housing authority,and then requiring the tenant to pay rent in excess of the tenant share of the rent under the former contract.
in april,in response to the withdrawal by landlords of numerous housing units from the section program,the los angeles city council adopted ordinance the ordinance amending los angeles municipal code municipal code section.as amended,municipal code section,found within the rent stabilization ordinance mun.code,ch.xv,provides a.it shall be unlawful for any landlord to demand,accept or retain more than the maximum adjusted rent permitted pursuant to this chapter or regulation or orders adopted pursuant to this chapter.b.it shall be unlawful for any landlord to terminate or fail to renew a rental assistance contract with the housing authority of the city of los angeles hacla,and then demand that the tenant pay rent in excess of the tenant portion of the rent under the rental assistance contract,amended by ord,eff,italics added.
the ordinance includes the following statement of intent it is the intent of the city council that a landlord can not bring an action to recover possession of a rental unit on the ground that the tenant has failed to pay rent to which the landlord is entitled,if the landlord has terminated or failed to renew a rental assistance contract with the housing authority of the city of los angeles hacla,then demanded that the tenant pay rent in excess of the tenant portion of the rent under the rental assistance contract and subsequently refused to accept rental assistance paid by hacla.the affirmative defense to an unlawful detainer proceeding provided for in section e shall apply to any of these proceedings not reduced to final judgment as of the operative date of this amending ordinance.
the ordinance was adopted as an urgency measure to take effect immediately upon publication.in this regard,the ordinance states during the past few months,numerous landlords have changed the terms of an existing tenancy,such that section tenants could not continue to pay their rent through the section voucher program.accordingly,the institution of a no section policy has resulted in many tenants appearing to be voluntarily vacating their rental units during the term of an existing tenancy,thereby allowing the landlord,as a practical matter,to raise the rent in violation of state law and the rent stabilization ordinance.it is impossible to track and enforce these violations.the institution of the no section policy has resulted in the cancellation of approximately contracts and displacement of thousands of tenants.there are no available housing units for these displaced tenants because of general unavailability of affordable housing and limitations based on their income.therefore,in order to prevent the displacement of tenants who could not otherwise be forced to move,it is necessary that this affirmative defense be made available to those tenants who currently face possible displacement as a result of a no section policy.it is the intent of the city council that the affirmative defense to an unlawful detainer provided for in section e shall apply to these proceedings not reduced to final judgment as of the operative date of this amending ordinance.
the complaint for declaratory relief.
on august,within four months of the adoption of the new ordinance,plaintiffs apartment association of los angeles county,doing business as apartment association of greater los angeles,apartment association of san fernando and ferrell burton,iii,filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,challenging the validity of the ordinance.the associations are membership trade organizations representing numerous of owners and managers of residential rental property in the city of los angeles and are subject to the city rent stabilization ordinance.burton owns rental property in the city.
plaintiffs alleged,inter alia,the ordinance mandated reduction in the amount of rent that an owner can collect for the occupancy of rental property after a lawful nonrenewal of a hacla contract constitutes a taking of the owner property without just compensation in violation of the state and federal constitutions.further,the setting of the monthly rent at a fraction of its fair market value,without regard to the reasonable rental value of the property and bereft of any factual or economic basis for the fractional amount set,is arbitrary,capricious,punitive and in violation of the rent stabilization ordinance,which guarantees an owner will be allowed a just and reasonable return.
proceedings.
on march,the matter came on for trial.the parties agreed the case involved issues of law only and that they would submit the matter on the trial briefs that were filed.the matter was taken under submission.on july,the trial court issued a tentative ruling,concluding the ordinance was preempted by state law.the trial court requested the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the preemption issue.the parties then filed supplemental briefs on that issue.
the city papers took the position civil code section does not preempt the ordinance.because the legislature did not intend to fully occupy the area of sudden rent increases.the state statute sets forth notice guidelines for sudden rent increases that could follow a landlord cancellation of a rental assistance contract whereas the city ordinance provides rent stabilized tenants with an affirmative defense to illegal rent increases.by allowing the statute and the ordinance to coexist,the public policy of locally controlling rent regulations is best served.
plaintiffs,in turn,argued state law,specifically,civil code sections and,fully regulate the termination of section tenancies,and the legislative history reflects the restriction upon rent collected from the tenant must be limited to days.
trial court ruling and judgment.
the tentative ruling,which essentially became the final ruling in the matter,sets forth the trial court reasoning with respect to the preemption issue.
in its ruling,the trial court found the preemption issue was dispositive.it noted,w hile there were several issues raised by the parties,whether the challenged ordinance exceeds the city police power,constitutes an impairment of contract or a taking,it is the court conclusion that the ordinance in question is preempted by state law.
a conflict between state and local law exists when a local law serves the same purpose as the state law but provides additional tenant protection.citation.the ordinance in question in this case is in conflict with state law.civil code section provides where an owner terminates or fails to renew a contract or recorded agreement with a governmental agency that provides for rent limitations to a qualified tenant,the tenant or tenants who were the beneficiaries of the contract or recorded agreement shall be given at least days written notice of the effective date of the termination and shall not be obligated to pay more than the tenant portion of the rent,as calculated under the contract or recorded agreement to be terminated,for days following receipt of the notice of termination of nonrenewal of the contract.
the purpose of the statute,according to the legislative history,is to protect tenants from sudden price increases that force them to move.civil code section protects tenants by giving them days before they have to pay more than the portion of the rent they previously paid.the ordinance at issue imposes the same restriction but without a time limit.the purpose of the ordinance appears to the court to be identical to the purpose of the state law,protection of tenants from sudden significant rent increases but the ordinance provides no time limitation.thus,a tenant could remain in a unit paying only a small percentage of the market value of the rent for many years if he or she so chose.
rent control is certainly not a fully occupied area of state law localities have considerable control.but when the issue becomes narrower,how much rent a landlord can charge after a rental assistance contract is canceled,it does not seem to this court that the legislature could have intended for the specific time limitation it imposed to be directly contradicted by local law.if the legislature did not intend for a time limit to be imposed,it would not have included one at all.it is well established that statutes must be construed so that none of the language is superfluous to hold that the state law and the city ordinance do not conflict would be to render the limit in civil code section superfluous.as such,the court concludes that the state and local laws conflict,and thus the local ordinance is preempted.italics added.
on august,the trial court entered judgment declaring ordinance,the ordinance,and municipal code section.b are preempted by state law and therefore,void,invalid and of no force nor effect 
this appeal followed.
contentions 
the city contends plaintiffs lack standing to prosecute this action,and municipal code section is not preempted by civil code section 
discussion 
plaintiffs have standing to maintain this action.
the city contends plaintiffs lack standing because they pled no more than they have members who own dwellings which are or may be subject to the city rent stabilization ordinance.according to the city,no actual or imminent actual injury caused by the enactment of municipal code section is alleged,and in the absence of any such allegation,plaintiffs lack standing to mount their facial challenge to the validity of the ordinance.as explained,the city challenge to plaintiffs standing is without merit.
a.the city is entitled to raise the issue of standing for the first time on appeal.
as a preliminary matter,we note the city challenge to the plaintiffs standing is being raised for the first time at the appellate level.however,the issue of standing is properly before us.

no merit to city challenge to plaintiffs standing to sue.
municipal code section sets forth remedies for violation of the provisions of the rent stabilization ordinance.a landlord who demands,accepts or retains any payment in excess of the amount allowed by the rent stabilization ordinance shall be liable in a civil action for damages of three times the amount of the excess rent,a.in addition,a landlord who violates section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,b,italics added.thus,an owner who terminates a section contract and then charges the tenant rent in excess of the tenant portion of the rent under the rental assistance contract,in violation of municipal code section b,faces very serious consequences.

further,a n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.citation.driving sch.of cal.san mateo union high sch.dist.th,d.here,the association plaintiffs satisfy all three criteria.their individual members could have challenged the validity of the ordinance in their own right,the right to a fair rent is germane to the association plaintiffs organizational purpose and their facial challenge to the validity of the ordinance does not require the participation of any individual members.
we conclude plaintiffs had standing to bring this action and turn to the merits of the appeal.
trial court properly found the ordinance is preempted by civil code section.
