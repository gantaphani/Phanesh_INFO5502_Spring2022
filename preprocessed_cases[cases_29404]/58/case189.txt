state law provides that a landlord may change the terms of a lease after giving days notice and that the new terms become part of the lease if the tenant continues to hold the premises after the notice takes effect,subd.a.a regulation promulgated by san francisco rent board provides that notwithstanding any changes to the terms of a tenancy under section,a tenant may not be evicted for violating an obligation that was not included in the tenant original rental agreement unless the change is authorized by san francisco rent control ordinance is required by law,or is accepted by the tenant in writing.rule.the primary question in this appeal is whether section preempts rule.the remaining questions are whether the rent board exceeded its powers when it adopted rule,and whether it exceeded its powers when it adopted rule c,which limits the rent a master tenant may charge to a subtenant but provides that a violation of that limitation is not a basis for eviction.
we conclude that section does not preempt rule and that the rent board did not exceed its powers in adopting the challenged regulations.accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.
i.the rent ordinance and rent board 
in,the san francisco board of supervisors supervisors adopted a comprehensive ordinance known as the san francisco residential rent stabilization and arbitration ordinance.citation.the supervisors adopted the rent ordinance because the lack of affordable rental housing in san francisco was creating hardships on senior citizens,persons on fixed incomes,and low and households.when adopting the rent ordinance,the supervisors created a rent board charged with safeguarding tenants from excessive rent increases,while also assuring landlords fair and adequate rents consistent with federal guidelines.the rent ordinance mandated that the rent board be comprised of two landlord commissioners,two tenant commissioners,and one member who would be neither a landlord nor a tenant,subds.a b.the supervisors conferred on the rent board a range of powers and duties,including the power to promulgate policies,rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this chapter,subd.a.the purposes of the rent ordinance included,among others,the limitation of rent increases for tenants in occupancy rent,the arbitration of rental increase adjustments rent,and the restriction of the grounds on which landlords could evict tenants from their rental units rent,b.danekas san francisco residential rent stabilization arbitration bd.th,danekas.
ii.background 
plaintiff margaret foster has lived for more than years in an apartment in a building the building now owned by defendant and john britton and managed by defendant and britton,collectively,britton.after buying the building in,britton served the tenants,including plaintiff,with house rules.among other provisions,the house rules required tenants to share the back yard equally,unless all tenants agreed otherwise to maintain their own garbage service to keep all property inside the unit,out of view and to use an outside laundromat rather than washing clothes in the sinks or tubs in their units.it also prohibited tenants from having pets and from storing their belongings anywhere except in their rental units or areas designated by the landlord.the document setting forth the new house rules stated that the rules superseded all previous house rules,that they went into effect days from receipt,and that tenant accepts the house rules by remaining in possession after they come into effect and paying rent each month.if tenant does not accept the house rules,tenant may opt to give days written notice to landlord to terminate his or her tenancy and move out.britton informed plaintiff that,under the new house rules,she would no longer be able to store personal property outside her unit.plaintiff responded that the longstanding terms of her tenancy included garbage service,two parking spaces,an assigned area in the back yard,specific storage spaces,and the use of her service porch for laundry and storage.she informed britton she did not agree to any unilateral changes to her rental agreement.in the ensuing dispute,britton took the position that section,subdivision a preempted rule.
foster brought this action,alleging she was a resident of the building and that the house rules conflicted with terms and conditions that had always been included in her rental agreement,including exclusive use of two parking spaces,use of a service porch for storage and laundry facilities,exclusive use of assigned garden areas,use of storage spaces,and inclusion of garbage service in her rental payments.she sought a declaration that section did not preempt rule,and rule barred the eviction of any tenant based on house rules.she also sought an injunction prohibiting defendants from attempting to evict her based on a violation of the house rules.the rent board intervened in the action,seeking a declaration that rule was not preempted by section.
britton against the rent board,seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that section preempted rule,and rules and c modified,conflicted with,or provided exceptions to the grounds for eviction found in the rent ordinance and the rent board exceeded its authority it enacting them.
plaintiff moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the grounds that section did not preempt rule and that rule barred the eviction of a tenant for violating house rules that contradicted a rental agreement the trial court ruled that plaintiff was entitled to a declaration that section did not preempt rule and that the rent board did not exceed its powers when it adopted rule.the court found the issue of whether rule barred the eviction of a tenant for violating house rules not ripe for review,because there was no eviction action pending,and therefore plaintiff was not entitled to declaratory relief on this claim.accordingly,the court granted summary adjudication to plaintiff as to the first issue only.plaintiff subsequently dismissed the second issue without prejudice.
the rent board demurred to britton and moved for judgment on the pleadings as to the complaint in intervention on the grounds that rule was a valid exercise of the police power,that section did not preempt rule,and that the board did not exceed its powers when adopting rule.the trial court granted the rent board motion for judgment on the pleadings,ruling it was entitled to a declaration that that section did not preempt rule.it also sustained the rent board demurrer to the causes of action concerning rule.
the rent board and britton then litigated the question of whether the rent board had exceeded its powers when it enacted rule c.the rent board moved for judgment on the pleadings as to the on the grounds that britton lacked standing to challenge rule c,subd.and that the rent board did not exceed its powers in adopting it.the trial court granted the motion with leave to amend to allege standing.britton amended the to allege that britton,was an unincorporated association of landlords and owners of rental property,that it managed and represented the rights of numerous landlords in san francisco,and that it brought suit in its representative capacity on behalf of its members to challenge the rent board action.the rent board demurred to the amended on the ground that it did not exceed its powers in adopted rule c,subd,but it did not argue that britton lacked standing to challenge the regulation.the trial court granted the demurrer with leave to amend to allege facts showing rule c,subd.was not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the rent ordinance and that it was arbitrary,capricious,or without reasonable basis.britton filed a second amended,to which the rent board demurred,again on the sole ground that it did not exceed its powers in enacting rule c,subd.the trial court granted the demurrer without leave to amend.the court then entered judgment in favor of foster and the rent board in accordance with its previous orders 
iii.discussion 
preemption 
the first question before us is whether the trial court correctly ruled that section does not preempt rule whether rule is preempted by state law is a question of law that we review de novo.roble vista associates bacon th,bravo vending city of rancho mirage th.
rule provides in pertinent part notwithstanding any change in the terms of a tenancy pursuant to civil code section,a tenant may not be evicted for violation of a covenant or obligation that was not included in the tenant rental agreement at the inception of the tenancy unless the change in the terms of the tenancy is authorized by the rent ordinance or required by federal,state or local law or the change in the terms of the tenancy was accepted in writing by the tenant after receipt of written notice from the landlord that the tenant need not accept such new term as part of the rental agreement.
britton argues that in order to avoid preemption,we should interpret rule to mean that changes to the terms of a lease become part of the conditions of the lease if the tenant agrees to the changes by remaining in possession of the premises,even if the changes are not authorized by the rent ordinance,required by law,or agreed to in writing by the tenant.this reading of rule flies in the face of the plain language of the regulation,which prohibits eviction for violating changes to the terms of a tenancy unless one of those conditions is met.we shall assume that the regulation means what it says and proceed to consider whether,so viewed,it is preempted by section.
a local law may conflict with a statute either directly or by implication.fisher city of berkeley cal d,fisher.we may infer the legislature intended to preempt a field only if the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the municipality.citations.id.at.
in considering the question before us,we bear in mind that our supreme court has upheld challenges to local rent control legislation against preemption challenges in the past.the court in birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d birkenfeld,considered the city of berkeley rent control law,which had been passed by an initiative amendment to the city charter.in doing so,the court made a distinction between local limitations placed on the substantive grounds for eviction and the local laws establishment of procedural barriers between the landlord and the judicial proceeding that exceed those established by state law.id.at,italics added.the court invalidated berkeley rent control law to the extent it required a landlord to obtain a certificate of eviction from the city before seeking to evict a tenant pursuant to the summary repossession provisions of code of civil procedure sections through.as the court explained,to require landlords to fulfill the elaborate prerequisites for the issuance of a certificate of eviction by the rent control board before they commence the statutory proceeding would nullify the intended summary nature of the state law remedy.birkenfeld,cal d at.
the court upheld,however,the substantive limitations on grounds for eviction against a challenge that they conflicted with state law.the court first concluded the city had the power to provide for rent control.it reasoned,the fact that the charter amendment prohibits landlords of residential units within the city from charging more than the maximum rents prescribed by a municipal rent control board under specified standards does not bring the amendment into conflict with general state law.california has no state rent control statute.there is of course extensive state legislation governing many aspects of relationships,some of which pertain specifically to the determination or payment of rent.see,changing rent terms in tenancies of one month or less citations.but neither the quantity nor the content of these statutes establishes or implies any legislative intent to exclude municipal regulation of the amount of rent based on local conditions.citation.the charter amendment purpose of preventing exploitation of a housing shortage through excessive rent charges is distinct from the purpose of any state legislation,and the imposition of rent ceilings does not materially interfere with any state legislative purpose.citation.whether the relevant field be deemed to be rent control as such or a broader aspect of relations citation,there is no legislative indication of a paramount state concern which will not tolerate further or additional local action.citation.birkenfeld,supra,cal at pp,fn.omitted,italics added.
the court went on to conclude that the local rent control law restriction on the grounds for eviction did not conflict with general law.the court explained that the charter amendment provided for eviction for numerous reasons,including a violation of the tenant duties to the landlord,such as the duty to pay rent or not to use the premises for illegal purposes,the landlord good faith intention to withdraw the unit from the rental market,and the tenant refusal to execute a written renewal of the lease,on materially the same terms,upon expiration of the lease.birkenfeld,supra,cal d at pp.these grounds,the court noted,appeared to cover most if not all of the grounds that would otherwise be available except that of termination of the tenancy,and the prohibition of eviction upon expiration of the tenancy was a reasonable means of enforcing rent ceilings by preventing landlords from putting out tenants because of their unwillingness to pay illegal amounts of rent id.at.the court rejected the contention that this prohibition conflicted with the unlawful detainer law,under which a landlord may recover possession in summary proceedings if a tenant continues in possession after the expiration of the term of a lease.id.at pp.code civ,subd.the court explained the purpose of the unlawful detainer statutes is procedural.the statutes implement the landlord property rights by permitting him to recover possession once the consensual basis for the tenant occupancy is at an end.in contrast the charter amendment elimination of particular grounds for eviction is a limitation upon the landlord property rights under the police power,giving rise to a substantive ground of defense in unlawful detainer proceedings.the mere fact that a city exercise of the police power creates such a defense does not bring it into conflict with the state statutory scheme.birkenfeld,cal d at.
following birkenfeld,our high court in fisher,supra,cal d at pp,concluded that another provision of berkeley rent control ordinance allowing a tenant to withhold rent and providing a defense to unlawful detainer if the tenant believed in good faith that the landlord had not complied with certain obligations was not preempted by general law.the court explained,as we observed in birkenfeld,this exercise of the municipality police power does not bring the provision into conflict with state law,because the statutory remedy for recovery of possession does not preclude limitations on grounds for eviction for the purpose of enforcing a local rent control regulation.birkenfeld,supra,cal d at.
our high court also discussed the application of the general rules of preemption to the rent control ordinance,and concluded the state had neither occupied the field of rent withholding in a manner that clearly indicated the field was solely a matter of state concern nor indicated that the field of rent withholding was a subject of paramount state concern that could not tolerate local involvement,and that the provisions would have little effect on transient citizens.id.at.
our colleagues in division three of this court reviewed birkenfeld and fisher and summarized,thus,under existing law,municipalities may by ordinance limit the substantive grounds for eviction by specifying that a landlord may gain possession of a rental unit only on certain limited grounds.citations.but they may not procedurally impair the summary eviction scheme set forth in the unlawful detainer statutes and they may not alter the evidence code burdens of proof.citations.rental housing of northern alameda county city of oakland th,rental housing.thus,the court stated,a local rent control ordinance may permissibly eliminate a ground for eviction specified in code of civil procedure without creating a conflict with the unlawful detainer statutes.citations.id.at pp.
britton contends rule is preempted by section.subdivision a of that statute provides where a lease is from week to week,month to month,or another period of less than a month,a landlord may,upon giving notice as provided in code of civil procedure section,change the terms of the lease as to tenancies from month to month,to take effect at the expiration of not less than days provided,however,that it shall be competent for the parties to provide by an agreement in writing that a notice changing the terms thereof may be given at any time not less than seven days before the expiration of a term,to be effective upon the expiration of the term.the notice,when served upon the tenant,shall in and of itself operate and be effectual to create and establish,as a part of the lease,the terms,rents,and conditions specified in the notice,if the tenant shall continue to hold the premises after the notice takes effect.subdivision b provides that in all leases of residential dwellings from week to week,month to month,or a period less than a month,the landlord may increase the rent provided in the lease or rental agreement,upon giving written notice to the tenant either by personal service or by mail pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subd.b.subdivisions b and b establish notice periods based on the amount of the rental increase.finally,subdivision c of section provides if a state or federal statute,state or federal regulation,recorded regulatory agreement,or contract provides for a longer period of notice regarding a rent increase than that provided in subdivision a or b,the personal service or mailing of the notice shall be in accordance with the longer period.
as we have described,under birkenfeld and its progeny,a municipality has authority to limit the substantive grounds for eviction,but it may not interfere with the procedural protections offered by state law.birkenfeld,supra,cal d at pp.rental housing,supra,th at.nothing in rule interferes with the notice procedures required by section,or any other procedural protections.rather,its effect is to regulate the substantive grounds on which a landlord may evict a tenant.
we do not agree with britton that section was intended to limit the substantive grounds for eviction.subdivision a of section provides that in all leases of lands or tenements,the landlord may change the terms of the lease,including terms,rents,and conditions,after giving the notice required by the statute.italics added.similarly,subdivision b provides that in all leases of a residential dwelling,the landlord may increase the rent provided in the lease or rental agreement,after giving the specified notice.despite theses references to rent,our high court has explicitly concluded that section does not establish or impl y any legislative intent to exclude municipal regulation of the amount of rent based on local conditions.birkenfeld,supra,cal d at.we see no principled basis to conclude that in enacting section,the legislature intended unilateral changes in rent which section does not preempt to be treated differently than unilateral changes in other terms of a lease.viewing the statute as a whole in light of the governing precedent,we conclude its purpose is to establish procedural safeguards for tenants when landlords raise the rent or change other terms of the tenancy,and not to prevent local governments from regulating the substantive grounds for eviction.
accordingly,we reject britton contention that rule conflicts with or is preempted by state law 
b.the board did not exceed its authority in promulgating rule 
as a second challenge to rule,britton contends the rent board exceeded its authority in promulgating it.according to britton,the rent ordinance sets out exceptions to the allowable grounds for eviction,and rule prohibition on evicting tenants for violating terms of the tenancy improperly created an additional exception and constituted improper legislation by the rent board.as a result,britton argues,rule did not further the purposes of the rent ordinance.
the principles we apply to such a claim are well established.when reviewing the legality of a regulation adopted pursuant to a delegation of legislative authority,we are limited to determining whether the regulation is within the scope of the authority conferred and whether the regulation is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citations.in enacting such rules and regulations,the rent board is empowered to fill up the details of the enabling legislation.citation.the court role is to decide whether in enacting the specific rule the rent board reasonably interpreted the legislative mandate.citation.citation.as a general proposition,administrative regulations are said to be shielded by a presumption of regularity citation and presumed to be reasonable and lawful.citation.the party challenging such regulations has the burden of proving otherwise.citation.citation.danekas,supra,th at.in deciding whether the regulation conflicts with its legislative mandate,however,the court does not defer to the agency interpretation of the law under which the regulation issued,but rather exercises its own independent judgment.lazarin superior court th.
the enabling legislation here is the rent ordinance,which grants the rent board the power to p romulgate policies,rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of the rent ordinance.rent,subd.a.
the premise of britton argument is that the rent ordinance established certain grounds for eviction and enumerated certain exceptions to those grounds relying on the legal maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius,britton contends that by specifying these exceptions,the supervisors implicitly precluded the rent board from creating additional exceptions.
as britton notes,section of the rent ordinance prohibits a landlord from evicting a tenant except in certain circumstances,among them when the tenant fails to pay rent rent,subd.a,violates a lawful obligation of the tenancy,subd.a,commits a nuisance or damages the unit,subd.a,uses the premises for an illegal purpose,subd.a,or refuses the landlord lawful access to the unit,subd.a the landlord may also,if acting in good faith,recover possession of the unit for occupancy by the landlord or a relative or for specified other reasons,subds.a.
britton focuses on section,subdivision a,which authorizes a landlord to evict a tenant when t he tenant has violated a lawful obligation or covenant of tenancy other than the obligation to surrender possession upon proper notice or other than an obligation to pay a charge prohibited by police code section,and the tenant fails to cure the violation after receiving written notice.this subdivision then goes on to provide for two exceptions.n otwithstanding any lease provision to the contrary,a landlord shall not endeavor to recover possession of a rental unit as a result of subletting of the rental unit by the tenant if the landlord has unreasonably withheld the right to sublet following a written request by the tenant,so long as certain conditions are met rent,subd.a a.further,where a rental agreement or lease provision limits the number of occupants or limits or prohibits subletting or assignment,a landlord shall not endeavor to recover possession of a rental unit as a result of the addition to the unit of specified relatives of the tenant,so long as the specified number of occupants is not exceeded,subd.a b.by enacting these provisions,britton contends,the supervisors established exceptions to the landlord right to evict a tenant for violating a lawful obligation of the tenancy,and,by implication,prohibited the ren
