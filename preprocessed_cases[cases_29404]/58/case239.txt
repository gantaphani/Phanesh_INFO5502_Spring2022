this appeal follows the entry of defense summary judgment.the defendants are the landlords of an apartment complex where the plaintiff resided,under a lease entered into by her ohio employer.the employer terminated the plaintiff employment following an industrial injury,and then it directed the defendants to change the locks on the plaintiff apartment unit.they complied,thereby causing the plaintiff to leave her residence.the plaintiff then instituted this litigation against the landlords alone.asserting that she was an intended third party beneficiary of the lease,the plaintiff alleged causes of action,including contract,tort,and statutory claims.the trial court granted the defendants summary judgment on all causes of action,ruling that the plaintiff was not an intended beneficiary of the lease and thus not the defendants tenant.the court also awarded the defendants their costs of suit,including statutory attorney fees as the prevailing parties.
we reverse the judgment and the fee award.as we shall explain,defense summary judgment on the contract claims is precluded,because the question of plaintiff status as an intended third party of the lease presents triable issues of fact.summary judgment on the remaining claims is precluded,because of triable issues on the question of whether the defendants improperly disturbed the plaintiff peaceful possession through resort to impermissible.reversal of the summary judgment means that the defendants are no longer the prevailing parties the award of costs and fees in their favor thus can not stand.
factual background 
the plaintiff in this action is lori spinks.the defendants are,a california limited partnership,and equity residential properties management.defendants own and operate briarwood apartment homes in sunnyvale,california,where plaintiff resided in late and early.
on october,plaintiff entered into a written employment agreement to work for mobile medical staffing,llc mobile.in the form agreement,the employee is referred to as traveler.the employer,mobile,is located in dayton,ohio.in the notice provision of the employment agreement,plaintiff listed an address in austin,texas.plaintiff and mobile entered into the employment agreement in louisiana.
the employment agreement called for plaintiff to undertake a staffing assignment at stanford university health sciences in california.the starting date of the assignment was october.
as part of the employment agreement,plaintiff and mobile also entered into a housing agreement,which stated that plaintiff would be housed individually in housing provided by the employer.under the housing agreement,only the spouse and minor children shall be allowed to reside with the employee.the contract calls for the housing benefit to start at least two days before the work assignment begins.it terminates two days after the assignment ends,under this provision traveler must vacate the housing within hours of the termination date of assignment.the housing agreement further states in the event that traveler breaches this agreement,mobile shall have the right to initiate eviction proceeding s against traveler.
on october,mobile entered into a lease agreement with defendants.as provided in the form lease,mobile rented apartment in the briarwood complex for a period commencing october.in the space for designating residents,the lease names corporate mobile medical staff.the nearby space for designating occupants is left blank.
on the same date as the lease was executed,mobile director signed a letter of responsibility,which was sent to defendants.in that letter,plaintiff is identified by name as the occupant of the unit.the letter begins this is to serve as a letter of responsibility for the above named employee,who will reside at briarwood apartment homes,apt,move in date.after assuming responsibility for specified items,the letter concludes the agreement will remain in effect for the duration of occupancy by our employee.
in late october,plaintiff moved into apartment.the apartment was furnished with furniture rented by mobile.plaintiff completed a corporate occupant application and a inspection form at defendants request.she was provided with a resident handbook spelling out rules to be followed by tenants at the property.
in december,plaintiff work assignment at stanford was extended for another weeks.the lease term likewise was extended for weeks,to run through may.in the lease extension,plaintiff was identified by name as the occupant of the apartment.
on january,plaintiff was seriously injured at work.she was unable to return to full duty.plaintiff underwent reconstructive surgery on her hand the following month.
by letter dated february,mobile notified plaintiff that it would no longer be providing the housing,utilities,furniture,nor automobile that she was then using.plaintiff received mobile letter on or about february,when she returned home from the hospital following her surgery.the letter advised we will notify pg e to turn off the utilities as of monday february.we will instruct brooks furniture to pick up the furniture on february or.we have notified the landlord that our staffing agreement has concluded for this assignment and we will no longer be paying the rent.
plaintiff went to defendants manager to discuss the letter,upset that they were going to turn off her electricity.the manager informed her that that not going to happen because in the state of california you ca shut someone electricity off in order to make them get out of an apartment.mobile representative was given the same information.
after learning that mobile would not be allowed to turn off the electricity,its representative asked if he could request to have the locks changed.defendants manager responded that she would need a work order in order to do that.mobile thereafter faxed a letter dated february,informing defendants of the change of status of apartment and making this request please change the locks on the above unit immediately.
to carry out mobile request,defendants manager created a work order for maintenance staff to change the locks to plaintiff apartment.the manager informed plaintiff that the lock would be changed.plaintiff was distraught at the news.plaintiff told the manager that she was seriously injured and under doctors orders to use her arm as little as possible.she informed them that she had been terminated from her employment and had no other place to reside.
on february,the furniture was removed from the apartment by the furniture rental company.plaintiff let the movers in.but mobile had previously authorized defendants to release keys to the furniture rental company,so that it could remove the furniture.
later that afternoon,the locks on the apartment were changed by defendants employee.by that time,plaintiff had packed her belongings but she was still moving some boxes of stuff.defendants manager told plaintiff that she was sorry,and to please leave the keys with the guy changing the locks.
procedural history 
in june,plaintiff instituted this action against defendants.plaintiff asserted that she was a third party beneficiary of the lease and the intended and actual occupant of the apartment.as a result,plaintiff alleged,defendants owed her a duty to comply with california law governing relationships,which they breached by ousting her from possession of the apartment.plaintiff asserted causes of action against defendants three contract claims,seven causes of action sounding in tort,and two statutory claims 
after its demurrer was overruled,defendant answered the complaint,interposing a general denial and affirmative defenses.the affirmative defenses included consent,abandonment,lack of privity of contract,and plaintiff status as a mere licensee.
defense motion for summary judgment 
in november,both defendants moved for summary judgment,or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication.articulating the essence of their position,defendants argued plaintiff can not establish that she is a tenant of defendants or an intended third party beneficiary to the lease agreement for the subject apartment and there was no breach of any duty or obligation owed to her.
plaintiff filed written opposition to the motion,which included additional factual assertions as well as formal evidentiary objections.in support of her contention that she was a beneficiary,plaintiff asserted the central purpose of the lease was to provide a residence for plaintiff lori spinks.beyond that,she argued the lease clearly establishes tenancy status for plaintiff as a beneficiary.moreover,plaintiff urged,statutory and tort liability would attach even if she were a mere occupant,rather than a tenant.
in reply,defendants objected to plaintiff purported additional material facts as irrelevant,lacking the necessary foundation,proffering a legal conclusion,and presenting an inaccurate and biased picture of the evidence.defendants argued contrary to plaintiff contentions,the material facts before the court are not in dispute there is no triable issue of material fact.what the parties require here is the court determination of plaintiff standing under the lease,if any,as a matter of law based on the evidence before it.
hearing and order 
on february,the trial court conducted a hearing on the defense summary judgment motion.it issued a written order the following day,granting the motion.the court did not rule on the evidentiary objections.
in its formal order after hearing,the trial court found that plaintiff was not a third party beneficiary of the lease.for that reason,the court said,plaintiff lacked standing to bring her contract claims.as for plaintiff other claims,the court reasoned because plaintiff can not show she is an express third party beneficiary,she also can not show that she was a tenant of the defendants.on that basis,the court summarily adjudicated plaintiff tort claims,citing the lack of any legal duty.the court also disposed of the statutory causes of action based on its determination that plaintiff was not defendants tenant.
on february,summary judgment for defendants was entered.thereafter,following to fix and tax attorney fees,the trial court issued an order awarding defendants statutory fees as prevailing parties,pursuant to civil code section.on may,the court ordered entry of judgment in defendants favor for costs and fees.the judgment for defendants exceeded,including attorney fees of more than,plus costs of just over.
in april,plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the summary judgment.the following month,she filed an amended notice of appeal,to include the subsequent judgment for attorney fees and costs.
as she did below,plaintiff asserts that she was an intended beneficiary of the lease and thus defendants tenant.alternatively,plaintiff urges,she was at least an occupant in peaceful possession.plaintiff urges reversal of the defense summary judgment on those grounds.she also maintains her right to seek punitive damages as to several of the causes of action asserted in the complaint.in addition,plaintiff challenges the award of fees,arguing reversal of the judgment requires reversal of the fee award,and in any event,the statute should not be interpreted to allow fees in this situation.
defendants dispute all of plaintiff appellate arguments.

ii.third party beneficiaries 
general principles 
california law permits third party beneficiaries to enforce the terms of a contract made for their benefit.principal mutual life ins.vars,pave,mccord freedman th,d principal mutual.that authority is codified in civil code section,which states a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.
classification as intended or incidental beneficiary 
third parties claiming the right to performance under an agreement made by others are classified as either intended or incidental beneficiaries of the contract.as explained in the restatement second of contracts an incidental beneficiary is a beneficiary who is not an intended beneficiary.rest d contracts.as used in civil code section,the word expressly has now come to mean merely the negative of incidentally.gilbert financial steelform contracting d.accord,prouty gores technology group th,d prouty.
test for determining third party status 
the test for determining whether a contract was made for the benefit of a third person is whether an intent to benefit a third person appears from the terms of the contract.citation.if the terms of the contract necessarily require the promisor to confer a benefit on a third person,then the contract,and hence the parties thereto,contemplate a benefit to the third person.the parties are presumed to intend the consequences of a performance of the contract.johnson holmes tuttle.d,accord,prouty,supra,th at,d souza westlands water dist.th,d.in other words,the doctrine presupposes that the defendant made a promise which,if performed,would have benefited the third party.souza westlands water,at,d.
under the intent test,it is not enough that the third party would incidentally have benefited from performance.souza westlands water,supra,th at,d.the circumstance that a literal contract interpretation would result in a benefit to the third party is not enough to entitle that party to demand enforcement.the contracting parties must have intended to confer a benefit on the third party.neverkovec fredericks th,d.the effect of the section is to exclude enforcement by persons who are only incidentally or remotely benefited.lucas hamm cal d.
on the other hand,the third person need not be named or identified individually to be an express beneficiary.kaiser engineers,grinnell fire protection systems d.accord,soderberg mckinney th,d.a third party may enforce a contract where he shows that he is a member of a class of persons for whose benefit it was made.garratt baker cal d,see also,soderberg mckinney,at,d souza westlands water,supra,th at,d.
while intent is pivotal,there is no requirement that both of the contracting parties must intend to benefit the third party schauer mandarin gems of california,th,d.rather,it is sufficient that the promisor must have understood that the promisee had such intent.lucas hamm,supra,cal d at,accord,schauer mandarin gems of california,at,d.thus,a third party will qualify as an intended beneficiary where the circumstances indicate that the promisee here,mobile intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.rest,supra,b.
ultimately,the determination turns on the manifestation of intent to confer a benefit on the third party.hess ford motor cal th,d.ascertaining this intent is a question of ordinary contract interpretation.ibid.
contract interpretation 
the primary goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties intent as it existed at the time of contracting,waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.
intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the language of the written contract,waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,an inflexible rule that would limit the determination of the meaning of a written instrument to its merely because it seems to the court to be clear and unambiguous,would either deny the relevance of the intention of the parties or presuppose a degree of verbal precision and stability our language has not attained.pacific gas thomas drayage.cal d.thus,other factors may come into play as well.
a contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made,and the matter to which it relates.in determining the meaning of a written contract allegedly made,in part,for the benefit of a third party,evidence of the circumstances and negotiations of the parties in making the contract is both relevant and admissible.garcia truck ins.exchange cal d,accord,souza westlands water,supra,th at,d.
additionally,a court may consider the subsequent conduct of the parties in construing an ambiguous contract.southern cal.edison superior court th,d.in determining intent to benefit a third party,the contracting parties practical construction of a contract,as shown by their actions,is important evidence of their intent.kalmanovitz bitting th,d.
suit by intended beneficiary against promisor 
the action by a third party beneficiary for the breach of the promisor engagement does not rest on the ground of any actual or supposed relationship between the parties but on the broad and more satisfactory basis that the law,operating on the acts of the parties,creates the duty,establishes a privity,and implies the promise and obligation on which the action is founded.johnson holmes tuttle,supra,d at.so long as the contract remains unrescinded,the relations of the parties are the same as though the promise had been made directly to the third party.prouty,supra,th at,d.
given the nature of the parties legal relationship,an intended beneficiary is not required to sue the promisee directly.it is no objection to the maintenance of an action by a third party that a suit might be brought also against the one to whom the promise was made.johnson holmes tuttle,supra,d at.nevertheless,a beneficiary may not obtain a greater recovery than that which would have been available to the promisee.souza westlands water,supra,th at,d.furthermore,the intended beneficiary bears the burden of proving that the promise he seeks to enforce was actually made to him personally or to a class of which he is a member.neverkovec fredericks,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
as noted above,the intended beneficiary has a right of action that continues until the contract has been rescinded in compliance with the rescission statute,principal mutual,supra,th at,d witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.if rescission has not occurred according to the statutory procedures,but the contract is instead terminated for some other reason,a third party beneficiary may still enforce the agreement.principal mutual,at,d syufy enterprises city of oakland th,d.moreover,the contracting parties may not rescind or revoke the contract where the beneficiary has accepted the benefit or has detrimentally acted in reliance thereon or where the promisor continues to retain the consideration from the original promisee griffin williamson d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also,silveyra harper d,no estoppel exists because respondent in no way changed his position to his damage in reliance on that part of the promise principal mutual,at,d contract benefit survived where there was no attempt by either party to restore the consideration obtained under the lease.
appellate review 
generally,it is a question of fact whether a particular third person is an intended beneficiary of a contract.prouty,supra,th at,d.but if the issue is presented to the court on the basis of undisputed facts and uncontroverted evidence and only a question of the application of the law to those facts need be answered,appellate review is de novo.souza westlands water,supra,th at,d see also,neverkovec fredericks,supra,th at,d.
applying the foregoing principles to the record before us,we find triable issues of material fact on the question of whether plaintiff was a beneficiary of the lease agreement between her employer and defendants.
the evidentiary record 
plaintiff interposed a number of objections to defendants proffered evidence.the trial court declined to render formal rulings on the evidentiary objections,stating that it had disregarded all inadmissible and incompetent evidence in ruling herein.in doing so,the court relied on biljac associates first interstate bank d.biljac has since been called into question on this point.see,demps san francisco housing authority th,d.the issue is currently pending in the california supreme court.reid google,gr.for purposes of our analysis here,however,we need not weigh in on the validity of the biljac rule.
nevertheless,we shall discuss one key objection,raised by plaintiff below,which she renews on appeal.that objection concerns the relevance of her employment agreement with mobile.in plaintiff view,defendants improperly relied on the employment agreement in an attempt to establish their affirmative defense that she was a mere licensee rather than a tenant under the lease.
initially,we observe,it does not appear that the trial court considered the employment agreement in reaching its decision.in discussing the evidence,the court explicitly cites only the lease,saying defendants have established through the production of admissible evidence,the lease agreement,that plaintiff was not an express third party beneficiary of the lease agreement between defendants and mobile.nowhere in its order does the court mention or rely on any other evidence besides the lease.thus,it does not appear that the employment agreement was a factor in the trial court determination that plaintiff lacks standing to enforce the lease agreement.
moreover,we find only partial merit in plaintiff objection to the employment agreement as irrelevant.we agree that it has no bearing on her status as a third party beneficiary of the lease.but neither is it entirely irrelevant to the parties dispute,since it explains both the basis on which plaintiff went into possession and her rights and obligations mobile,the promisee under the lease.in that respect,this case is similar to diamond woodworks,argonaut ins.th,d.that case also involved two contracts an agreement between the plaintiff diamond and an employee leasing company bsc,which obligated bsc to maintain workers compensation insurance for the employees it placed at the plaintiff jobsite and an agreement between bsc and the defendant insurance company argonaut for the purchase of the required insurance.id.at,d.as the court observed,the two contracts are interrelated,and argonaut performance can not be analyzed outside the context in which its duty arose,in relation to the contract.ibid.for similar reasons,the employment agreement in this case is relevant to an understanding of the parties relationships,and it may be considered for that purpose.
based on all of the evidence presented below,we proceed to an analysis of whether plaintiff was an intended beneficiary of the lease.
the lease agreements 
as a necessary first step in interpreting the contracting parties intent,we identify the agreement at issue.plaintiff and defendants agree that the contract at issue here is the lease executed by mobile on october,including addenda,and also including the other agreements identified therein as part of the lease the parties also agree that the lease was extended by mobile and defendants,by letter dated december.
we next consider the pertinent language of the contract documents.in the october form lease,in the space for designating residents,the agreement names corporate mobile medical staff.the nearby space for occupants is left blank.defendants promised mobile that they would provide apartment from october,to january.as for the lease extension,the december letter specifically identifies plaintiff as the occupant of apartment.
intent to benefit class 
as the contract language makes clear,the most basic aspect of defendants performance is its obligation to supply mobile with a place for its staff to live.indeed,defendants stated as undisputed facts that they understood that mobile medical intended to use unit to house temporary staff and that mobile medical executed the lease to house its staff.obviously,as an entity,mobile itself could not reside in the apartment.the only way that defendants could perform their lease obligation was by providing the apartment to one or more of mobile employees.harris superior court d.corporation could render professional medical services only through its employees.the benefit of occupancy was a core purpose of the lease it was not incidental.
as a member of mobile staff when the lease was formed,plaintiff arguably was among a class of intended beneficiaries of the lease.diamond woodworks,argonaut ins,supra,th at,d plaintiff was intended beneficiary of insurance contract with employee leasing company zigas superior court d.tenants were third party beneficiaries of landlords contract with the united states department of housing and urban development,which placed limits on rents tenants constitute the class which congress intended to benefit.
nevertheless,it is not clear from the lease or the lease extension that mobile intended its staff to have the benefit of defendants performance without is,for the entire term without regard to any other circumstance,such as continued employment.nor is it clear that defendants understood an intent by mobile that any given occupant would remain during the entire term.to the contrary,defendants property manager testified to her understanding that occupants could change during the lease term.
intent to benefit plaintiff individually 
the october lease does not mention plaintiff explicitly,but the december lease extension letter does identify her by name.this raises an inference that defendants least during the lease extension meant to benefit plaintiff specifically.guntert city of stockton d.though not a party to the lease,corporation was expressly named as occupant marchese standard realty dev.d.where the lease itself contains a provision that the property may be sublet to a named party,that party is the beneficiary of lessor promise to allow it to occupy the property.
in moving for summary judgment,however,defendants presented evidence reflecting their understanding that the occupants of apartment could change during the term of the lease or any extension.defendants fact statement number thus reads defendants understood that the occupants of apartment could change during the lease term.plaintiff disputed that statement,saying this fact is not contained in the deposition testimony cited.that testimony refers to deponent s understanding of whether mobile had a right to terminate occupancy,not whether occupants could change during the lease term.with this extrinsic evidence of defendants understanding in conflict,plaintiff status under the lease should not be adjudicated as a matter of law.neverkovec fredericks,supra,th at,d.
because resort to the contract language alone does not resolve the question of plaintiff status,we look to the circumstances surrounding the formation and performance of the lease.
other circumstances 
circumstances at contract formation 
as explained above,evidence of the circumstances surrounding formation of the contract is both relevant and admissible.garcia truck ins.exchange,supra,cal d,accord,souza westlands water,supra,th at,d see also,neverkovec fredericks,supra,th at,fn,d.
here,the relevant circumstances surrounding formation of the lease included the letter of responsibility,which was signed by mobile representative on the same day as the lease.in it,plaintiff is identified by name as the occupant of the unit in the subject line.the letter states the above named employee will reside at the apartment,move in date.the letter assumes responsibility for specified items,including that all lease terms and property regulations are followed by our employee occupying the unit.the letter closes by confirming that mobile assumption of responsibility will remain in effect for the duration of occupancy by our employee.the letter of responsibility thus raises an inference that plaintiff was an intended beneficiary of the lease.
the relevant circumstances surrounding formation of the lease also included execution of the employment agreement.diamond woodworks,argonaut ins,supra,th at,d.according to defendants undisputed fact statement number in their moving papers below under the housing agreement,which was part of the employment agreement,mobile agreed to provide plaintiff with furnished housing and utilities during her temporary work assignment.
furthermore,as appears from a comparison of the employment agreement and the lease,the time period covered by plaintiff work assignment corresponded exactly with the lease term,given the contractual allowances for and.the same is true of the lease extension the extended lease term likewise corresponded with plaintiff work assignment dates.and in the lease extension,plaintiff was specifically named as the occupant.those facts tend to show mobile intent to benefit plaintiff by providing housing for her,procured via this lease.
on the other hand,as plaintiff acknowledges,the housing agreement required her to pay for housing if she failed to work all the hours required by the employment contract or if she voluntarily left an assignment.the housing agreement also required her to vacate the housing within hours of the termination date of her assignment.additionally,the housing agreement states that mobile shall have the right to initiate eviction proceedings against plaintiff in the event of her breach.these provisions suggest that the benefit to plaintiff was not unrestricted,but rather was conditioned on her performance of her employment agreement with mobile.
subsequent events 
some of the contracting parties actions following execution of the original lease likewise suggest that plaintiff was the intended beneficiary of the lease.for one thing,she was allowed to move into the apartment.
but the import of other subsequent events is in conflict.for example,it is undisputed that plaintiff was required to provide defendants with certain information when she moved in.but the nature and purpose of that information was contested.according to defendants fact statement number the employee occupants only provided moving defendants with identification and emergency contact information.in supporting evidence explaining the purpose of that information,defendants property manager testified that it was required so that defendants would know if she a criminal or who to contact if there was an emergency.plaintiff disputed defendants fact statement,saying instead that she was required to fill out an application and a inspection form for defendant.in reply,defendants also point out that plaintiff was required to complete a on behalf of mobile medical pursuant to her agreement.
on the disputed question of whether mobile bore full responsibility for the apartment,plaintiff responded to defendants fact statement number by saying that she was provided with a resident handbook spelling out rules to be followed by tenants at the property.but as defendants pointed out in their reply,plaintiff agreement required her to follow all rules at the complex.clearly she would need to be informed of what these rules were.
these later actions are relevant to the contracting parties understanding of whether plaintiff was the specific person who would be residing in the apartment and who therefore would be benefited by the lease.and while they do not support determination of plaintiff status as a third party beneficiary as a matter of law,they do demonstrate the existence of a material fact dispute on this key point.
conclusion 
this record discloses the existence of a triable issue of fact on the question of whether plaintiff was an intended third party beneficiary of the lease between defendants and mobile.if plaintiff can prove that status at trial,she will enjoy certain substantive legal rights.
with that understanding in mind,we now consider whether defendants established their right to summary judgment on the substantive claims asserted in plaintiff complaint.we start by analyzing plaintiff contract claims.
iii.contract claims 
in her complaint,plaintiff asserted three causes of action sounding in contract breach of contract sixth cause of action breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing fourth cause of action and breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment third cause of action.as we now explain,none of these contract claims should have been summarily adjudicated.
breach of contract 
elements of the cause of action 
a cause of action for breach of contract requires pleading of a contract,plaintiff performance or excuse for failure to perform,defendant breach and damage to plaintiff resulting therefrom.mckell washington,th,d.
plaintiff right to sue 
assuming that plaintiff was a third party beneficiary of the lease,she would have the right to sue for its breach.that right continues so long as the lease has not been formally rescinded.prouty,supra,th at,d principal mutual,supra,th at,d.
here,according to the undisputed evidence,the lease was never rescinded.that being so,the relations of the parties are the same as though the promise had been made directly to the third party.prouty,supra,th at,d.plaintiff thus was entitled to sue for breach of the lease,on proving that she was a third party beneficiary.
nature of the claims as contractual 
plaintiff right of action derives from the contractual aspects of the lease.
a lease is both a contract and a conveyance under such an agreement there are rights and obligations based upon the relationship of landlord and tenant as well as upon the contractual promises.beckett city of paris dry goods cal d.this dual character serves to create two distinct sets of rights and obligations one comprising those growing out of the relation of landlord and tenant,and said to be based on the privity of estate,and the other comprising those growing out of the express stipulations of the lease,and so said to be based on privity of contract.horton converse cal d,see also,ellingson walsh,barneson cal d.because of the dual aspects of the relationship,rights,obligations and remedies turn on both real property and contract law.many times,the two bodies of law produce conflicting results.friedman,et,cal.practice guide the rutter group.
because plaintiff claims depend on her asserted status as a contract beneficiary,it is the lease contractual features that concern us here.conversely,at least at this point in our analysis,the rights and obligations based upon the relationship of landlord and tenant are not called into play.beckett city of paris dry goods,supra,cal d at.in other words,plaintiff claimed status as an intended beneficiary of the and of not necessarily create any privity of estate between her and defendants rather,it creates privity of contract,entitling plaintiff to sue upon the contractual promises.ibid.
facts supporting plaintiff claim for breach of contract 
as alleged in the complaint,on february,defendants entered the subject premises with no notice and for the purpose of terminating plaintiff occupancy rights,and removed furniture and changed the locks to the subject premises.at that time,the lease was still in force,having been extended through may.
concerning the furniture removal,it is undisputed that mobile informed defendants employee that it had plans to remove the furniture from plaintiff apartment.by facsimile transmission,mobile sent a letter purporting to authorize defendant to release keys to the furniture company.according to deposition testimony by defendants manager,that gave them permission to enter,to allow the furniture company keys to remove their belongings.nevertheless,defendants asserted,they had no involvement with the removal of the furniture.they did not unlock or open the apartment door for the movers and were not present when the movers were there.even so,defendants apparently acquiesced in mobile plan to allow the furniture movers access by agreeing to release keys to the furniture company.
as for the lock change,the undisputed facts demonstrate that mobile medical instructed defendants to change the lock on unit.to carry out that instruction,defendants manager created a work order for maintenance staff to change the locks to plaintiff apartment.defendants informed plaintiff that the locks would be changed.and defendants maintenance worker in fact changed the lock on plaintiff apartment.defendants understood that the reason for the requested lock change was because mobile medical wanted plaintiff out of the premises.
based on these facts,a jury could find that defendants displaced plaintiff from occupancy of the apartment while the lease was still in force,conduct that could constitute an actionable breach of the lease.richardson pridmore d,the wilful eviction of a tenant is a breach of contract.defendants thus are not entitled to summary adjudication on this cause of action.
nor can defendants actions be justified as a matter of law,by framing them as mere compliance with directives from mobile,their tenant.brown derby hollywood hatton cal d,consent of the landowner to the encroachment can not prevent the tenant from asserting his rights,for a landowner can not interfere with his tenant possession or enjoyment by allowing others to enter upon the land.had they not followed the instructions of their tenant,defendants assert,they would have been exposed to a possible action for breach of contract by mobile medical.that assertion finds no support,either in the lease terms or in the law,and it does not support the grant of summary adjudication here.
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
legal principles 
the prerequisite for any action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is the existence of a contractual relationship between the parties,since the covenant is an implied term in the contract.smith city and county of san francisco d.the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is limited to assuring compliance with the express terms of the contract,and can not be extended to create obligations not contemplated by the contract.pasadena live city of pasadena th,d.
intended contract beneficiaries may possess the rights of parties to the contract.bily arthur young cal th,fn,d,see prouty,supra,th at,d.those rights may include the benefits of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in a proper case.murphy allstate ins.cal d.
application 
here,the complaint alleges that defendants violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when they failed to provide plaintiff with a place of residence and failed to obey the law in dispossessing plaintiff from the subject premises.the underlying facts,described above,could support judgment for plaintiff on this claim,assuming that she can prove her status as a third party beneficiary.this claim thus should not have been summarily adjudicated.
breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment 
legal principles 
in every lease the landlord impliedly covenants that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment and possession of the premises.in california this covenant is partially expressed in civil code section,which guarantees the tenant against rightful assertion of a paramount title.guntert city of stockton,supra,d at.the statute provides an agreement to let upon hire binds the letter to secure to the hirer the quiet possession of the thing hired during the term of the hiring,against all persons lawfully claiming the same.beyond the statutory covenant,the landlord is bound to refrain from action which interrupts the tenant beneficial enjoyment.guntert city of stockton,at.
the covenant protects all hirers of property,as statutorily defined.the relevant provisions are found in the civil code,title,chapters and.chapter deals with the hiring of property in general,et the statutory warranty of quiet possession is contained within this chapter.chapter deals with the hiring of real estate,et generally speaking,that chapter applies broadly to all persons who hire dwelling units located within this state including tenants,lessees,boarders,lodgers,and others,however denominated,subd.a.the only exceptions are for certain transient hotel guests,subd.b.as this broad statutory definition makes clear,the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects not only tenants but all hirers of real property.
determining whether there has been a breach of the covenant of quiet possession generally depends upon the facts in a proper case.stockton dry goods girsh cal d,see also,andrews mobile aire estates th,d.
breach can take many forms,including actual or constructive eviction.see,lafrance kashishian cal,covenant breached where plaintiff was evicted from the leased premises by one who had established paramount title to the property guntert city of stockton,supra,d at,arbitrary and unreasonable notice of termination violated the lessor implied obligation to abstain from interference with the tenant use and enjoyment of the premises goldman house d,under the covenant of quiet enjoyment,attempt to evict by the use of wrongful and malicious means with knowledge of probable injury is actionable see id.at,defendants wilfully and maliciously shut off the electric current and the tenant fell down the darkened stairway and sustained injuries.pursuant to another provision of title,chapter,the hirer or tenant need not even be actually or constructively evicted in order to obtain relief,subd.a.
application 
applying the facts in the evidentiary record to the statutory definition,plaintiff argues that she was a hirer of the apartment,see ellingson walsh,barneson,supra,cal d at.defendants implicitly dispute this characterization,asserting that plaintiff was staying in the apartment without paying rent,and without providing employment services for which she initially received the permission to stay at the unit rented by mobile medical.as plaintiff points out,however,she received the apartment as part of her compensation.that fact was known to defendants.see,tappe lieberman,d supp,residents received housing in lieu of wages.at the very least,there is a disputed factual issue on the question.eichhorn de la cantera d,jury decided that mortgage and utility payments were rental and hence that the eichhorns were tenants,not licensees.
as for the breach,the complaint alleges that defendants seriously impaired the plaintiff quiet use and enjoyment by engaging in the acts described above,thereby breaching the covenant.
the facts in this record,described above,could support judgment for plaintiff on this claim.summary adjudication for defendants thus was improper on this cause of action.
iv.tort claims 
in addition to her contract claims,plaintiff asserted seven tort causes of action wrongful eviction fifth cause of action trespass seventh cause of action negligent and intentional invasion of privacy eighth and ninth causes of action negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress first and second causes of action and negligence cause of action.
based on its determination that plaintiff was not a third party beneficiary of the lease,and thus not defendants tenant,the trial court summarily adjudicated plaintiff tort claims,citing the lack of any legal duty towards plaintiff on defendants part.
as explained above,however,the trial court erred in reaching that conclusion it remains a disputed material fact whether plaintiff was an intended beneficiary of the lease contract.defendants thus have not demonstrated the absence of a legal duty toward her.garcia borelli d.intended beneficiaries of will could recover on a tort liability for breach of duty owed directly to them.
nor have defendants otherwise established their entitlement to summary adjudication of any of plaintiff tort claims.in part,our analysis on this point is grounded in longstanding principles of real property law.applying those principles,the evidence supports the conclusion that plaintiff was in peaceful possession of the premises,being an occupant of the premises as defined in and protected by the relevant statutes at the very least,triable issues exist on that question.if plaintiff was in peaceful possession,defendants had a legal duty not to interfere with her peaceful possession through the use of impermissible.this record presents evidence from which the trier of fact could find that defendants breached that duty to plaintiff and that she was harmed thereby.
we explain these conclusions below.in doing so,we address each of plaintiff tort claims separately,starting with her wrongful eviction cause of action.as to each,we first describe and then apply the applicable legal principles.
wrongful eviction 
the law provides both statutory and tort remedies for wrongful eviction.though plaintiff sued in tort,an understanding of the statutory remedies will prove helpful in analyzing plaintiff tort claim.
statutory remedies 
statutory remedies are available for forcible entry and detainer,including those committed by a landlord.code civ.as discussed below,those remedies are not limited to tenants alone.
the forcible entry statute protects a party in possession.code civ.the party in possession refers to any person who hires real property.cal.practice guide,supra,see.with exceptions for transient hotel guests,that includes all persons who hire dwelling units located within this state including tenants,lessees,boarders,lodgers,and others,however denominated,subd.a.at trial,the plaintiff is required to show only that he was peaceably in the actual possession at the time of the forcible entry.code civ.
the forcible detainer statute protects the occupant of real property,meaning one in the peaceable and undisturbed possession of such lands.code civ,moldovan fischer d.
for occupants in peaceful possession of real property,these statutes offer protection from,without regard to the parties legal claims to title or possession.the statutes reflect a policy,with deep roots in english law,barring the use of forceful to enforce a right to possession of real property and requiring instead the use of judicial process to gain possession.glass najafi th,d.
as the california supreme has said both before and after the enactment of the present forcible entry and detainer statutes this court held that ownership or right of possession to the property was not a defense to an action for forcible entry.jordan talbot cal d,fn.omitted.witkin explains a tenant holding over without permission is technically a trespasser.but by statute the owner must use the unlawful detainer procedure,and,if the owner ousts the tenant forcibly,the tenant may regain possession by an action for forcible entry.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.landlords thus may enforce their rights only by judicial process,not by.jordan talbot,at.regardless of who has the right to possession,orderly procedure and preservation of the peace require that the actual possession shall not be disturbed except by legal process.id.at,see also,daluiso boone cal d,these statutes are intended to discourage in the settlement of disputes over possession of land and to encourage resort to the courts in all such matters.
conduct such as that alleged here could support recovery under the forcible entry statute.as the california supreme court said in jordan section,subdivision,prohibits an entry by means of breaking open doors or windows.defendant violated this section when he unlocked plaintiff apartment without her consent and entered with the storage company employees to remove her furniture,even though there was no physical damage to the premises or actual violence.jordan talbot,supra,cal d at.the court went on to say even if we were to interpret the first subdivision of section as being inapplicable unless a door or window was physically damaged or threats of violence actually occurred,the evidence in the instant case would nevertheless support a finding of forcible entry as defined by subdivision of section.under that subdivision a forcible entry is completed if,after a peaceable entry,the occupant is excluded from possession by force or threats of violence.id.at.in jordan,defendant agent shouted at plaintiff to get out.ibid.but the court also observed the removal of plaintiff furniture without her consent rendered the apartment unsuitable for residence and forced her to seek shelter elsewhere.ibid.
other cases demonstrate that same a lock change can support a statutory claim for forcible entry.see,lamey masciotra d.karp margolis d.forcible entry is not confined to cases where a fight takes place,or physical force or restraint is used,or there are threats of physical harm.karp margolis,at,lamey masciotra,at.there is a statutory violation if entry was made by breaking locks,without any other show of force,threat or intimidation.karp margolis,at.the same is true where a locksmith is employed to peaceably change the lock.lamey masciotra,at.no flat breach of the peace is necessary citation,the statute being enacted to obviate such incidents of self help as occurred here.karp margolis,at.
tort remedies 
the statutory remedies are not exclusive.quite apart from the statutes,a person in peaceable possession of real property may recover,in an action sounding in tort,damages for injuries to his person and goods caused by the forcible entry of one who is,or claims to be,the lawful owner or possessor daluiso boone,supra,cal d at,see cal.practice guide,supra,describing this claim as an action for wrongful eviction.as with statutory claims,the forcibly entering defendant title or right of possession is no defense to such action.daluiso boone,at.the recovery includes all consequential damages occasioned by the wrongful eviction personal injury,including infliction of emotional distress,and property damage and upon a proper showing of malice,punitive damages.cal.practice guide,at to.
application 
the evidence presented here could support plaintiff tort claim for wrongful eviction,as to both required prongs plaintiff possession and defendants forcible entry.
plaintiff possession 
the first requirement for tort recovery is a showing that the plaintiff was in peaceable possession of the premises.daluiso boone,supra,cal d at.defendants argue that plaintiff can not claim to have been in peaceable possession,based on two theories she was a mere licensee and by holding over after employment termination,she was a trespasser.
defendants first assert that plaintiff was a mere licensee of her employer,with no right to possession of the premises.a license is a personal,revocable and generally nonassignable privilege conferred either orally or in writing to do a particular act or acts upon the land of another.it is a nonpossessory right to use the property as specified between the parties.cal.practice guide,supra,see,qualls lake berryessa enterprises,th,d right to maintain a recreation home on lands held by concessionaire of governmental entity was a license,not a tenancy von goerlitz turner d,right to operate a mine was a license,not a tenancy beckett city of paris dry goods,supra,cal d at,contract to operate the shoe department of a store created a tenancy,not a mere license.unlike a tenancy,a license does not convey a possessory interest in land.cal.practice guide.whether a contract confers a mere license or instead creates a tenancy is a question of law.
one key characteristic that distinguishes a tenancy from a mere license is the right to exclusive possession as against the whole world,including the landowner.san jose parking,superior court th,d von goerlitz turner,supra,d at.here,plaintiff made the factual assertion that the lease agreement did not place any restrictions upon plaintiff occupancy at the subject property.defendants responded that the proffered fact was irrelevant,but they did not dispute it.in any event,there is no evidence in the record indicating that any person besides plaintiff had the right to occupy the apartment during the lease term.to the contrary,the housing agreement provides for plaintiff to be housed individually in the apartment.thus,so far as this record suggests,plaintiff enjoyed exclusive possession of the premises during the term of the lease.san jose parking,superior court,at,d no exclusive possession where the contracting party was required to provide reasonable access for pedestrian customers of the adjacent property owners.
another fundamental attribute of a lease that distinguishes it from a license is payment for the use of the premises in the form of the legal equivalent of rent.san jose parking,superior court,supra,th at,d.in this case,there is evidence that plaintiff was housed at the apartment as part of her compensation.tappe lieberman,supra,d supp.at eichhorn de la cantera,supra,d at.that is sufficient to raise a triable issue on the question of payment of rent or its legal equivalent.
these facts undermine defendants argument that plaintiff was a mere licensee with no right to possession as a matter of law.
as a second ground for their assertion that plaintiff can not have been in peaceable possession,defendants cite her knowing decision to continue residing in the apartment despite termination of her employment.defendants rely on chan antepenko,d supp.that case states discharged employees are not tenants.their presence on the premises is not a possession or an occupancy,for these are retained by the owner they are like guests or lodgers who,when their rights to remain has ceased,may be removed without notice.id.at.the chan case further states that a licensee holding over after expiration of his license is a trespasser id.at.
defendants reliance on chan is misplaced,for two reasons.first,chan is factually distinguishable.that case did not involve landlord.chan antepenko,supra,d supp.at.using available judicial remedies,the plaintiffs there commenced an unlawful detainer action against defendant seeking to recover possession of the apartment that he had occupied first as their assistant manager and later as their manager.id.at.furthermore,in chan,the defendant had acknowledged that he was not a tenant but rather a licensee.id.at.that is not our case.second,to the extent that chan suggests that any discharged employee may be regard to the circumstances surrounding his occupancy and by means of the landlord reject that suggestion as contrary to the law of this state.
longstanding authority undercuts defendants argument on this point.as has been said,where a party possession arose by virtue of employment that was later terminated,and where the party never himself abandoned or surrendered the possession of the premises so acquired,he could not be guilty of forcible entry merely for the reason that the employer had declared his contract at an end and therefore his right to the actual possession of the property forfeited.san francisco.soc.leonard.
the terminated employee refusal to vacate thus does not constitute proof that he was not in actual possession,peaceably obtained san francisco.soc.leonard,supra.at.
defendants forcible entry 
indeed,to the contrary,if,under such circumstances,the employer had forcibly driven the terminated employee from the premises and thus taken possession thereof,it would itself have been guilty of forcible entry,although it might transpire that,as a matter of legal right,it was entitled to the possession.this proposition necessarily follows from the very theory upon which or the purpose for which the forcible entry and forcible and unlawful detainer statute is enacted,to secure a judicial adjustment of differences of that character and thus prevent the parties themselves from redressing or attempting to redress their own wrongs which is likely to lead to serious wrongs against the public or society.san francisco.soc.leonard,supra.at,accord,eichhorn de la cantera,supra,d at.
by dispossessing plaintiff without resort to judicial process,defendants exposed themselves to potential tort liability for wrongful eviction.daluiso boone,supra,cal d at.by changing the locks,defendants exposed themselves to potential tort liability for forcible entry.jordan talbot,supra,cal d at,lamey masciotra,supra,d at.karp margolis,supra,d at.
for all the foregoing reasons,it was improper to summarily adjudicate this claim.
the essence of the cause of action for trespass is an unauthorized entry onto the land of another.such invasions are characterized as intentional torts,regardless of the actor motivation.civic western zila industries,d.
protection of the plaintiff possessory right 
the cause of action for trespass affords protection for a possessory,not necessarily an ownership interest.allen mcmillion d.for that reason,the plaintiff need not have legal rights in the land.id.at.even one in peaceable though wrongful possession of real property may sue in tort for forcible interference with that possession even in the absence of injury to his person or goods ibid.furthermore,the fact that a defendant may have title or the right to possession of the land is no defense.id.at.
the conduct alleged in this case could support recovery under a trespass theory,as the factually similar civic case makes clear.in civic,defendant zila on several theories,including trespass.civic western zila industries,supra,d at.zila alleged that agents of civic had wrongfully taken possession of zila premises in inglewood by ejecting zila employees from those premises and changing the locks on the doors,fn.omitted.regardless of the actual circumstances of this event,no one denies that zila officers and employees were prevented from remaining on zila premises,and that the officers were prevented from access to their personal records.this precludes the granting of a summary judgment on these causes of action.id.at.
consent as a defense 
nor have defendants demonstrated their entitlement to summary judgment based on consent.to be sure,consent obviates the tort where there is a consensual entry,there is no tort,because lack of consent is an element of the wrong.civic western zila industries,supra,d at.see witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.in this case,however,the factual issue of whether plaintiff consented to the entry is disputed.and as explained above,mobile consent is irrelevant.brown derby hollywood hatton,supra,cal d at,consent of the landowner to the encroachment can not prevent the tenant from asserting his rights.thus,the defense of consent was not established here as a matter of law.
invasion of privacy 
plaintiff alleges both intentional and negligent invasion of privacy.california law makes no distinction between the two,however.the motives of a person charged with invading the right are not material with respect to the determination whether there is a right of action,and malice is not an essential element of a violation of the right.fairfield american photocopy.d.we thus discuss these two causes of action together.
legal principles 
while invasion of privacy takes several forms,the tort of intrusion into private places,conversations or matter is perhaps the one that best captures the common understanding of an invasion of privacy.it encompasses physical intrusion into the home,hospital room or other place the privacy of which is legally recognized shulman group w productions,cal th,d.it is in the intrusion cases that invasion of privacy is most clearly seen as an affront to individual dignity.id.at,d.
the cause of action for intrusion has two elements intrusion into a private place,conversation or matter,in a manner highly offensive to a reasonable person.shulman group w productions,supra,cal th at,d.to prove actionable intrusion,the plaintiff must show the defendant penetrated some zone of physical or sensory privacy surrounding the plaintiff.the tort is proven only if the plaintiff had an objectively reasonable expectation of seclusion or solitude in the place or zone.id.at,d.
application 
addressing the first element of the cause of action,defendants assert that plaintiff had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment,since she consented to the entry and since her boxes were already packed and she was ready to move out.according to defendants,at the time the lock was changed,the apartment was no longer a private place or a home and entry by anyone would not have been an invasion of privacy.
we can not agree with defendants that this point has been established as a matter of law.as explained above,assuming that plaintiff establishes herself as a hirer of the property,she would have the right to peaceful possession of the apartment.under that scenario,the apartment was still plaintiff home at the time that the locks were changed,with the concomitant right to privacy there.shulman group w productions,supra,cal th at,d,accident victims had no right of ownership or possession of the property where the rescue took place,nor any actual control of the premises.
as for the second element,a jury could find defendants conduct here highly offensive to a reasonable person.shulman group w productions,supra,cal th at,d.the record thus fails to support summary adjudication for defendants as to plaintiff tort claim for invasion of privacy.
infliction of emotional distress 
plaintiff complaint asserts claims for both negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress the first and second causes of action.negligent infliction of emotional distress does not exist as an independent tort.potter firestone tire rubber cal th,d.the tort is simply negligence.ibid.we therefore confine our discussion at this juncture to plaintiff intentional tort claim.
legal principles 
the elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant extreme or severe emotional distress to the plaintiff and actual and proximate causation between the two.potter firestone tire rubber,supra,cal th at,d.to be outrageous,the defendant conduct must be either intentional or reckless,and it must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of decency in a civilized community.potter firestone tire rubber,supra,cal th at,d.furthermore,that conduct must be specifically directed at the plaintiff.id.at,d.malicious or evil purpose is not essential to liability,however.superior court th,d.in the usual case,outrageousness is a question of fact.angie superior court th,d trerice blue cross of california d.
application 
according to defendants,the first element of the claim can be resolved as a matter of law in this case,since there is simply no evidence of outrageous conduct here.in defendants view,their conduct can not be considered outrageous,as it amounted to nothing more than changing the lock of an apartment at the request of their tenant,mobile medical,after plaintiff employment assignment was terminated.
we reject defendants contention that they have established lack of outrageousness as a matter of law.
first,as a general principle,changing the locks on someone dwelling without consent to force that person to leave is prohibited by statute.see,subd.b forbidding landlords from changing locks to terminate occupancy.though defendants agents were polite and sympathetic towards plaintiff,they nevertheless caused her to leave her home without benefit of judicial process.as stated in richardson pridmore while in the present case no threats or abusive language were employed,and no violence existed,that is not essential to the cause of action.an eviction may,nevertheless,be unlawful even though not accompanied with threats,violence or abusive language.here the eviction was deliberate and intentional.the conduct of defendants was outrageous.they must be held responsible for the damages caused by their deliberate and intentional acts.richardson pridmore,supra,d at.
furthermore,as defendants property manager testified,she was concerned about the legality of changing the locks at mobile request.she had been trained that changing locks with the intent to terminate a resident right to occupy their home is illegal but she did think she was doing that here.the fact that the manager proceeded despite those concerns bears on the disputed question of outrageousness.in short,the evidence does not as a matter of law dispel a reasonable inference of actionable intent.superior court,supra,th at,d.
additionally,the record demonstrates that plaintiff was particularly vulnerable at the time of defendants unlawful entry.she returned home after reconstructive surgery,with her arm in a cast.the very next day,plaintiff received notification that mobile wanted her out of the premises.the day after that,she was gone from the apartment.plaintiff told defendants employees that she was seriously injured and under doctors orders to use her arm as little as possible.she informed them that she had been terminated from her employment and had no other place to reside.and defendants property manager acknowledged that she was concerned for plaintiff welfare when asked to change the locks.this evidence of vulnerability is relevant in considering whether defendants acted outrageously.symonds mercury savings loan d.debt collectors actions may rise to the level of outrageous conduct where the creditor knows the debtor is susceptible to emotional distress because of her physical or mental condition.
for all these reasons,defendants have not established lack of outrageousness as a matter of law.plaintiff cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress should not have been summarily adjudicated.
negligence 
legal principles 
actionable negligence is traditionally regarded as involving the following a legal duty to use due care a breach of that duty and the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.witkin,summary of cal.law torts.
the first element,duty,may be imposed by law,be assumed by the defendant,or exist by virtue of a special relationship.potter firestone tire rubber,supra,cal th at,d.the existence of a legal duty is a question of law to be resolved by the court.bily arthur young,supra,cal th at,d,accord,artiglio corning cal th,d.in the usual negligence case,the other two elements present questions of fact for the jury.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.
application 
defendants make a argument in support of summary adjudication of plaintiff negligence claim,asserting a their lack of duty and b the absence of evidence that their conduct was a substantial factor in causing any harm to plaintiff.neither persuades us that defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this claim.
defendants first argue that they owed plaintiff no legal duty,because she was not their tenant.that argument misses the point.as discussed above,the law imposes a duty on landlords not to disturb an occupant possession except by legal process.code civ,jordan talbot,supra,cal d at.plaintiff has proffered evidence that she was an occupant of the property as statutorily defined.proof of that status gives rise to a legal duty on defendants part,imposed by law.potter firestone tire rubber,supra,cal th at,d,defendant was subject to a duty imposed on it by law and regulation.
nor can defendants avoid tort liability as a matter of law on the ground that they merely complied with instructions from mobile.barkett brucato d,rejecting the landlord claim that she could not be held liable at all on the second cause of action for negligence because the only negligence shown was that of the contractors.as they did in defense of plaintiff contract claims,defendants assert that refusal to follow mobile medical instruction regarding changing the lock would arguably have breached their duty to mobile medical with respect to its right to quiet use and enjoyment of the premises.that assertion reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of plaintiff rights as an asserted hirer of the dwelling unit,which include the quiet possession of the thing hired during the term of the hiring,against all persons lawfully claiming the same,italics added.it also reflects disregard for the law strong policy against in resolving disputed claims to possession of real property.
in short,defendants have not established the absence of duty as a matter of law.
alternatively,defendants assert,any breach of duty on their part was not a substantial factor in causing harm to plaintiff since she had already substantially moved out and relinquished her occupancy by that time.
however,as plaintiff correctly observes,relinquishment is ordinarily a question of fact.while abandonment is a matter of intent which may be proved by the acts and conduct of the party who is alleged to have abandoned the property in controversy,a finding of abandonment must be based upon evidence from which an inference of abandonment can reasonably be drawn.pickens johnson d,see also,kassan stout cal d,abandonment is a question of fact for the trial court martin cassidy d,there was substantial evidence to support the court finding of abandonment.
in this case,according to the undisputed facts,plaintiff communicated to defendants agents a strong desire not to leave the premises.on the day of the she was visibly upset and distraught.plaintiff declared i was provided no choice with regard to the removal of my furniture and the changing of my locks.she further declared i had no way to prevent defendants from committing these acts.these facts support an inference that plaintiff had not voluntarily relinquished her occupancy.this record also supports the further inference that plaintiff would not have been in the process of moving out at all,if not for defendants stated intent to change the lock on her apartment.
for all these reasons,summary adjudication of plaintiff negligence claim is improper.
statutory claims 
beyond her contract and tort claims,plaintiff complaint asserts two statutory causes of action illegal entry in violation of civil code section cause of action and in violation of civil code section cause of action.
as with plaintiff other claims,the trial court summarily adjudicated her statutory causes of action based on its determination that plaintiff was not defendants tenant.
as explained above,however,a person in peaceful possession of a residential dwelling need not be a tenant to be protected under the relevant statutes.moreover,defendants have not otherwise established their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on either of plaintiff statutory claims.we briefly address those points now.
civil code,section 
civil code,section,limits a landlord right to enter an occupied residential dwelling.civil penalties may be imposed for a significant and intentional violation of section,if done for the purpose of influencing a tenant to vacate a dwelling,subd.a,subd.b penalties.
application to plaintiff 
section is part of title,chapter,of the civil code,et as explained above,that chapter governs those who hire residential real property,which generally includes all persons who hire dwelling units located within this state including tenants,lessees,boarders,lodgers,and others,however denominated,subd.a see,subd.b exceptions for transient hotel guests see generally cal.practice guide,supra,to,pp.to.the statute defines dwelling unit as a structure or the part of a structure that is used as a home,residence,or sleeping place by one person who maintains a household or by two or more persons who maintain a common household,subd.c.
applying these statutory definitions to the evidentiary record,plaintiff has raised a triable issue that civil code section applies to her,since she arguably hired and indisputably occupied the dwelling unit at issue here.we therefore reject defendants assertion that,as a matter of law,plaintiff does not qualify as a tenant and can not rely on this code section.
facts precluding defense summary judgment 
civil code section forbids the landlord from entering a dwelling,except in specified circumstances.those circumstances include cases where the tenant has abandoned or surrendered the premises,subd.a.in such cases,the landlord may enter without giving notice,subd.e.notice is also unnecessary when the tenant is present and consents to the entry at the time of entry,subd.e.
it is undisputed that defendants entered plaintiff dwelling unit and changed the locks.whether plaintiff consented to the entry and whether she voluntarily relinquished her occupancy of the premises are disputed questions of fact.
defendants nevertheless argue that they were not in violation of this statute,because they were acting on instructions from mobile,their tenant.
we disagree,for at least two reasons.
for one thing,as discussed above,the record could support a determination that defendants actions constitute improper.regardless of who has the right to possession,orderly procedure and preservation of the peace require that the actual possession shall not be disturbed except by legal process.jordan talbot,supra,cal d at.resort to legal process is required,even where the occupant is technically a trespasser.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.even with the right to possession,an employer is guilty of forcible entry by using to oust a terminated employee who is holding over.san francisco.soc.leonard,supra.at.for that reason,we can not agree that mobile directives justify defendants actions.
moreover,it is plain that the statute is intended to protect people such as plaintiff,who are actually living in the dwelling.tappe lieberman,supra,d supp.at ordinance was designed to protect the real tenants,those who actually reside in the rooms and pay their rent in the form of in lieu wages.defendants thus have not shown as a matter of law that mobile directives overcome plaintiff statutory rights to reside in the dwelling free of unlawful entry.
civil code,section 
civil code section protects those occupying residential premises from specified actions by the landlord,including changing the locks,which are done with the intent to oust the resident.the parties disagree about whether plaintiff falls within the statute protections.
application to plaintiff 
an analysis of the statutory language reveals that civil code,section,applies to plaintiff occupancy.
first,and most importantly,plaintiff falls within the statute broad reach.painting with a broad brush,the statute forbids landlords use of to terminate the occupancy under any lease or other tenancy or estate at will,however created,of property used by a tenant as his or her residence by means of changing the locks,removing outside doors or windows,or removing the resident personal property,subd.b,italics added.plaintiff is a named occupant under the extension of the lease at issue here.and as our high court has explained in connection with subdivision c of the statute,the word tenant as used in the penalty formula of section refers to all the occupants of a rental unit.kinney vaccari cal d.
additionally,plaintiff situation does not fall within the statute explicit exception for occupancies defined by subdivision b of section,subd.b.as explained above,the excepted occupancies are for transient hotel guests,subd.b.but plaintiff is not such a person rather,she is in the statutory category that includes tenants,lessees,boarders,lodgers,and others,however denominated,subd.a.
facts precluding defense summary judgment 
defendants do not repeat their arguments that their conduct was justified.those arguments would be unpersuasive in any event for the reasons discussed above.first,there is evidence in this record that defendants engaged in.the manifest purpose of section is to discourage landlords from using.otanez blue skies mobile home park th,d.second,the statute is apparently designed to protect people actually residing in the dwelling place.tappe lieberman,supra,d supp.at ordinance protecting such people.
under the circumstances present here,defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiff statutory claims.
vi.punitive damage claims 
plaintiff asserted entitlement to punitive damages in connection with her claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing intentional infliction of emotional distress wrongful eviction trespass invasion of privacy and violation of civil code section.punitive damages are authorized by civil code section 
defendants sought summary adjudication of plaintiff punitive damage claims.code civ,subd.f myers trendwest resorts,th,d.defendants argued there was no basis for punitive damages since plaintiff could not maintain an action against any of the moving defendants on those causes of action,and there was no evidence of any conduct by defendants amounting to oppression,fraud,or malice as required by the governing statute.they renew those arguments here.
