plaintiffs brought an unlawful detainer action code civ,et against defendant.plaintiffs alleged defendant was unlawfully in possession of premises after a written sublease had expired.
prior to trial,plaintiffs dismissed the unlawful detainer action without prejudice.defendant moved the court for an award of attorney fees pursuant to a provision in the sublease providing the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorney fees in any action or other proceeding arising out of this sublease 
plaintiff resisted an award of attorney fees,relying on civil code section,which provides as pertinent that i n any action on a contract where an action has been voluntarily dismissed there shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section italics added.
the trial court agreed with plaintiff,concluding plaintiff action sounded more in contract than in tort,so fees were barred by civil code section.
we respectfully disagree with the trial court.plaintiff action for wrongful possession following termination of the lease sounded in tort.civil code section,subdivision b,does not apply.defendant was the prevailing party pursuant to section,subdivision a and was entitled to attorney fees pursuant to the clause in the sublease.we shall therefore reverse the trial court order denying attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
on august,plaintiffs filed an unlawful detainer action against defendant,seeking to evict defendant from commercial premises following expiration of a written sublease which commenced on january.the complaint said,plaintiff demands possession from each defendant because of expiration of a lease.the complaint sought fair rental value of per day and statutory damages under section,subdivision b,on the ground that defendant continued possession was malicious.an attachment to the complaint asserted defendant threatened to wreak financial hardship on plaintiffs after plaintiffs refused to sign a retroactive extension of the sublease and defendant terminated the employment of plaintiff todd drybread as a chiropractor in defendant chiropractic practice.
the complaint also sought attorney fees pursuant to a written agreement.the attorney fees clause in the sublease stated if any action or other proceeding arising out of this sublease is commenced by either party to this sublease concerning the subleased premises,then as between sublessor and sublessee,the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the other party,in addition to any other relief that may be granted,the reasonable attorneys fees,costs,and expenses incurred in the action or other proceeding by the prevailing party.
on august,defendant filed an answer,which also asked for attorney fees.the answer alleged as follows 
the sublease was still in effect because,prior to december,defendant exercised its option under the sublease to extend the original term for another year,which had not yet expired therefore,defendant was not a tenant at will,as alleged by plaintiffs,and the tenancy could not be terminated by a notice to quit.
defendant also alleged plaintiffs waived the notice to quit when they demanded and accepted payment of rent for august.
defendant also alleged defendant is informed and believes that plaintiffs leased the subject premises to provide an office for plaintiff todd drybread to use as an office for his personal chiropractic practice.defendant is informed and believes and thereon alleges that plaintiffs had no prior experience in providing chiropractic services or in running the business of a chiropractic office.defendant is informed and believes that as a result of their inexperience,plaintiffs were failing with respect to their chiropractic office.defendant is informed and believes and thereon alleges that in or about september,plaintiff todd drybread notified defendant that,because of his failing business,he was interested in abandoning his,and wished to find an employed associate position with defendant.thereafter,in or about december,defendant entered into an agreement whereby defendant sublet the premises being leased by plaintiffs from the master landlord.by the terms of a separate and independent agreement,also entered into in or about december,defendant engaged plaintiff todd drybread as an employee in the capacity of a doctor of chiropractic however,plaintiff todd drybread place of work was at an office,or offices,that did not include the premises that are the subject of this unlawful detainer proceeding.on or about june and,disagreements arose between defendant and plaintiff todd drybread.as a result of these disagreements that arose in the relationship between defendant and plaintiff todd drybread,attorneys were engaged on behalf of both defendant and plaintiff todd drybread.on or about june,as a result of the negotiations of their respective legal counsel,in the course of the lawful and peaceful exercise of rights under the law by defendant,it was agreed that plaintiff todd drybread employment with defendant was terminated effective june.defendant is informed and believes and thereon alleges that a mere five calendar days later,on june,plaintiffs prepared the document entitled notice to quit hereafter notice that forms the basis for this unlawful detainer proceeding.the plaintiffs did not state in the notice any ground upon which they,in good faith,were seeking to recover possession of the subject premises.while there had been an unpleasant dissolution of the relationship,that relationship did not have any direct connection to the continuation of the relationship that independently existed between both of the plaintiffs and the defendant.further,defendant is informed and believes and thereon alleges that there had been no occurrence that could have rationally justified the plaintiffs good faith creation and service of the notice.defendant is informed and believes that the only true motive for the service of the notice was the intent by plaintiffs to retaliate against defendant because of the termination of plaintiff todd drybread employment with defendant just days earlier.
on september,a voluntary dismissal of the case without prejudice was entered at plaintiffs request.
on october,defendant filed a motion for attorney fees in the amount of,pursuant to sections and,subdivision a on the ground that defendant was the prevailing party in the unlawful detainer proceeding,as defined pursuant to section,subdivision a fn,ante,and that pursuant to section et,there was a written agreement between the parties for the successful party in any litigation to recover reasonable attorney fees as part of its costs of suit.
defendant president,christ chipain chipain,submitted a declaration attesting that on december,defendant entered the sublease with plaintiffs,becoming subtenant of commercial premises of which plaintiffs were the tenants under a master lease with the master landlord.the master landlord gave consent to the sublease.defendant entered the sublease in order to open a second location to expand operation of its business.defendant took possession on january,and invested resources in developing that location.in response to plaintiffs efforts to dispossess defendant,defendant incurred attorney fees.defendant also submitted declarations from its attorneys setting forth the amount of attorney fees.
plaintiffs opposed the motion for attorney fees.plaintiff todd drybread submitted a declaration attesting the sublease was for one year with an option to renew no later than days before the end of the first year.at the end of november,drybread asked defendant whether it would be exercising the option but received no response.during january,after the sublease expired,drybread continued his employment with defendant,and defendant held over as a subtenant in the office.on june,defendant president,chipain,gave drybread a document entitled,sublease extension.drybread was wary because it was to january,and said the parties agreed to extend the sublease by one year.it did not indicate timely exercise of the option.drybread refused to sign the document because of its false statements.immediately thereafter,chipain and i todd drybread severed my employment.upon disclosing to chipain that i would be leaving his employ,he stated to me that he would sue me for every dime i owned.drybread further attested initially,because of my need to open a location within which to engage in chiropractic,i initiated this proceeding to evict defendant from my offices.however,after initiating this proceeding on august,i found an alternative location for my practice,and asked my attorney to dismiss this action.drybread further attested that he was responsible for defendant accounting and knew defendant lost money almost every month on its business operations in the subleased premises.drybread further expressed his opinion that the amount of attorney fees sought by defendant was unreasonable.
after hearing oral argument,the trial court affirmed its tentative ruling denying attorney fees.the written tentative ruling stated in part defendant argues that a proceeding in unlawful detainer is a special proceeding and is a noncontract cause of action and as such,defendant is not barred from recovering reasonable attorney fees as the result of a plaintiff voluntary pretrial dismissal.as a statutory remedy to regain possession of real property,an unlawful detainer proceeding has characteristics of a contract action,it usually involves a lease,and often seeks its termination and recovery of rent.citations.given the legal issues presented by the parties,the unlawful detainer action in this case sounds more in contract than not.that being the case,civil code section b bars defendant from recovering attorney fees.
defendant appealed to the appellate division of the superior court.after oral argument,the appellate division affirmed the trial court order without explanation.
we granted defendant petition to transfer the case to this court under former rule of the california rules of court see now rule et.
discussion 
standard of review 
the determination of the legal basis for an award of attorney fees is a question of law which we review de novo.citation.honey baked hams,dickens th,d honey baked hams,disapproved on other grounds in santisas goodin cal th,fn,d,santisas.
plaintiffs argue an abuse of discretion standard applies because this type of case calls for the trial court to make a determination of the nature of the lawsuit in order to determine whether it lies in contract or tort.even assuming an abuse of discretion standard,we shall conclude defendant is entitled to attorney fees.
ii.application of civil code section to unlawful detainer 
defendant argues civil code section applies only to contract actions,and the trial court improperly applied that statute to this unlawful detainer action.defendant argues all unlawful detainer actions sound in tort and,even if they do not necessarily sound in tort,this unlawful detainer action sounded in tort.we shall conclude this unlawful detainer action sounded in tort,and the trial court denial of defendant motion for attorney fees was improper.
civil code section states in part 
a in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.
reasonable attorney fees shall be fixed by the court,and shall be an element of the costs of suit.
b the court,upon notice and motion by party,shall determine who is the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section,whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment.except as provided in paragraph,the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.the court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.
where an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case,there shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section.italics added.
the limitation of civil code section,subdivision b precluding attorney fees when a complaint is voluntarily only to contract claims.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.it does not apply to noncontract claims and thus does not preclude attorney fees on noncontract claims where the contractual attorney fees clause is broad enough to encompass noncontract claims.ibid.in santisas,buyers of a residence brought a contract and tort action against the sellers.after the plaintiffs dismissed the complaint with prejudice before trial,the trial court awarded attorney fees to the defendants pursuant to a clause in the purchase agreement that i n the event legal action is instituted by the broker s,or any party to this agreement,or arising out of the execution of this agreement or the sale,or to collect commissions,the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the other party a reasonable attorney fee to be determined by the court in which such action is brought.id.at,d.
santisas,supra,cal th,d,held civil code section barred recovery of attorney fees for the contract claims but not the tort claims.the supreme court said,contractual attorney fees provisions are generally enforceable in voluntary pretrial dismissal cases except as barred by civil code section.id.at,d.under civil code section,the seller defendants are not part ies prevailing on the contract because that section specifies that there is no party prevailing on the contract when,as here,the plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed the action,and therefore defendants may not recover the attorney fees they incurred in the defense of the contract claim.but this conclusion does not affect the seller defendants right to recover as costs the attorney fees they incurred in defense of the tort claims.because civil code section does not apply to those claims citations,it does not bar recovery of attorney fees that were incurred in litigation of those claims and that are otherwise recoverable as a matter of contract law.id.at,d.
in holding that civil code section barred attorney fees for the contract claims,santisas disapproved of this court opinion in honey baked hams,supra,th at page,d,insofar as it said civil code section was restricted to unilateral attorney fees clauses which needed civil code section to make the clauses reciprocal.santisas,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
thus,civil code section does not bar recovery of attorney fees for noncontract claims voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff,as long as the attorney fees clause is broad enough to encompass such noncontract claims.
here,the clause is broad enough.it says if any action or other proceeding arising out of this sublease is commenced by either party to this sublease concerning the subleased premises,then as between sublessor and sublessee,the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the other party,in addition to any other relief that may be granted,the reasonable attorneys fees,costs,and expenses incurred in the action or other proceeding by the prevailing party.this clause is broad enough to encompass noncontract claims such as this unlawful detainer action.see santisas,supra,cal th at,d,clause calling for attorney fees i n the event legal action is instituted by the broker s,or any party to this agreement,or arising out of the execution of this agreement or the sale,or to collect commissions applied to buyer tort claim against seller gonzales personal storage,th,d clause calling for attorney fees in any legal action applied to tort action.
in general,prevailing party includes a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,subd.a see also,subd.a costs include attorney fees authorized by contract.
thus,defendant is entitled to recover attorney fees unless such fees are barred by civil code section.
the question is whether this unlawful detainer action was an action on a contract to which civil code section applies and bars attorney fees or a noncontract claim.
the summary proceedings for unlawful detainer are based on the english statutes that abrogated the common law right of
