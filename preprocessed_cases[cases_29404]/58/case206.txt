anti slapp motion 
the city and the employees responded to the with an motion on november.elena gerli,a deputy city attorney for the city,attested to several pertinent facts.pursuant to city policy and the costa mesa municipal code,the city has never issued business licenses for the operation of medical marijuana dispensaries.when the city complaint was filed on april,the city stopped issuing any new business licenses for the property,if the requested business licenses concerned activities or operations related to the city complaint.this cessation of the issuance of business licenses for the property was pursuant to the litigation concerning the property.pursuant to a temporary restraining order issued on may,the city ceased issuing for the property any building permits or new business licenses relating to medical marijuana or massage establishments as ordered by the tro.there is no city policy regarding not issuing other types of business licenses,nor has the city temporarily suspended or placed a moratorium on issuing other types of business licenses for the property.prior to the april,filing by the city of the underlying lawsuit in this matter,i am personally aware that the city enacted a moratorium on the issuance of new business licenses for new massage establishments within the city.
the five employee signed declarations in support of the motion.all of the employees denied making the statements attributed to them in the.all of the employees denied bearing any malice,hatred,or toward,or having any reason to do so.
four of the employees recall some conversations concerning the property.mel lee,a senior planner with the city,remembered a conversation he had with a tenant or prospective tenant of the property in august.this conversation occurred in the context of processing a city permit for the display of a banner at the property.lee may have conversed with this individual about the issuance of city permits city licenses for the property.

delores cinquegrani visited the offices of the city of costa mesa on april,to inquire about obtaining a business license for operation of a retail store at the property.she spoke with mel lee who informed me that the subject building had recently been raided and that the police had been documenting for over a year the various comings and goings at this property,specifically,the massage parlors.he said that there was a lot of illegal businesses there,but that another story they have massage parlors and marijuana dispensaries and that why the cops raided it.they been investigated.lee suggested cinquegrani look at other buildings for her business.

the statute requires the court to engage in a process.first,the court decides whether the moving party has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the responding party has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.

step one of the anti slapp analysis 
the first step of the analysis requires careful consideration of the statutory language in light of the legal theories of recovery,not a mere cataloging of claims or consideration of general principles of free speech.courts look not to first amendment law but to the statutory definition set forth in section,subdivision e when determining whether an motion may be brought against a cause of action.schaffer,supra,th at,d.
a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,subd.b.as used in the statute,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or on an issue of public interest.id.subd.e,italics added.
in our view,causes of action arise from oral statements made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,subd.e.our analysis can be broken down into three components a was there an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body b were the employees statements made in connection with this issue and c did the causes of action pleaded by aris e from the employees statements ibid.
first,was there an issue under consideration or review by a government body as used in section,subdivision e,a matter is under consideration if it is one kept before the mind,given attentive thought,reflection,meditation.citation.a matter under review is one subject to an inspection,examination.maranatha corrections,llc department of corrections rehabilitation th,d maranatha.the review or consideration process need not consist of official or formal proceedings.ibid.in maranatha,a private firm sued a state executive branch department based on alleged defamatory matter in a publicized letter and subsequent oral comments by an employee explaining the reasons the department was terminating its contract with the firm,the firm misappropriated funds.id.at,d.for purposes of evaluating the first step of the analysis under section,subdivision e,the maranatha court rejected an argument that the department was not entitled to bring an motion because it had not instituted formal or official proceedings pertaining to the misappropriation allegations.maranatha,at,d.
at the time in question in the instant case,both an executive body the city government and a judicial body the trial court were considering and reviewing the issue of whether illegal activity was occurring at the property and what should occur as a consequence.the city,once injunctive relief issued from the court,formulated a policy of refusing to issue certain licenses at the property.both forms of review and consideration of the issue of illegal conduct at the property qualify under section,subdivision e.
the second question is whether the alleged statements of the city employees were made in connection with the issue under review or consideration.in cases in which the only relevant governmental review or consideration of a private issue is a lawsuit,a statement is in connection with litigation under section,subdivision e if it relates to the substantive issues in the litigation and is directed to persons having some interest in the litigation.neville chudacoff th,d.the trial court in this case found that only alleged statements by shank and ashabi,which included the word litigation,satisfied section,subdivision e,because only these statements were shown to be made in connection with this litigation.but the statute asks whether the statements were made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a branch of the government ibid,not whether the statements specifically referenced litigation.see schaffer,supra,th at,d written statements by police officer were made in connection with executive branch investigation rejects claim that police officers merely doing their job are not entitled to slapp protection.
all of the allegedly slanderous communications referenced in the are based on employees in the planning department and code enforcement department communicating with parties interested in obtaining licenses at the property.these parties seeking licenses at the property were allegedly told they could not obtain licenses because of illegal activity at the property.they were also allegedly told other details some clearly inaccurate,such as being convicted of crimes.for purposes of this inquiry,it is irrelevant whether the alleged statements accurately described the litigation and concomitant executive body review of alleged criminal activity at the property.it would unduly conflate the merits of claim with the first step of the inquiry were we to distinguish between alleged statements accurately describing ongoing policy consideration and other less accurate statements.regardless of whether these communications specifically referenced the litigation or accurately described the status of the litigation,each communication is connected to the issue of alleged illegal activities at the property and the executive body policy consequences of this issue for individuals seeking business licenses at the property.see maranatha,supra,th at,d written and oral statements about alleged misconduct by private firm were connected with executive branch consideration and review of an issue.
third and finally,did causes of action arise from the alleged oral statements the arising from statutory requirement means the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.city of cotati cashman cal th,d.in some instances,speech and petitioning activity is peripheral to the actual legal claim in the complaint.see,id.at,d,controversy not a slapp because dispute concerned validity of city ordinance,not protected activity related to the city ordinance wang wal mart real estate business trust th,d overall thrust of complaint took aim at alleged private business misdeeds rather than collateral activity of pursuing government approvals.but that is not the case here.is suing for slander,trade libel,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,all based on the allegation that the five employees made statements about and the property resulting in economic harm to.see people ex rel.lockyer brar th,d archetype slapp actions involve torts of defamation or intentional interference with economic advantage.is suing for relief based on the oral statements,not challenging the underlying acts the refusal of the city and its employees to issue licenses.
in sum,is subject to an motion.we turn to the second step of the analysis to evaluate probability of prevailing on his slander,trade libel,and intentional interference causes of action.
step two of anti slapp analysis probability of prevailing 
a lthough by its terms section,subdivision b calls upon a court to determine whether the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim italics added,past cases interpreting this provision establish that the legislature did not intend that a court,in ruling on a motion to strike under this statute,would weigh conflicting evidence to determine whether it is more probable than not that plaintiff will prevail on the claim,but rather intended to establish a procedure available at an early stage of litigation that poses a potential chilling effect on activities.taus loftus cal th,d.t he court responsibility is to accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff hms capital,lawyers title th,d.t he defendant evidence is considered with a view toward whether it defeats the plaintiff showing as a matter of law,such as by establishing a defense or the absence of a necessary element.contacts,steinberg th,d.
slander is a form of defamation,consisting of a false and unprivileged oral publication.to establish a prima facie case for slander,a plaintiff must demonstrate an oral publication to third persons of specified false matter that has a natural tendency to injure or that causes special damage.mann quality old time service,th,d.trade libel is the publication of matter disparaging the quality of another property,which the publisher should recognize is likely to cause pecuniary loss to the owner.citation.the tort encompasses all false statements concerning the quality of services or product of a business which are intended to cause that business financial harm and in fact do so.citation.to constitute trade libel,a statement must be false.computerxpress,jackson th,d.
interference with prospective economic advantage consists of an economic relationship between the plaintiff and a third party,with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff the defendant knowledge of the relationship an intentional act by the defendant,designed to disrupt the relationship actual disruption of the relationship and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the defendant wrongful act,including an intentional act by the defendant that is designed to disrupt the relationship between the plaintiff and a third party.edwards arthur andersen llp cal th,d.the intentional act at issue must be independently wrongful.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.here,the alleged independently wrongful conduct was the oral publication of false information about and the property.
provided no evidence to support allegations in the that nichols,shank,or bouwens killeen made the statements alleged in the.nor does even argue that the statements admitted to by nichols and bouwens killeen in their declarations were false or otherwise wrongful.in the second step of the analysis,the plaintiff must show there is admissible evidence that,if credited,would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment.mcgarry university of san diego th,d.the plaintiff may not rely solely on its complaint,even if verified instead,its proof must be made upon competent admissible evidence.paiva nichols th,d.thus,does not have a probability of prevailing against nichols,shank,or bouwens killeen and the motion must be granted in its entirety as to these three 
declarations provide support for the conclusion that minoo ashabi and mel lee made the statements alleged in the.ashabi allegedly told a prospective tenant that business licenses were not being issued at the property because of illegal activity occurring at the property lee allegedly told two prospective tenants about illegal activity at the property in the context of those prospective tenants attempting to procure business licenses.lee also indicated the police had raided the property and documented wrongdoing at the massage parlors and marijuana dispensaries at the property.lee allegedly told one of the prospective tenants to look elsewhere for property to lease because the property would be shut down.lee also allegedly told one of the prospective tenants that had been convicted of prostitution and drug dealing,a clearly inaccurate statement.
the question,then,is whether ashabi and lee alleged statements are actionable against the city,ashabi,lee.the tort liability of public entities like the city is statutory in nature.peterson san francisco community college dist.cal d,see,public entities are not liable for injuries e xcept as otherwise provided by statute.under california law,a public entity may be held vicariously liable for the conduct of its employees acting within the scope of their employment,but only to the extent that the employees may be held liable.nadel regents of university of california th,d see,subd.a.the liability of a public entity is subject to any immunity of the public entity provided by statute and is subject to any defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private person,subd.b.
extant case law supports the general proposition that a public entity and its employees may in appropriate circumstances be held liable for slander.see,sanborn chronicle pub.cal d,affirming jury verdict against public entity and its clerk for defamation arising out of clerk comment to newspaper that plaintiff procured money from clerk by means of a real con job nadel regents of university of california,supra,th at,d in holding constitutional malice standard applicable in defamation action brought by limited public figures against a public entity and its employees,court suggests that in at least some cases,no statutory privilege or immunity applies to government speech made by employee within scope of employment.it is also possible for a public entity and its employees to be held liable for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and trade libel.h m associates city of el centro d.cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relationships survives demurrer despite assertion of various immunities and privileges eco resources,city of rio vista.july,no.cv geb dad wl,dist.lexis city can be liable for trade libel based on conduct of employees.
it is uncontested for purposes of this appeal that ashabi and lee were acting within the scope of their employment when they allegedly uttered the statements at issue.the question before us is whether various defenses,privileges,and immunities preclude liability for ashabi,lee,the city under the circumstances of this case we discuss each of theories in turn 
failed to prove ashabi statement was false 
first contend ashabi statement and most of lee statements were true and therefore not actionable.in defamation actions generally,factual truth is a defense which it is the defendant burden to prove.in a defamation action by a private person suing over statements of public concern,however,the first amendment places the burden of proving falsity on the plaintiff.eisenberg alameda newspapers,th,d newspaper defendant see nizam aldine city of oakland th,d nizam aldine same rule applies to nonmedia defendants.unlike personal defamation,the plaintiff seeking damages for trade libel must carry the burden of proving that the disparaging statement is false.guess,superior court d.
if the truth of the employees statements were an affirmative defense to causes of action,the argument on appeal would have no merit.the point to the unverified complaint and the issuance of preliminary injunctions to support their claim that the statements about illegal conduct at the property were true.the did not submit any admissible evidence that illegal activity was occurring at the property.thus,are far from establishing the truth of any of the statements as a matter of law.
but t he first amendment trumps the common law presumption of falsity in defamation cases involving plaintiffs when the allegedly defamatory statements pertain to a matter of public interest.nizam aldine,supra,th at,d.in nizam aldine,a dispute arose when a property owner sought to develop several lots.id.at,d.the city of oakland employees made derogatory statements about the boundary survey work performed by two private civil engineers,the survey was either fabrication or fraud the survey was screwed up or fucked up id.at,d surveys were fraudulent or
