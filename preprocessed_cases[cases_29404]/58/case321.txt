after a major sewer line repair was required for its business that was operated on leased premises,plaintiff and appellant del taco,del taco,sued its former landlord,defendant and respondent university real estate partnership v,a limited partnership university.del taco sought declaratory relief concerning its rights under the original ground lease agreement and the obligations to pay for the repairs.del taco also sued its current landlord,third street corporation third street,which is not a party to this appeal.the underlying action is still pending against third street.
university brought a motion for summary judgment,contending there were no triable issues of material fact and it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ.the motion was granted and del taco appeals,contending the trial court erred in finding that as to university,there was no potential liability nor any triable issues of fact under either the express or implied covenants in the lease agreement.these arguments lack merit and we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in,del taco entered into a ground lease agreement with university,providing that del taco would construct and operate a fast food restaurant within a shopping center.exhibit b to the lease provided a map of the premises.exhibit d to the lease required university to provide certain utilities to del taco designated points of connection,with capacities sufficient for del taco intended use.specifically,exhibit d required university to provide a sanitary sewer lateral line.del taco new sewer connection tied into a lateral line that had been used by a previous restaurant tenant at the site.the lease required the landlord to maintain and repair the common areas during the term of the lease,and defined common areas as including those parking areas and walkways that were subject to the rights of all tenants of the shopping center.
the restaurant was constructed and began operations in.in march,approximately one and years after del taco began its operations at the site,a sewage blockage occurred and was repaired through the removal of congealed grease.the grease trap had not been cleaned out as part of del taco maintenance of its premises.university property manager sent the bill to del taco,which paid it.at her deposition,she identified the foot sewer line as running under a common area parking lot.only del taco was using that line.
in may,university sold the shopping center,including these leased premises,to third street.
in june,the sewer line serving del taco failed and had to be repaired.the job logs for the repair reported that the stoppage was due to faulty construction in installation,including improper grading,separations in the line,improper assembly,and foreign material on top of the line.del taco paid over for this repair.
in february,del taco filed this action for declaratory relief against university and third street,seeking to hold them responsible for the costs of the repair under the terms of the leases.
in october,university brought a motion for summary judgment,contending there were no express or implied warranties about the sewer line which would place it under a duty to maintain or repair it,and that to the extent there were any express warranties regarding the construction of the line,they only extended to its size,and there was no dispute that the proper size was installed.
in opposition to the summary judgment,del taco argued there were triable issues of fact about university breach of the lease,particularly with reference to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the provision of the sewer line under the lease.del taco took the position that the sewer line was improperly constructed and therefore it could not have expressly or impliedly accepted the condition of the property as conveyed to it through the lease.
after the trial court took the motion under submission,it issued a ruling first stating that unless there is an express covenant set forth in a lease,a landlord is not bound to prepare nonresidential premises for the tenant use,or to keep them in repair,except to the extent to which he retains control over an area used in common by the public or other tenants.citation.this ruling analyzed the duty of a transferor of an interest in leased property,as follows if,immediately before the transfer,the transferor was under an obligation to perform an express promise contained in a lease that touches and concerns the transferred interest,that transferor will continue to be obligated after the transfer,if the obligation rests on privity of contract,and the transferor will not be relieved of the obligation by the person entitled to enforce it.
in applying these rules,the trial court ruling further noted that at oral argument,del taco had conceded university was not expressly obligated to maintain and repair the sewer line,but was alternatively contending university breached the lease contract by not providing an adequate sewer line.this alternative contention was rejected,as follows the lease required university to provide a sanitary sewer lateral.there is no dispute that such a sewer line was installed.further,the line did not have to be replaced for more than a year after university sold the property.to the extent plaintiff argues university was required to do more than provide a sewer line,the plaintiff would be implying conditions that are not expressed in the lease.as noted above,university can not be liable for implied obligations after it is no longer in privity with the plaintiff.
thereafter,del taco brought a motion for reconsideration,new trial,or to set aside the ruling.this motion was denied.the court reasoned as follows exhibit d to the lease required university to provide certain utilities with capacities sufficient for del taco intended use.plaintiff contends the sewer line was defective,was not installed or constructed properly,and,therefore,was not sufficient for del taco intended use.it appears plaintiff is focusing on sufficient to the exclusion of capacity.for example,exhibit d also calls for amp capacity and natural gas capacity of minimum cfh.thus,capacities sufficient for del taco intended use in this context calls for university to provide a sewer line as specified in the lease.
summary judgment was entered for university in accordance with the order granting the motion.del taco appeals.
discussion 
iintroduction and summary judgment standards 
del taco relies on both express and implied lease covenants to support its declaratory relief request to hold university responsible for payment of the repair costs for the sewer line.it contends that triable issues of fact exist concerning such a continuing duty,to the extent that the sewer line ran under the common area parking lot,and the landlord was responsible under the lease for maintaining the common areas.further,to the extent that the lease contains an express warranty to provide a sewer line with sufficient capacity for its intended use,del taco argues this will support an implied lease covenant that this sewer line was to be properly constructed and installed.as a matter of law,it argues that both these express and implied lease covenants remained binding on university after its transfer of the property.
