introduction 
in transactions,key money is generally considered an bonus payment made by the tenant in order to secure the tenancy in january,civil code section,subdivision b,made it unlawful for any person to require,demand,or cause to make payable any payment of money,including,but not limited to,key money,as a condition of initiating,continuing,or renewing a commercial lease or nonresidential rental agreement,unless the amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement.
the issue presented in this case is whether a landlord may be liable for simply demanding key money as a condition of extending or renewing an existing lease or rental agreement,even when the tenant rejects the demand and the parties do not enter into the desired new agreement.based upon the legislative intent behind section,we hold it is not unlawful for a landlord to merely make a demand for key money.rather,in order for liability to attach under the statute,a plaintiff must allege that the landlord made a demand for key money as a condition of initiating,continuing or renewing a lease or rental agreement,and failed to state the amount of the demanded payment in the resulting written lease or rental agreement between the parties.
factual and procedural background 
yeng pil ji and kyong ji own edamerica,through which they operate a korean restaurant in los angeles.the jis operate their restaurant on commercial property under a written lease with kwang jin jung and min ja jung,the owners of the property.in their second amended complaint against the jungs and the jungs agent,the jis alleged that on several occasions between december and march,they asked the jungs to issue a new lease or extend the existing lease to allow them to sell their business.each time,the jungs responded they would not grant a new lease or extend the existing lease unless the jis first paid million.the jungs allegedly were aware the jis had invested over in tenant improvements and would be unable to sell their business without a renewed or extended lease because of the limited term remaining on the lease.
the jis further alleged that in march,they received an offer to purchase their business,but the offer was contingent upon the new buyer receiving an assignment of a new lease or an extension of the existing lease.the jungs allegedly refused to issue a new lease or extension unless they were paid.the jis alleged each of the jungs demands for key money was unlawful under section,and they lost the offer to purchase their business,and sustained other losses,as a result of the jungs violation of this statute.they sought a civil penalty of million,representing three times the amount they would have received from their buyer had they received an extended or renewed lease without a key money demand.
the jungs demurred,arguing that section is violated only when a demand for key money is not memorialized in the negotiated lease.in other words,the phrase unless the amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement refers to a future lease the parties have yet to enter into.because they never entered into the new lease or agreement the jis desired,the jungs asserted that they could not be held liable solely for making a demand for key money.in contrast,the jis argued a demand for key money was sufficient to violate the statute if the amount of the payment was not stated in the existing lease,or in a future lease.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court agreed with the jungs because there is no liability under civil code section when a landlord merely demands in advance of a lease renewal an increase in the amount of rent or a lump sum payment.what is prohibited by the statute is the failure to include any such payment in the new written lease.because no new lease was entered into,no violation could occur as a result of the demand.
the jis challenged the ruling by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in this court.generally,writ review is not employed for rulings on pleadings.see babb superior court cal d.nonetheless,we issued an alternative writ because section is a newly enacted statute that has not yet been interpreted or applied by any appellate court.see omaha indemnity superior court d.

section,which became law in january,expressly applies only to commercial leases and nonresidential tenancies of real property,subd.a.subdivision b provides,it shall be unlawful for any person to require,demand,or cause to make payable any payment of money,including,but not limited to,key money,however denominated,or the lessor attorney fees reasonably incurred in preparing the lease or rental agreement,as a condition of initiating,continuing,or renewing a lease or rental agreement,unless the amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement.according to subdivision b,key money includes any amount of money a landlord demands or requires in order to initiate,continue,or renew a lease,including money denominated as rent.
a violation of this subdivision subjects a person to a civil penalty of three times the amount of actual damages proximately suffered by the person seeking to obtain the lease or rental of real property,as well as an award of costs,including reasonable attorney fees,incurred in connection with obtaining the civil penalty,subd.c.
the statute does not prohibit the advance payment of rent,if the amount and character of the payment are clearly stated in a written lease or rental agreement,subd.d.the statute also does not prohibit any person from charging a reasonable amount for the purpose of conducting reasonable business activity in connection with initiating,continuing,or renewing a lease or rental agreement for nonresidential real property,including,but not limited to,verifying creditworthiness or qualifications of any person seeking to initiate,continue,or renew a lease or rental agreement for any use other than residential use,or cleaning fees,reasonably incurred in connection with the hiring of the real property,subd.e.additionally,the statute does not prohibit a person from increasing a tenant rent for nonresidential real property in order to recover building operating costs incurred on behalf of the tenant,if the right to the rent,the method of calculating the increase,and the period of time covered by the increase is stated in the lease or rental agreement,subd.f.
section requires statement of key money demands in prospective lease.
the words of section,subdivision b,which are far from clear,indicate a landlord is subject to liability if that person demands,requires,or causes to make payable a key money payment as a condition of initiating,continuing,or renewing a lease or rental agreement.but the statute then provides that the landlord is not liable if the amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement.thus,no violation of section occurs wher
