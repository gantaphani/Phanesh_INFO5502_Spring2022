the section voucher program is a voluntary program through which the federal government provides rent subsidies to eligible families who rent from participating landlords.see a.the fair housing act,also known as title viii,bars discrimination against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling because of race b.in this case,graoch,the owner of autumn run apartments in louisville,seeks a declaratory judgment that it did not violate the fha by withdrawing from the section program.its claim presents two questions regarding the interplay between section and the fha.first,can a landlord withdrawal from the section program ever violate the fha solely because it has a disparate impact on members of a protected class second,if so,what are the standards for measuring disparate impact 
the district court answered the first question in the negative and therefore granted summary judgment in favor of graoch without reaching the second question.we reach the same final result,but in a different way.disagreeing with the position taken by the second and seventh circuits,we hold that a plaintiff can,in principle,rely on evidence of some instances of disparate impact to show that a landlord violated the fair housing act by withdrawing from section.we also hold,however,that in this case the metro human relations commission did not even allege facts making the statistical comparison necessary to state a prima facie case of discrimination.consequently,we affirm.
the housing authority of jefferson county hajc coordinates the local disbursement of section funds in the louisville area.see b the secretary is authorized to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies pursuant to which such agencies may enter into contracts to make assistance payments to owners of existing dwelling units in accordance with this section.in march,graoch notified the hajc that it intended to withdraw from the section voucher program,stating that it would honor existing leases by section tenants but would not renew those leases or sign any new section leases.
the kentucky fair housing council fhc and three autumn run tenants receiving section mcnealy,tina gray,and angela a complaint with the metro human relations commission.the commission found probable cause to believe that graoch withdrawal from the section program constituted unlawful racial discrimination because it had a disparate impact on blacks.on graoch motion,it then stayed administrative proceedings to give graoch the opportunity to seek declaratory relief in federal court.graoch responded by initiating this case 
the parties agreed to a series of factual stipulations.eighteen families receiving section assistance lived at autumn run when graoch announced that it was withdrawing from the section program.seventeen of those families were black.as of,of the jefferson county residents receiving section vouchers were black.finally,as of the census,of jefferson county residents were black and were members of black households.absent from the joint stipulations,however,was any information regarding the races of the tenants at autumn run.indeed,the only reference contained in the record to the racial makeup of autumn run as a whole,or of its tenants,is a remark by graoch counsel,quoted by the commission in its probable cause finding the tenants at respondent project autumn run apartments were minority and white.
graoch stated that it chose to withdraw from the section program because of disputes with the hajc regarding rent payments made on behalf of section tenants.graoch claimed that the hajc held graoch to an impossible standard in enforcing the quality standards for section,abating rent for conditions which graoch was either not made aware of prior to inspection,or which it attempted to fix only to be cited upon for not making its repairs to the arbitrary satisfaction of the inspector.see stating the housing quality standards for housing assisted through the section program.
based on this record,graoch moved for summary judgment.first,it argued that the commission failed to state a prima facie case that graoch withdrawal from section violated the fha because it had a disparate impact on blacks.second,it argued that its withdrawal from section did not violate the fha even if the commission did state a prima facie case because the decision to withdraw resulted from a business necessity.the district court granted summary judgment for graoch,holding that a party offering only evidence that a landlord withdrawal from the section program had a disparate impact on members of a protected class can not establish a prima facie case that the landlord violated the fha.
the commission appealed.we review the district court decision de novo.see trustees of the.laborers health care fund gibbons,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.ordinarily,we may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any basis fairly presented by the record,as long as the opposing party is not denied an opportunity to respond to the new theory.herm stafford,cir.in this case,however,both parties agree that we should remand the case to the district court if it is necessary to consider the adequacy of graoch business justification for its withdrawal from section.as a result,we consider only whether the commission has stated a prima facie case.
before delving into the specific implications of withdrawal from section and the details of this case,we must address as a general matter the law governing claims under the fha.we previously have held that a plaintiff can establish a violation of the fha by showing either disparate treatment or disparate impact larkin.dep t of soc,cir.we have stated that,to show disparate impact,a plaintiff must demonstrate that a facially neutral policy or practice has the effect of discriminating against a protected class of which the plaintiff is a member.blaz barberton garden apartment,wl,at.lexis,at cir.july,unpublished.we have not decided,however,what framework we should use to determine whether a plaintiff has done enough to survive summary judgment on a claim against a private defendant under the fha.
we find it useful to compare the frameworks that we have applied to three similar kinds of claims claims against private defendants under the fha,claims against private defendants under title vii,and claims against governmental defendants under the fha.in cases under the fha,we apply the burden of proof test established in mcdonnell douglas green,d.selden apartments dep t of hous.urban,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.first,the plaintiff must state a prima facie case by showing that he is a member of a protected class,that he applied to and was qualified to rent or purchase certain housing,that he was rejected,and that the housing remained available thereafter.maki laakko,cir.second,the defendant may then articulate a legitimate basis for its challenged decision.selden apartments,at.third,if the defendant does proffer such a basis,the plaintiff must establish that the articulated reason is pretextual.ibid.the burden of persuasion always remains with the plaintiff.
we imported this framework from our cases under title vii.see larkin,at compare daniels bd.of,cir addressing a claim under title vii with selden,at applying the same framework to a claim under the fha.we agreed with the reasoning used by the second circuit,which found persuasive the parallel between title vii and title viii 
the two statutes are part of a coordinated scheme of federal civil rights laws enacted to end discrimination the supreme court has held that both statutes must be construed expansively to implement that goal.see,trafficante metro.life ins,d fair housing act must be generously construed to foster integration griggs duke power,d title vii should be interpreted broadly to achieve equal employment opportunity.courts and commentators have observed that the two statutes require similar proof to establish a violation.
huntington branch,naacp town of huntington,cir,aff on other grounds,d cited in blaz,wl,at.lexis,at,and bangerter orem city,cir,which in turn was cited in larkin,at.in sum,we concluded that we generally should evaluate claims under the fha by analogizing them to comparable claims under title vii.larkin,at.
in cases under title vii,we apply a different version of the mcdonnell douglas framework than in cases.we follow the same three steps the plaintiff states a prima facie case the defendant responds the plaintiff rebuts the response.see kovacevich kent state,cir.to state a prima facie case,however,a title vii plaintiff basing his claim on disparate impact must identify and challeng e a specific employment practice,and then show an adverse effect by offering statistical evidence of a kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the adverse effect in question.ibid.to respond,the defendant must articulate a legitimate business reason for the challenged decision,rather than simply a basis.ibid.finally,to rebut the defendant response,the plaintiff can show either that the employer reason is a pretext for discrimination,or that there exists an alternative employment practice that would achieve the same business ends with a less discriminatory impact.ibid.relying on the analogy between title vii and the fha,several other circuits have applied essentially this approach to claims under the fha.hack president fellows of yale,cir langlois abington hous,cir mountain side mobile estates sec y of hous.urban dev.ex rel.vanloozenoord,cir.so has a district court in our circuit.marbly home props.of,d.
in a case against a governmental defendant under the fha,however,we did not mention the framework or the elements of a prima facie case.see arthur city of toledo,cir.instead,we stated that,to determine whether conduct which produces a discriminatory effect but which did not have a discriminatory intent violates the fha,we must consider three factors the strength of the plaintiff showing of discriminatory effect the strength of the defendant interest in taking the challenged action and whether the plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant affirmatively to provide housing for members of minority groups or merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with individual property owners who wish to provide such housing.id.at adopting a modified version of the standard used in metropolitan housing development village of arlington heights,cir arlington heights ii neither our opinion in arthur nor the seventh circuit opinion in arlington heights ii makes clear whether this balancing approach is the way to evaluate the claim as a whole after the parties have completed all three steps in the framework,or whether the framework does not apply.compare sherman tenants ass dist.of columbia,contrasting the seventh circuit inquiry to the second circuit framework,thereby indicating it reads arlington heights ii not to require a prima facie case with resident advisory bd.rizzo,cir we read the seventh circuit opinion in arlington heights ii as requiring no more than we do in order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case to the extent that the seventh circuit would seem to go beyond this standard in its statement of critical factors,our impression is that the court is setting forth a standard upon which ultimate title viii relief may be predicated,rather than indicating the point at which the evidentiary burden of justifying a discriminatory effect will shift to the defendant.
in formulating a framework to analyze claims against private defendants under the fha,we think that it is best to merge the approaches we used in arthur and in our title vii cases by reading the arthur standard as a supplement,not an alternative,to the framework.treating the arthur standard as an alternative would conflict with our statement in larkin that similar claims under title vii and the fha generally should receive similar treatment.see larkin,at.and when applied to private defendants,the arthur standard nicely captures the inquiry that we must perform at the third step in the framework.to determine whether a defendant proffered business reason is a pretext for discrimination,or whether an alternative practice exists that would achieve the same business ends with a less discriminatory impact,we must consider the strength of the plaintiff statistical evidence of disparate impact and the strength of the defendant interest in maintaining the challenged practice.those are the first two arthur factors.the third arthur factor,distinguishing defendants who wish only not to provide housing themselves from those who wish to stop others from providing housing,is not relevant to claims against private defendants,who lack the authority to control behavior though it is relevant when applied to governmental defendants,who through zoning regulations or permit requirements might have the authority to control the housing development and allocation decisions of third parties.consequently,we think that our approaches to claims under title vii and claims against governmental defendants under the fha are compatible,not inconsistent.
borrowing from our title vii cases,then,we hold that claims against private defendants under the fha should be analyzed using a form of the mcdonnell douglas framework 
first,a plaintiff must make a prima facie case of discrimination by identifying and challenging a specific housing practice,and then show ing an adverse effect by offering statistical evidence of a kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the adverse effect in question,kovacevich,at disparate impact claim under title vii 
second,if the plaintiff makes a prima facie case,the defendant must offer a legitimate business reason for the challenged practice,
third,if the defendant offers such a reason,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant reason is a pretext for discrimination,or that there exists an alternative housing practice that would achieve the same business ends with a less discriminatory impact.ibid.in order to evaluate the plaintiff showing,we consider the strength of the plaintiff showing of discriminatory effect against the strength of the defendant interest in taking the challenged action.see arthur,at claim against a governmental defendant under the fha.
graoch argues that,instead of analyzing the commission claims through this framework,we should exempt landlords from any possible liability under the fha for a complete withdrawal from the section voucher program the second circuit,in salute stratford greens garden apartments,cir,and the seventh circuit,in knapp eagle property management,cir,have created such a categorical exemption for section withdrawals.we decline to do so.
the fha prohibits discrimination against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling because of race b.the supreme court held that title vii,which uses similar language,proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form,but discriminatory in operation.griggs duke power,d.the same analysis justifies the existence of liability under the fha.what is required by congress is the removal of artificial,arbitrary,and unnecessary barriers to access to housing when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.ibid.discussing title vii.
of course,not every housing practice that has a disparate impact is illegal.we use the framework described especially the final inquiry considering the strength of the plaintiff statistical evidence and the strength of the defendant business distinguish the artificial,arbitrary,and unnecessary barriers proscribed by the fha from valid policies and practices crafted to advance legitimate interests.our analysis is derived from our interpretation of the statute,and we can not create categorical exemptions from it without a statutory basis.
in knapp and salute,our sister circuits seem to have taken a more circumscribed view of liability under the fha.the knapp court stated 
t he courts must use their discretion in deciding whether,given the particular circumstances of each case,relief should be granted under the statute.arlington heights ii,at t his court has recognized that disparate impact analysis is not appropriate in certain contexts.see naacp american family mutual ins,cir claim alleging failure to insure in certain areas violated the act not conducive to analysis,cert.denied,d village of bellwood dwivedi,cir some practices lend themselves to disparate impact method,others not.
knapp,at.this passage appears to say that some claims should fail even if the plaintiff could prevail under the standard framework.we can not endorse this view.
when we adjudicate statutory claims,our role is limited to interpreting what congress may do and has done.patterson mclean credit union,d.while reasonable minds could disagree as to whether the fha contemplates disparate impact liability,we have concluded that it does.see larkin,at arthur,at.nothing in the text of the fha instructs us to create exceptions.absent such instruction,we lack the authority to evaluate the pros and cons of allowing claims challenging a particular housing practice and to prohibit claims that we believe to be unwise as a matter of social policy.accord salute,at calabresi,dissenting expressing doubt whether the seventh circuit approach in knapp is consistent with the general use of the framework to analyze claims under the fha.
the passage from knapp also could mean something more limited that if no challenge to a particular practice ever could succeed under the framework,then a court categorically may bar all challenges to that practice.this reading is consistent with our statement that at least under some circumstances a violation of the fair housing act can be established by a showing of discriminatory effect without a showing of discriminatory intent.arthur,at quoting arlington heights ii,at alteration in original.it is also consistent with the cases relied on by the seventh circuit in knapp.in naacp american family mutual insurance,for example,the court held that insurers never can face liability for charging higher rates or declining to write insurance for people who live in particular areas,reasoning that i nsurance works best when the risks in the pool have similar characteristics.at.conducting an inquiry analogous to our inquiry at the third step in the framework,it concluded that the strength of the insurer interest in declining to insure in certain areas outweighed the strength of any possible disparate impact the policy could have.see id.at.
likewise,in village of bellwood dwivedi,the court concluded that claims of racial steering were not subject to analysis because racial steering necessarily involves disparate treatment,not a facially neutral policy that has a discriminatory effect.at.we agree that categorical bars are justified when they result from a generalized application of the framework.we see no reason to require courts to engage in the sisyphean task of working through the framework in each individual case when the plaintiff has no chance of success for example,when a plaintiff brings a challenge to a landlord decision to charge rent.
we do not believe,however,that it is impossible for a challenge to a landlord withdrawal from section to succeed under the framework.consider the strongest possible challenge to a landlord withdrawal from section all of the tenants at a housing complex are white.the landlord decides to participate in the section voucher program.a number of section participants move in,including the plaintiff.all are black.the landlord quickly decides to withdraw from section and refuses to renew the leases of existing section tenants.he explains his decision by saying simply that he no longer wished to participate in the program,without claiming that his participation cost him money,time,business opportunities,or any other benefit.
at the first stage of the framework,the hypothetical plaintiff could state a prima facie case she could identify a challenged practice the landlord withdrawal from section and present strong statistical evidence that the practice had a disparate impact on blacks.at the second stage of the framework,the landlord could offer a business reason for his decision he wanted out of the section program.at the third stage,then,the plaintiff would have to show either that the landlord explanation was a pretext for discrimination or that an alternate practice would serve the same business ends with less discriminatory effect.to evaluate the plaintiff showing,we would consider the strength of her evidence of disparate impact and the strength of the business interests stated by the landlord.we have little doubt that a reasonable presented with this hypothetical set of facts could conclude that the landlord withdrawal from section was pretextual,and therefore that the plaintiff claim should survive summary judgment under the framework.
graoch makes two arguments that could undermine this conclusion.first,it contends that because section is a voluntary program we should place exceptional weight on a landlord interest in being able to withdraw without the threat of litigation.yet to say that section participation is voluntary is only to say that a landlord does not break the law by declining to participate as such,graoch claim proves too much almost every action that could create liability under the fha is voluntary.buckeye,at vacated approving building site plans maki,at varying of rent based on number of occupants.the mere fact that a landlord often can withdraw from section without violating the terms of section or the fha does not mean that withdrawal from section never can constitute a violation of the fha.
second,graoch claims that there is no coherent way to permit challenges to a landlord withdrawal from section without also permitting such challenges to a landlord in section.it reasons that t he actions of both and participating owners have the same impact on minorities and therefore that no principled way exists to distinguish the two groups.knapp,at.while we agree that a landlord should never face liability for in section,we do not think that withdrawal and are functionally identical.withdrawal affects an identifiable group tenants receiving section assistance.could be said to have a theoretical impact on members of a protected class,but the size and composition of the affected group is indeterminate.
moreover,the fha does not impose liability based solely on the existence of a disparate impact.it imposes liability only when a plaintiff can meet the ultimate burden of persuasion by showing either that the landlord business reason for a practice is a pretext for discrimination or that an alternative practice would serve the same business goal with less discriminatory effect.that burden is harder to meet in a challenge to than in a challenge to withdrawal.a landlord presumptively can appeal to his interests in not wanting to spend time learning about the program and not wanting to become entangled in government bureaucracy,while a withdrawing landlord who fails to cite any reason why participation in section hurt his business can not do so.and an unexplained withdrawal from section,combined with strong evidence of disparate impact,might permit a to infer that a landlord entered section expecting to attract section tenants of one race,then withdrew based on discriminatory animus when she instead attracted tenants of a different race.thus,our view that it is possible to bring challenges to withdrawals from section is consistent with our view that one can not bring a challenge to section.
because we reject a categorical rule against challenges to withdrawals from section,we must address whether the commission can state a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination against graoch in this case.to state a prima facie case of discrimination under the fha,a plaintiff must identify and challenge a specific housing practice,and then show that the practice had an adverse effect on members of a protected class by offering statistical evidence of a kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the adverse effect in question.the commission plainly satisfied the first requirement by identifying and challenging graoch practice of no longer accepting section vouchers.we conclude that it did not satisfy the second requirement,however,because it failed even to allege any facts making the statistical comparison necessary to determine whether graoch withdrawal from section had a disparate impact on blacks.
in arthur,we explained that there are two types of discriminatory effects which a facially neutral housing decision can have 
the first occurs when that decision has a greater adverse impact on one racial group than on another.the second is the effect which the decision has on the community involved if it perpetuates segregation and thereby prevents interracial association it will be considered invidious under the fair housing act independently of the extent to which it produces a disparate effect on different racial groups.
at citing arlington heights ii,at.in a case under the fha,a plaintiff must present statistical evidence showing the existence of at least one of the two effects to state a prima facie case.here,the commission presented three pieces of data seventeen of the eighteen families who received section assistance and lived at autumn run when graoch announced its withdrawal are black as of,of the jefferson county residents receiving section vouchers were black and as of the census,of jefferson county residents were black and were members of black households.it made no other allegations regarding the racial makeup of autumn run or the surrounding community.
to determine whether a plaintiff can show the first type of discriminatory effect described in arthur,t he correct inquiry is whether the policy in question had a disproportionate impact on the minorities in the total group to which the policy was applied.betsey turtle creek,cir emphasis added isabel city of memphis,cir applying essentially the same inquiry in a title vii case.in betsey,a landlord managing several adjacent buildings adopted a policy banning children from building three.at.the policy led to the eviction of of the tenants in building three,but only of white tenants.id.at.relying on the discrepancy between those percentages,the court held that the plaintiffs had made a prima facie case even though the percentage of blacks at the apartment complex as a whole continues to exceed by a substantial margin both the percentage of black renters in the election district in which the complex is located as well as in montgomery county as a whole.id.at.this approach respects the notion that a policy applied to a population that is percent black does not have a disproportionate adverse effect on blacks even if percent of the people it burdens are black.
here,graoch applied its no section policy to all residents of autumn run.consequently,to determine whether the policy had a greater adverse effect on blacks than whites,we should compare the percentage of blacks among the section tenants whose leases were not renewed about percent to the percentage of blacks among the total pool of tenants at autumn run.yet the commission has not presented any data regarding the total tenant pool and has not even alleged that there are more whites among the tenants than among the section tenants.the only information we have about autumn run tenants is an isolated comment by graoch lawyer that the tenants at respondent project autumn run apartments were minority and white.if we consider this information which the commission does not dispute,it indicates that the racial mix of autumn run section and tenants was essentially the same,overwhelmingly.because the commission has not even very likely could not graoch withdrawal from section harmed a disproportionate percentage of the black tenants at autumn run,we conclude that the commission has not stated a prima facie case based on the first type of discriminatory effect.there can be no prima facie case of racial disparate impact without a showing of adverse impact on a racial group.for all that the commission alleges,any vacancies caused by of section leases to black tenants will be filled by black tenants,who already fill the very large majority of autumn run apartments.
the commission has not stated a prima facie case based on the second type of discriminatory effect either.it has never claimed that graoch withdrawal from section had a segregative effect nor alleged any facts from which we could infer a segregative effect it has not provided any information about the racial makeup of the community surrounding autumn run or about the likely effect of withdrawal on the racial makeup of autumn run itself.
because the commission can not meet its burden at the first step of the framework,its case can not go forward.graoch is not required to present a legitimate business reason justifying its decision to withdraw from section.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of graoch is affirmed.
i concur in the judgment in this case and in section iv of judge boggs opinion.i am not sure whether disparate impact analysis can ever apply to refusals to enter or remain in section housing because i am unable to foresee the full spectrum of such cases that could arise in the future.but i agree that there is no valid discrimination case here.the owner apparently became irritated by certain requirements the local housing administrator imposed on him,requirements he apparently regarded as too onerous,time consuming and costly.so he withdrew.this apparently angered the administrator and the commission,and they accused him of discrimination.this seems to be the underlying situation.the local administrative body should have to show either an intent to discriminate based on race or such a significant racial impact that intent can be inferred or that serious harm to a racial minority is likely to occur.none of these elements are present here.
the county metro human relations commission mhrc appeals from the district court order denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment to graoch associates graoch.for the reasons set forth below,i concur in the lead opinion conclusion that a landlord withdrawal from the section program may give rise to a claim under the fair housing act fha,title viii of the civil rights act of,codified as amended at.but i differ in the analytical framework that i think this court should apply to fha claims against private entities.in the instant case,graoch has conceded that mhrc has established a prima facie case of disparate impact under the fha.i therefore think this court should reverse the grant of summary judgment to graoch.because the district court offered no reason for denying mhrc for summary judgment,other than the grant of graoch motion,i believe this court should vacate the part of the district court order denying mhrc motion for summary judgment.insufficient evidence exists for us to rule as a matter of law on whether graoch successfully rebutted mhrc prima facie case by showing that withdrawal from the section program constitutes a business necessity.i therefore believe this court should remand for further proceedings.
background 
the section program aids families in obtaining housing in the private market.a.local agencies receive federal funds to administer the program.b.these agencies issue vouchers to families who then independently find suitable rental housing provided by private owners voluntarily participating in the program.o b.the local housing agency pays the housing subsidy directly to the landlord.participation in the section program places legal duties on owners related to the safety,sanitation,and of the rental housing they provide.d o.agencies set the payment standard for each size of dwelling unit in a market area at not less than ninety percent and not more than percent of the fair market rental.o b.the monthly assistance for a family is equal to the amount by which the payment standard rent determined by the public housing agency exceeds either thirty percent of the monthly adjusted income or ten percent of the monthly income of the family,whichever is greater.a tenant,however,must pay the difference between his or her subsidy and actual rent,no matter the amount of the payment standard rent.o a alfred clark iii,can america afford to abandon a national housing policy afford.hous.cmty.dev.
the housing authority of jefferson county administers the section program in the louisville area.in march,graoch,the owner of autumn run apartments in louisville,notified the housing authority that it would honor existing leases held by section tenants but would not renew these leases or sign any new section leases.joint appendix at.both parties have stipulated the following facts in,tenants in louisville including jefferson county received section voucher subsidies,and of these tenants were.according to the census,households comprised approximately percent and comprised approximately nineteen percent of louisville total population also including jefferson county.when graoch withdrew from the section program,there were eighteen families at autumn run receiving section vouchers,of which seventeen,or approximately percent,were families.at.
the kentucky fair housing council,and three autumn run tenants receiving financial assistance through the section program filed a complaint with mhrc,which subsequently found probable cause that graoch withdrawal constituted unlawful racial discrimination.at.mhrc stayed administrative proceedings to allow graoch to seek a declaratory judgment in the district court for the western district of kentucky that withdrawal from the section program can not constitute a violation of the fha.at.the current case involves only graoch and mhrc and arises from the district court grant of summary judgment to graoch 
ii.disparate impact under the fha 
standard of review 
we must review the district court order granting summary judgment de novo.dicarlo potter,cir.summary judgment is proper if the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.macy hopkins county sch,cir citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d and.c.we must determine whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.bryson regis,cir citing anderson liberty lobby,d.regardless of the evidence put forth by the nonmoving party,the moving party has the burden of establishing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.patmon.supreme,cir quoting celotex catrett,d.although both sides in this case made for summary judgment before the district court,mhrc now appeals the grant of summary judgment to graoch.thus,we must view graoch as the moving party and mhrc as the nonmoving party.
framework for analysis 
section of the fha prohibits discrimination because of,inter alia,race,color,or national origin in the sale or rental of housing by refusing to rent or make available any dwelling offering discriminatory terms,conditions,or privileges of rental making,printing or publishing any notice,statement,or advertisement indicating a preference,limitation,or discrimination based on race,color,or national origin and representing to any person that any dwelling is not available for rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.a d.we have previously held that a plaintiff may establish a violation under the fha by showing that the defendant has an intent to discriminate disparate treatment or that an otherwise neutral practice has a disparate impact on a protected class disparate impact.larkin.dep t of soc,cir.every one of the ten other circuits to consider the issue has allowed analyses under the fha.john stanton,the fair housing act and insurance an update and the question of disability discrimination,hofstra,listing cases sherman tenants ass district of columbia,assuming without deciding that plaintiffs may bring a claim under the fha.to prove a claim,a plaintiff need not show any intent to discriminate on the part of the defendant.bacon honda of america,cir citing wards cove packing atonio,d,cert.denied,d nationwide mut.cisneros,cir,cert.denied,d.
the appropriate framework for analyzing an fha claim against a private entity is an issue of first impression in this circuit.i believe that we should analyze these claims according to a framework derived from that which the fourth circuit uses to evaluate fha claims against private defendants as well as that which we use to evaluate title vii claims.first,we should require a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case by showing that a challenged housing practice or policy has caused a disparate effect on a protected class.second,if a plaintiff has established a prima facie case,the defendant can avoid liability by proving that the challenged practice constituted a business necessity and that there existed no less discriminatory alternatives that could serve the business interest.
fha claims against government defendants 
in deriving this standard,i have found it helpful to survey how other circuits treat fha claims against both government and private entities.the circuits evaluate the claim either by applying a test,implementing a framework,or combining the two approaches.in metropolitan housing development village of arlington heights arlington heights ii,cir,cert.denied,d,the first court of appeals case concerning disparate impact under the fha,the seventh circuit stated we refuse to conclude that every action which produces discriminatory effects is illegal.id.at the seventh circuit accordingly set forth a test to determine whether an action producing a disparate effect violates the fha.its factors inquire 
how strong is the plaintiff showing of discriminatory effect is there some evidence of discriminatory intent,though not enough to satisfy the constitutional standard of washington davis,d what is the defendant interest in taking the action complained of and does the plaintiff seek to compel the defendant to affirmatively provide housing for members of minority groups or merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with individual property owners who wish to provide such housing.
id.five years later,the fourth circuit adopted the same four factors in considering an fha claim against a government entity.see smith town of clarkton,cir.the sixth circuit subsequently applied the arlington heights ii analysis in a case involving a defendant government entity,but eliminated the assessment of evidence of discriminatory intent because it agreed with the seventh circuit that this was the least important of the four factors.arthur city of toledo,cir citing arlington heights ii,at.see also buckeye cmty.hope found.city of cuyahoga falls,cir evaluating the factors articulated in arthur to conclude that there existed genuine issues of material fact concerning defendants liability with respect to a claim under the fha,vacated on abandonment of claim,d.
in response to confusion about the stage of litigation at which the arlington heights ii factors came into play,the second circuit clarified that courts should consider the factors as part of a final determination on the merits rather than as a requirement for a prima facie case.huntington branch,naacp town of huntington,cir,aff in part,d.the second circuit reasoned treating the four factors as steps necessary to make out a prima facie case places too onerous a burden on plaintiffs.id.at.drawing on earlier third circuit precedent the second circuit established a framework,which considered the arlington heights ii factors as part of a defendant justification for its challenged action.id.at.the second circuit held that plaintiffs should first establish a prima facie case by showing that the challenged practice of the defendant actually or predictably results in racial discrimination in other words that it has a discriminatory effect.id.at quoting united states city of black jack,cir,cert.denied,d.the plaintiff need not show that the decision complained of was made with discriminatory intent.id.once a plaintiff has presented a prima facie case,a defendant must prove that its actions furthered,in theory and in practice,a legitimate,bona fide governmental interest and that no alternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.id.at citing resident advisory bd.rizzo,cir,cert.denied,d.
the tenth circuit takes the same approach as huntington branch in establishing a framework and then weighing the government defendant justifications against the plaintiff showing of disparate impact.reinhart lincoln county,cir.although the fifth circuit has not had occasion to develop fully the framework for assessing fha claims against government entities at least one district court within the fifth circuit follows the huntington branch analysis.in dews town of sunnyvale,d,the district court for the northern district of texas held that once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discriminatory effects,the defendant must prove that it acted to further a legitimate,bona fide governmental interest as well as prove the absence of a less discriminatory alternative.the court then evaluates the claim by balancing the showing of discriminatory effects against that of the defendant justifications and by assessing whether the plaintiff seeks to compel or to prevent interference with housing provision.id.
the other circuits that have addressed fha claims against government defendants have not followed huntington branch framework for incorporating the arlington ii factors into an evaluation of the merits of the defendant justification for the challenged action.the first,third,and eighth circuits evaluate fha claims against government entities according to frameworks and do not employ any final balancing test derived from the arlington heights ii factors to evaluate the merits of the defendant justification.the standards employed by these circuits are similar,with the only significant variation being that the eighth circuit requires plaintiffs to prove the existence of a less discriminatory alternative,while the third circuit requires defendants to prove the absence of such an alternative the first circuit has not yet determined the allocation of this burden.see tenant ass bd.louis hous,cir holding that once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case,the defendant must demonstrate that the proposed action has a manifest relationship to the legitimate,policy objectives and is justifiable on the ground it is necessary to the attainment of these objectives the burden then shifts back to the plaintiffs to show that a viable alternative means is available to achieve those legitimate policy objectives without discriminatory effects quoting oti kaga,south dakota hous.dev,cir,llc zoning bd.of adjustment,cir holding that once a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of disparate impact,then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that it had a legitimate,reason for the action and that no less discriminatory alternatives were available langlois abington hous,cir finding that practically all of the case law treats impact as doing no more than creating a prima facie case,forcing the defendant to proffer a valid justification and that further balancing of objectives by judges is inappropriate in cases.
the ninth and eleventh circuits have allowed fha claims against government entities but have not specified whether they incorporate the arlington heights ii test into a framework.gamble city of escondido,cir jackson okaloosa county,cir citing united states mitchell,cir keith volpe,cir,cert.denied,d.
fha claims against private defendants 
plaintiffs have brought to the federal courts far fewer fha claims against private entities than they have against public entities.the fifth circuit acknowledges the availability of a claim against a private defendant under the fha,but has not developed a framework for analyzing these claims.see simms first gibraltar bank,cir.citing hanson veterans,cir,cert.denied,d.the fourth and tenth circuits,however,have developed contrasting frameworks for evaluating fha claims against private entities the fourth circuit has applied a simple framework,holding that when confronted with a showing of discriminatory impact,defendants must prove a sufficiently compelling to justify the challenged practice.betsey turtle creek,cir.in applying the standard to claims against private defendants under the fha,the fourth circuit followed the framework for parallel claims under title vii.
the tenth circuit,however,created a different framework for evaluating fha claims against private defendants that departs from the test.instead,the tenth circuit evaluation of claims against private defendants follows the framework that the sixth circuit uses to evaluate claims against public defendants.in mountain side mobile estates partnership secretary of housing urban development,cir,the tenth circuit held that a title viii prima facie case,once established could alone suffice to prove a title viii violation unless the defendants justify the discriminatory effect which has resulted from their challenged actions.the opinion reiterated that unrebutted proof of discriminatory effect alone may justify a federal equitable response.id.to determine whether a plaintiff prima facie case of disparate impact makes out a violation of title viii,the tenth circuit assesses the three factors we set forth in arthur the strength of the showing of discriminatory effect the defendant interest in taking the action and whether the plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant to provide housing or alternatively to restrain the defendant from interfering with the provision of housing.id.
sixth circuit treatment of title vii claims 
in deciding what framework to apply in the instant case,the lead opinion does not look to other circuit courts treatment of fha claims for guidance.instead,the lead opinion integrates the analysis outlined in arthur city of toledo with the tripartite approach taken in a single sixth circuit title vii case,kovacevich kent state,cir.in particular,the lead opinion suggests that the first two factors from strength of the showing of disparate effects and the strength of the defendant interest in the challenged be applied at the pretext stage of analysis.i part company with the lead opinion on two grounds.first,i believe that the appropriate framework for a case is found not in kovacevich but in an earlier sixth circuit decision,alexander local,laborers international union of north america,cir,cert.denied,d.second,i believe that the lead opinion improperly applies the factors outlined in arthur city of toledo to an fha claim involving a private defendant.
the lead opinion is correct in looking to claims against private defendants under title vii to derive a framework for assessing such claims under the fha.see larkin,at.the sixth circuit cases on claims under title vii,however,conflict.kovacevich holds that a once a plaintiff has shown an adverse effect,the burden shifts to the defendants to articulate a legitimate business reason for the challenged practice.at.once the defendant has proffered such a reason,under kovacevich the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show either that the defendant reason is a pretext for discrimination,or that there exists an alternative practice that would achieve the same business ends with a less discriminatory impact.id.in contrast,alexander holds that once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case by showing adverse effect,the burden shifts to the defendant to produce evidence that the challenged practice is a business necessity.at.the difference between the two opinions lies in the fact that by requiring the plaintiff to prove pretext,kovacevich both imports an principle from the test into the analysis and places the ultimate burden of persuasion on the plaintiff rather than on the defendant.
alexander offers the better standard for assessing claims against private entities.moreover,alexander is the earlier opinion,and when a later decision of this court conflicts with one of our prior published decisions,we are still bound by the holding of the earlier case.darrah city of oak park,cir citing sowards loudon county,cir,cert.denied,d,and brentwood acad.secondary sch.athletic ass n,cir,rev on other grounds,d.pretext does not belong in a case as a matter of principle.as a general matter,the plaintiff burden to prove pretext involves a showing that the defendant proffered justification for the challenged action masks actual discriminatory intent.amini oberlin,cir.because a plaintiff does not need to establish discriminatory intent in a case,proof of pretext in such a case would be an unnecessary and indeed absurd undertaking.
third,the genealogy of the pretext prong in kovacevich renders it suspect.kovacevich devised the requirement that a plaintiff prove pretext in a title vii claim from an earlier sixth circuit title vii case,scales bradford,cir.scales,in turn,derived the pretext requirement from a supreme court opinion,watson fort worth bank trust,d.the relevant portion of watson,however,does not make a plaintiff proof of pretext a third stage of the in cases.instead,the opinion merely observes that the factors used to assess a plaintiff showing of a less discriminatory alternative in cases are also ones that determine whether the challenged practice has operated as the functional equivalent of a pretext for discriminatory treatment.watson,at.emphasis added.
moreover,the section of watson cited by scales for the proposition that a plaintiff retains the burden of proof in a claim was issued by a plurality rather than a majority of the court and is therefore not binding.in this section of the watson opinion joined only by three other justices,justice wrote that the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion at each stage of the inquiry in a case.id.at.justice white majority opinion in wards cove,at,adopted the position taken by the plurality in watson.the civil rights act of,stat.codified as amended at k,however,rejected wards cove holding regarding the allocation of burdens of production and proof in cases.the interpretive memorandum for the act,which congress declared to be its exclusive legislative history,states the terms business necessity and are intended to reflect the concepts enunciated by the supreme court in griggs duke power,d,and in the other supreme court decisions prior to wards cove packing atonio.cong.rec.we have clearly interpreted the civil rights act of to mandate that once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of disparate effects,the burden of persuasion,not just the burden of production,shifts to the defendant to show a business necessity for the practices with disparate impact.phillips cohen,cir citing k a.
burdens of proof and the defense 
business necessity is similarly the appropriate standard for private entities defense against claims under the fha.see sherman tenants ass n,at observing that griggs is the seminal case on the issue of claims and that,in the employment context,griggs establishes business necessity as the sole defense to a showing of disparate effects.the secretary of housing and urban development hud takes the position that implementing regulations promulgated in established a defense to claims.the secretary of hud regulation of the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation.at,codified at part.
business necessity holds defendants to a higher standard than the more lenient business justifications test set forth in wards cove,at,which defined the dispositive issue to be whether a challenged practice serves,in a significant way,the legitimate business goals of the defendant.between and,some courts applied the wards cove standard to fha cases.cases decided after the passage of the civil rights act of,however,implement the business necessity test in recognition that the act overruled the weakened standards set forth in wards cove.stanton,the fair housing act and insurance,hofstra.at.while a consensus exists that business necessity is the appropriate test,there remains some disagreement as to the content of that standard.the fourth circuit,hud,and district courts within the ninth circuit define business necessity to mean a compelling business interest in their allocation of the burdens of proof,the second and third circuit apply a substantive equivalent of this test id.at.i agree that when confronted with a showing of discriminatory impact,defendants must prove a business necessity sufficiently compelling to justify the challenged practice.see betsey,at.requiring the defendant to prove anything less would contravene the plain meaning of the word necessity,defined as an imperative requirement or need for something.random house dictionary stuart berg flexner,ed.moreover,requiring the defendant to offer a mere business justification would confuse defendants burden of proving in cases with defendants burden of producing a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action in cases.compare macy,at discussing the shifting burdens in cases,with alexander,at discussing the shifting burdens in cases.
in articulating the framework for our evaluation of fha claims against private defendants,i believe that we should rely on our earlier precedent alexander,rather than kovacevich,and seek guidance as well from the fourth circuit decision in betsey turtle creek.thus,we should first require that plaintiffs establish a prima facie case of disparate effects.second,upon the showing of a prima facie case,the burden of persuasion then shifts to the defendants,who must prove that the challenged housing practice constitutes a business necessity and that no less discriminatory alternatives are available.in the title vii context,plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that a less discriminatory alternative exists.isabel city of memphis,cir citing albemarle paper moody,d.the consensus across the circuits,however,is that in the housing context defendants have the burden of proving the absence of a less discriminatory alternative.see,llc,at discussing the defendant burden of proof regarding the absence of less discriminatory alternatives langlois,at same huntington branch,naacp,at same dews,d at,same see also betsey,at holding that once plaintiffs have established a prima facie case,defendants must prove business necessity.
our analysis should stop with an evaluation of whether a private defendant has successfully rebutted the plaintiff showing of disparate effects by proving business necessity and the unavailability of a less discriminatory alternative.considerations of doctrine and policy preclude this court use of the arthur factors for a government defendant to evaluate an fha claim against a private defendant.first,the lead opinion applies factors from a case concerning a public defendant to cases against private defendants,without explaining why they are transferable.that the lead opinion needed to excise the third arthur factor from its analysis only highlights the unsuitability of the framework in the context of a case against a private defendant.i believe that the tenth circuit incorrectly integrated arthur test into the business necessity framework applicable to private defendants in suits it did so without even acknowledging that the case concerned a private defendant while arthur concerned a public defendant.see mountain side,at.in contrast,the fourth circuit has explicitly stated that the analysis derived from arlington heights ii and its progeny should not apply in claims against private defendants.betsey,at.
second,by applying the arthur factors,the lead opinion converts an inquiry into the business justification for a practice bearing a disparate impact on a protected class into a balancing test.the lead opinion suggests that this court should weigh the disparate effects of the challenged action against the strength of the defendant interest in taking the challenged action.courts appropriately countenance governments weighing of competing public considerations of deep importance,and they may engage in such balancing acts themselves.see,arthur,at holding that because of the strong policy considerations underlying referendums absent highly unusual circumstances,the discriminatory effect of a referendum can not establish a violation of the fair housing act.in limited instances,congress has reduced the burden of fair housing laws on government entities,with respect to those entities pursuit of important public interests,but congress did not do the same for private landlords.see pfaff dep t of hous.urban,cir holding that congress chose to give special deference to occupancy limits only and made no comparable provision for private occupancy policies.even if weighing relative strengths of interests were appropriate,we must follow the longstanding rule that the weighing of litigants competing interests belongs at trial and not at the summary judgment stage.crestview parke care ctr.thompson,cir in evaluating whether summary judgment is proper,we do not weigh the evidence,but rather view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party to divine the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact.
third,the lead opinion framework mistakenly places the ultimate burden of persuasion on the plaintiff.the lead opinion states that the final step in the analysis involves evaluating the plaintiff showing by considering the strength of the plaintiff showing of discriminatory effect against the strength of the defendant interest in taking the challenged action.lead op.at.under the test,however,the landlord will successfully defend against a showing of disparate effects only if he or she proves that the challenged action constitutes a business necessity.if the landlord fails to carry this burden of proof,then he or she should lose once the plaintiff has established a statistically significant showing of disparate effects regardless of its strength.conversely,if the defendant does indeed prove business necessity,he or she should not be liable under a theory of the fha no matter how strong the showing of disparate effects.
in conclusion,we are bound by the factors set forth in arthur when evaluating fha claims against government defendants.but the framework outlined in arthur is not well suited to the evaluation of fha claims against private defendants.the framework for fha claims against private defendants is straightforward first,the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that a challenged housing practice or policy has caused a statistically significant disparate effect on a protected group second,the housing owner can assert the affirmative defense that the challenged action constitutes a business necessity and that there are no less discriminatory alternatives.
withdrawal from the section program and disparate impact 
i concur in the lead opinion holding that a landlord withdrawal from the section program,when it has a disparate impact on members of a protected class,may violate the fha.courts should give the broad and inclusive language of the fha a generous construction to effectuate its remedial purpose.trafficante metro.life ins,d.
no compelling jurisprudential or policy reasons exist to make a categorical exception to our recognition of claims under the fha for the withdrawal by landlords from the section program.graoch argues that the voluntary nature of the section program should counsel against allowing a plaintiff to bring a claim based on a landlord decision to withdraw.appellee br.at.graoch derives this analysis from the seventh circuit opinion in knapp eagle property management,cir,which held that the refusal by a landlord who participated in the section program to accept a new section tenant could not give rise to liability under a analysis of the fha.id.at.the seventh circuit found no principled basis upon which to distinguish between a landlord decision not to participate in the section program and the decision of a participating housing owner not to accept a new section tenant.id.accordingly,the seventh circuit held that because nonparticipation is not actionable,neither can a landlord withdrawal from the program give rise to a claim.id.the actions of both and participating owners have the same impact on minorities and to hold only the latter liable for racial discrimination for that conduct would deter them from joining or remaining involved in the program.
the voluntary nature of the section program does caution us to consider carefully whether a landlord decision to withdraw from the program may give rise to liability under the fha.congress revision of the fha has only reinforced that body intent to make section a voluntary program.before,some courts interpreted d b,which provided that the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease,for violation of applicable federal,state,or local law,or for other good cause to prescribe an endless lease.some courts read this provision to mean that the owner could not refuse to renew a lease at the conclusion of the lease period,except for the specified reasons.eastchester llc healy,index,wl,at unpublished opinion citing salute stratford greens garden apartments,cir tann realty thompson,misc d,kings.in,however,congress amended this section of the fha as part of the omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act of,stat,at,by inserting during the term of the lease into both clause ii and clause iii of the section.the effect of the statutory change was to eliminate the endless lease interpretation of such provision and clarify that a landlord could terminate a section tenant lease and,a fortiori,its participation in the section program with respect to that tenant,when the term of the tenant lease expires.eastchester,wl,at.
the same omnibus budget act also repealed the take one,take all provision of the united states housing act of.omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act.that provision,previously codified at t a was entitled nondiscrimination against certificate holders and voucher holders and provided that no owner who had entered into a contract for housing assistance payments under the section shall refuse to lease any available dwelling unit in any multifamily housing project of such owner to a holder of a voucher.glover crestwood lake section holding.
ultimately,however,i disagree with the seventh circuit reasoning that the voluntary character of the section program precludes liability for withdrawal from the program under a theory of the fha.the repeal of the endless lease and take one,take all provisions of evinced congress intention that a landlord decision to participate in the section program should not require him or her to accept any particular section tenant or to renew endlessly the lease of a given tenant.the statutory repeals,however,did not address the issue of a complete withdrawal from the program and a decision not to accept any new section tenants.the fha imposes a mandate on actors engaging in many different types of voluntary actions.see,betsey,at allowing a claim to proceed where a private landlord issued eviction notices to families with children in an effort to institute an rental policy.landlords who choose not to accept any section vouchers may do so for all kinds of legitimate or biased reasons that remain behind the veil of nonparticipation,far removed from legal scrutiny.once a landlord decides to enroll in the section program,however,he or she necessarily accepts a new set of responsibilities toward tenants under the fha.these include duties both to refrain from intentional discrimination on the basis of a protected characteristic and,in the case of a business practice that has a disparate impact on a protected class,to implement when possible an alternative business practice with less discriminatory effects.see alexander,at.i agree with the lead opinion that the sixth circuit should decline to follow the seventh circuit and should instead allow plaintiffs to use evidence of disparate impact to show that a landlord violated the fha by withdrawing from the section program.
in addition to knapp,graoch relies on the second circuit decision in salute stratford greens garden apartments,cir,to argue against the propriety of allowing a claim for withdrawal from the section program.appellee br.at.in salute,however,the majority based its opinion on the fact that the defendant landlord had never accepted tenants who,at th
