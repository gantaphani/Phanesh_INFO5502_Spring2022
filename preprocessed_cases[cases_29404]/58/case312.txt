appellant the company llc contends that an order granting summary adjudication as to seven of its causes of action was erroneous because california should recognize an implied covenant for further exploration in oil and gas leases.respondent brea oil company brea argues that it fully complied with the express terms of the oil and gas leases which defined its responsibilities to drill wells in the search for oil and gas on the leased property,and that an implied covenant for further exploration is contrary to the express terms of the leases.
based on the undisputed facts presented with the motion for summary adjudication,we conclude that a covenant for further exploration should not be implied in the two oil and gas leases involved in this case.accordingly,the judgment is affirmed.
undisputed facts relied upon by the parties 
the following are all of the material facts the parties presented to the superior court in their separate statements of undisputed facts concerning the motion for summary adjudication.none of the facts asserted by either party were disputed.
is the current lessor,and brea is the current lessee,under two oil and gas leases covering certain property located in kern county,california leased property.the first lease was entered in lease and was assigned to brea in.the second lease was entered in by,as lessor,and brea,as lessee lease.
since,brea has drilled and operated wells on the land covered by both the lease and the lease.several oil and gas wells exist on the land covered by the leases,and is receiving royalty payments for the wells production.
both the lease and the lease require the drilling of oil and gas wells by brea,but neither expressly requires the drilling of any well to a particular depth 
contends that,although brea is in compliance with the express provisions of the leases,brea should do more by drilling additional wells,which are deeper than feet.
brea has not drilled for oil,gas or other hydrocarbons below a depth of feet on the real property covered by the lease has not prospected,explored or drilled for oil or gas from below feet on the real property covered by the lease and has produced no oil,gas or other hydrocarbon substances from a depth of feet or below on the real property covered by either lease.
in addition to these undisputed material facts listed in the separate statements,the parties each listed as fact their agreement that the question whether there is an implied covenant of further exploration in the lease and lease is a question of law.
proceedings 
on november,filed a complaint against brea asserting nine causes of action.the first seven causes of action were predicated on the claim that an implied covenant of further exploration is recognized in oil and gas leases in the state of california.the eighth cause of action was for breach of an agreement that was part written and part oral.the ninth cause of action was for rescission based on alleged mistake of fact.
brea filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication and,in its opposing papers,framed the issue as follows 
first seven causes of action deal directly or indirectly with an implied covenant of further exploration.brea motion for summary judgment challenges the existence of the implied covenant of further exploration in the state of california.
as can be seen by response to brea separate statement of facts,there is no real factual dispute regarding this claim.claims that an implied covenant of further exploration exists,brea claims that the implied covenant of further exploration does not exist.
as to the covenant of further exploration,the gravamen of complaint in general is that the leases have been held for an undue length of time without a test of formations favorable to the accumulations of oils or gas or hydrocarbons,that brea has no intention of exploring the lower depths and further that,so long as the lessee continues to hold the lease and refuses to explore,there can be no tests or exploration,because the lessee has the absolute and sole right to explore for,test and produce oil and gas on those properties.
the superior court filed its order denying the motion for summary judgment and granting in part the motion for summary adjudication of issues on october.the court granted summary adjudication of first seven causes of action because california does not recognize a cause of action based on breach of an implied covenant of further exploration.moreover,there is no express contractual duty for brea to drill any well to a particular depth.
the eighth and ninth causes of action were tried to the court,which found in favor of brea on both and subsequently entered judgment in brea favor.filed a notice of appeal relating to the order granting summary adjudication as to the first seven causes of action,but did not appeal the superior court decision on the eighth and ninth causes of action.
discussion 
standard of review 
the parties agree that the question whether california law should recognize an implied covenant of further exploration is one of law,subject to independent appellate review,twedt franklin th,d.
ii.background 
much has been written on the subject of an implied covenant of further exploration in oil and gas leases.see martin,implied covenants in oil and gas,present future washburn,fn.and the articles cited therein.one treatise gives the subject lengthy treatment.see williams meyers,oil and gas law.another commentator,however,has described the scholarly debate as follows 
while some issues may remain open in some jurisdictions,it is probably fair to say that brown view that the implied covenant of further exploration does not exist has generally prevailed.see richard hemingway,the law of oil and gas c ed.lansdown,the implied marketing covenant in oil and gas leases the producer perspective mary,fn.
iii.california view of implied covenants in oil and gas leases 
this court need not become mired in the many aspects of the scholarly debate,because the california supreme court has addressed the circumstances in which a covenant will be implied in an oil and gas lease and it has set forth the steps of the analysis to be used in reaching a determination.hartman ranch associated oil cal d,hartman a covenant to protect against drainage was implied into the lease.
the first step requires a court to examine the express terms of the lease.as stated in hartman 
in the absence of express provision it is well settled that covenants will be implied to use reasonable diligence in the exploration and discovery of oil,and thereafter in the development of the oil lease,and protection from drainage through wells on adjoining lands.citations.where express covenants do not cover completely all phases of the lessee obligation in regard to exploration,development and protection,implied covenants may coexist with express covenants it is agreed,of course,that implied covenants will not be raised which are in conflict with express covenants.hartman,supra,cal d at.
after identifying the relevant contractual provisions in the leases,a court second step is to determine whether the alleged implied covenant would conflict with those express provisions.this step necessarily involves contractual interpretation.see,storek storek,citicorp real estate,th,d addressing whether implied covenant of good faith contradicted express terms of loan agreement.
in this case,we conclude the contractual interpretation required is a matter for the is,it presents questions of law,because the parties agreed that the existence of an implied covenant of further exploration was a question of law,which implies that the underlying contractual interpretation necessary to resolve that broader issue also presents only questions of law california courts have long recognized that the interpretation of a written instrument is a judicial function unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence parsons bristol development cal d,and under the rule of law stated in parsons,courts have treated the question whether an implied covenant conflicts with the express terms of a contract as a question of law,storek storek,citicor
