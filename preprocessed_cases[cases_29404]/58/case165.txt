rohrer towers ii apartments rohrer towers ii is a housing facility for elderly residents in haddon township,camden county,new jersey.haddon housing associates,limited partnership leased rohrer towers ii to housing authority of the township of haddon collectively haddon,which,in turn,entered into a housing assistance payments contract hap contract with the united states department of housing and urban development hud to provide housing under the housing act of housing act.see housing and community development act of,stat.haddon filed suit on september,alleging that hud breached the hap contract in each of the years from by,among other things,requiring rent comparability studies to be submitted along with requests for annual rent adjustments and adopting a reduction of the annual adjustment factors for units occupied by the same tenant s from the previous year units.the claims court agreed and ordered rent adjustments for all relevant years other than.
the government appeals the claims court ruling and contests the earlier denial of its motion to dismiss haddon claim for damages for the rent year on statute of limitations grounds.the government also appeals the claims court decision that regulatory imposition of a mandatory rent reduction for units was arbitrary,and thus beyond hud authority.haddon appeals the claims court failure to order a rent adjustment for.finally,haddon appeals the claims court refusal to set aside the government imposition of a requirement that rent adjustment requests be submitted sixty days prior to the hap contract anniversary date.all appeals are timely.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.for the reasons below,we and.
section of the housing act created a housing assistance program through which hud subsidizes the rents of individuals and families living in privatelyowned homes and apartments.see.building owners enter into hap contracts that obligate hud to pay rent subsidies on behalf of occupants.id.each hap contract establishes the maximum monthly rent,otherwise known as the contract rent,that a building owner is entitled to receive for a particular housing unit.c.the tenants are obligated to pay a portion of the established monthly rent based on particular income guidelines,see,while the government pays a subsidy to the building owner to bridge the difference between the tenant obligation and contract rent.see.
the maximum monthly rent is tied to the fair market rental value of the housing.the fair market rental value for an area is published in the federal register and is based on the most recent available data of rents for existing or newly constructed rental units of various sizes and types in the market area.c.once a baseline rent is established,the housing act also provides for at least yearly adjustments of the contract rent.c a.the upward rental adjustments are to reflect changes in the fair market rentals established in a housing area for similar types and sizes of dwelling units or,if the secretary determines,on the basis of a reasonable formula.c a.
hud uses automatic annual adjustment factors aaaf to calculate the amount of the upward rental adjustments.hud publishes the aaafs in the federal register at least annually.yearly increases,however,are subject to an overall limitation to ensure that a djustments in the maximum rents shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units of similar quality,type,and age in the same market area,as determined by the secretary.c c.
congress twice modified the administration of hap contracts,in and.in,congress amended the housing act to enforce the overall limitation by providing that the secretary will establish regulations for conducting comparability studies.see department of housing and urban development reform act of,stat,codified at u.c c.a comparability study compares private market rents against section rents of units of comparable size and type in a particular area.see cisneros alpine ridge,d.hud,prompted by the amendment requirement,began to create the studies to enforce the overall limitation in rental markets where the secretary believed application of the aaafs to the contract rents would generate materially higher rents for assisted units compared to similar unassisted units.id.after a challenge by building owners,the supreme court concluded that the hap contracts authorized hud to conduct such comparability studies.id.at.congress was not yet finished amending the statutory framework of section.
in,congress revised the housing act and shifted the burden to building owners to prove that the adjusted rents,the maximum rents plus a particular year aaafs do not exceed rents of comparable unassisted units.the amendment states that,should an aaaf adjustment cause the monthly rent to exceed the fair market rent for the units,the owner must demonstrate that the adjusted rent would not exceed the rent for comparable unassisted units in the same market.see departments of veterans affairs and housing and urban development,and independent agencies appropriations act of,stat,amendments.
in response to the amendments,hud issued notice.see hud directive,annual adjustment factor rent increase requirements pursuant to the housing appropriations act of.notice provides that a building owner must submit a rent comparability study at least days prior to the hap contract anniversary date if the adjusted rent after application of the annual aaaf should exceed the published fair market rent for the area.id.at.absent submission of such a study,the rent would not be adjusted.but,if the owner submitted the information outside the day window,the rent would be adjusted days after receipt of the required information,so long as the request was made before the next contract anniversary date.id.at.should the owner demonstrate via a comparability study that rents for unassisted units in the area are more than five percent over the current contract rent,hud maintained that it would increase the rent to the lesser of the rent level adjusted by the aaaf or the comparable,unassisted rent plus the initial difference the amount by which the original contract rent exceeded the original comparable rent.id.at.should the comparability study demonstrate that the current contract rent was above the current rents for comparable unassisted units,the rent would remain steady and would not be reduced.id.at.
beyond the rent comparability study requirement,the amendments amended other aspects of the administration of hap contracts.for units,or units occupied by the same family at the time of the last annual rental adjustment,congress instituted a mandatory reduction of the applicable aaafs.see c a department of veterans affairs and housing and urban development,and independent agencies appropriations act of,stat.at.congress also added a provision to c a that where application of an aaaf causes the contract rent to exceed the fair market rental for an existing dwelling unit in a market area,the owner must demonstrate that the adjusted rent would not exceed the rent for an unassisted unit.see id.emphasis added.this new provision could be interpreted to supersede the overall limitation in existing hap contracts targeted to identify material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and comparable unassisted units,not whether the rent would exceed the fair market rental value.see,d of haddon hap contract.
on january,haddon housing associates leased rohrer towers ii to the housing authority.the housing authority,in turn,entered into a hap contract with hud for rohrer towers ii,effective march.during the term of the lease,haddon housing associates agreed to operate and maintain the project and,on behalf of the housing authority,submit requests for rent adjustments to hud.the hap contract allowed for a maximum term of years and terminated on march.section b of the hap contract provided that u pon request from the owner to the ca contract administrator,contract rents will be adjusted on the anniversary date of the contract in accordance with cfr and this contract.section d recited the overall limitation provision,which provided that application of a given aaaf to the contract rent shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and comparable unassisted units in the same market.
hud provided rent adjustments to haddon from to,but no adjustments for and.from through,hud granted all of haddon requests for rent adjustments.hud,however,denied haddon requests for rent adjustments from through,for failure to include an attendant rent comparability study in compliance with recently issued notice.haddon did not submit requests for rent adjustments or conduct rent comparability studies from to and in.in,haddon conducted a rent comparability study,but decided not to submit a request for a rent adjustment based upon its belief that the request might result in a downward adjustment of contract rents.haddon again submitted requests for rent adjustments from through,all of which hud denied for lack of an accompanying comparability study.from through,haddon accompanied its rent adjustment requests with rent comparability studies and hud accordingly granted the adjustments.despite the parties disagreement regarding rent adjustments,they continued complying with all other duties and obligations under the contract hud continued paying subsidies to haddon,while haddon maintained and provided housing to its elderly residents.
haddon filed suit against the government on september,seeking damages from september,forward,alleging that hud breached the hap contract by not providing rent adjustments from to.see haddon hous.at.the case was initially consolidated with pennsauken senior towers urban renewal assocs.united states,fed,filed march.id.at.while the cases were consolidated,the government moved pursuant to rule b to dismiss haddon claim for damages from september,to march,contending that any claim relating to the contract year accrued on march,outside the statute of limitations for contract claims against the government.pennsauken senior towers urban renewal.at.the claims court denied the government motion,holding that haddon claim for was not outside the limitations period because haddon could have requested a rent adjustment at any time prior to march,and was not limited to making a request as of the beginning of the contract year.id.at.the pennsauken case settled,and haddon and the united states went to trial between november.haddon.at.
the claims court issued its opinion and order on liability on june.the claims court held that the amendments and hud implementation of the changes,namely notice and the comparability study requirement,constituted a breach of haddon hap contract.id.at.the claims court found that hud was liable for denying haddon rent adjustments from through,the years during which haddon had submitted rent adjustment requests absent a comparability study.id.the claims court also held that haddon was entitled to recover the cost of the comparability study it conducted in.id.
the claims court further found that haddon failed to submit rent adjustment requests from through a condition precedent in the hap contract to obtaining an adjustment.id.at.the claims court,nevertheless,held that haddon was excused from performance of the condition precedent under the prevention doctrine for the years and.id.the claims court found that the facts adduced at trial demonstrated that haddon failure to submit rent requests in those years was a direct result of hud previous denials.id.as such,the claims court held that the government materially contributed to haddon failure to fulfill the condition precedent and,therefore,that haddon was excused from performance.id.regarding,the claims court found that the trial evidence demonstrated that the government previous denials did not contribute to haddon failure to submit a rent adjustment request.id.haddon thus was not awarded any recovery for.id.
the trial court also held that the reduction for units was not supported by adequate rationale to satisfy the secretary duty under the overall limitation in the haddon hap contract does not serve as a cap on haddon damages because it was superseded by the and the requirement that owners submit their rent requests days prior to the anniversary date or rental adjustment date if made after the anniversary date is reasonable and within the boundaries of hud discretion.id.at.this appeal followed.
the government argues that the trial court erred in holding that hud breached the hap contract by not granting rent adjustments from to haddon was excused for not submitting rent adjustment requests in and the reduction for nonturnover units was improper and the statute of limitations did not bar haddon claim for damages for haddon,contending that the trial court erred in holding that haddon was not entitled to a rent adjustment for.alternatively,haddon argues that the claims court should have found the day requirement established in notice arbitrary,thus granting haddon retroactive request for the adjustment.
we turn first to the claims court decision in haddon hous.united states.there,the claims court provided a and meticulous opinion detailing its factual findings and legal conclusions thereon.in significant measure,we see no reason to revisit that careful analysis.thus,for the reasons set forth in the claims court opinion,we agree that the amendments and hud implementation thereof is a breach of the haddon hap contract for all years at issue here.we also agree that the government deduction of one percent from the annual adjustment factor to be applied to contract rents for units breached the hap contract because the figure was arbitrary.finally,we agree that hud requirement that owners request rent adjustments at least sixty days prior to the contract anniversary date fits within the boundaries of the administrative discretion hud possesses,haddon hous.at,and thus,did not breach the haddon hap contract.we disagree with only the claims court decision that haddon was excused from submitting rent adjustment requests in and.
haddon hap contract contains a condition precedent that requires haddon to affirmatively request a rent adjustment each year to trigger hud duty to provide an adjustment.haddon failed to make any requests for rent adjustments from to.the claims court excused haddon failure to fulfill the condition precedent in and under the prevention doctrine.the claims court found that the government,via the amendments and hud implementation thereof,breached the haddon hap contract and made clear its intention to continue to breach that contract by requiring rent comparability studies as a precondition to receipt of any rent adjustment.id.at.the claims court thus concluded that haddon failure to fulfill the condition precedent of making a rent adjustment request in and was a direct result of the government prior breach of its express contractual duty to grant rent adjustments upon haddon request,and a breach of its implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing.id.at.as a result of such breach,the claims court found that haddon failure to fulfill the condition precedent was excused under the prevention doctrine.id.we disagree.
