defendant kwai ho lam appeals from the denial of his special motion to strike the complaint of plaintiffs regina birkner,nyri scanlon,charles birkner,and william rogers burton as a strategic lawsuit against public participation pursuant to code of civil procedure section commonly known as the statute.the trial court determined plaintiffs causes of action were not based upon petitioning activity protected by section.we disagree,and remand the matter for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
the four causes of action in the complaint designated wrongful of a rent ordinance,negligence,breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment,and intentional infliction of emotional distress are all based on the following factual allegations.plaintiffs are tenants of a single unit in a san francisco apartment building owned by lam under a rental agreement.the tenancy is subject to the san francisco residential rent stabilization and arbitration ordinance,san francisco administrative code,chapter,originally enacted on june,rent ordinance.at issue is rent ordinance section a,concerning relative move in evictions.that provision allows a landlord to terminate a tenancy in order that the premises may be occupied,in good faith,without ulterior reasons and with honest intent,by a relative of a landlord,to be used as the relative principal residence,within three months of the termination and for a period of at least continuous months.ibid.however,a landlord may not recover possession of a unit from a tenant under section a if the landlord receives notice,at any time before recovery of possession,that any tenant in the rental unit a is years of age or older and has been residing in the unit for years or more or b is disabled as defined in section i b i and has been residing in the unit for years or more,or is catastrophically ill as defined in section i b ii and has been residing in the unit for five years or more rent,i a b.protected tenant status does not apply,however,where there is only one rental unit owned by the landlord in the building,or where each of the rental units owned by the landlord in the same building where the landlord resides except the unit actually occupied by the landlord is occupied by a tenant otherwise protected from eviction by section i a and b and where the landlord qualified relative who will move into the unit pursuant to section a is years of age or older.rent,ii.a landlord may challenge a tenant s claim of protected status either by requesting a hearing with the rent board or,at the landlord s option,through commencement of eviction proceedings,including service of a notice of termination of tenancy.in the rent board hearing or the eviction action,the tenant shall have the burden of proof to show protected status.no civil or criminal liability under e or f shall be imposed upon a landlord for either requesting or challenging a tenant s claim of protected status.rent,ii.
on or about december,lam,through counsel,served a notice to terminate tenancy the termination notice,pursuant to rent ordinance section a.lam sought possession of plaintiffs apartment to allow his mother to reside in the building.on or about january,plaintiffs counsel notified lam in writing that plaintiffs could not be evicted because they were protected tenants under the rent ordinance.lam refused to rescind the termination notice.
the declarations filed in opposition to and support of lam special motion to strike added the following relevant information.after lam moved into the apartment building,he decided to move his mother into plaintiffs ground floor apartment.lam mother used a walker and had a disabled person placard to use when being driven.at the time the termination notice was served on plaintiffs in december,lam mother was living in an apartment that required her to climb stairs to reach her unit.however,on february,lam mother died.on february,lam attorney wrote plaintiffs attorney,informing him of the mother death and rescinding the termination notice.
according to plaintiffs,the termination notice had been unlawful for two reasons three of the tenants were protected from eviction because of their age or disability and length of tenancy,and the termination notice failed to comply with procedural requirements of the rent ordinance.plaintiffs alleged that lam was aware of their protected status before he served the termination notice,their apartment was not the only rental unit in the building that was available for use by lam mother,another unit was then occupied by tenants who were not protected under the rent ordinance,and lam had made no offer to move plaintiffs to any other rental unit owned by lam or his family.the termination notice assertedly exacerbated plaintiffs preexisting medical conditions,and caused them stress,frustration,insomnia and anxiety.also,regina birkner alleged that she and the other plaintiffs had many problems with the building owners over the years.she recounted a december,incident involving lam sister,and a november,incident involving lam.
in a reply declaration,one of lam attorneys asserted she was notified of the death of lam mother on february,but did not notify plaintiffs counsel immediately because she was busy and knew plaintiffs were not going to vacate the unit.had lam mother not died,counsel would have proceeded to file an unlawful detainer action.lam also filed a reply declaration,asserting he did not own an interest in another apartment at the time the termination notice was served,and his sole intent in serving the notice was to provide a place for his mother to live to accommodate her difficulty in walking up and down stairs.if his mother had not died,he intended to file an unlawful detainer action,if necessary,but he was hoping to settle the dispute.
in denying lam special motion to strike,the trial court found lam asserted petitioning activity was not illegal as a matter of law.however,the court concluded that lam conduct was not in furtherance of his right to petition within the meaning of section,so that the complaint was not based on activity protected by that section.the court did not address whether plaintiffs had made a prima facie showing they were likely to prevail on their causes of action.lam timely appeals from the denial of his motion,as he is entitled to do by sections,subdivision i,and,subdivision a.
