in this action,we must determine whether the judicially created doctrine enunciated in hoadley san francisco cal,wl hoadley that the statute of limitations does not apply to actions by the state to recover property dedicated for public use against an adverse be extended to bar the application of the statute of limitations to the state action to void a lease of property.because the purpose of the hoadley doctrine is to prevent property that the state can not directly alienate from being indirectly alienated through the passage of is,through the statute of conclude that the doctrine has no application to a lease of property which the state is authorized to make.
in this case,the plaintiff,marin healthcare district the district,a political subdivision of the state,brought suit to recover possession of a publicly owned hospital and related assets that it had leased and transferred in to defendant marin general hospital marin general pursuant to the terms of the local health care district law health,et.the district complaint alleges that the agreements are void because its chief executive and legal counsel had a financial interest in the agreements at the time of their execution,in violation of government code section,which prohibits state employees from having any financial interest in any contract made by them or by any body of which they are members but because the action was filed years after the agreements were signed,the trial court concluded that the suit was.
the district contends it did in the trial under the california supreme court decision in hoadley,a suit by a governmental entity to recover property from a private party to whom it was illegally or invalidly transferred is never barred by any statute of limitations.
we conclude,to the contrary,that hoadley stands for the more narrow rule that property held by the state in trust for the people can not be lost through adverse possession.people shirokow cal d.other cases have only extended the doctrine to prevent the statute of limitations from barring the recovery of property that the state had no authority to alienate,sixth district.wright cal.the doctrine has no application to the lease of property into which the state is authorized by law to enter and which property the state will recover at the end of the lease term.
extension of the hoadley doctrine here would conflict with the legislature determination to apply statutes of limitations to actions brought by the state,including the type pleaded here.specifically,ever since the first session of the california legislature,t he general legislative policy of california has been that the state shall be bound by its statute of limitations with respect to the bringing of actions for the enforcement of any and all such rights as may accrue to the state.people osgood.while there are good policy reasons both for and against subjecting void leases of public property to the statute of limitations,we must defer to the legislature determination that the state,like other parties,is bound by the statute of limitations.we shall therefore affirm the judgment barring this suit from unsettling the balance of marin general lease term.
factual and procedural background 
the facts underlying this action are undisputed.
the district,a political subdivision of the state of california,is a local health care district organized and operating under the provisions of the local health care district law health,et.the district owns an acute care hospital facility located in marin county.
the statutory scheme governing local health care districts permits such districts to delegate pursuant to a lease of up to years the responsibility of operating and maintaining a hospital former health,and authorizes them to transfer the assets to a nonprofit corporation to operate and maintain the assets former health,subd.p the legislature stated reason for allowing such transfers was to permit local hospital districts to remain competitive in the ever changing health care environment stats,ch.yoffie marin hospital dist.d.
in or about november,pursuant to those statutory provisions,the district leased the hospital facilities and transferred certain of the district assets used in the operation of the hospital,including cash,accounts receivable,and inventory,to defendant marin general,a nonprofit public benefit corporation.the relevant agreements included a lease agreement and an agreement for transfer of assets collectively,the contracts.marin general has continuously operated the hospital facility since.
at the time the contracts were entered,the district chief executive officer was henry buhrmann.however,while buhrmann was still employed as the district chief executive officer,he became president and chief executive officer of marin general and signed the contracts on behalf of marin general.two of the district directors executed the contracts on the district behalf.moreover,the district legal counsel,quentin cook,became legal counsel to marin general before the contracts were executed.and when marin general later combined to form another health care entity,cook became chief executive officer of that entity.
in november,nearly years after the contracts were signed,the district filed the instant action against marin general and the affiliated defendants,marin community health and sutter health.see fn,ante.the operative first amended complaint alleges that at the time the contracts were entered,buhrmann and cook simultaneous employment by marin general and the district created a prohibited financial interest in those contracts within the meaning of government code section.that statute prohibits state,county,district,and city officers or employees from being financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity,or by any body or board of which they are members.ibid.and because the contracts were purportedly made in violation of government code section,the complaint alleges that the contracts are void under government code section 
the first and second causes of action of the complaint seek a declaration that the contracts are void by virtue of buhrmann or cook alleged financial interest in the contracts and that therefore the district is entitled to recover the assets transferred by the contracts.the district also seeks to impose a constructive trust on all hospital assets the fifth cause of action,to conduct an accounting of the assets transferred under the contracts and their proceeds the sixth cause of action,and to direct defendants to deliver the assets to the district the seventh cause of action 
defendants admitted the existence of a controversy concerning the district claim that the contracts are void,denied any wrongdoing,and alleged that the causes of action based on the purported invalidity of the contracts the first,second,fifth,sixth,and seventh causes of action were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
defendants then brought a motion for summary adjudication with respect to the first,second,fifth,sixth,and seventh causes of action on the grounds that they were barred by all applicable statutes of limitations in support of their motion,defendants argued that the gravamen of the district complaint was a claim that the contracts were void in violation of government code section.as such,they claimed that the suit was an action other than for the recovery of real property within the meaning of code of civil procedure section et and was barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
the district,in turn,moved for summary adjudication of,among other things,defendants affirmative defense of the statute of limitations.relying on the common law principle adopted by the california supreme court in hoadley,supra,cal,the district argued,both in support of its motion and in opposition to defendants motion,that under settled case law,a suit by a governmental entity to recover property from a private party to whom it was illegally or invalidly transferred is never barred by any statute of limitations.
the trial court rejected the district purported application of hoadley and granted defendants motions.in its tentative decision,which was subsequently incorporated into the judgment,the trial court opined in part that the contracts here are fundamentally different from those in the hoadley line of cases.the lease and sale of assets were legitimate contracts.violation of government code section can result in them being declared void.this is not like the hoadley line of cases where the orig i nal transactions had no legitimacy.statutes of limitations do attach to claims seeking to have contracts declared void based on the nature of the claim asserted the issue here then is what limitations period applies to actions brought under government code section.schaef er berinstein d,disapproved on another point in jefferson french cal d,is on point and stands for the proposition that the nature of the underlying right sued on will determine the applicable statute.italics added.
the trial court then concluded that the appropriate statute of limitations for the district claims concerning the validity of the contracts under government code section was the catchall provision of code of civil procedure section,and applying that statute,ruled that the district claims were.
the parties thereafter settled the remaining claims in the complaint and stipulated to entry of judgment incorporating the trial court ruling on the statute of limitations.

ii.the causes of action are subject to the statute of limitations 
the gravamen of the district claims is that the contracts are void as a matter of law because its chief executive officer and counsel each had a financial interest in the contracts in violation of government code section.it is settled that a contract in which a public officer is interested is void,not merely voidable.citations.thomson call cal d,fn.
but the district refrained from filing suit for the first years of its lease.it argues that under the rule confirmed in hoadley,a conveyance of property that was not valid and effective when it was made can be attacked,and the property reclaimed by the public,regardless of how much time has passed.
there are certainly good policy arguments both for and against applying a limitations period to an action to void a lease of public property.on the one hand,t he purpose of statutes of limitations is to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,memories have faded,and witnesses have disappeared.cutujian benedict hills estates th,d,citing order of telegraphers railway exp.agency,accord,wood elling cal d.statutes of limitations also serve many other salutary of which are relevant to this protecting settled expectations giving stability to transactions promoting the value of diligence encouraging the prompt enforcement of substantive law avoiding the retrospective application of contemporary standards and reducing the volume of litigation.board of regents tomanio,d,norgart upjohn cal th,d,gutierrez mofid cal d,ochoa wistrich,the puzzling purposes of statutes of limitation pacific.
on the other hand,courts have noted that cases should be decided on their merits see norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d,and that t he public is not to lose its rights through the negligence of its agents in failing to bring suit promptly.board of education martin cal.
however,as a court,we must defer to the legislature judgment on which of these two policies to adopt.as our supreme court stated in a somewhat similar circumstance,t o establish any particular limitations period under any particular statute of limitations entails the striking of a balance between the two policies.to establish any such period under any such statute belongs to the legislature alone citation,subject only to constitutional constraints citation.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.
as shown below,the legislature has expressly addressed the application of statutes of limitations to actions brought by the state or its agencies.
a.the application of statutes of limitations to a public entity 
the parties agree that the district is a political subdivision of the state.we thus first turn to whether the legislature intended to apply a statute of limitations to a suit by a state entity to void a contract in violation of government code section.
the rule quod nullum tempus occurrit the sovereign is exempt from the consequences of its laches,and from the operation of statutes of to be a vestigial survival of the prerogative of the crown,but is nowadays premised on considerations of public policy.guaranty trust of united states.the true reason is to be found in the great public policy of preserving the public rights,revenues,and property from injury and loss,by the negligence of public officers.ibid.
accordingly,the implied immunity of the domestic sovereign,state or national,has been universally deemed to be an exception to local statutes of limitations where the government,state or national,is not expressly included guaranty trust of united states,supra,at.at.at.
this is the rule in california the rights of the sovereign are not barred by lapse of time unless by legislation the immunity is expressly waived.city of county of cal d.
but sections and of the code of civil procedure expressly waive the state legislative immunity by applying statutes of limitations to various types of actions by the state and its agencies.that it is not the policy of this commonwealth not to be bound by any statute of limitations is made clear by certain enactments which date back to the first session of the state legislature.code civ.the general legislative policy of california is that the state shall be bound by its statute of limitations with respect to the bringing of actions for the enforcement of any and all such rights as may accrue to the state.people osgood,supra.at.
title of part of the code of civil procedure commencing with section addresses general statutes of limitations.section,which is part of chapter of title,reflects the legislature historical preference for limiting the time within which civil actions may be initiated civil actions,without exception,can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title,after the cause of action shall have accrued,unless where,in special cases,a different limitation is prescribed by statute.italics added.chapter of title addresses the time for commencing actions for the recovery of real property et,while chapter et addresses the time for commencing actions other than for the recovery of real property.in both cases,the legislature has expressly subjected the state to the limitations periods.
with respect to actions for the recovery of real property,section provides that t he people of this state will not sue any person for or in respect to any real property,or the issues or profits thereof,by reason of the right or title of the people to the same,unless.such right or title shall have accrued within ten years before any action or other proceeding for the same is commenced the words right or title in this passage are to be construed to mean cause of action.people kings.development cal,accord,people chambers cal d,chambers.
thus,if the present action is deemed to seek the recovery of real property under chapter of title by reason of the right or title of the people to the same,this action,brought by a state entity,would be subject to and as we shall show,barred by the limitations period specified in section.
on the other hand,if this action is deemed other than for the recovery of real property,it comes under chapter of title commencing with section but section expressly waives the state immunity from any of the relevant statutes of limitations in that chapter the limitations prescribed in this chapter apply to actions brought in the name of the state or county or for the benefit of the state or county,in the same manner as to actions by private parties.
accordingly,we next address whether one of the statutes of limitations that the legislature has expressly made applicable to the state applies to the claim here.
determination of the applicable statute of limitations 
to determine the statute of limitations which applies to a cause of action it is necessary to identify the nature of the cause of action,the gravamen of the cause of action.citations.t he nature of the right sued upon and not the form of action nor the relief demanded determines the applicability of the statute of limitations under our code.citation.hensler city of glendale cal th,d,citing leeper beltrami cal d,and maguire hibernia soc.cal d,see also note,developments in the of limitations harv.
put another way,w hat is significant for statute of limitations purposes is the primary interest invaded by defendant wrongful conduct.citation.barton new united motor manufacturing,th,d see day greene cal d,although a complaint may be styled as a breach of contract action,if the gravamen of the claim is fraud,the period prescribed in section governs,rather than the period applicable to contracts witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,if the gravamen of the action is held to be tort,the action,though in form one for breach of contract,is subject to the tort limitation period.
thus,for example,in leeper beltrami,supra,cal d,the california supreme court held that an action to set aside a deed and to quiet title to real property was barred by the limitation period for fraud actions under section,rather than the period under section applicable to the recovery of real property,because the plaintiffs recovery depended upon their right to avoid a contractual obligation,which,in turn,depended upon a finding of duress,a type of fraud.id.at.based on its conclusion that the modern tendency is to look beyond the relief sought,and to view the matter from the basic cause of action giving rise to the plaintiff right to relief id.at,the state supreme court analyzed the case as follows quieting title is the relief granted once a court determines that title belongs in plaintiff.in determining that question,where a contract exists between the parties,the court must first find something wrong with that contract.in other words,in such a case,the plaintiff must show he has a substantive right to relief before he can be granted any relief at all.plaintiff must show a right to rescind before he can be granted the right to quiet his title.id.at.accordingly,the court applied the limitation period for fraud actions to the quiet title action.
here,the gravamen of the district first and second causes of action,seeking to declare the contracts void,is its claim that these agreements are unlawful under government code section,and therefore void under government code section.indeed,the operative complaint styles both the first and second causes of action f or a declaration against all defendants that the contracts were made in violation of government code.while the form of the pleading is not determinative of the issue quintilliani mannerino th,d,none of the allegations in either cause of action hint at another basis for the district claim for relief.and the other causes of action subject to defendants summary adjudication of a constructive trust over the transferred assets,an accounting of the transferred assets,and an injunction to return the transferred fairly described as ancillary to the first two.
thus,the nature of the right sued on here is the public right to be free of a government contract made under the influence of a financial conflict of interest.accordingly,the applicable statute of limitations is the statute applicable to a claim under government code sections and,not a claim for the recovery of real that is the ultimate relief the declaration seeks.
claims under government code section are subject to the limitations periods under chapter 
neither government code sections and,nor the statutory scheme of which they are a part,specifies a limitations period for actions brought to void a contract entered in violation of government code section.
accordingly,the limitations periods under title of part of the code of civil procedure apply commencing with section because section provides that c ivil actions,without exception,can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title unless where,in special cases,a different limitation is prescribed by statute.italics added.
and since the nature of the right sued on here is the public right to be free of a government contract made under the influence of a financial conflict of interest,this is an action other than for the recovery of real property,and is this covered by chapter of title of part of the code of civil procedure commencing with section.and t he limitations prescribed in that chapter apply to actions brought in the name of the state or for the benefit of the state.
however,no case has squarely addressed the applicable statute of limitations for suits to void a contract in violation of government code section,although various decisions have applied statutes of limitations to cases raising a financial conflict of interest under government code section or its predecessor statute.see,people honig th,fn,d applying the limitations period to penal actions under government code section for violations of government code section county of marin messner d,action to recover money paid without authority under predecessor statute to government code section is subject to limitations period for liability created by statute schaefer berinstein d,when gravamen of taxpayer action is fraud against the city based,in part,on violation of government code section,statute applies.
accordingly,as we noted,to determine the applicable statute of limitations,we must look to the nature of the right sued upon and not the relief demanded.hensler city of glendale,supra,cal th at,d.government code section prohibits state,county,district,and city officers or employees from being financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity,or by any body or board of which they are members.and under government code section,e very contract made in violation of any of the provisions of section may be avoided at the instance of any party except the officer interested therein.california courts have generally held that a contract in which a public officer is interested is void,not merely voidable.thomson call,supra,cal d at,fn.moreover,a governmental agency is entitled to recover any consideration which it has paid,without restoring the benefits received under the contract.id.at.the california supreme court has ruled that this remedy results in a substantial forfeiture and provides public officials with a strong incentive to avoid situations scrupulously.id.at.
in this light,the limitations period under section,subdivision,could be argued to apply to the district claims to declare the contracts void and to repossess the transferred assets because it applies to a n action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture,when the action is given to an individual,or to an individual and the state,except when the statute imposing it prescribes a different limitation.a forfeiture is t he divestiture of property without compensation or t he loss of a right,privilege,or property because of a crime,breach of obligation,or neglect of duty.black law dict.ed.government code section,which voids contracts in which a state employee has a financial conflict of interest without regard to the restoration of benefits,certainly would appear to effect a forfeiture.
however,we need not decide whether section,subdivision,applies in this case.even if an action under government code section is not deemed a claim based on a statute for a forfeiture,the district causes of years after it entered the purportedly void be under the limitations period under the catchall provision of section.section,which is also part of chapter which applies to all actions brought by the state,provides an action for relief not hereinbefore provided for must be commenced within four years after the cause of action shall have accrued.
as the california supreme court long ago explained,t he legislature has specified the limitations applicable to a wide variety of actions,and then to rebut the possible inference that actions not therein specifically described are to be regarded as exempt from limitations,it has specified a limitation upon an action for relief not hereinbefore provided for and where it has intended that an action shall be exempt from limitations it has said so in clear and unmistakable language.citations.moss moss cal d,quoting bogart george porter cal.
applying section to this action to void the contracts on the ground of illegality would certainly be consistent with existing case authority,moss moss,supra,cal d at,holding that cause of action for cancellation of an agreement is governed by section,in part because there is no section of the code that expressly limits the time within which an action must be brought for cancellation of an instrument because of its illegality zakaessian zakaessian d,o rdinarily a suit to set aside and cancel a void instrument is governed by section of the code of civil procedure unless,for example the gravamen of the cause of action stated involves fraud or a mistake see also piller southern pac.cal,the four years limitation of section applies to all suits in equity not strictly of concurrent cognizance in law and equity dunn county of los angeles d,action to set aside deed on the ground of coercion is governed by section.
in any event,we reject the district contention that the gravamen of its causes of action is possession of real property or ejectment.first,possession of real property is the ultimate relief sought following a declaration to that effect,not the nature of the right sued upon,which controls the selection of the statute of limitations.see leeper beltrami,supra,cal d at.instead,the district right to recover the hospital facility from defendants depends wholly upon its establishing that buhrmann and cook were financially interested in the contracts so as to render those agreements void under government code section.second,only one of the two contracts that the district seeks to void pertains to real property.the agreement for transfer of assets can not be founded on a claim to recover real property therefore,this portion of the claim must surely be premised on chapter of title of part of the code of civil procedure addressing actions other than for the recovery of real property.
nor does the fact that the contracts are claimed void avoid the statute of limitations.actions to void contracts are nonetheless subject to the statute of limitations,smith bach,witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions.
finally,even if the gravamen of the district causes of action was deemed to be for the recovery of real property under chapter of title commencing with section,the district action would be barred because it would be subject to the limitations period under section for actions by the people of this state in respect to any real property by reason of the right or title of the people to the same.
accrual of the district causes of action 
as a general rule,a statute of limitations accrues when the act occurs which gives rise to the claim myers eastwood care center,cal d,that is,when the plaintiff sustains actual and appreciable harm.citation.any manifest and palpable injury will commence the statutory period.citation.garver brace th,d.
assuming for the sake of argument that the agreements were made in violation of government code section,the district sustained a manifest and palpable injury no later than november.that is when it entered a contract influenced by a financial conflict of harm the statute seeks to avoid.
after all,government code section codified the common law prohibition of public officials having a financial interest in contracts they make in their official capacities.breakzone billiards city of torrance th,d.because it is recognized that an impairment of impartial judgment can occur in even the most men when their personal economic interests are affected by the business they transact on behalf of the government citations,the objective of the conflict of interest statutes is to remove or limit the possibility of any personal influence,either directly or indirectly which might bear on an official decision citations.people honig,supra,th at,d.accordingly,government code section has been interpreted to prohibit a financially interested employee from participating in the planning,preliminary discussion,compromises,drawing of plans and specifications and solicitation of bids that lead up to the formal making of the contract.people honig,supra,th at,d,citing stigall city of taft cal d,see also thomson call,supra,cal d at.
based on the limited record before us,it is undisputed that buhrmann and cook worked simultaneously for the district and marin general before the contracts were executed in november.hence,the harm that government code section seeks to avoid arose no later than november when the contracts were executed.accordingly,the district causes of action to declare the contracts void under government code section accrued no later than november.and the district makes no allegation that the commencement of the running of the statute of limitations should be tolled,only that its action is exempt from the otherwise applicable statute of limitations.thus,unless the hoadley doctrine exempts this action from the statute of limitations,defendants have successfully established that this action,filed in years untimely under either section,section,subdivision,or section.
iii.the district has not established that its action is exempt from the statute of limitations 
the district opposition to defendants motion for summary adjudication rests wholly upon its insistence that under the rule confirmed in hoadley a conveyance of property that was not valid and effective when it was made can be attacked,and the property reclaimed by the public,regardless of how much time has passed.
as we shall explain,hoadley does not stand for such a broad proposition.no published case has applied the holding of hoadley,or its reasoning,to an action to set aside contracts allegedly made in violation of government code section.
in hoadley,the plaintiff sued the city of san francisco to quiet title to two parcels of land,located in an area dedicated for use as city squares.he claimed that he had acquired title by virtue of an ordinance and a confirmatory act,and by adverse possession.hoadley,supra,cal.at.
after holding that the plaintiff did not acquire title to the public squares pursuant to the ordinance or the confirmatory act hoadley,supra,cal.at,the court in hoadley considered whether the city was barred by the applicable statute of limitations from opposing the plaintiff claim of adverse possession.first,the court ruled that adverse possession could not extinguish a public use to which the land had been dedicated the statute of limitations was not intended as a bar to the assertion by the public of rights of that character.id.at.next,it ruled that the city legal title could not be extinguished by adverse possession that is to say,the title was granted to the city in trust,for public use and the city had no authority to alienate or in any manner dispose of it,but only to hold it for the purposes expressed in the statute.it was granted to the city for public use,and is held for that purpose only.it can not be conveyed to private persons,and is effectually withdrawn from commerce and the city having no authority to convey the title,private persons are virtually precluded from acquiring it.the land itself,and not the use only,was dedicated to the public.land held for that purpose,whether held by the state or a municipality,in our opinion,is not subject to the operation of the statute of limitations.id.at.
thus,hoadley holding was premised on the governmental entity lack of authority to alienate property held for public use hoadley,supra,cal.at and the presumably concomitant inability of a private person to acquire it indirectly through the failure of the government to timely bring suit within the statute of unlike the instant case where the district had statutory authority to enter into a lease.
this is made more clear by hoadley reliance on the reasoning in commonwealth alburger whart,wl commonwealth,among other cases,in coming to its conclusion.hoadley,supra,cal.at.in commonwealth,the supreme court of pennsylvania held that william penn son had no authority to sell a portion of a public square in philadelphia dedicated to public use by his father.in holding that the defendants were not protected by the lapse of time commonwealth,at,the supreme court of pennsylvania opined it is well settled that lapse of time furnishes no defense for an encroachment on a public right such as the erecting of an obstruction on a street or public square these principles are of universal application,and control the present case as well as others.there is no room for presumption since the grant itself is shown and proves defective and if there were no grant shown,presumption will not be made to support a nuisance,by encroachment on a public right and no statute of limitations bars the proceeding by indictment to abate it.these principles,indeed,pervade the laws of the most enlightened nations as well as our own code,and are essential to the protection of public rights,which would be gradually frittered away,if the want of complaint or prosecution gave the party a right.individuals may reasonably be held to a limited period to enforce their right against adverse occupants,because they have interest sufficient to make them vigilant.but in public rights of property,each individual feels but a slight interest,and rather tolerates even a manifest encroachment,than seeks a dispute to set it right citation.id.at.
accordingly,based on this analysis,it is clear that hoadley held that property that can not be alienated directly should not be alienated indirectly to an adverse possessor through the passage of time.
indeed,hoadley holding that the statute of limitations does not bar the state recovery of property against a claim of adverse possession is simply the mirror image of the rule that a private party can not acquire prescriptive title to property through adverse possession s o far as the title to real property is and limitation are convertible terms and a plea of the proper statute of limitations is a good plea of a prescriptive right.alhambra addition water richardson cal,see people shirokow,supra,cal d at.thus,hoadley s holding that property held by the state in trust can not be lost through adverse possession is not so much a rule concerning the application of the statute of limitations as it is a substantive doctrine that a private party can not acquire prescriptive title to public rights founded on adverse possession.indeed,civil code section was amended in to codify this by prohibiting the acquisition of title by adverse possession of any property,no matter how long the property is occupied.stats,ch.hence,a statute now defines in more direct terms the common law exception that hoadley established.
we thus face the question whether hoadley should be extended beyond its codification to exempt any conveyance of property from the statute of limitations,in the face of other statutory enactments that expressly apply limitations to actions brought by the state.
a.the adverse possession cases 
hoadley has most commonly been cited as authority to bar an adverse possessor of property from asserting the statute of limitations against the government action to recover the property,board of education martin,supra,cal,the california supreme court relied upon hoadley to hold that no statute of limitations bars an educational district from recovering lands taken by adverse possession people kerber cal,the statute of limitations does not apply to an action by the state to recover a portion of san diego bay tidelands purportedly acquired by adverse possession because tidelands belong to the state by virtue of its sovereignty and constitute property devoted to public use,of which private persons can not obtain title by prescription,founded upon adverse occupancy for the period prescribed by the statute of limitations county of yolo barney cal,no statute of limitations restricted ability of hospital district to quiet title to property claimed by adverse possession san leandro le breton cal,no statute of limitations bars city from recovering land marked for public use against a claim of adverse possession,disapproved on another ground in people reed cal,visalia jacob cal,no statute of limitations bars city from recovering a portion of a city street taken by adverse possession proctor city county of san francisco cir,it is settled by a series of decisions by the supreme court that the rights of municipal corporations in such property are not affected by adverse possession,however long continued see witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions,there can be no adverse possession of property devoted to a public use.
more recently,in people shirokow,supra,cal d,the california supreme court characterized hoadley in conformity with these cases as holding that property held in public trust can not be lost through adverse possession more than a century ago,in hoadley,supra,cal.at pp,we articulated the rule that property held by the state in trust for the people can not be lost through adverse possession.the statute of limitations is of no effect in an action by the state to recover such property from an adverse possessor whose use of the property for private purposes is not consistent with the public use.citation.people shirokow,supra,cal d at.
accordingly,hoadley has no application to the circumstances presented here for several reasons.
first,the instant case does not involve the application of the statute of limitations to a claim of adverse possession of public property.
second,hoadley premise is that the passage of time can not grant title to that which the government has no authority to alienate.here,the district had authority to enter into a lease of the hospital.the issue in this case is not whether the public property could be leased,but whether it was leased in conformity with the law.for this reason,too,hoadley does not apply.
indeed,the california supreme court in ames city of san diego cal,distinguished hoadley on precisely this ground i n case of lands,the legal title to which is vested in the city,and which may be alienated by it,the rule just stated in hoadley in relation to land dedicated to the public use does not apply.id.at.
finally,hoadley surely does not apply to that part of the district claim that concerns property that could never be the subject of adverse possession,namely,the assets including the cash,inventory,and accounts receivable which were transferred under the contracts.
b.the unauthorized transfer cases 
the district observes,however,that the supreme court disposed of any notion that the hoadley rule was restricted to situations where property had merely been seized and held by a private individual on a claim of adverse possession,since it has also been cited to defeat the application of the statute of limitations in actions for the recovery of property that has been voluntarily transferred.
but a careful reading of the cases upon which the district relies demonstrates that they do not support its assertion that the hoadley rule bars the application of the statute of limitations to any invalid,illegal,or ineffective transfer of a asset,regardless of the particular legal defect that rendered the original transfer invalid.instead,these cases only extend hoadley to bar the assertion of the statute of limitations with respect to the recovery of property that the government had no authority to alienate.
