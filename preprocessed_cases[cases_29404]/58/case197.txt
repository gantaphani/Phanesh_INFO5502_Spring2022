this appeal addresses whether cotenancy provisions in a lease for retail space in a shopping center are unconscionable or unreasonable penalties and,thus,not binding on the landlord.the enforceability of cotenancy provisions has not been discussed in an opinion published by a california appellate court.this opinion does not establish a categorical rule of law holding cotenancy provisions always,or never,are enforceable.instead,it illustrates that the determination whether a cotenancy provision is unconscionable or an unreasonable penalty depends heavily on the facts proven in a particular case.here,the facts show the provisions were not unconscionable and only the rent abatement provision operated as an unreasonable penalty.
grand prospect partners,grand prospect,the owner and operator of the porterville marketplace shopping center,filed this action to challenge the enforceability of provisions in its commercial lease with ross dress for less,ross.the provisions conditioned ross obligation to open a store and pay rent on mervyn operating a store in the shopping center on the commencement date of the lease,and also granted ross the option to terminate the lease if mervyn ceased operations and was not replaced by an acceptable retailer within months.
the opening cotenancy condition was not satisfied because mervyn filed for bankruptcy and closed its store in.as authorized by the lease,ross took possession of the space,never opened for business,never paid rent,and terminated the lease after the month cure period expired.
grand prospect claims ross was obligated to pay rent for the full year term of the lease because the provisions authorizing rent abatement and termination were unconscionable or,alternatively,an unreasonable penalty and thus unenforceable.the trial court agreed with both theories,found ross had breached the lease by failing to pay rent and terminating the lease,and directed the jury to determine the amount of damages resulting from each breach.the jury awarded for unpaid rent and approximately million in other damages caused by the termination.
ross appealed,contending the cotenancy provisions in the lease were not procedurally and substantively unconscionable and were not an unreasonable penalty.
as to unconscionability,which requires proof of both procedural and substantive unconscionability,we conclude the evidence establishes there was no procedural unconscionability.the parties were sophisticated and experienced in the negotiation of commercial leases for retail space,their negotiations involved several drafts of the letter of intent and subsequent lease,and grand prospect decision to approach ross first about renting the space was a free and unpressured choice.ross insistency on cotenancy provisions during negotiations did not make the lease a contract of adhesion or otherwise deprive grand prospect of a meaningful choice.
as to unreasonable penalties,the rent abatement and termination provisions must be examined separately because they involve separate consequences triggered by different albeit partially overlapping conditions.as a general rule,a contractual provision is an unenforceable penalty under california law if the value of the property forfeited under the provision bears no reasonable relationship to the range of harm anticipated to be caused if the provision is not satisfied.
here,the trial court determination that the rent abatement provision constituted an unreasonable penalty is supported by its findings of fact that ross did not anticipate it would suffer any damages from mervyn not being open on the lease commencement date and the value of rent forfeited under the provision was approximately per month.there is no reasonable relationship between of anticipated harm and the forfeiture of in rent per month and,therefore,the trial court correctly concluded the rent abatement provision was an unenforceable penalty.
as to the lease termination provision,california courts have adopted a specific rule that holds no forfeiture results from terminating a commercial lease based upon the occurrence of contingencies that are agreed upon by sophisticated parties and have no relation to any act or default of the parties.these facts are present in this case and,therefore,the rule compels the conclusion that the termination provision did not constitute a forfeiture.because no forfeiture occurred as a result of the termination,the termination provision did not create an unreasonable penalty.
we therefore modify the judgment to award damages only for unpaid rent.
the parties 
ross is the nation largest retailer of apparel and home fashion.the trial court found ross had more than stores in california and more than stores nationwide.in,ross annual sales totaled more than billion.
grand prospect is a california limited partnership.its sole asset is a shopping center named the porterville marketplace,located in porterville,california.
grand prospect is managed by david paynter,its sole general partner.paynter received a bachelor degree in business administration,majoring in finance.at the time of trial,he had over years of experience in real estate.in,paynter formed his current company,paynter realty and investments,which is based in tustin,california.paynter realty and investments is involved in both development of shopping centers and managing those properties.paynter testified that he had been partners in developing over shopping centers and that paynter realty and investments currently owned and operated seven shopping centers.two of those shopping centers clovis and visalia leased space to ross.
grand prospect sole limited partner is john marshall,who is a percent owner.marshall is a commercial real estate broker who received a college degree in business administration in.marshall started working in real estate in,moved exclusively to commercial real estate in,and started his own real estate company in.his company specialized in selling and leasing shopping centers.marshall met paynter in when the both were working on a shopping center project in turlock.marshall was familiar with ross,having acted as its broker in numerous lease transactions between and.
the negotiations 
in,a former grocery store building became available at the porterville marketplace and marshall contacted ross to see if ross would be interested in the location.in october,marshall acting as grand prospect broker showed mike seiler of ross the site and several other locations in porterville.seiler worked with marshall to prepare a letter of intent,which was similar to the one used for a store in a clovis shopping center managed by paynter.seiler,not marshall,was responsible for the letter contents.after making changes,seiler emailed the letter of intent to marshall and directed him to forward it to paynter.
the first version of the letter of intent presented to paynter was dated october,set the initial term of the lease at years with minimum rent for the first five years at per square foot with an increase to for the second five years.the letter of intent provided four renewal options,each with a increase in rent.the letter of intent also contained cotenancy provisions that required,at commencement and throughout the full term of the lease,percent of the leasable floor area in the center be occupied by retail tenants,including target and mervyn occupying and square feet,respectively.
the negotiations of the letter of intent were delayed when paynter learned target was considering moving out of the shopping center.eventually,target decided to stay in porterville marketplace and expand its store.as a result,paynter delivered his revisions to the letter of intent to ross in the spring of.
after further negotiations,the final letter of intent,dated july,was signed by the parties.the minimum rent was for the first years and for the first option period with increases for each of the three remaining option periods.the calculation of the percent occupancy requirement stated that it would exclude ross and target as to the commencement date to be further negotiated in the lease,from the numerator and denominator target was required to occupy square feet on the commencement date and during the term of the lease mervyn square feet.
with the nonbinding letter of intent in place,the parties began negotiating the lease for square feet of space in the porterville marketplace.
on april,the lease for a ross store at porterville marketplace was executed on behalf of ross by james fassio,executive vice president,and gregg mcgillis,group vice president of real estate the lease.four days later,paynter signed the lease on behalf of grand prospect.
the terms of the lease cotenancy provisions required mervyn to be operating its business in square feet on the commencement date of the lease other aspects of the cotenancy provisions are described in part,post.
actions under the lease 
in early july,grand prospect notified ross the construction work on the store had been completed and ross,if it chose,could take delivery early jack toth,then ross director of real estate responsible for the san joaquin valley,responded with an email stating ross intended to take delivery on february,as stated in the lease.
in late july,mervyn filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy law.in october,the bankruptcy case was converted to a liquidation under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the mervyn store in the porterville marketplace closed on december.
in october,paynter became aware that mervyn was going to close its stores and,as a result,grand prospect could not meet the opening cotenancy requirement in lease.paynter contacted toth and told him about mervyn liquidation.on october,toth sent paynter an email asserting we negotiated hard for the mervyn because it makes a huge difference to us financially.without mervyn,we will open very soft and it will take much longer for ross to get established in porterville.toth made two proposals for amending the lease.under the first,ross would pay two percent of sales as rent and,once a suitable replacement tenant was found,would go back to full rent.under the second proposal,the requirement for mervyn as a cotenant would be eliminated and ross would pay a fixed rent of per square foot for the initial term versus.
the parties were unable to negotiate a modification of the lease.on february,ross advised grand prospect that it accepted delivery of the store as the lease required,subject to all its rights under the lease,including the required co tenancy provisions of section.the february,delivery date meant that the commencement date of the lease was may,
on may,neither mervyn nor a replacement anchor tenant was open for business in the porterville marketplace.relying on the cotenancy provisions in the lease,ross opted not open a store or pay rent.
in january,grand prospect notified ross that it had entered into a lease with kohl department stores to occupy square feet of the mervyn square feet space.ross regarded kohl as an acceptable replacement for mervyn,but concluded the lease between grand prospect and kohl did not cure the cotenancy failure because kohl had not leased the required square feet and kohl was not scheduled to open within the month cure period.
on january,ross advised grand prospect that it would terminate the lease days after the expiration of the month period.
in may,one year after the commencement date,ross provided grand prospect with formal notice that it was terminating the lease because the reduced occupancy had remained in effect for consecutive months.
grand prospect leased the ross space to famous footwear square feet and marshalls of california,llc square feet in.these businesses opened and began paying rent in july and march of,respectively.these leases also contained cotenancy requirements.
proceedings 
in april,before ross terminated the lease,grand prospect filed a complaint against ross for declaratory relief,breach of contract and unjust enrichment.grand prospect requested a judicial declaration that the cotenancy provisions were unenforceable and money damages for unpaid rent,future rent and expenditures on tenant improvements.
in june,ross filed a against grand prospect,seeking a judicial declaration of the parties rights and duties under the lease.
in november,a jury trial began.on the day of the jury trial,december,the trial court issued an oral ruling on the issues that had been reserved for the court.it determined the cotenancy provisions were unconscionable and were an unenforceable penalty and struck those provisions from the lease.by striking the cotenancy provisions from the lease,the court found that ross had breached the lease by failing to pay rent and terminating the lease.the court rejected grand prospect cause of action for unjust enrichment.
the jury was then instructed on two issues related to damages.first,the jury was directed to determine the amount that would reasonably compensate grand prospect for ross failure to pay rent and its termination of the lease.second,the jury was directed to determine the amount of damages,if any,grand prospect could have avoided with reasonable efforts and expenditures.
the special verdict form submitted to the jury required findings as to four items of damages.the first item addressed the worth of the unpaid rent that had been earned at the time of termination.the jury found this amount was.the jury findings on the three other damage items,relating to the termination of the lease,brought grand prospect total damages to.
after the trial court decided grand prospect contested motion for attorney fees and denied ross motion for a new trial,it entered an amended judgment of in favor of grand prospect,which included an award of approximately in attorney fees and costs.
ross timely appealed.
discussion 
cotenancy provisionsa.overview 
cotenancy requirements are included in retail leases for the benefit of the tenant.they generally require other stores in the shopping center to be occupied by operating businesses.retail leasing,supra.their purpose is to assure the tenant that there is a critical mass of key tenants or occupants as well as a sufficient population of other retailers that have opened for business or will concurrently open when the tenant is required or intends to open,and there is a satisfactory level of occupancy by these tenants or occupants during the term of the lease after the tenant has opened.retail leasing,supra.cotenancy provisions usually are found only in retail leases.ibid.
cotenancy provisions can be categorized as opening cotenancy requirements and operating cotenancy requirements.retail leasing,supra.opening cotenancy requirements condition the tenant obligation to open for business or commence paying minimum rent on satisfaction of the cotenancy requirement.ibid.operating cotenancy requirements condition the tenant obligation to either continue to conduct business or to continue to pay minimum rent on the active operation of certain named tenants a predetermined level of occupancy within the shopping center.ibid.
the major points covered by cotenancy provisions are the specific named cotenants and level of occupancy required,any right the landlord has to cure failures to meet a cotenancy requirement,and the tenant remedies if a cotenancy failure occurs.retail leasing,supra,at.these three major points can be resolved by the landlord and tenant in many different ways.consequently,there is no standard form of cotenancy requirements.see id.at,to two forms of opening cotenancy requirements,with three alternatives in the second form miller starr,cal.real estate forms ed,cotenancy requirements addressed in section of sample retail lease for space in large shopping center under construction.
variation in cotenancy requirements may occur because a particular tenant business concerns about other tenants might be more complex than simply avoiding vacancies.for instance,a national greeting card chain might be more concerned that the center supermarket continues in business than the center other stores because it has ascertained its stores perform better in shopping centers anchored by a supermarket.retail leasing,supra.as to the tenant remedies on the failure of the opening cotenancy requirement,they might include the right to delay the opening of the tenant store,payment of alternative rent,termination of the lease,or a combination of these remedies.id.at,to.further variation can occur if a landlord seeks to impose conditions on the tenant exercise of these remedies.id.at.conditions may include the absence of a tenant default in the lease and,in the case of rent abatement,the tenant continued operation of its business on the premises.ibid.finally,how these various points are resolved during the negotiation of a commercial lease varies greatly depending on the relative bargaining strengths of the landlord and the tenant.id.at.
the variation in cotenancy requirements,and the remedies given to a tenant when the requirements are not met,prevents the application of a categorical rule of law regarding enforceability.for instance,there is no general principle of california law holding cotenancy provisions in a commercial retail lease can never be unconscionable.similarly,there is no categorical rule holding cotenancy provisions are unreasonable per se and therefore unenforceable penalties.instead,the validity of a cotenancy provision depends upon the facts and circumstances proven in a particular case.
cotenancy requirements in the lease 
the cotenancy requirements in the lease are set forth in sections,and.the provisions relevant to this appeal concern mervyn absence from the shopping center on the commencement date and the continuation of this vacancy for months.as a result of these events,ross paid no rent and,as soon as allowed,exercised an option to terminate the lease.
commencement date cotenancy requirements 
section of the lease required mervyn and target to occupy no less than and square feet of leasable floor area,respectively,on ross commencement date.in addition,section required percent of the leasable floor area to the shopping center to be occupied by operating retailers 
commencement date reduced occupancy period 
section b of the lease defined a commencement date reduced occupancy period as beginning with the failure of one of the required tenants to be open for business on the commencement date of the lease and continuing until cured.because mervyn had closed its store,a commencement date reduced occupancy period began.as a result,section b provided that ross was not required to open its store for business.that section also stated that,regardless of whether ross opens for business in the store,no rent shall be due or payable whatsoever until and unless the commencement date reduced occupancy period is cured.for purposes of this opinion,this term of the lease is referred to as the rent abatement provision 
section b also provided ross with an option to terminate the lease conditioned upon the commencement date reduced occupancy period continuing for months and ross giving days notice of termination prior to the expiration of the commencement date reduced occupancy period.section b reference to months did not limit the free rent to the first months of the lease and did not limit the cure period to those months.rather,the month period identifies when ross accrued an option to terminate the lease.
ii.unconscionability 
fundamental principles 
unconscionability is a defense to the enforcement of an entire contract or particular contractual provisions,subd.a.unconscionability does not have a precise legal definition,but has been described as extreme unfairness.black law dictionary ed.see a m produce fmc d,no precise definition of substantive unconscionability can be proffered a m produce.
the unconscionability defense to the enforcement of a contract was codified in civil code section in.beasley wells fargo bank d,see stats,ch.the statute did not create new law,but simply codified the existing common law.beasley wells fargo bank,supra,at.civil code section provides in full 
a if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
b when it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting,purpose,and effect to aid the court in making the determination.
some of the common law principles of unconscionability were set forth by judge skelly wright in his formulation of the doctrine 
unconscionability has generally been recognized to include an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.williams walker thomas furniture.
the first california court to quote this formulation was the fourth appellate district.a m produce,supra,d at.judge wright formulation has been repeated by our supreme court and the ninth circuit of the united states court of appeal.sonic calabasas a,moreno cal th,ingle circuit city stores,cir,arbitration agreement signed by employee as part of job application was unconscionable under california contract law.the formulation contains both a procedural and a substantive element.pinnacle museum toward pinnacle market development us,llc cal th,pinnacle leff,unconscionability and the code the emperor new clause.seminal article discussing procedural and substantive elements of unconscionability.
the procedural element addresses the circumstances of contract negotiation and formation,focusing on oppression and surprise due to unequal bargaining power.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.
in contrast,the substantive element is concerned with the fairness of the agreement actual terms and assesses whether they are overly harsh or.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.thus,substantive unconscionability is described by the phrases unduly oppressive,so as to shock the conscience,and unreasonably favorable to the more powerful party.sonic calabasas a,moreno,supra,cal th at.
burden and sliding scale 
the party challenging the validity of a contract or a contractual provision bears the burden of proving unconscionability.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.california is among the jurisdictions requiring both elements be shown.maxwell fidelity financial services,unconscionability can be established by a showing of substantive unconscionability alone.the evidence presented must show the circumstances that existed at the time the contract was made because the determination of unconscionability is not based on hindsight in light of subsequent events,subd.a sonic calabasas a,moreno,supra,cal th at.
the elements of procedural and substantive unconscionability need not be present to the same degree because they are evaluated on a sliding scale.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz.consequently,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to conclude the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.ibid.
procedural unconscionability 
the oppression that creates procedural unconscionability arises from an inequality of bargaining power that results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.aron u haul of california th,see pinnacle,supra,cal th at.
in general,california law allows oppression to be established in two ways.first,and most frequently,oppression may be established by showing the contract is one of adhesion.mccaffrey,supra,th at oppression generally entails a contract of adhesion see pinnacle,supra,cal th at procedural unconscionability generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion.the principles that define a contract of adhesion are discussed and applied in part.of the discussion,post.
in the absence of an adhesion contract,the oppression aspect of procedural unconscionability can be established by the totality of the circumstances surrounding the negotiation and formation of the contract.sonic calabasas a,moreno,supra,cal th at.the circumstances relevant to establishing oppression include,but are not limited to the amount of time the party is given to consider the proposed contract the amount and type of pressure exerted on the party to sign the proposed contract the length of the proposed contract and the length and complexity of the challenged provision the education and experience of the party and whether the party review of the proposed contract was aided by an attorney.see ajamian,th,dimatteo rich,a consent theory of unconscionability an empirical study of law in action,the distinction described as a in unconscionability cases as relatively few merchant unconscionability claims are upheld presence of an attorney in precontract negotiations diminishes the likelihood a contract will be held unconscionable.
in ohio,another jurisdiction that examines both procedural and substantive unconscionability,an appellate court stated procedural unconscionability involves those factors bearing on the relative bargaining position of the contracting parties,age,education,intelligence,business acumen and experience,relative bargaining power,who drafted the contract,whether the terms were explained to the weaker party,whether alterations in the printed terms were possible,whether there were alternative sources of supply for the goods in question.collins click camera and video,ohio app d.
to summarize,courts evaluating procedural unconscionability must consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the negotiation and formation of the contract,giving particular consideration to factors that affect the presence of oppression or the absence of a meaningful choice.
substantive unconscionability 
substantive unconscionability is not susceptible to precise definition.sonic calabasas a,moreno,supra,cal th at.it appears the various descriptions unduly oppressive,overly harsh,so as to shock the conscience,and unreasonably favorable to the more powerful party all reflect the same standard.id.at.substantive unconscionability is not concerned with a simple bad bargain.ibid.
factors courts have considered in evaluating whether a contract is substantively unconscionable include the fairness of the terms,the charge for the service rendered,the standard in the industry,and the ability to accurately predict the extent of future liability.hayes oakridge home ohio.
standard of review 
the legal principles that define the doctrine of unconscionability demonstrate that numerous factors are relevant to determining whether a contract or a particular provision is unconscionable.despite the numerous factual issues that may bear on the question,unconscionability is ultimately a question of law for the court.mccaffrey,supra,th at.where the trial court determination of unconscionability turned on the resolution of conflicts in the evidence or on factual inferences to be drawn from the evidence,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court determination and review the trial court factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.ibid.when some facts of a case are determined under the foregoing rule and other facts are undisputed because there are no material conflicts in the evidence,appellate courts conduct a de novo review of those facts and makes its own unconscionability determination.ibid.
our application of the de novo standard of review is illustrated by crippen central valley rv outlet,th,a case in which we concluded the plaintiff had failed to prove procedural unconscionability and reversed the trial court determination that the arbitration agreement in question was unenforceable.
contract of adhesion 
the lease as a whole 
grand prospect contends the lease was a contract of adhesion.ross argues that its unwillingness to sign a lease without the protection of cotenancy clauses can not transform a heavily negotiated lease between sophisticated parties into a contract of adhesion.ross also contends there is no case law supporting the position that procedural unconscionability exists merely because a party viewed one of many points under discussion as critical to reaching a deal,while willingly negotiating numerous other material terms,including price.
the california supreme court has defined the term contract of adhesion to mean a standardized contract imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength that provides the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.armendariz,supra,cal th at von nothdurft steck th.
we conclude the undisputed facts of this case establish the lease was not a contract of adhesion.first,it was not a standardized,preprinted form.see von nothdurft steck,supra,th at management agreement was not a preprinted form contract.
second,and more importantly,grand prospect was given the opportunity to negotiate the terms of the lease.to reach an agreement acceptable to both sides,the parties went through multiple drafts of a letter of intent and five versions of the lease.furthermore,the lease was based on the earlier clovis lease,which was the product of negotiations between paynter and ross attorney theani louskos.she also represented ross in finalizing the grand prospect lease.the facts establish that grand prospect choices were not limited to rejecting or adhering to the draft of the lease first presented by ross.
therefore,the lease itself does not fit the definition of a contract of adhesion.
clause of adhesion 
a question presented by the facts of this case is whether the lease should be classified as a contract of adhesion because the cotenancy requirements were presented by ross on a basis.we conclude this aspect of ross negotiating posture did not make the lease a contract of adhesion.
in szetela discover bank th,the court used language that suggests a clause might qualify as a contract of adhesion when it stated,even if the clause at issue here is not an adhesion contract,it can still be found unconscionable.id.at.in szetela,a credit card company inserted a notice in its customer billing statement that stated the cardmember agreement was being amended to include an arbitration clause.id.at.if the customer did not wish to accept the terms of the amendment,the only option was to notify the credit card company,which would then close the account.id.at.when the customer challenged the arbitration clause as unconscionable,the court analyzed the process by which that clause was added to the contract,not the formation of the original contract.the court stated 
procedural unconscionability focuses on the manner in which the disputed clause is presented to the party in the weaker bargaining position.when the weaker party is presented the clause and told to take it or leave it without the opportunity for meaningful negotiation,oppression,and therefore procedural unconscionability,are present.citation.these are precisely the facts in the case before us.szetela received the amendment to the cardholder agreement in a bill stuffer,and under the language of the amendment,he was told to take it or leave it.his only option,if he did not wish to accept the amendment,was to close his account.we agree with szetela that the oppressive nature in which the amendment was imposed establishes the necessary element of procedural unconscionability.id.at.
szetela does not establish that the inclusion of a clause in an agreement makes the entire contract one of adhesion.instead,it establishes that when a clause is added to a contract by an amendment,the inquiry into procedural unconscionability is concerned with the circumstance surrounding the negotiation and formation of the amendment,not the original contract.where the amendment contains a single clause,that clause or the amendment can be described accurately as a contract of adhesion.it does not follow,however,that the inclusion of a clause in a negotiated agreement turns the entire agreement into a contract of adhesion.
in summary,we do not interpret szetela to mean that when the relatively stronger party insists on including a particular provision in a contract,the entire contract becomes a contract of adhesion.therefore,the lease was not a contract of adhesion by virtue of ross insisting that it contain cotenancy provisions.
general circumstances relevant to procedural unconscionability 
sophistication 
the circumstances relevant to procedural unconscionability include age,education,intelligence,business acumen and experience.paynter received a bachelor degree in business administration.at the time of trial,he had over years of experience in real estate.in,paynter and an attorney left a development company and formed their own company to develop shopping centers.in,the attorney returned to the practice of law and paynter formed his current company,paynter realty and investments,which is based in tustin.paynter realty and investments is involved in both development of shopping centers and managing those properties.its management fee is typically three to four percent of the rent collected.paynter testified that he had been partners in developing over shopping centers and that paynter realty and investments currently owned and operated seven shopping centers.paynter limited partner,john marshall,was equally experienced,and had earlier acted as ross broker in numerous lease transactions.
paynter age,education,intelligence,business acumen and experience are not among the factors that support a finding of procedural unconscionability.the record shows paynter was,very experienced in developing and managing shopping centers,and successful in that business.in short,paynter was sophisticated and these factors did not place him at a disadvantage in bargaining with ross.
paynter sophistication means that his decision not to seek the advice of an attorney to assist him in the negotiations with the attorney representing ross was not significant.from earlier business dealings with ross,paynter and marshall were familiar with the terms ross wanted in the lease and they understood the cotenancy terms without an explanation of those terms from a lawyer.
time pressure 
the trial court did not find,and it does not appear from the evidence in the record,that ross exerted time pressure on paynter and,as a result,prevented him from fully understanding how the cotenancy provisions would operate.cotenancy provisions were in the first letter of intent presented by marshall to paynter in and the lease was not signed until april.ross did not impose deadlines during the negotiations for the purpose of pressuring paynter into making a quick,decision that would have been more favorable to ross than it could have obtained without any time pressure.therefore,time pressure is not a factor that supports a finding of procedural unconscionability.
economic pressure 
the record does not contain evidence showing grand prospect was economically vulnerable and this vulnerability was exploited by ross during the negotiations.for example,there is no evidence that grand prospect was having difficulty servicing its debt or that a balloon payment on a loan was coming due and,therefore,grand prospect was willing to accept onerous terms in order to begin receiving rent from the space.the only economic pressure apparent in this case is the same pressure that every commercial landlord experiences when a space is vacant and not generating rent.
pressure from coercion or threats 
the record contains no evidence that ross used coercion or threats while negotiating the lease.for example,ross did not threaten paynter by saying that,if he did not agree to the lease and its cotenancy requirements,breaches would be found in ross other leases with him and payment of rent under those leases would be stopped.
relative bargaining power 
ross had an advantage in bargaining power because it was the larger company in terms of financial resources and personnel.also,at the time the lease was being negotiated,ross was negotiating leases at many other locations.the fact that ross was opening stores at other locations made the opening of a store in porterville less important to ross than it was to grand prospect.
the fact that ross had more bargaining power than grand prospect does not mean that inequality in power resulted in no real negotiations and an absence of a meaningful choice for grand prospect.see aron u haul of california,supra,th at.here,the parties negotiated before the letter of intent was signed and negotiated further before the lease was signed.one of the points subject to further negotiation was the specific terms of the cotenancy requirements.although ross would not agree to a lease without cotenancy requirements,the terms for the tenant remedy and landlord cure were subject to negotiation,and ross eventually agreed to a base monthly rent well above its original offer.
meaningful choices 
the record shows that john marshall of grand prospect,who had acted as ross broker in numerous earlier lease transactions,first approached ross as a prospective tenant.the record also shows that ross was grand prospect first choice to fill the vacancy and that paynter was familiar with the contents of the leases used by ross,including its cotenancy provisions.there were other companies that grand prospect could have approached about the empty space.thus,paynter had a meaningful choice when he began to pursue ross as a tenant.the fact that other companies would have required cotenancy provisions in any lease they signed with grand prospect does not mean the choice made by paynter was not meaningful.the specifics of the cotenancy requirements vary and paynter decided to pursue a company that would pay higher rent,rather that pursuing a company that would have accepted cotenancy provisions more favorable to grand prospect,at a lower rent.
conclusion 
based on the foregoing factors,we conclude there were real negotiations between the parties and paynter was given meaningful choices both in initiating contact with ross and during the negotiations of the lease.see aron u haul of california,supra,th at.the fact ross insisted upon cotenancy provisions is not determinative because the specifics of those provisions were subject to negotiations.therefore,we conclude there was no procedural unconscionability in this case and,thus,unconscionability does not provide a ground for invalidating the cotenancy provisions in the lease.see crippen central valley rv outlet,supra,th trial court reversed because plaintiff failed to prove arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable.
iii.penalties 
standard of review 
whether a contractual provision is an unenforceable penalty is determined by the trial court,not the jury.beasley wells fargo bank,supra,d at.as a result,the issue has been described as a question of law.ibid.however,the validity of a provision alleged to be an unlawful penalty is not really a classic question of law,but is one of fact that,because of its character,is nevertheless committed to judicial determination.id.at.thus,a trial court decides,in light of all the facts,including the whole instrument,whether the provision in question is an unlawful penalty.ibid.
despite the nature of the trial court decision,some courts have stated the determination whether a provision constitutes an unlawful penalty is subject to de novo on appeal.harbor island holdings kim th.
based on the foregoing precedent,we conclude the ultimate question of a provision invalidity as a penalty is a question of law subject to de novo review,but the factual foundation for appellate review consists of the facts that are not in dispute and the facts that are established by viewing the conflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court judgment.see a m produce,supra,d at.
conditional provisions sometimes are penalties 
the first legal question raised by the parties contentions is whether a contract provision triggered by one or more conditions precedent can be deemed a penalty under california law.we conclude conditional provisions sometimes can operate as penalties.
general principles 
ross argument that a condition precedent is not a penalty is contrary to a treatise on contract law that devotes a chapter to the topic of conditions and promises that cause a forfeiture or penalty.williston on contracts ed ch.when justice requires,a court can excuse the performance of conditions and promises otherwise agreed to by the parties.the fact that a promise or condition,if not excused,will operate harshly or unfairly in a particular case does not in itself justify a court in excusing its performance,but the law has long strictly scrutinized and often prohibited through the use of a principle inherently incapable of precise articulation or application the enforcement of forfeitures or penalties even though the parties agreement refers to them as liquidated damages or some other innocuous term.williston on contracts,supra,fns.omitted.
the treatise reference to both conditions and promises indicates that,contrary to ross position,it is possible for a condition precedent to operate as a penalty.more explicitly,the treatise states a condition may be as penal in its effects as a promise to pay a penalty.williston on contracts,supra,fn.omitted.the treatise also asserts that relief against the effect of penalties should depend as little as possible on the form a transaction takes.id.at,fn.omitted.in short,phrasing a forfeiture of payment in conditional language does not exempt it from judicial scrutiny.
california approach to conditions and penalties 
we believe the treatise accurately described the law of california,which does not allow unreasonable penalties or forfeitures simply because they are imaginatively drafted as contractual conditions.
first,the legislature has directed california courts to put substance before form.civil code section states the law respects form less than substance.adhering to this fundamental principle,our supreme court has consistently ignored form and sought out the substance of arrangements which purport to legitimate penalties and forfeitures.citations.garrett coast southern fed.sav.loan cal d,charges assessed on late installment payments that were calculated as a percentage of the entire unpaid balance of the loan,not the amount of the overdue installment,were invalid penalties.pursuant to the principle,a court must determine a contract provision true function and operation when evaluating its legality.mcguire more gas investments,llc th,mcguire.
second,a california appellate court has applied the principle to a contractual provision drafted as a condition.in fox chicago zukor d fox chicago,the landlord and lessee entered a series of lease amendments reducing the rent to below the previously agreed upon per month.id.at.as modified,the lease amendments included a clause providing that,in the event of a default,the lessee would be obligated to pay the entire unpaid portion of the rent for each and every month the lessee had paid a smaller amount.ibid.when the lessee breached the lease by removing certain fixtures from the premises without the landlord consent,the landlord sued and demanded approximately under the provision.id.at.the lessee filed a demurrer,which the trial court sustained without leave to amend.id.at.the appellate court affirmed on the ground the landlord recovery of rent at the initial rate constituted a penalty.id.at.
on appeal,the landlord argued the was merely a debt payable upon the happening of a certain event.fox chicago,supra,d at.the court concluded there was no debt.instead,the language of the lease modification and surrounding circumstance convinced the court the provision was a penalty.ibid.where the language of a condition thus appears upon a fair construction to be a penalty,the obligation is thereby invalidated.any provision by which money or property is to be forfeited without regard to the actual damage suffered calls for a penalty and is therefore void.ibid.
the appellate court also addressed the fact the obligation to pay prior rent reductions was worded as a condition 
there is nothing in the lease provision that might remove it from the category of a penalty.it is not necessary that a penalty be designated as such in specific terms before it may be so classified.a condition in a contract providing for the payment of money not earned is just as much a penalty as though it had been stipulated to penalize the promissor should he default in the performance of his promise.citation.if the lease had contained a provision that the breach of any condition thereof should obligate him to pay to the lessor the sum of,there would be no question of its being properly classified as a penalty.but cloaked in the innocent verbiage of a condition requiring the lessee to pay in the event he should fail to perform some covenant which is collateral to the main covenant,it is equally a penalty.citation.a provision in a contract exacting the payment of moneys for the violation of a collateral agreement is opposed to public policy and is not bereft of its vice because it may appear in the form of a condition.citation.fox chicago,supra,d at.
the statements in fox chicago that a lease provision drafted as a condition might be classified as a penalty is consistent with decisions involving other types of contracts.for instance,in henck lake hemet water cal d henck,a water supply contract stated that timely payment for the yearly bill was a condition precedent of the right to receive water.the water company did not send a notice that the bill was due,the buyer did not pay on time,and the company declared the contract terminated and refused to reinstate it after the buyer tendered the amount due with interest.our supreme court affirmed the trial court reinstatement of the contract,stating if the breach of such a condition works a forfeiture,equity in a proper case may grant relief.id.at see root american equity specialty ins.th,nonoccurrence of conditions precedent in contracts excused when nonoccurrence works a forfeiture.
notwithstanding the foregoing cases,california courts have recognized that some conditional provisions in a contract do not operate as a forfeiture or penalty.in blank borden cal d,the supreme court examined a real estate listing agreement that provided the broker would be paid the full six percent commission if the owner withdrew the listing.id.at.the court acknowledged it must look to the substance rather than form in determining the true function and character of an arrangement challenged as a voidable penalty.id.at.the court then stated the listing agreement in question presented the owner with a true option or alternative.specifically,the owner could continue the listing or could change his mind about selling the property,terminate the exclusive listing agreement,and pay the sum specified in the contract.the court concluded the payment required upon termination was valid because it did not have the invidious qualities characteristic of a penalty or forfeiture.id.at.in summary,a contract provision that provides a party with a true alternative performance that is,an alternative that provides a rational choice between two reasonable possibilities does not involve an unenforceable penalty.id.at see parsons smilie cal.land purchaser decision not to satisfy a condition subsequent by operating a lumber yard on the property for five years was willful and therefore he did not qualify under,for relief from forfeiting property back to seller.
here,the conditions contained in the lease regarding mervyn and the occupancy of its space did not provide grand prospect with an alternative performance because,at the time the lease was made,grand prospect did not own the space or have any opportunity to affect,much less control,mervyn decision to cease its operations.
california test of invalid penalties 
under california law,the characteristic feature of a penalty is the lack of a proportional relationship between the forfeiture compelled and the damages or harm that might actually flow from the failure to perform a covenant or satisfy a condition.ridgley topa thrift loan cal th.in other words,an unenforceable penalty bears no reasonable relationship to the range of actual damages the parties could have anticipated would flow from a breach of a covenant or a failure of a condition.greentree financial group,executre sports,th.
therefore,the general rule for whether a contractual condition is an unenforceable penalty requires the comparison of the value of the money or property forfeited or transferred to the party protected by the condition to the range of harm or damages anticipated to be caused that party by the failure of the condition.if the forfeiture or transfer bears no reasonable relationship to the range of anticipated harm,the condition will be deemed an unenforceable penalty.
separate conditions with separate consequences 
the next legal question we address is whether the test for invalid penalties should be applied to section b as a whole or whether the rent abatement provision and termination provision should be analyzed separately.we conclude the provisions must be analyzed separately.
ross right to rent abatement is separate from its option to terminate because the abatement of rent existed whether or not ross subsequently exercised its option to terminate the lease,each right is triggered by different albeit,partially overlapping conditions,and each provision resulted in different consequences to the relationship between grand prospect and ross.pursuant to section b of the lease,the right to rent abatement came into existence if there was a commencement date reduced occupancy period and continued in effect until the reduced occupancy was cured.in contrast,the option to terminate arose if the commencement date reduced occupancy period continued for consecutive months and was exercised by ross giving a termination notice before the reduced occupancy was cured.
given the distinct features of the rent abatement and termination provisions,we conclude the validity of each provision must be determined separately.
iv.rent abatement 
overview of validity of rent abatement provision s 
there is no general rule of law that states all rent abatement provisions in a commercial lease are valid or invalid.as the following cases from other jurisdictions indicate,whether a particular rent abatement provision operates as an unreasonable penalty depends upon the specific facts and circumstances of the case.
rent abatement provisions that were penalties 
in mark it place foods,new plan excel realty trust ohio app d mark it place,a grocery store lease included an exclusive use provision that required an abatement of rent while a violation was in effect.id.at.the landlord later leased space in the shopping center to wal mart without including a provision prohibiting wal mart from selling groceries and other foodstuffs listed in the grocery store exclusive use provision.id.at.the trial court concluded the lease rent abatement provision was a valid liquidated damages clause and not an unenforceable penalty.id.at,fn.the appellate court disagreed,noting that the wal mart lease could run for years and conceivably allow the tenant to remain in the shopping center without paying rent for that period.id.at.as a result,the court concluded the provision abating the rent was a draconian penalty prohibited by ohio case law.ibid.
consequently,mark it place provides an example of a rent abatement provision that was deemed an unenforceable penalty.
in sunny isle shopping center,xtra super food centers,d,a tenant operating a supermarket in a shopping center had a lease that stated the landlord would not permit another tenant to sell food for consumption off premises and a violation of the covenant would allow the tenant to withhold its rent.id.at.the landlord violated this provision by leasing space to kmart corporation,a company that offered groceries for sale.id.at.the tenant began withholding rent and the landlord filed suit seeking a declaration that the provision was unenforceable.ibid.the tenant moved for summary judgment on the landlord claim that the provision was an unenforceable penalty.id.at.the district court denied the motion because it was unclear from the evidence whether the tenant suffered any financial loss since kmart arrival or whether any such losses were attributable to kmart sale of food products.the existence of these factual questions precluded the court from determining the provision was enforceable and granting the tenant summary judgment.accordingly,this case provides an example of a provision for the abatement of rent that might be deemed an unenforceable penalty.
rent abatement provisions that were not penalties 
some challenges to a rent abatement provision in commercial leases have failed.the federal decisions include red sage.despa deutsche sparkassen immobilien anlage gasellschaft mbh rent abatement provision resulting from breach of exclusive use covenant was enforceable and providence,llc v.a p forfeiture of rent during period landlord did not pay construction allowance was enforceable under new jersey law.
decisions from state appellate courts include majestic cinema holdings,llc high point cinema.reversed trial court decision that lease provision requiring the landlord to open square feet of adjacent retail space or forego rent from tenant was unenforceable penalty and bates advertising usa,seventh,llc,enforceable rent abatement was keyed to the number of days of landlord nonperformance and varied from a half day to a day depending upon the importance of the item of work not completed by landlord.
the foregoing cases demonstrate that there is no categorical rule of law holding rent abatement provisions are enforceable or unenforceable.thus,it is possible to draft a rent abatement provision that is reasonably related to the anticipated harm likely to be suffered.
rent abatement provision was a penalty in this case 
generally,a contractual provision is an unenforceable penalty if the value of the money or property forfeited or transferred to the party protected by the provision bears no reasonable relationship to the range of harm anticipated to be caused to that party by the failure of the provision requirements.see pt,ante.
the application of the legal test defining contractual penalties requires this court to identify the value of property forfeited or transferred by grand prospect and the anticipated harm or damages that ross was likely to have experienced as a result of the failure of the conditions specified in the rent abatement provision.the reference to anticipated harm or damage indicates that courts examine the circumstances that existed at the time of the making of the contract when determining if the provision is enforceable.
value of property forfeited or transferred 
under the terms of the lease,grand prospect transferred to ross the right to possession of the retail space and lost the right to receive monthly rent.regardless of whether the loss is conceptualized as the forfeiture of possession of real estate or rent,we conclude the value of the rights relinquished by grand prospect pursuant to the rent abatement provision can be quantified by the rental rate set forth in the lease.
the lease specified the minimum rent as per month.the lease also required ross to pay a pro rata share of the costs for maintaining and repairing the shopping center common areas,real property taxes and assessments,and certain insurance premiums.
ross pro rata share of these items is reflected in the calculations of stuart harden,a certified public accountant retained by grand prospect as an expert witness.harden calculated the amount of damages grand prospect experienced from may,to june,using civil code section.under this statute,when a tenant breach of a lease causes a termination,a landlord may recover t he worth at the time of award of the unpaid rent which had been earned at time of termination,subd.a.harden calculated the unpaid rent as and the accrued interest as,using an interest rate of percent.harden added these two figures together and concluded the damages for the month period was.
the jury accepted harden calculations when it answered to a question in the special verdict form about t he worth at the time of award of the unpaid rent which had been earned at the time of termination.
based on the trial court finding that the withheld rental payments for months totaled which is consistent with the jury finding as to damages,we conclude that the value of the property rights grand prospect relinquished pursuant to the rent abatement provision was approximately per month.
trial court findings as to the harm anticipated 
at page four of its statement of decision,the trial court explicitly found ross did not anticipate any damage,lost sales or profits,if or because mervyn would not be open on the commencement date.the court also found the presence of mervyn was not a condition material to ross under the lease the court reiterated its findings about anticipated harm at page of its statement of decision when it compared that harm to the value of the property forfeited by grand prospect 
t he withheld rent of for the months ross maintained possession of the premises bears no reasonable relationship to the actual damages ross anticipated it would have suffered if it had opened its store at the porterville marketplace even though mervyn was not open on the commencement date because ross did not anticipate it would suffer any damages in such an event.italics added.
ross does not challenge these findings of fact by the trial court on the ground they are unsupported by substantial evidence.such a challenge would have failed in light of the and trial testimony of the ross executives toth,mcgillis and fassio cited by the trial court.the executives testified that no study or analysis was done to determine the impact of mervyn traffic on ross potential sales or,alternatively,the impact of mervyn closure on ross potential sales.furthermore,in october after the ross executives learned of the mervyn closure,they held the view that the porterville marketplace remained a desirable location for a store.mcgillis testified that he was unable to state,one way or the other,whether the closure of mervyn stores in shopping centers where ross was present adversely effected ross sales.
ross theory of error as to anticipated harm 
ross contends the trial court analysis is deeply flawed because the court assumed without analysis that the relevant inquiry was whether ross expected to sustain losses if it opened and operated the store,and paid rent,despite mervyn closure.ross contends the legally relevant evaluation of the cotenancy provisions should have recognized that ross would be entitled to defer opening its store as a way of mitigating its damages if mervyn failure to operate its store were deemed a breach by grand prospect.
ross argues that,in the situation where ross mitigated its damages by not opening a store,the parties anticipated that the failure of the opening cotenancy requirement would have damaged ross in the sum of the rent and common area charges it would have paid during the month period,all of the costs ross would have incurred in building out and preparing to open the store,unavoidable costs of maintaining the premises during that period,and the loss of profits ross expected to earn from operating the store with both mervyn and target open for business in the shopping center.
we conclude ross arguments have failed to identify a legal error in the trial court analysis of the anticipated harm the cotenancy provisions purportedly addressed.
first,ross has not shown it objected to the trial court statement of decision on the ground it omitted the relevant legal analysis.
second,ross has cited no legal authority to support its position that an inquiry into anticipated harm is limited to whether the tenant expected to sustain losses if it did not open and operate the store.ross position about the relevant inquiry is not consistent with the applicable legal standard.under that standard,a court evaluating a contractual provision that might be a penalty must consider the range of harm or damages anticipated to be caused to that party by the failure to meet the contractual requirement by evaluating the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made.in considering this range,a court may not focus on a single scenario to the exclusion of others,which is what ross argues the trial court should have done.consequently,ross argument about the relevant inquiry fails to identify trial court error.denham superior court cal d,appellant has the burden of affirmatively demonstrating prejudicial error.
third,the trial court findings about anticipated harm support an implied finding regarding the causation of the purported harm described by ross.specifically,if the parties anticipated that ross would have no damages if it opened and operated the store,then it logically follows that any lost profits resulting from ross decision not to open the store would not flow from,been caused by mervyn absence.instead,the loss of profits would be caused by ross own decision not to open the store that is,the losses would have been.
fourth,ross appears to assert that,when it decided not to open the store,it was motivated by the desire to mitigate its damages.under the principles of appellate practice,we can not accept the factual assertion as to ross motivation or the assertion that ross,in fact,mitigated any damages by deciding not to open a store.the trial court made no such findings on these specific points and this court may not presume the existence of these purported facts.the judgment of the trial court is presumed correct and all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support that judgment.denham superior court,supra,cal d at.under this principle and the doctrine of implied findings,an appellant such as ross is not entitled to presume the existence of facts that support its claim of error unless the existence of that fact is the only reasonable deduction to be drawn from the evidence.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment,we must conclude ross decision was not motivated by the desire to mitigate its damages,but was part of a failed strategy to renegotiate the rent and achieve greater profits from a store at that location.similarly,we must conclude that ross caused,rather than mitigated,any damages it might have experienced because it was not operating a store at the porterville marketplace.
in summary,ross has failed to demonstrate the trial court erred in its analysis of the damages or harm anticipated to flow from the failure of the conditions in the rent abatement provision.
comparison of anticipated harm to value forfeited 
the trial court finding that there was no anticipated damage expected to flow from the mervyn vacancy makes the final step of the penalty analysis the comparison of anticipated harm to the value of the property forfeited relatively simple.
the value of the property forfeited by grand prospect was approximately per month.as found by the trial court,no harm was anticipated to result from the mervyn vacancy.therefore,we agree with the trial court determination that there was no reasonable relationship between the value of the property forfeited by grand prospect per month and the anticipated harm to ross per month.accordingly,the trial court correctly concluded the rent abatement provision was an unenforceable penalty.
civil code section 
in reaching its conclusion that the rent abatement provision was an unenforceable penalty,the trial court referred to civil code section,which provides 
whenever,by the terms of an obligation,a party thereto incurs a forfeiture,or a loss in the nature of a forfeiture,by reason of his failure to comply with its provisions,he may be relieved therefrom,upon making full compensation to the other party,except in case of a grossly negligent,willful,or fraudulent breach of duty.
the trial court addressed the requirement for making full compensation to the other party by finding ross compensation would be the cost of installing and removing its signs.the court stated ross did not offer evidence and no evidence was admitted as to these costs.as a result,the court did not require grand prospect to compensate ross for these costs.
ross argues civil code section is not applicable to the facts of this case because the cotenancy provisions were conditions,not an obligation as that term is used in the statute.see parsons smilie,supra,cal.at question noted but not decided.we reject ross proposed interpretation of the statute.see root american equity specialty ins,supra,th at.instead,we conclude contracts are a type of obligation covered by civil code section.see,obligations are created by contract or operation of law.therefore,the phrase the terms of an obligation includes the terms of a contract,even when those terms are drafted as
