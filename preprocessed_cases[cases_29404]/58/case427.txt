the issue in this case is whether a condominium unit owner can assert the homestead exemption contained in section of the code of civil procedure the code ilcs west as an affirmative defense to a condominium association action in forcible entry and detainer brought because of the unit owner nonpayment of maintenance assessments.the circuit court of du page county answered this question in the negative and entered judgment for possession in favor of the condominium association.the appellate court reversed,with one justice dissenting.d.we granted leave to appeal a and now reverse the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
the plaintiff,knolls condominium association,filed a complaint in forcible entry and detainer against the defendant,mary harms.the complaint alleged that plaintiff was entitled to possession of a certain condominium unit owned by defendant in willowbrook,illinois,because defendant failed to pay plaintiff in maintenance assessments,plus costs and attorney fees,as required by the condominium declaration.the complaint further alleged that defendant was unlawfully withholding possession of the premises from plaintiff.
defendant answered the complaint by denying that plaintiff was entitled to possession of the property or that she was unlawfully withholding possession from plaintiff.additionally,defendant asserted as an affirmative defense that she owned and occupied the property and,therefore,was entitled to an estate of homestead to the extent of in the property.
at the hearing on the matter,the parties stipulated that defendant owed plaintiff maintenance assessments of.defendant then argued that an estate of homestead was a proper defense to plaintiff action for possession.in response,plaintiff argued that various provisions of the condominium property act ilcs et west,and of article ix of the code of civil procedure hereinafter,the code or the forcible entry and detainer statute ilcs et west,specifically afford a condominium association the right to maintain an action for possession against a unit owner for nonpayment of assessments.the trial court agreed with plaintiff and found that the specific language of the statutory authority relied upon by plaintiff controlled over the more general language of the homestead exemption relied upon by defendant.
a divided appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court.in so doing,the appellate court majority relied upon the principle of inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,the enumeration of certain exceptions in a statute is construed as an exclusion of all others.the appellate court majority found that section of the code ilcs west specified its own exceptions to the homestead exemption of section ilcs west.it concluded that because an exception for a forcible entry and detainer action brought by a condominium association was not listed in section,the legislature did not intend to make an exception to the homestead exemption in such cases.
the dissenting justice argued that the majority analysis produced a statutory disharmony that was not intended by the legislature.the dissent maintained that section a of the code ilcs a west,and section of the condominium property act ilcs west,both of which specifically allow an action for possession brought by a condominium association against a unit owner for nonpayment of assessments,should be read harmoniously with the homestead statute so as not to render any of the statutory provisions meaningless.
we allowed plaintiff petition for leave to appeal.we subsequently granted leave to the association of condominium and townhome associations to file an amicus curiae brief in support of plaintiff appeal.
on appeal to this court,plaintiff argues that the specific statutory provisions allowing a condominium association to obtain possession of a condominium unit for the owner failure to pay maintenance assessments control over the general language of the homestead exemption.because the question of the proper interpretation to be afforded statutory provisions is a question of law,our standard of review is de novo.people maggette,county of knox ex rel.masterson v.the highlands.
we begin our analysis by examining the relevant statutory framework.section of the code provides,inter alia,as follows 
amount.every individual is entitled to an estate of homestead to the extent in value of of his or her interest in a farm or lot of land and buildings thereon,a condominium,or personal property,owned or rightly possessed by lease or otherwise and occupied by him or her as a residence.that homestead and all right in and title to that homestead is exempt from attachment,judgment,levy,or judgment sale for the payment of his or her debts or other purposes and from the laws of conveyance,descent,and legacy,except as provided in this code.ilcs west.
section of the code states,generally,that only a written release,waiver,or conveyance of the exempted homestead estate is valid.ilcs west.section provides a few exceptions to the homestead exemption,which are applicable in the context of a sale 
no property shall,by virtue of part of article xii of this act,be exempt from sale for nonpayment of taxes or assessments,or for a debt or liability incurred for the purchase or improvement thereof,or for enforcement of a lien thereon for nonpayment of common expenses pursuant to the condominium property act.ilcs west.
we now turn to the specific provisions of the condominium property act and the forcible entry and detainer statute,which set forth the appropriate procedure available to a condominium association for remedying a default in the obligations of a unit owner.sections g and h of the condominium property act provide that if a unit owner fails to make timely payment of common expenses,the amount due shall constitute a lien on the interest of the unit owner in the property,which may be foreclosed upon by the board of managers of the condominium association.ilcs g,h west.section of the act specifically provides for further remedies as follows 
other remedies.a in the event of any default by any unit owner,his tenant,invitee or guest in the performance of his obligations under this act or under the declaration,bylaws,or the rules and regulations of the board of managers,the board of managers or its agents shall have such rights and remedies as provided in the act or the condominium instruments including the right to maintain an action for possession against such defaulting unit owner or his tenant for the benefit of all the other unit owners in the manner prescribed by article ix of the code of civil procedure.
b any attorneys fees incurred by the association arising out of a default by any unit owner,his tenant,invitee or guest in the performance of any of the provisions of the condominium instruments,rules and regulations or any applicable statute or ordinance shall be added to,and deemed a part of,his respective share of the common expense.emphases added.ilcs west.
section a of the code gives the board of managers of a condominium association the authority to maintain a forcible entry and detainer action against a defaulting unit owner as follows 
a the person entitled to the possession of lands or tenements may be restored thereto under any of the following circumstances 
when any property is subject to the provisions of the condominium property act,the owner of a unit fails or refuses to pay when due his or her proportionate share of the common expenses of such property,or of any other expenses lawfully agreed upon or any unpaid fine,the board of managers or its agents have served the demand set forth in section of this article in the manner provided for in that section and the unit owner has failed to pay the amount claimed within the time prescribed in the demand.ilcs a west.
defendant argues that plaintiff does not have standing to bring an action under the forcible entry and detainer statute because it is not a person entitled to possession.defendant contention,however,is contradicted by the clear statutory language and must be rejected.section of the property condominium act plainly provides that the board of managers of a condominium association is
