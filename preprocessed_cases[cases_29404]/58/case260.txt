introduction 
this appeal arises out of a malicious prosecution action filed by plaintiff sycamore ridge apartments,llc sycamore ridge against defendants shirley powell,william naumann,christopher hagen,lisa stepp,steven nunoz,and naumann levine llp collectively naumann defendants,and jeffrey lafave and lafave rice jointly lafave defendants.the malicious prosecution action arises from powell participation as a plaintiff in gonzalez,et sycamore ridge apartments llc,et case no.gonzalez.
the naumann attorneys filed the complaint in gonzalez on behalf of individual plaintiffs,including powell,who had lived worked at sycamore ridge.the complaint set forth causes of action alleging that sycamore ridge failed to maintain the apartments in a habitable condition,and that sycamore ridge engaged in unfair business practices pertaining both to tenants and to former sycamore ridge employees.through discovery it became apparent that powell main contention involved sycamore ridge failure to return her security deposit when she moved out of the complex.after sycamore ridge noticed a deposition date for powell,she requested that the date be changed and that the deposition take place at her home,due to her advanced age and poor health.powell maintains that she later sought to end her participation in the litigation because she became confined to bed and believed it would be difficult for her to continue to prosecute the case in view of her deteriorating health.powell ultimately voluntarily dismissed her portion of the lawsuit,without prejudice.sycamore ridge later offered to waive costs if powell would agree that the dismissal of her claims would be with prejudice.powell accepted sycamore ridge offer.
sycamore ridge subsequently filed a malicious prosecution action against powell and her attorneys.in response to the malicious prosecution action,the naumann defendants and the lafave defendants filed motions to strike under the law.the trial court denied the motion to strike as to the naumann defendants,but granted it as to the lafave defendants.
the naumann defendants appeal from the order of the trial court denying their motion to strike under the law.sycamore ridge appeals from the trial court order granting the lafave defendants motions to strike under the law.
in their appeal,the naumann defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion because sycamore ridge failed to establish a probability of succeeding on its malicious prosecution claim.in its appeal,sycamore ridge contends that the trial court erred in granting the lafave defendants motion because sycamore ridge sufficiently established a probability of succeeding on its malicious prosecution claim against the lafave defendants,despite the lafave defendants late entry into the case.
we conclude that sycamore ridge demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its malicious prosecution claim as to both groups of defendants we therefore affirm the trial court order denying the naumann defendants motion,and reverse the trial court order granting the lafave defendants motions.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the underlying lawsuit against sycamore ridge 
in,a sycamore ridge tenant contacted the naumann attorneys,complaining about conditions at the apartment complex.an investigation into the complaints allegedly revealed high airborne readings of spores,maintenance deficiencies,roof leaks,vermin infestations,and flying termites at sycamore ridge.
on december,the naumann attorneys sent unsolicited letters to present and former tenants of sycamore ridge informing them about complaints of health problems that some of the tenants had suffered.included with the letter were contingency fee agreements to be signed and returned by those tenants who wished to be represented by the naumann attorneys in future litigation against sycamore ridge.
powell signed and returned the retainer agreement,and subsequently discussed her complaints with naumann attorneys.powell apparently discussed with the attorneys symptoms she suffered while living at sycamore ridge,including sinus congestion,watery and itchy eyes,headaches and fatigue,heating problems she had encountered in her apartment,and the fact that she believed sycamore ridge had unfairly retained her security deposit.
in june,the naumann attorneys filed a complaint against sycamore ridge on behalf of individual plaintiffs,including powell.the complaint set forth causes of action arising out of allegations of poor living conditions at sycamore ridge and unfair business practices on the part of sycamore ridge management.from the complaint,it appears that all plaintiffs were named as complainants in all counts a letter naumann sent to powell in august indicates that the naumann attorneys had filed a complaint alleging causes of action against sycamore ridge on her behalf.the total damages alleged in the complaint on behalf of the plaintiffs,as a group,exceeded.
sycamore ridge propounded form interrogatories to powell.powell verified her responses on september.in her responses,powell indicated that she was not claiming to have suffered physical injuries,property damage,lost earnings or lost future earnings.in response to the question,do you attribute any physical,mental,or emotional injuries to the incident powell answered,yes.despite having indicated in her response to the solicitation letter that she had suffered from various physical ailments as a result of living at sycamore ridge,when powell was asked to identify each injury she attributed to sycamore ridge conduct,powell answered,the owner and staff have caused me mental and emotional distress because of their dishonesty.powell identified no past or present physical injuries that she attributed to living at sycamore ridge.when asked do you still have any complaints that you attribute to the incident,powell answered no.powell stated that she had not received any consultation,examination or treatment from a health care provider,had not taken any medications,and had not required any other medical services related to her tenancy at sycamore ridge.
in response to the question,do you attribute any loss of or damage to a vehicle or other property to the incident powell answered,no.in response to the question,do you attribute any loss of income or earning capacity to the incident powell answered no.in fact,powell answered no or not that i know of to the great majority of the interrogatories that inquired about the substance of her claims.however,in response to the question was there a breach of any agreement alleged in the pleadings if so,for each breach describe and give the date of every act or omission that you claim is the breach of the agreement,powell answered,i feel that the apartment at hibiscus ave,is unsuitable to live in.sic.
on december,the naumann attorneys filed a statement of damages on behalf of powell.the statement of damages asserted that powell had incurred in emotional distress damages,in property damage,and in punitive damages.
sycamore ridge noticed powell deposition for april.naumann arranged for powell to appear for her deposition on april.powell subsequently requested to change the date of her deposition,and it was rescheduled for september.powell failed to appear on september,and was never deposed.
the lafave defendants became involved in the plaintiffs case on september.on october,the lafave defendants appeared in the case on the plaintiffs behalf after having filed an association of counsel form with the court.
on october,naumann wrote to powell,i understand from our previous conversation you have instructed this office to dismiss you although the dismissal will be without prejudice,you may nonetheless be barred from bringing another suit for the damages you incurred at sycamore ridge apartments.
powell voluntarily dismissed her claims without prejudice on november.after receiving a letter from sycamore ridge counsel offering to waive costs if powell would agree that the dismissal be with prejudice,the naumann attorneys filed a dismissal with prejudice on powell behalf on january,
powell complaints against sycamore ridge 
powell lived at sycamore ridge from february,to august.on july,powell wrote a letter to sycamore ridge management in which she stated,i have enjoyed my stay here at sycamore ridge and knowing all of you.
on october,powell filed a small claims action against sycamore ridge alleging that sycamore ridge had failed to return her security deposit after she moved out of the complex.powell sought to recover.a trial was held in small claims court on november.the court entered judgment in favor of sycamore ridge.
naumann received a signed retainer agreement from powell on december.powell had checked several of the problems listed in the solicitation letter,and included that letter with the retainer agreement.powell made notations next to certain listed symptoms,including repeated sinus congestion,watery itchy eyes,headaches,respiratory infections or problems such as asthma,and fatigue.powell also handwrote these symptoms cleared up after i moved out on.
it appears from declarations the naumann attorneys filed in the subsequent malicious prosecution that powell had never provided them with any specific information indicating that there was mold in her apartment,or that she had suffered any damages attributable to mold.
sycamore ridge malicious prosecution action against the naumann and lafave defendants 
sycamore ridge filed a complaint for malicious prosecution against the naumann and lafave defendants on september,sycamore ridge alleged in its complaint that the naumann and lafave defendants had filed prosecuted powell claims without probable cause,and that the defendants had maintained powell portion of the lawsuit in bad faith,maliciously,and without probable cause.
c.the defendants motions 
the naumann defendants filed a special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section,the law,on october.in their motion,the naumann defendants asserted that powell portion of the lawsuit had not been terminated favorably to sycamore ridge,that her claims were brought with probable cause,that they were not filed with malice,and that sycamore ridge could not prove that it had suffered damages as a result of powell claims against it.
the lafave defendants filed their own special motion to strike under section on october.in their motion,the lafave defendants contended that they had not become involved in the gonzales litigation until august,that their participation was limited to providing expertise concerning mold,and that they had not had any contact with powell.
sycamore ridge filed oppositions to the naumann and lafave defendants motions on november.
d.the trial court order concerning the defendants motions 
the naumann defendants motion 
on december,the trial court entered an order denying the naumann defendants motion,ruling that sycamore ridge had presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the naumann defendants commenced the underlying lawsuit,that the dismissal of the lawsuit constituted a favorable termination for sycamore ridge,that the naumann defendants had lacked probable cause to prosecute powell claims,and that the naumann defendants had prosecuted the action with malice.
the lafave defendants motion 
in the same order,the trial court granted the lafave defendants motion.the trial court ruled that sycamore ridge had not met its burden of demonstrating a probability that it would prevail against the lafave defendants in its malicious prosecution action because there existed no evidence that the lafave defendants participated in the lawsuit.in granting the lafave defendants motion,the court stated,i t appears the lafave defendants joined in the underlying case only two months before the case was dismissed and nine days after powell had requested that her case be dismissed.there is no evidence presented that the lafave defendants continued to prosecute her case or did anything during this time.
e.the notices of appeal 
the naumann defendants filed a timely notice of appeal on december,challenging the trial court order denying their motion.sycamore ridge filed a timely notice of appeal of the court order granting the lafave defendants motion on january.

whether section applies,and whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing,are both questions we review independently on appeal.kashian harriman th,d see also hms capital,lawyers title th,d hms capital orders granting motions are reviewed de novo.
section provides in pertinent part 
a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.
resolution of a special motion to strike requires the court to engage in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute.citation.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon.

sycamore ridge claim arises from a protected activity 
the naumann and lafave defendants met their burden to show that sycamore ridge malicious prosecution action arose from their protected petitioning activities.a protected activity is any act that is completed in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.filing a lawsuit is an exercise of a party constitutional right of petition briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,and claims for malicious prosecution may thus be subject to the statute.jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d,jarrow.sycamore ridge appears to concede that its claim for malicious prosecution arose from a protected activity on the part of the naumann and lafave defendants.thus,the pertinent question on appeal is whether sycamore ridge met its burden to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its malicious prosecution claim.
sycamore ridge has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its malicious prosecution claim against both sets of defendants 
in opposing the defendants motion,sycamore ridge had the burden to present evidence sufficient to demonstrate a probability that it would prevail on its malicious prosecution claim against the naumann and lafave defendants,subd.b navellier sletten cal th,d,equilon,supra,cal th at,d.t he plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.navellier,supra,cal th at,d.
in order to establish a claim against the naumann and lafave defendants for malicious prosecution,sycamore ridge must plead and prove that the prior action was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in sycamore ridge,favor citations was brought without probable cause citations and was initiated with malice citations.citation.crowley katleman cal th,d,crowley.
c ontinuing to prosecute a lawsuit discovered to lack probable cause may also support a claim of malicious prosecution.zamos stroud cal th,d,zamos.continuing an action one discovers to be baseless harms the defendant and burdens the court system just as much as initiating an action known to be baseless from the outset.id.at,d.a person who had no part in the commencement of the action,but who participated in it at a later time,may be held liable for malicious prosecution.paramount general hospital jay d,fn.paramount,disapproved in part on other grounds in staffpro,elite show services,th,d,citing lujan gordon d.
a claim for malicious prosecution may also apply to a defendant who has brought an action charging multiple grounds of liability when some,but not all,of the grounds were asserted without probable cause and with malice.crowley,supra,cal th at,d,citing bertero national general cal d,bertero.
sycamore ridge presented evidence to support the allegation that the underlying litigation was terminated in its favor 
the theory underlying the requirement of favorable termination is that it tends to indicate the innocence of the accused,and coupled with the other elements of lack of probable cause and malice,establishes the tort of malicious prosecution.jaffe stone cal d.it is hornbook law that the plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action must plead and prove that the prior judicial proceeding of which he complains terminated in his favor.babb superior court cal d.
a favorable termination does not occur merely because a party complained against has prevailed in an underlying action.while the fact he has prevailed is an ingredient of a favorable termination,such termination must further reflect on his innocence of the alleged wrongful conduct.if the termination does not relate to the on neither innocence of nor responsibility for the alleged termination is not favorable in the sense it would support a subsequent action for malicious prosecution.lackner lacroix cal d,lackner.w hen the underlying action is terminated in some manner other than by a judgment on the merits,the court examines the record to see if the disposition reflects the opinion of the court or the prosecuting party that the action would not succeed.citations.ross kish th,d ross.should a conflict arise as to the circumstances of the termination,the determination of the reasons underlying the dismissal is a question of fact.citation.ibid.
the lackner court quoted with approval several examples that the appellate court in minasian sapse d.considered illustrative of terminations that may or may not be deemed favorable 
in some instances the manner of termination reflects the opinion of the court that the action lacks merit,as where the criminal proceedings are dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence of guilt following a preliminary hearing.citation omitted.in others,the termination reflects the opinion of the prosecuting party that,if pursued,the action would result in a decision in favor of the defendant,as where the district attorney seeks dismissal of the prosecution of a criminal action for lack of evidence citations omitted or where the plaintiff in a civil proceeding voluntarily dismisses the action citations omitted.by way of contrast,a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction citation not only is not on the merits,it is unreflective of the merits neither the judgment of the court nor that of the prosecuting party on the merits is implicated in the dismissal.lackner,supra,cal d at,quoting minasian,supra,d at.
the defendants contend that the trial court erred in concluding that sycamore ridge established a probability of prevailing on the issue of favorable termination specifically,the defendants challenge whether the voluntary dismissal of powell claims should be considered a favorable termination.a voluntary dismissal is presumed to be a favorable termination on the merits,unless otherwise proved to a jury.weaver superior court d,disapproved on other grounds in sheldon appel albert oliker cal d,sheldon appel.this is because a dismissal for failure to prosecute does reflect on the merits of the action and in favor of the defendant the reflection arises from the natural assumption that one does not simply abandon a meritorious action once instituted.lackner,supra,cal d at.
according to the defendants,there could be no finding of a favorable termination here because,they claim,the underlying reasons for terminating the action did not reflect on sycamore ridge innocence.the defendants note that sycamore ridge presented no evidence as to why powell case was dismissed,and argue that the evidence demonstrates that powell dismissed her case because of her advanced age and poor health,not because her claims lacked merit.however,the trial court noted that sycamore ridge offered evidence that reasonably suggested that the dismissal occurred because powell claims lacked merit,including the fact that powell failed to appear for two depositions and that she submitted interrogatory responses that indicated she had incurred no damages other than mental and emotional distress,after having filed a complaint with causes of action alleging physical injury and property damage.we agree with the trial court that the evidence sycamore ridge presented in opposition to the special motion to strike permits the reasonable inference that the allegations of mold contamination and personal injuries brought on behalf of powell were groundless,and that the voluntary dismissal was motivated by a recognition that most of the claims made on powell behalf in the complaint were meritless.see ross,supra,th at,d given total lack of merit in plaintiff claims,dismissal of a lawsuit for refusing to be deposed reflected adversely on the merits of the action based on the natural assumption that one does not simply abandon a meritorious action once instituted.
the defendants suggest that the agreement to dismiss with prejudice in exchange for a waiver of costs constitutes a negotiated settlement,and that the dismissal therefore does not reflect on the merits of the action.however,the fact that powell later dismissed her case with prejudice,after sycamore ridge agreed to waive costs,is not determinative on the issue of favorable termination.powell voluntarily dismissed her claims before any discussions with sycamore ridge concerning a waiver of costs.a voluntary dismissal,even one without prejudice,may be a favorable termination which will support an action for malicious prosecution.citation.in most cases,a voluntary unilateral dismissal is considered a termination in favor of the defendant in the underlying action the same is true of a dismissal for failure to prosecute.citations.citation.fuentes berry th,d.
although powell had not given up her option to file a new action against sycamore ridge at the time she voluntarily dismissed her claims,the underlying action was terminated upon the initial dismissal.that powell later agreed to give up her right to file another suit against sycamore ridge in exchange for a waiver of costs does not alter the fact that she unilaterally voluntarily dismissed her claims.for these reasons,we agree with the trial court that sycamore ridge made a sufficient prima facie showing that powell claims against sycamore ridge were terminated in sycamore ridge favor.
sycamore ridge established a prima facie showing that the naumann and lafave defendants lacked probable cause to prosecute some or all of the counts in the complaint on behalf of powell 
an action is deemed to have been pursued without probable cause if it was not legally tenable when viewed in an objective manner as of the time the action was initiated or while it was being prosecuted.the court must determine whether,on the basis of the facts known to the defendant,the institution of the prior action was legally tenable.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.the resolution of that question of law calls for the application of an objective standard to the facts on which the defendant acted.citation.ibid.the test the court is to apply is whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable id.at.the tort of malicious prosecution also includes the act of continuing to prosecute a lawsuit discovered to lack probable cause.zamos,supra,cal th at,d.in determining the probable cause issue,the same standard applies to the continuation as to the initiation of a suit.id.at,d.
in analyzing the issue of probable cause in a malicious prosecution context,the trial court must consider both the factual circumstances established by the evidence and the legal theory upon which relief is sought.a litigant will lack probable cause for his action either if he relies upon facts which he has no reasonable cause to believe to be true,or if he seeks recovery upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to him.sangster paetkau th,d sangster.
in determining whether the prior action was legally tenable,whether the action was supported by probable cause,the court is to construe the allegations of the underlying complaint liberally,in a light most favorable to the malicious prosecution defendant.sangster,supra,th at,d.construing the allegations of powell underlying complaint in the light most favorable to her,it is clear that there was not probable cause to support at least some of the causes of action alleged on powell behalf 
the causes of action alleged on behalf of all of the plaintiffs included negligence in failing to manage,repair maintain the property breach of contract based on allegations that sycamore ridge failed to maintain the plumbing,heating,and electrical systems in satisfactory condition,as required by the terms of the leases and breaches of the warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment for failing to water the buildings,installing improper plumbing and gas facilities,and maintaining unclean unsanitary buildings and grounds filled with filth,mold,garbage,rodents,termites,vermin.the complaint also included causes of action for breach of an employment contract,wrongful termination in violation of public policy,and retaliation.
a.the naumann defendants 
the record suggests that powell had limited complaints about sycamore ridge prior to the filing of the lawsuit.although powell had initially indicated that she suffered from some of the physical ailments identified in the solicitation letter,her main complaint appeared to be that sycamore ridge failed to return her security deposit after she moved out.however,powell had previously sued sycamore ridge on that claim in small claims court and lost.in a declaration,powell attests that she experienced repeated sinus congestion,watery itchy eyes,headaches severe and fatigue while living at sycamore ridge,and that she experienced heating problems with her apartment and often had to turn on the oven to adequately heat her home.she states in her declaration that she discussed these problems with the attorneys,and also the issue of sycamore ridge failing to return the security deposit.powell does not mention ever having discussed any other complaints about sycamore ridge with the attorneys at naumann levine,llp.further,there is no evidence in the record to suggest that powell was ever an employee of sycamore ridge,or that she had complaints about sycamore ridge related to having been employed there.
despite the very limited complaints powell discussed with the naumann attorneys,the naumann defendants alleged different causes of action on her great majority of which had nothing to do with any of the concerns powell had discussed with them.under these circumstances,it is difficult to conclude that a reasonable attorney would have believed that powell had tenable claims under many of the causes of action alleged in the complaint as filed.
regardless of whether the facts known to the naumann defendants at the time they initiated the action on powell behalf supported all of the legal theories presented in the complaint,it became clear after powell provided responses to the interrogatories that she was not claiming any physical injuries or property damage.further,her allegations of emotional distress were tied to sycamore ridge supposed dishonesty,and not to any issues attributable to mold.in her interrogatory responses,powell answered yes to the question,do you attribute any physical,mental,or emotional injuries to the incident however,when powell was then asked to identify each injury she attributed to sycamore ridge conduct,she responded,the owner and staff have caused me mental and emotional distress because of their dishonesty.thus,although powell had initially indicated to the naumann attorneys that she had suffered some physical problems while living at sycamore ridge,she did not claim any physical injuries in her discovery responses.additionally,when asked do you still have any complaints that you attribute to the incident,powell answered no.powell further denied that she had been examined by any health care provider or that she had received advice or treatment from any health care provider.she also denied that she had taken any medications,or that she had required other medical services as a result of any injury she attributed to the incident.
in response to the question,do you attribute any loss of or damage to a vehicle or other property to the incident powell answered,no.in response to the question,do you attribute any loss of income or earning capacity to the incident powell answered no.in response to almost every question concerning whether or not she had been injured or had suffered a loss,powell answered,no or not that i know of.again,powell deviated from her denials in response to only one additional inquiry,other than the original question that asked whether she was claiming any physical or emotional injuries.when asked to identify,describe and give the date of every act or omission she claimed constituted a breach of the lease agreement,powell stated that she fe lt that the apartment at hibiscus ave,wa s unsuitable to live in.however,powell did not explain why she believed the apartment was not habitable,and offered no evidence that would demonstrate any factual support for this claim.powell subjective feelings about her apartment are insufficient to support a cause of action for breach.
powell interrogatory responses established that she was not claiming to have suffered any physical injuries,property damage,or lost income,and that there was no factual support for her generalized assertions of emotional injury or of the unsuitability of her apartment.yet the naumann defendants not only did not dismiss powell causes of action based on personal injury property damage,but they took the affirmative step of filing a statement of damages on her behalf.the assertions in the statement of damages were unsupported by,or even inconsistent with,the discovery responses powell had previously given the statement of damages alleged that powell had suffered in emotional distress damages,despite the fact that she provided no factual support for her blanket assertion of emotional distress and acknowledged that she had required no medical treatment for any injuries she claimed to have suffered in property damage,despite the fact that she asserted in her interrogatory responses that she had incurred no property damage at all and an unspecified dollar amount,to be determined at a later date,for loss of future earning capacity,despite the fact that she had specifically stated in her discovery responses that she had suffered no loss of future earning capacity.the statement of damages also claimed in punitive damages,although the basis to support such an award is unclear from powell discovery responses.
after powell responded to sycamore ridge initial discovery requests in september,there was simply no factual basis to support a number of the causes of action alleged on powell behalf in the complaint.powell had no complaints about mold or other health concerns at sycamore ridge,and did not assert that any of her property had been lost or damaged during her stay at sycamore ridge.by failing to assert any claim of physical injury,powell acknowledged that she was not claiming to have suffered from any of the physical injuries alleged in the complaint,which included ear infections lung infections eye irritations kidney dysfunction otitus sinus infections yeast infections skin infections nail,and destruction of bodily tissues and systemic diseases.it also became clear that powell was not claiming damages for any costs of repair reconstruction or physical injury in relation to a negligence cause of action,yet these allegations were also made on her behalf.
powell also did not contend that sycamore ridge had improperly withheld her security deposit.while powell stated that sycamore ridge owner and staff had caused her emotional distress because of their dishonesty,she did not attribute this distress to the improper retention of her security deposit,and she did not indicate anywhere in her discovery responses that she had suffered damage as a result of sycamore ridge withholding of her security deposit.these responses establish that powell had no grounds to bring any of the causes of action relating to the collection or retention of a security deposit in addition,powell did not assert that her tenancy had been unlawfully terminated,as alleged in the cause of action,nor did she allege that she had ever been employed by sycamore ridge,that sycamore ridge had wrongfully terminated her employment,or that she had suffered retaliation at the hands of sycamore ridge,as alleged in the,and causes of action.
in response to the question do you or anyone acting on your behalf contend that any person involved in the incident violated any statute,ordinance,or regulation and that the violation was a legal proximate cause of the incident,powell answered no.she thus denied that she had any personal claims for violations of statutes or regulations,which were alleged in the second cause of action,for negligence per se based on violations of statutes,ordinances,regulations including civil code section,civil code section,civil code section,and civil code section the fifth cause of action,for unfair business practices pursuant to business and professions code section,et the cause of action,for violation of civil code section,the cause of action,for violations of civil code section and,and the cause of action,for violations of united states code section,et and code of federal regulations section,et.
there was no probable cause to support most of the causes of action alleged in the complaint as to powell.the naumann attorneys nevertheless continued to prosecute the action on powell behalf until november months after powell verified her interrogatory responses.sycamore ridge has demonstrated a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to support its allegation that the defendants lacked probable cause to maintain a number of the claims they alleged on powell behalf.
b.the lafave defendants 
the trial court determined that the lafave defendants late entry into the case was sufficient to insulate them from sycamore ridge malicious prosecution action.we conclude that the lafave defendants can not escape potential liability simply because they entered the case after it was well underway,and shortly before it was dismissed.one may be liable for malicious prosecution for prosecuting an action even if he or she did not institute the action.lujan gordon d.lujan there does not appear to be any good reason not to impose liability upon a person who inflicts harm by aiding or abetting a malicious prosecution which someone else has instituted.further,as noted above,one may be held liable for malicious prosecution for continuing to prosecute an action after discovering that the action lacks probable cause.zamos,supra,cal th at,d.thus,although the lafave defendants did not institute the action on powell behalf,this fact does not insulate them from potential liability.
before agreeing to become attorney of record in a pending case,an attorney should,at a minimum,be familiar with his client claims and should have made a preliminary determination whether probable cause exists to support the asserted claims or defenses.by associating into the case as cocounsel,the lafave defendants became the proponents of all of powell claims,which included a large number of claims that were untenable on their face.the lafave defendants thus either knew or should have known of the significant deficiencies in powell claims at the time they associated into the case,and there is no evidence indicating that the lafave defendants took immediate steps to dismiss the meritless claims upon associating into the case.under these circumstances,sycamore ridge has made a sufficient showing that the probable cause prong of its malicious prosecution claim against the lafave defendants has the minimal merit necessary to defeat the lafave defendants motion.
sycamore ridge presented evidence demonstrating a probability that it would prevail on the element of malicious intent 
a.the naumann defendants 
the malice element of the malicious prosecution tort goes to the defendant subjective intent in initiating the prior action.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.for purposes of a malicious prosecution claim,malice is not limited to actual hostility or ill will toward the plaintiff.rather,malice is present when proceedings are instituted primarily for an improper purpose.sierra club foundation graham th,d sierra club.suits with the hallmark of an improper purpose include,but are not necessarily limited to,those in which the person initiating them does not believe that his claim may be held valid the proceedings are begun primarily because of hostility or ill will the proceedings are initiated solely for the purpose of depriving the person against whom they are initiated of a beneficial use of his property the proceedings are initiated for the purpose of forcing a settlement which has no relation to the merits of the claim.id.at,d.
evidence tending to show that the defendants did not subjectively believe that the action was tenable is relevant to whether an action was instituted or maintained with malice.see sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.additionally,if the trial court determines that the prior action was not objectively tenable,the extent of a defendant attorney investigation and research may be relevant to the further question of whether or not the attorney acted with malice.id.at.
addressing the factors discussed in sierra club,supra,th at page,d,there is abundant evidence that the naumann defendants continued to prosecute this action on powell behalf despite being aware that there was no basis for most of her claims sycamore ridge presented evidence that the naumann defendants were aware of the lack of facts to support the majority of powell claims,since the naumann attorneys were the ones who prepared powell interrogatory responses and powell attested to their truth.the evidence suggests that the naumann defendants were aware of facts demonstrating that powell had no compensable claims under most of the causes of action alleged in the complaint,and that there was no sufficient factual basis to support her claim that she had suffered more than in damages and that she should receive an additional in punitive damages.yet,the naumann defendants continued to pursue the action on powell behalf.from the evidence sycamore ridge presented,one could infer that the naumann defendants were at best indifferent as to whether the claims alleged on powell behalf had any basis in fact.
there is also evidence that would support the conclusion that the proceedings were initiated and maintained in order to force sycamore ridge to enter into a settlement,unrelated to the merits of powell claims.see sierra club,supra,th at,d.the statement of damages was filed after powell had provided responses to the interrogatories in which she stated that she had suffered no compensable personal injuries and no property loss.the only harm powell claimed to have suffered was emotional distress as a result of unspecified dishonesty on sycamore ridge part.powell discovery responses do not support the dollar figures set forth in the statement of damages the naumann defendants filed on powell behalf.
even if one were to assume that the naumann attorneys filed the statement of damages in error or that some sort of caused them to erroneously assert unsupported damages allegations on powell behalf,it was clear after they had prepared and served interrogatory responses that there was no basis for the majority of her claims.nevertheless,the defendants did not dismiss those claims until more than a year later.once it became clear that there was no basis for a number of powell claims,the defendants should have dismissed the claims immediately.continuing an action one discovers to be baseless harms the defendant and burdens the court system just as much as initiating an action known to be baseless from the outset.zamos,supra,cal th at,d.
further,this case has a number of hallmark s sierra club,supra,th at,d of a suit brought for an improper purpose.the naumann attorneys appear to have employed a shotgun approach from the outset of the litigation,sending contingency fee agreements to potential plaintiffs whom they had never met and with whom they had never spoken,and naming all who responded to the solicitation letter in all counts of the complaint they filed against sycamore or not there was a factual basis for the claims.a reasonable inference based on the evidence is that powell claims,which included causes of action that had no support in fact,were brought for an improper purpose,within the meaning of sierra club,supra,th at page,d.at a minimum,the record discloses that the naumann attorneys failed to conduct any reasonable investigation with regard to powell complaints,and that they served a statement of damages on sycamore ridge that had no apparent basis in fact.
b.the lafave defendants 
the same evidence that supports sycamore ridge opposition to the naumann defendants motion also establishes a sufficient showing of malice for the limited purpose of defeating the lafave defendants special motion to strike.malice may range anywhere from open hostility to indifference.citations.soukup,supra,cal th at,d.while the mere absence of probable cause,without more,is not sufficient to demonstrate malice downey venture lmi ins.th,fn,d,m alice may also be inferred from the facts establishing lack of probable cause.citation.soukup,supra,cal th at,d.as we discussed earlier,t he extent of a defendant attorney investigation and research may be relevant to the further question of whether or not the attorney acted with malice.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.
the complaint in this case contains a number of claims that are clearly untenable.if the lafave defendants knew the relevant facts and did not take immediate steps to dismiss powell unmeritorious claims,one could infer that the continued prosecution of those claims was motivated by a malicious intent.if the lafave defendants were not aware of the relevant facts because they failed to adequately familiarize themselves with the case before associating in as cocounsel,this would indicate a degree of indifference from which one could also infer malice.see sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.
the lafave defendants contend that powell made the decision not to pursue her case a month before they associated into the case,and that they can not therefore be considered to have prosecuted her claims.however,powell asserted intention not to pursue her claims was apparently not disclosed to sycamore ridge prior to the lafave defendants entry into the case.rather,the case remained open for approximately a month after the lafave defendants associated into the action.the lafave defendants associating into the case without disclosing to sycamore ridge an intention to dismiss powell claims relayed the message to sycamore ridge that not only would prosecution of the case continue,but that the case would now be prosecuted by additional attorneys who were coming into the litigation for their expertise.
maintaining a case one knows,or should know,is untenable continues to harm the defendant as long as the case remains open,since the defendant must continue to prepare a defense to the case as long as the case appears to be moving forward.an attorney who associates into a case that is being maliciously prosecuted participates in harming the defendant for the time period that the attorney allows the untenable claims to remain alive.thus,contrary to the assertions in the dissenting opinion,the liability of an attorney who associates into a case in which untenable claims are being prosecuted is based not on the prior mistakes of others,but,rather,on that attorney own participation in that case.
the lafave defendants claim that their role in the litigation was to be limited to the mold exposure aspect of the litigation,and that they did not have any input in the decision to file against sycamore and were not involved in deciding which plaintiffs to include in the lawsuit or what allegations were made.they assert that,a t all times,lafave believed that the lawsuit against sycamore was supported by probable cause and certainly was not being prosecuted with malice or ill will by anyone.
an attorney assertion that he or she did not initiate a lawsuit and that his or her participation in the case was to be limited in time and scope does not eliminate the attorney potential liability for malicious prosecution.soukup,supra,cal th at,d,noting that an attorney defendant can not insulate himself from malicious prosecution liability,as a matter of law,simply because he asserts that his role in the underlying action was limited to that of appellate counsel.as stated above,by associating into a case as cocounsel,an attorney becomes the proponent of his client claims.the act of associating into a case as cocounsel carries with it at least the responsibility to be familiar with the claims made by one clients in the litigation 
the lafave defendants claim that their role in the litigation was limited and that they were not involved in deciding which plaintiffs to include in the case or what allegations were made.however,their protestations that they believed the claims in the lawsuit were supported by probable cause and that they harbored no malice do not establish,as a matter of law,that sycamore ridge can not prevail on these elements of its malicious prosecution action.none of the lafave defendants assertions negate the fact that they formally associated into the case and that powell claims remained active for approximately a month after their entry into the case,despite the obvious failings of powell complaint.
sycamore ridge sufficiently established that it was damaged by the defendants conduct 
both the naumann and lafave defendants argue that sycamore ridge did not present sufficient evidence that it was damaged by the prosecution of powell complaint and,therefore,that sycamore ridge can not establish a prima facie case of malicious prosecution.the naumann defendants contend that sycamore ridge can not establish that it suffered damages because it continued to litigate the claims of the remaining plaintiffs until settlement and therefore lost nothing by also litigating powell case under the same complaint at the same time.the lafave defendants contend that because they had no involvement in filing the original litigation and did not do anything with regard to continuing the litigation of the powell claim,sycamore ridge could not have suffered any damages as a result of the lafave defendants conduct.we disagree with the defendants contentions.
first,the defendants cite no authority establishing that a malicious prosecution plaintiff must present evidence of the facts supporting the damages claimed in order to establish a probability of prevailing.rather,the weight of authority holds that in order to prevail,a malicious prosecution plaintiff must establish three elements,that the prior action was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in plaintiff favor,was brought without probable cause,and was initiated with malice.see,crowley,supra,cal th at,d.in order to be granted monetary relief,a malicious prosecution plaintiff must also prove damages.however,there is no requirement that,for purposes of surviving an motion,a malicious prosecution plaintiff must provide specific evidence of the extent of the damages suffered.a malicious prosecution claim is actionable precisely because the malicious prosecution is presumed to have injured the defendant in the under
