at issue in this case is whether a class of black tenants of a dallas,texas housing project may sue its private owners for violations of section of the housing act of,e since repealed.we agree with the magistrate judge conclusion that there is no implied private right of action under e and that violations of e are not actionable under.the judgment denying relief against the apartment owners on this basis is affirmed.
facts and procedural history 
the plaintiffs brought this class action on behalf of all who,within the two year period prior to october,occupied a unit at robin square apartments for which dallas housing authority provided section moderate rehabilitation assistance.during this two year period,the robin square apartments were owned and operated by challenge properties,the alfred hughes corporation,and alfred hughes collectively,the robin square defendants.
the section moderate rehabilitation program authorized the secretary of the department of housing and urban development hud to 
make assistance payments under this section directly or through public housing agencies pursuant to contract with owners or prospective owners who agree to upgrade housing so as to make and keep such housing decent,safe,and sanitary through upgrading which involves less than substantial rehabilitation 
e west emphasis added in this case,hud channeled the assistance payments through dha,which agreed to provide tenants and pay rent assistance for each rehabilitated unit in the robin square apartments.
the robin square defendants were required to maintain the apartments in decent,safe,and sanitary condition in order to receive government subsidies under section.this statutory requirement was reiterated in the contractual agreements between the parties.for example,the standard annual contributions contract between hud and dha provided that dha shall require,as a condition for the making of housing assistance payments,that the owner maintain the assisted dwelling units and related facilities in decent,safe,and sanitary condition.the record suggests that hud and dha considered a rental unit decent,safe,and sanitary if it substantially complied with a myriad of hud standards,such as those requiring that subsidized units have adequate heating and cooling,that the units be free of vermin and rodents,and that the project site be accessible to recreational,educational,commercial,and health facilities and services.b.
in a series of reports issued in and,both hud and dha concluded that the robin square defendants had failed to meet hud housing quality standards.in october,hud and dha terminated the section rent assistance contract with the robin square defendants and transferred the tenants to other housing projects.
in july,several robin square tenants filed this suit,alleging that dha and the robin square defendants had violated various civil rights laws as well as section of the housing act of,e.after an initial flurry of activity,the suit languished until june,when the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification pursuant to.b.
in june,the district court entered partial summary judgment against dha in light of its admission that it had approved the robin square project for the purpose of housing black tenants in segregated neighborhoods.the court also determined that dha had breached its obligation to ensure that the robin square apartments met hud housing standards.
in october,the parties agreed to let a magistrate judge conduct all further proceedings.in may,the claims of seven class members were tried before a jury.the jury assessed modest damages against dha to compensate the plaintiffs for the diminished rental value of their units.dha has not appealed the court finding of liability or the jury award of damages.
with respect to the robin square defendants,the jury rejected the plaintiffs claims under the fourteenth amendment the fair housing act,title vi of the civil rights act of,and.the jury found that the robin square defendants had neither acted with a racially discriminatory purpose to segregate blacks in public housing nor operated the apartments with the purpose of discriminating against the plaintiffs because of their race.the plaintiffs do not appeal this portion of the judgment.
the jury also concluded,however,that the robin square defendants had purposefully and consistently operated the apartments in violation of e.despite this finding of liability,the jury awarded the trial plaintiffs no damages arising from the housing act violations.
after the jury returned its verdict,the magistrate judge granted the robin square defendants renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.the magistrate judge concluded,first,that violations of e are not actionable under and,second,that there is no implied private right of action under e.the magistrate judge entered a final judgment for the robin square defendants and ruled that this judgment was binding as to all class members.
ii.discussion 
the sole issue on appeal is whether the plaintiffs have a cause of action for the robin square defendants violations of former e,which provided that public housing authorities could make assistance payments to only those property owners who agree d to upgrade housing so as to make and keep such housing decent,safe,and sanitary.two avenues exist for finding a cause of action.the statute may create rights enforceable by individuals against state actors pursuant to.alternatively,the statute may give rise to an implied private cause of action.
a procedural question first arises as to whether the plaintiffs have abandoned their housing act claim under because they did not properly submit that theory of recovery to the jury.we conclude they did not abandon this claim.
before trial,the plaintiffs asserted that violations of e were actionable under both and under an implied right of action.to prevail on this claim,the plaintiffs were required to prove that the robin square defendants had,while acting under color of state law,deprived them of a right secured by e.see,bass parkwood hospital,cir.the crux of the robin square defendants argument appears to be that the jury instructions on the housing act claim did not contain any reference to or any instruction regarding the element of state action.by contrast,the instructions on the plaintiffs fourteenth amendment claims under explicitly referred to the cause of action and did contain a brief explanation of state action.
we would note,however,that the specific fourteenth amendment questions submitted to the jury pertained only to whether the robin square defendants had acted with a racially discriminatory purpose.thus,even on the fourteenth amendment claim,the jury was not asked to decide any factual issues relevant to the state action question.this omission is not surprising because nearly all the relevant as dha financial support and oversight of the undisputed.once the facts were established,the magistrate judge was in a position to resolve the legal issue whether the robin square defendants,who are private entities,may nevertheless be treated as state actors for purposes of each claim.the record does not show that either party insisted on a ruling on this issue prior to trial.and,after the jury found that the robin square defendants had not acted with a discriminatory motive,and after the magistrate judge ruled that the housing act did not confer a right enforceable under,the magistrate judge had no reason to decide the state action question.under these circumstances,we can not say that the plaintiffs abandoned their housing act claims under in favor of their alternative theory that e implicitly created a private right of action.
turning to the merits,the plaintiffs contend that the robin square defendants may be sued under for operating a housing project,which was funded and regulated by government entities,in a manner that violated plaintiffs united states housing act right to decent,safe,and sanitary housing.the plaintiffs argument raises two questions whether e creates an enforceable federal right to decent housing and,if so,whether the robin square defendants acted under color of state law in th
