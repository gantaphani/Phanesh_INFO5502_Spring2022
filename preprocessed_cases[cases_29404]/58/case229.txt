introduction 
in,a dispute arose between plaintiff delois,then a tenant of defendants in a space on harrison street in san francisco,and defendants.the dispute,described in more detail below,was purportedly resolved by a written agreement between the parties.but various and sundry factors led to alleged breaches of that agreement in any event,plaintiff did not vacate the premises on the date agreed upon in the settlement agreement and,as a result,defendants did not forgive the past due rent or return the security deposit as they would have done pursuant to that agreement.
after vacating the premises,plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants alleging,various torts and breaches of contract regarding defendants actions.defendants countered with a slapp motion under code of civil procedure section section asking that all causes of action be stricken.the trial court ruled that defendants had satisfied the first prong of that section as to all causes of action,but not the second prong as to four of them.it thus struck six of plaintiff causes of action essentially tort causes of action,but declined to strike the remaining four mainly contractual causes of action.defendants appeal the order insofar as it fails to strike three of the remaining four causes of action.they concede that the trial court order was correct as to respondent first cause of action,which sought declaratory relief.
plaintiff from the order insofar as it struck six of his causes of action,contending that none of those claims satisfies the first prong of section.we agree with that contention and hence reverse the trial court order.
ii.factual and procedural background 
from to,plaintiff was a tenant in a space owned by defendant barrett block partners,a limited partnership,at harrison street in san francisco.at that space,plaintiff operated a business known as the clay studio.defendant john barrett barrett is the general partner of the limited partnership.
sometime in either or,caltrans notified defendants that it intended to cut off access from the harrison building to perry street a short street running parallel to harrison street apparently behind that building in order to do a retrofit of part of the freeway.defendants negotiated a monetary settlement for that and,at about the same time,agreed to reduce the rent plaintiff paid for his unit.
in,defendants advised plaintiff that they had no immediate plans to alter the property and that he had been an ideal tenant,and could stay in the building as long as he wanted.as a result,plaintiff did not consider alternative spaces and anticipated a renewal of his lease in.however,later in,defendants decided to redevelop the property as condominiums,obtain the entitlements and permits needed to do so,and then sell the property.they did not advise plaintiff of these plans.
on or about june,defendant barrett wrote to plaintiff regarding a new lease,the prior one having expired on february.he proposed a substantial increase in plaintiff rent,to per month.plaintiff countered with a proposal of a lesser increase,and an oral agreement was reached that plaintiff rent would be per month from october until october.plaintiff paid,and defendants apparently accepted,that amount of rent starting in october.
in early,plaintiff learned of a san francisco planning commission hearing on defendants proposed project to transform the property into a condominium complex to be known as gardens at harrison street.he attended that hearing on february,with a group opposing the change,and believed that barrett saw him there.at that hearing,the operation of the clay studio on the premises was specifically mentioned several times by speakers protesting the proposed zoning change.plaintiff later wrote a letter to the planning commission opposing the proposed change.
after that hearing,plaintiff received a notice from defendants increasing his rent to per month.on july,defendants served him with a three day notice to pay rent or quit.that notice advised that,if plaintiff did not quit the premises,defendants would commence legal proceedings against him.
plaintiff paid the requested rental amount for the month of july and the parties commenced negotiations to resolve their dispute.in august,they executed a tenancy termination agreement requiring plaintiff to vacate his space by november,and leave the premises in broom clean condition.in consideration of that,defendants promised to return plaintiff security deposit,require plaintiff to pay only per month on the first of each month until he vacates with the balance of the set rate of to be waived if the tenant vacates on or before the termination date and meets all other obligation sic of this agreement.
on august,defendants also executed a to whom it may concern letter stating that plaintiff had paid his rent on time since becoming a tenant in march.
plaintiff did,in fact,move out,but a couple of days after the november,date.this delay was at least partially because caltrans was blocking the loading doors in the back of the property and the front door was too small.additionally,barrett allegedly refused to allow plaintiff an additional couple of days occupancy at a per diem rate.per defendants in a letter to plaintiff on december,plaintiff did not leave the premises in broom clean condition.more significantly,defendants enforced their monetary remedies under that agreement,and charged plaintiff the full rent for the interim months and did not refund his security deposit.as of december,defendants claimed plaintiff owed them slightly under.
plaintiff filed his complaint on october.in it,his principal charging allegations were that he was forced to vacate the residential unit in violation of the provisions of the san francisco residential rent stabilization and arbitration ordinance,as a result of the false promises and misrepresentations of defendants,he had entered into a void contract relating to said premises,defendants had made false representations that the building was going to be demolished and that permits had been obtained,that plaintiff would have money returned to him,and that defendants would cooperate in allowing plaintiff to vacate the premises,and that all of this was motivated by defendants illwill sic,with the desire to trick plaintiff and to harm him for landlord pecuniary advantage and out of spite.
as noted,there followed ten causes of action for,respectively,declaratory relief,misrepresentation,breach of contract,conversion,unfair business practices under bus,and,unjust enrichment,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,constructive trust,and violation of the san francisco rent control ordinance admin.code.
defendants filed their section motion on april.the trial court heard oral argument on it on may,after having issued a tentative ruling the previous day.it ruled that the first prong of the slapp motion regarding the nature of the claim had been sustained by defendants moving papers as to all causes of action,but that defendants had not sustained the second prong of the statute as to four of the causes of action,failed to establish that plaintiff had not alleged and could not prove a prima facie case as to four causes of action,namely,those for declaratory relief,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
defendants filed their notice of appeal on may,plaintiff on june,claiming that section did not apply to any of his alleged causes of action.
iii.discussion 
a trial court order either granting or denying a section motion is appealable.see,subd.j.and w hether section applies and whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing are both reviewed independently on appeal.computerxpress,jackson th,d,and cases cited therein see also seelig infinity broadcasting th,d.
because of the large number of appellate decisions construing and applying section,we have many options from which to choose to summarize the key features of that law and the issues an appellate court must address in reviewing a case arising under it.given that wide choice,we opt to quote from our own recent decision in feldman park lane associates th,d feldman a slapp strategic lawsuit against public to chill or punish a party exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.citation.the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section as the provide a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights.citation.citations.determination of a special motion to strike involves a inquiry.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff here the feldman has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.citations.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.citation.citation.thus,plaintiffs burden as to the second prong of the test is akin to that of a party opposing a motion for summary judgment.citation.if the plaintiff fails to carry that burden,the cause of action is subject to being stricken under the statute.citation.in determining whether have satisfied their burden under the first prong of the section analysis,the critical consideration is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant protected free speech or petitioning activity.citation.the statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.citation.citation.section defines an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,to include statements or writings before a judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law and statements or writings made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body.citations.thus,statements,writings and pleadings in connection with civil litigation are covered by the statute,and that statute does not require any showing that the litigated matter concerns a matter of public interest.citations.citation.nor need defendants or bringing an motion prove the suit was intended to or actually did chill their speech.citations.feldman,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.
the issue we face here is,shortly and simply,whether plaintiff lawsuit satisfied the first prong of section,was it designed to chill or punish defendants exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.rusheen cohen cal th,d.
to recapitulate the key facts noted above plaintiff rented the space at harrison street from defendants in and both resided and operated his clay studio business there for over a decade.in,defendants decided to undertake to redevelop the property into condominiums.however,according to the pleadings filed below by both parties,apparently defendants never told their lessees,including plaintiff,about this.indeed,in their opening brief to us,defendants do not even there was any such advice rather,they state,citing plaintiff declaration in the trial court,that they told plaintiff that they had no plans for the property as of.but,in fact,according to them,defendants wanted to recover the property in order to redevelop it as a mixed development.
in,the parties attempted to negotiate a new lease for the premises they were unsuccessful in those efforts,with the result that,in,defendants served plaintiff with a notice to quit.importantly,however,no unlawful detainer action was ever filed by defendants rather,what they repeatedly term a settlement agreement,the tenancy termination agreement,was negotiated between the parties and signed in august.it required plaintiff to vacate the premises on or before november.both sides agree that plaintiff was a couple of days late in vacating those premises,and defendants claim he also did not leave them in broom clean condition.however,and as noted earlier see fn,ante,defendants own brief to us suggests that most,if not all,of the material left behind after plaintiff vacated the unit belonged to either defendants or others.in any event,as a result of plaintiff late departure and alleged lack of a broom clean unit,defendants assessed him almost and also did not return his rental deposit or other rent payable under the tenancy termination agreement.or,to put it as defendants do in their opening brief to us plaintiff expected the consideration due to him under the agreement if he performed.instead,defendants enforced their rights for plaintiff breach.thus,per defendants,it was the denial of the consideration due plaintiff under the agreement and defendants enforcement of their rights for his breach which triggered plaintiff october complaint.
the trial court found that these facts satisfied the first prong of section.it stated defendants motion is based on the contention that every claim plaintiff brings arises from a settlement agreement that was entered into to avoid litigation defendants correctly state that settlement agreements,being a part of the litigation process,are protected activity under ccp section.that includes communications preparatory or in anticipation of bringing an action citations.the court finds that defendants have met the first prong of section.
we disagree with this analysis,because it runs contrary to both authority concerning lawsuits designed to enforce agreements generally and recent authority regarding the application of the slapp statute to disputes.those authorities establish that where,as here,no litigation is ever possibly contemplated by one side or,rather,an agreement entered into to resolve the parties disputes,a later suit alleging breach of that agreement and related tortious conduct does not constitute the sort of activity encompassed by the slapp statute first prong.
a prime example of a case holding that actions intended to enforce settlement agreements does not come within the first prong of the slapp statute is applied business software,pacific mortgage exchange,th,d applied business.there,pending federal court litigation between a licensor and a licensee had been resolved in by a settlement agreement providing that the latter would cease using the former software.later that year and again in early,the licensor attorney wrote to the licensee demanding a certification that the licensee all copies of the software to the licensor and was otherwise in compliance with the federal court litigation settlement agreement.when such was not forthcoming,the licensor filed suit in los angeles superior court alleging causes of action for breach of the settlement agreement and specific performance.the filed a section motion,alleging that the state court case was brought to retaliate against it and as a warning to defendant to keep silent about the licensor business practices.in support of that motion,the argued that a suit alleging a breach of a settlement agreement is necessarily a suit that involves an act in furtherance of a person right of petition.id.at,d.the licensee argued that the suit attacked protected activity,relying on language in navellier sletten cal th,d.
the trial court denied the slapp motion and the appellate court affirmed,and did so in words relevant to defendants arguments in this case regarding agreements in settlement of actual or anticipated litigation here,the gist of plaintiff complaint is not that defendant did something wrong by acts committed during the course of the underlying federal action,but rather that defendant did something wrong by breaching the settlement agreement after the underlying action had been concluded.under the explanatory provisions in subdivision e of section,defendant entering into the settlement agreement during the pendency of the federal case was indeed a protected activity,but defendant subsequent alleged breach of the
