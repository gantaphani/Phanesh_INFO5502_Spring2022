in this appeal from a november,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york alvin hellerstein,judge,a bankruptcy court granted a debtor motion to reject an unexpired commercial lease pursuant to a nunc pro tunc to a date nearly three years earlier when it first told the parties of its intention to make the order retroactive.under the circumstances of this case,we hold that the bankruptcy court acted within its discretion.
background 
nicholas abnos owns the historic firestone building,located in kansas city,missouri.on september,adelphia business solutions,adelphia entered into two companion leases for the firestone building.one lease pertained to two floors of the firestone building the building lease the other,to an annex of the same property the annex lease.on march,adelphia commenced voluntary proceedings under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on may,adelphia filed two motions one seeking authorization to reject certain unexpired leases of nonresidential real property pursuant to a,and the other seeking an extension of the deadline for assuming or rejecting other unexpired leases of nonresidential real property pursuant to d.in the motions,adelphia only identified the address of the firestone building,leaving unclear whether it was referring to the building lease or annex lease.
on may,a hearing was held before the bankruptcy court robert gerber,bankruptcy judge.at around the same time,adelphia vacated the premises covered by the building lease.at the hearing,adelphia explained that it sought to reject the building lease and extend the time for rejection or assumption of the annex lease.abnos objected,arguing that the building lease and annex lease were actually a single lease that had to be treated as a whole.the bankruptcy court,declining to authorize the rejection of the building lease at that time,decided to review the lease agreements and pleadings to determine whether it could rule on the issue of whether the two leases had to be treated as one for rejection purposes without a further evidentiary hearing.the bankruptcy court authorized the rejection of all the other leases listed in the motion.
during the hearing,the bankruptcy judge made oral statements indicating that if he approved the rejection of the building lease,his approval would be effective as of that hearing date.the bankruptcy judge said,if adelphia is right justice would say that their clock should stop today because they at least tried to reject today.the judge also said 
what i am of a mind to do is to deal with this as quickly as i can and if the debtor is right,i will tell you now i will stop their postpetition clock today,and if they wrong,then you can collect from them for the postpetition rent until we can get this thing sorted out that what i inclined to do to balance your needs for procedural due process and to give adelphia what it tried to achieve,which is that if adelphia is right to stop their postpetition rent clock on the building lease starting today.
the bankruptcy court relieved adelphia from its rent obligation on the building lease pending its decision.the bankruptcy judge also said,i will try to give you folks a decision as quickly as possible.when adelphia counsel asked if it should keep the building lease rent in escrow,the judge responded,i f i get you the answer in a couple of weeks or less,you do need that in escrow,do you 
regrettably,the pending motion to reject languished for the next two years.on november,abnos filed a claim with adelphia for administrative expenses for postpetition rent but did not notify the bankruptcy court.neither party took any action on the pending rejection motion until june,when abnos raised its status with the bankruptcy court.on july,the bankruptcy court requested,and one month later received,supplemental memoranda on the issue of whether the building lease and annex lease constituted a single lease.in january,abnos again asked the bankruptcy court about the status of the motion.
finally,on march,than months after the may,bankruptcy court entered an order that found that the building lease and annex lease were separate contracts and authorized adelphia to reject the former and assume the latter.the order did not specify whether it had retroactive effect.
on april,after the time for appeal of the order had elapsed,abnos moved for an order directing adelphia to pay in administrative expenses under d,consisting of the unpaid rent under the building lease up to the bankruptcy court approval of rejection on march.the bankruptcy court noted that abnos had been justified in filing the objection to the rejection motion because whether the two leases constituted a single lease was fairly debatable.on may,however,the bankruptcy court ruled that its march,decision to grant the motion to reject was retroactive to may.the bankruptcy judge acknowledged that the rejection motion fell off his radar screen,as it apparently fell off the radar screens of the two sides in this dispute as well.he concluded,however,that he had issued a final determination on may,that if he ruled in adelphia favor,the building lease rejection would be retroactive to that date and that nothing had transpired since then to justify its alteration.the bankruptcy court reached this decision based on several undisputed facts it notified the parties on may,of its final determination on retroactivity abnos did not object to that ruling adelphia surrendered the premises on or about the date of the hearing while neither party acted on the pending motion,abnos made no effort to alert the bankruptcy court of the pendency of the rejection motion until june or raise concerns about the timing of the approval until april and,finally,abnos did not attempt to relet the vacant premises despite little risk that adelphia would have objected,little chance that abnos would have thereby waived his objection to rejection,and no chance whatever of any forfeiture of rights if he had explained his needs and concerns to the court.
on november,the district court for the southern district of new york found no abuse of discretion and affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.the district court found neither party at fault for the delay.implicitly rejecting the bankruptcy court view that the may,retroactivity pronouncement was a final determination,the district court nonetheless held that those statements put abnos on clear notice that the bankruptcy judge,if he decided against abnos,would more likely than not,and maybe certainly,use the may day for stopping the clock.with that in mind and noting that the debtor had quit the premises,the district court concluded that the risk should fall on the landlord because it was more incumbent on the landlord to seek out a new tenant or to obtain permission to rent to a new tenant.
abnos timely appealed.
discussion 
abnos advances two principal arguments.first,he argues that a bankruptcy court lacks equitable authority to make retroactive its order approving a debtor rejection of an unexpired nonresidential lease.second,he contends that,even if the bankruptcy court has this power,its exercise was an abuse of discretion in this case.after initially reviewing the mechanics behind lease rejection under,we will address each argument in turn.
rejection of leases under of the bankruptcy code 
during a chapter reorganization,a provides that the trustee,subject to the court approval,may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.as a debtor in possession,adelphia has essentially the same rights,powers,and duties as a trustee.see a,see also smart world,llc juno online,in re smart world,llc,cir.
before rejection or assumption,the debtor in possession has certain obligations.section d states 
the trustee shall timely perform all the obligations of the debtor,except those specified in section b,arising from and after the order for relief under any unexpired lease of nonresidential real property,until such lease is assumed or rejected,notwithstanding section b of this title.
d emphasis added.this subsection therefore requires continued performance under a lease until it is assumed or reject
