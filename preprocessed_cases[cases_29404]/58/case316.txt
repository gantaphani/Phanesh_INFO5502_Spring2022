in august a jealous boyfriend broke into the apartment of his estranged girlfriend and murdered her.in this wrongful death action,plaintiffs allege defendants,owners of the apartment building were negligent by not replacing a missing pane of glass in the apartment front door used by the murderer to obtain entry,and that negligence substantially contributed to the decedent death by expediting the murderer entry into the apartment.the trial court entered summary judgment for owners,and we reverse.
factual background 
condition of the premises 
abigail ramirez decedent and her infant daughter lived with decedent parents in an apartment apartment in a building owned by owners.the front door to apartment is a wood door with diamond and glass panes in the top half.when the family moved in,one of the glass panes was missing and a piece of cardboard covered the opening.shortly after moving in,decedent mother elsa complained to the apartment manager and requested the missing pane be replaced because it was pretty cold.decedent parents made several subsequent requests that the glass pane be replaced because they felt the absence of the pane created a security risk.however,the missing pane was never replaced eventually,decedent brother replaced the cardboard with a piece of plywood he used finishing nails to tack the plywood to the door.
b.the august murder 
jesus vasquez jesus,decedent boyfriend and the father of her infant child,had visited apartment on numerous occasions.jesus and decedent had lived together at his parents apartment,but a few days before the murder decedent had moved into apartment with her parents following an argument with jesus.
on august,jesus heard that decedent was having an affair with her former boyfriend.between and that morning,jesus armed with a knife drove to apartment to confront decedent.he pounded on the door to apartment twice,and became angry because they were letting him in.when no one responded to his demands,jesus removed the plywood panel that replaced the glass pane in the door,reached through the opening,opened the door from the inside,and entered the apartment.jesus testified that when elsa and decedent refused to let him in,he recognized the missing pane provided him an easy opportunity to gain entrance because it was relatively easy to push out the wood panel requiring only a hard knock to push it aside without risking potential injury to his hand had he punched through a glass pane.jesus testified he would not have tried to break in through a glass pane because of the risks and difficulties but instead would have waited outside until decedent emerged.
when jesus entered apartment,elsa and decedent along with decedent infant daughter were inside.although elsa tried to position herself between jesus and decedent,jesus pushed elsa down and incapacitated her.he then confronted decedent,fatally stabbing her,cut the telephone line and escaped.jesus was later convicted of murder.
extant dangers 
no one was aware that jesus was potentially violent.however,the neighborhood surrounding the apartment building had experienced the commission of some crimes,including violent crimes,and there were reports of an alleged rape in the apartment building,although the apartment manager viewed the reports of rape to be questionable.decedent family had experienced an incident in which two men,apparently in a case of mistaken identity,had attempted to enter apartment but then fled when decedent father warned them not to enter.the apartment building itself was secured by fencing,including a fence topped by razor accordion wire on three sides.
procedural background 
the complaint for wrongful death against owners contained a single cause of action based on premises liability.it alleged owners,as lessors of apartment,were negligent by not replacing the missing windowpane,and that negligence was a direct and proximate cause of the attack on and death of decedent.
owners moved for summary judgment,contending the existence of a duty of care is a matter of law resolvable on summary judgment.owners argued that under ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,d,ann and sharon arman,cal th,d,sharon,disapproved on other grounds by aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,footnote,d,a property owner has no duty to make his or her property or take precautions against third party criminal conduct the owner had no reason to anticipate,and owners had no reason to anticipate jesus violent behavior.owners also asserted the failure to replace the windowpane did not create a dangerous condition because it created no unreasonable or substantial risk of injury,and jesus criminal conduct was a superseding intervening cause of the injury.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing a landlord duty to repair a door arises from numerous statutory and common law obligations,and therefore the only issue was whether the landlord failure to replace the windowpane was a substantial factor in causing the injury.plaintiffs argued that causation is ordinarily a question of fact and the evidence raised triable issues of fact as to the causal nexus between the missing glass pane and the resulting attack,and therefore summary judgment was inappropriate.
the court tentatively ruled in favor of owners,concluding they had no notice of jesus violent tendencies or of criminal activity around the apartment building,and therefore owed no duty to replace the windowpane.the court also ruled apparently on the issue of causation it was unlikely jesus would have been stopped even had the glass pane been replaced.the court granted plaintiffs request to obtain and submit testimony from jesus.plaintiffs submitted jesus deposition testimony to support their argument that an issue of fact existed on whether jesus would have remained outside apartment if the missing pane had not provided him easy access the court confirmed its ruling in owners favor,holding the subject incident was not sufficiently foreseeable to give rise to a duty on owners to prevent jesus from entering apartment.after plaintiffs motion for reconsideration was denied,the court entered judgment in favor of owners,and plaintiffs timely appealed.
legal standardsa standard of review 
the summary judgment procedure aims to discover whether there is evidence requiring the procedures of trial.citation.t he trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment is merely to determine whether such issues of fact exist,and not to decide the merits of the issues themselves.citation.the trial judge determines whether triable issues of fact exist by reviewing the affidavits and evidence before him or her and the reasonable inferences which may be drawn from those facts.morgan fuji country usa,th,d.to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,a defendant must show one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established or there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.o.the evidence of the moving party is strictly construed and that of the opponent liberally construed,and any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion.branco kearny moto park,th,d.
consequently,summary judgment should be granted only when a moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,subd.c.because a motion for summary judgment raises only questions of law,we independently review the parties supporting and opposing papers and apply the same standard as the trial court to determine whether there exists a triable issue of material fact.city of san diego gypsum th,d southern cal.rapid transit dist.superior court th,d.in practical effect,we assume the role of a trial court and apply the same rules and standards that govern a trial court determination of a motion for summary judgment.lopez university partners th,d.
negligence principles 
the elements of a cause of action for negligence are the defendant had a duty to use due care,that he or she breached that duty,and that the breach was the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.citation.nally grace community church cal d.e very negligence case is governed by the rule of general application that all persons are required to use ordinary care to prevent others from being injured as the result of their conduct.weirum rko general,cal d.the existence of a legal duty to use reasonable care in a particular factual situation is a question of law for the court to decide.adams city of fremont th,d.however,the elements of breach of that duty and causation are ordinarily questions of fact for the jury determination.andrews wells d.
analysisa.the legal issue of duty 
plaintiffs assert owners were negligent by not replacing the missing windowpane in the front door of apartment,which was a substantial cause of decedent death.owners prevailed on summary judgment by convincing the trial judge that,as a matter of law under the facts of this case,owners owed plaintiffs no duty that was breached.we review the record de novo to determine whether owners conclusively negated this necessary element of plaintiffs case.ann,supra,cal th at,d.
the existence of duty is a question of law to be decided by the court see,sharon,supra,cal th at,d,and the courts have repeatedly declared the existence of a duty by landowners to maintain property in their possession and control in a reasonably safe condition.see,rowland christian cal d,rowland.however,acknowledgment of the broad proposition that landowners have a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain their property in a safe condition provides scant guidance to a court that must determine the existence of the landlord duty in a particular case.because the question of the legal duty of a landlord has perplexed many courts and generated an amorphous body of law,to answer the question presented in this case we preface our analysis with a brief consideration of the question of duty in the broader context of tort law.
when a defendant has not intended to injure a plaintiff,and the defendant is not deemed for policy reasons to be strictly liable for a plaintiff injuries regardless of fault,a defendant liability for a plaintiff injuries is determined under negligence principles.prosser keeton,torts ed.the elements of negligence are defendant obligation to conform to a certain standard of conduct for the protection of others against unreasonable risks duty failure to conform to that standard breach of the duty a reasonably close connection between the defendant conduct and resulting injuries proximate cause and actual loss damages.the first of a duty to be decided by the court rather than the jury is not an immutable fact,but rather an expression of policy considerations leading to the legal conclusion that a plaintiff is entitled to a defendant protection.ludwig city of san diego th,d.to determine the standard of conduct required by the first element of negligence,we generally undertake a analysis by balancing the risk,in the light of the social value of the interest threatened,and the probability and extent of the harm,against the value of the interest the actor is seeking to protect,and the expedience of the course pursued.for this reason,it is usually difficult,and often simply not possible,to reduce negligence to any definite rules it is relative to the need and the occasion,and conduct proper under some circumstances becomes negligence under others.prosser keeton,supra,fns.omitted.stated differently,duty is a question of whether the defendant is under any obligation for the benefit of the particular plaintiff and in negligence cases,the duty is always the conform to the legal standard of reasonable conduct in the light of the apparent risk.thus,although the articulated standard is the same,the question of what is reasonable will depend in each case on the particular circumstances facing that defendant considering the foreseeability of the risk of harm balanced against the extent of the burden of eliminating or mitigating that risk.
this cursory overview of negligence law helps focus the threshold question present in every negligence action how do we define the scope of the defendant duty established by law for the protection of others against a risk of harm out of the generic obligations owed by landowners to maintain property in a reasonably safe condition,the law of negligence in the context has evolved to impose a duty of reasonable care on the owner of an apartment building to protect its tenants from foreseeable third party criminal assaults.thus,the question of a landlord duty is not whether a duty exists at all,but rather what is the scope of the landlord duty given the particular facts of the case our reference to the scope of the landlord duty is intended to describe the specific steps a landlord must take in a given specific circumstance to maintain the property safety to protect a tenant from a specific class of risk.it is this question that we decide as a matter of law.
when a court strives to answer this question,we believe it should limit its inquiry to the specific action the plaintiff claims the particular landlord had a duty to undertake in the particular case.this specific action approach was used,albeit sub silentio,by the supreme court in both ann and sharon p.in both of those cases,the supreme court considered whether,as alleged by the plaintiffs,the scope of the duty owed by owners of a shopping center and a commercial parking garage extended to providing security guards to protect its tenants and customers from violent crimes.ann,supra,cal th at,d,sharon,supra,cal th at,d.only after the scope of the duty under consideration is defined may a court meaningfully undertake the balancing analysis of the risks and burdens present in a given case to determine whether the specific obligations should or should not be imposed on the landlord.if only the broad proposition that landlords have a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain their property in a safe condition is considered rather than focusing on the scope of duty,then in every premises liability negligence case the existence of the duty is present,there is no duty issue for the court to determine and each case would be decided by the jury determination of breach of duty,causation and damages.the law has not evolved in this manner.
the factors to be weighed in the balancing analysis necessary to determine the scope of the duty in a case will vary with each case.however,a review of the cases addressing the question of duty in the context reveals two primary considerations the foreseeability of the harm and the burden on the landlord created by the duty to protect against the harm in both ann and sharon,the supreme court adopted this approach to determine whether the scope of the landlords duties extended to providing security guards,and evaluated the degree to which the attacks were foreseeable considering the circumstances weighed against the extent of the burden to the defendants of providing security guards,as urged by the plaintiffs.i n cases where the burden of preventing future harm is great,a high degree of foreseeability may be required.citation.on the other hand,in cases where there are strong policy reasons for preventing the harm,or the harm can be prevented by simple means,a lesser degree of foreseeability may be required.citation.ann,supra,cal th at,d,quoting isaacs huntington memorial hospital cal d,isaacs.
in ann the supreme court determined the plaintiff had not established the degree of foreseeability of harm necessary to require the security measures requested.the plaintiff,employed by one of the tenants in defendants commercial shopping center,was raped and robbed at knifepoint in the store where she worked,and sued the landlords for negligence.ann,supra,cal th at,d.in deciding that violent criminal assaults were not sufficiently foreseeable to impose a duty on the defendants to provide security guards in common areas,the court noted there was no evidence that defendants had notice of prior similar incidents occurring on the premises,evidence of other criminal conduct on the premises was not similar in nature to the violent assault suffered by plaintiff,and neither evidence of the crime rate in the surrounding neighborhood nor evidence that transients were present on the premises was sufficient to establish a high degree of foreseeability.id.at,d.because the court concluded the monetary and social burdens of hiring of security guards were neither minimal nor insignificant,the court concomitantly held that a high degree of foreseeability of harm was required,which could rarely,if ever,be proven in the absence of prior similar incidents of violent crime on the landowner premises.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
similarly,in sharon the court declined to impose a duty on the defendant landlords to provide security guards in their underground commercial parking garage because the sexual assault on the plaintiff was not sufficiently foreseeable.although there was evidence the bank in the building had been robbed seven times in the prior period,and several hundred crimes,including two rapes,had occurred in the square blocks surrounding the building,no crimes had been reported in the garage in the years preceding the attack.sharon,supra,cal th at,d.the court found it significant that none of the bank robberies involved violent attacks,and held that their dissimilarity to the sexual assault on the plaintiff,even when considered with the other evidence,did not establish the high degree of foreseeability necessary to justify the significant burden id.at,d,of imposing a duty to provide security guards in the garage id.at,d.
numerous other cases have decided the question of a landlord negligence liability for a tenant injuries by considering the foreseeability of the injury balanced against the burden of protecting against that injury for example,in hollywood.venture superior court d,the plaintiff was raped in her apartment,and she sued her landlord,claiming there was a duty to provide lighting and security devices sufficient to prevent the attack.the court rejected the claim because the plaintiff had not alleged sufficient foreseeability of the attack to justify the vague and thus potentially onerous duty she sought to impose on the defendant.id.at.in totten v.more oakland residential housing,d.the plaintiff,wounded by a shooting on the premises of the apartment building,sued the landlord,claiming there was a duty to provide proper guard service or other supervision of the premises.id.at.the court rejected the claim,primarily on the ground that the plaintiff had not alleged sufficient foreseeability to justify the duty she sought to impose on the defendant,but also noting that b oth the proposed duty and the measures to be applied in discharge of the duty defy exact delineation and suffer from inherent vagueness.the questions posed in goldberg housing auth.of newark,could all be asked here to which houses would the duty apply would it depend upon the number of tenancies if so,can we now fix the number and if the duty springs from a combination of tenancies and prior unlawful events,what kind of offenses will suffice,and in what number,and will crimes next door or around the corner or in the neighborhood,raise the obligation and if a prescient owner concludes the duty is his,what measures will discharge it it is an easy matter to know whether a stairway is defective and what repairs will put it in order b ut how can one know what measures will protect against the thug,the narcotic addict,the degenerate,the psychopath and the psychotic these questions by themselves signify the formidable task of defining the exact scope of the duty and the measures required of the landlord to meet that duty.we are in full agreement with the goldberg court that to predicate tort liability upon such a loose and vague standard would be genuinely unfair to the landlord totten,supra,at,quoting goldberg,supra,at.
similarly,in rogers jones d,the court declined to impose a duty on a football stadium parking lot operator to prevent an attack by one fan on another.the court held that the measures needed to prevent that incident would be unreasonably burdensome,necessitating one guard be provided for every fan,and concluding the harm to the plaintiff was not sufficiently foreseeable to warrant that heavy burden.id.at.finally,in pamela millsom th,d,the plaintiff was raped by an intruder into her condominium,one of four in the condominium complex.during the rape,the assailant called pamela by name,and told her that he had been watching her.she sued her landlords,alleging negligence,and they obtained summary judgment on the ground they owed her no duty because the attack was not reasonably foreseeable in the absence of prior similar incidents on the premises.id.at,d.on appeal,this court undertook an analysis of the landlords duty in the context of ann and affirmed,concluding the rape was not sufficiently foreseeable to impose the extraordinarily burdensome duty on the defendants to physically secure the premises in the manner demanded by the plaintiff pamela,supra,at,d.
in contrast,in kwaitkowski superior trading d,plaintiff was raped in a common area in her apartment building,and she sued the landlord,alleging that the lock to the common hallway was broken and a robbery had previously occurred in the same hallway.the court held that the burden of fixing the lock on the lobby door placed the landlord under a minimal burden,and the slight foreseeability of the rape considering the prior robbery in the same location was sufficient to impose a duty on the landlord to provide the first line of defense against intruders by providing working locks.id.at.similarly,in gomez ticor d.disapproved on other grounds by sharon,supra,cal th at,d,plaintiffs decedent was killed in a parking garage when he interrupted a robbery in progress.in reversing summary judgment for the owner of the parking garage,the court noted the history of theft and vandalism in the garage,and concluded that it was at least somewhat foreseeable that a garage patron would interrupt such an act and be subject to a violent attack by the perpetrator.balanced against the burden of providing a first line of defense against intruders,which the court did not precisely define but concluded was minimal and did not place an onerous burden upon defendant or society,the court held defendant had a duty to implement those minimal measures.id.at,d.
although these cases have resolved as a matter of law the question of the scope of the landlord duty,often by engaging in an implicit balancing process,the method used to reach their conclusions is unclear.we discern from these cases the following analytical approach to evaluate the threshold legal question of duty that a court must resolve.
first,the court must determine the specific measures the plaintiff asserts the defendant should have taken to prevent the harm.this frames the issue for the court determination by defining the scope of the duty under consideration.second,the court must analyze how financially and socially burdensome these proposed measures would be to a landlord,which measures could range from minimally burdensome to significantly burdensome under the facts of the case third,the court must identify the nature of the third party conduct that the plaintiff claims could have been prevented had the landlord taken the proposed measures,and assess how foreseeable on a continuum from a mere possibility to a reasonable probability it was that this conduct would occur.once the burden and foreseeability have been independently assessed,they can be compared in determining the scope of the duty the court imposes on a given defendant.the more certain the likelihood of harm,the higher the burden a court will impose on a landlord to prevent it the less foreseeable the harm,the lower the burden a court will place on a landlord 
the trial court here granted summary judgment for owners after concluding they did not owe plaintiffs a legal duty because they had no knowledge of facts to suggest that jesus had violent propensities and therefore it was not reasonably foreseeable he would violently attack decedent.employing the analytical approach set forth above,we review de novo the trial court order granting summary judgment for owners.
we begin with the specific duty plaintiffs seek to impose on owners the obligation to restore the integrity of the front door to apartment by replacing the missing glass pane.the action plaintiffs contend owners should have but did not take defines the scope of the duty that we determine as a matter of law should or should not be imposed.the question we must answer is did owners owe plaintiffs a duty to make reasonable efforts to restore the protections that an intact front door would have provided with replacement of the missing windowpane to answer this question we first evaluate the extent of the burden placed on owners were they required to take the requested action.the evidence is undisputed that the burden would have been minimal the materials for replacing the missing pane had already been purchased,and the cost of completing the pane replacement would have been approximately.we conclude that,under the facts presented,plaintiffs proposed duty is so minimally burdensome that it militates in favor of imposing that duty on owners.
where the harm can be prevented by simple means,a lesser degree of foreseeability may be required.citation.ann,supra,cal th at,d.considering the minimal burden on owners to take the action proposed by plaintiffs,we consider how foreseeable it was that an intruder might utilize a missing windowpane in the front door to enter the apartment.the evidence,viewed most favorably to plaintiffs,showed plaintiffs complained to the manager that the missing windowpane was a security risk,at least one incident had occurred involving an aborted entry by an intruder into apartment,and assaultive crimes had been reported in other apartments in the building.we conclude that,if the facts known to owners were sufficient to notify them of a slight likelihood that an intruder might seek to enter the apartment,they had a duty to take the minimally burdensome steps available to restore the integrity and security provided by a repaired front door.
owners contend that because they had no knowledge of jesus violent propensities,they could not have foreseen that he would violently attack someone on the premises and therefore had no duty to take any action to prevent the attack.however,a high degree of foreseeability is not required to impose the minimally burdensome measures urged here.see musgrove ambrose properties d.lesser degree of foreseeability is required when the proposed duty involves simple,effective,and easily defined steps.moreover,foreseeability depends not on whether a particular plaintiff injury was foreseeable as a result of a particular defendant conduct,but instead on whether the conduct at issue created a foreseeable risk of a particular kind of harm.panama buena vista union school dist.th,d ballard uribe cal d,fn.the particular type of harm risked by a weakened front door is that the first line of defense against intruders kwaitkowski superior trading,supra,d at.will not protect the occupants against intruders as articulated by kwaitkowski,f oreseeability does not require prior identical or even similar events id.at,and the court found that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to justify imposition of a duty of care upon the landlord concerning the lock,explaining t he instant case involves a defective lock on the lobby door that provided easy access to strangers.as the court noted in hollywood.venture superior court,supra,d,the utility of a light outside the door was questionable.here,in contrast,a properly functioning front door lock is a vital first line of defense.kwaitkowski superior trading,supra,d at.
we conclude in this case that the degree of foreseeability of a criminal intruder by owners was sufficiently high,compared with the burden of the duty proposed by plaintiffs to replace the glass pane,to support imposition of that duty on owners.
b.the factual issue of causation 
owners alternatively argue summary judgment was proper because there was no triable issue of fact on whether failure to replace the missing windowpane was a substantial cause of decedent death.owners argue it is speculation whether the missing windowpane substantially contributed to jesus entry and assault on decedent,and jesus conduct must be deemed an intervening and superseding cause of decedent death.
cause in fact 
in a negligence action the plaintiff must show the defendant act or omission breach of duty was a cause of the plaintiff injury.jackson ryder truck rental,th,d.the element of causation generally consists of two components.id.at,d.the plaintiff must show the defendant act or omission was a cause in fact of the plaintiff injury,and the defendant should be held responsible for negligently causing the plaintiff injury.ibid.the second component is a normative or evaluative one that asks whether the defendant should owe the plaintiff a legal duty of reasonable care under the circumstances of the case.id.at,d.because we have concluded owners did owe a duty to restore the integrity of apartment front door,the second component of causation is satisfied.
the first component of causation in fact generally is a question of fact for the jury.causation in fact is shown if the defendant act or omission is a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff injury.jackson ryder truck rental,supra,th at,d mitchell gonzales cal d,d.this issue ordinarily may not be resolved on summary judgment.nichols keller th,d grant of summary judgment on causation improper unless under undisputed facts there is no room for a reasonable difference of opinion on casual nexus slaughter legal process courier service d.owners,relying on saelzler advanced group,supra,cal th,d,assert the absence of the glass pane can not be a cause in fact of decedent death unless it is more probable than not that the glass would have prevented jesus attack on decedent,and argue it is pure speculation whether the presence of the glass pane would have deterred jesus.saelzler did affirm summary judgment in favor of the landlord on the causation issue because it rejected as speculation the plaintiff proof of the causal nexus between the absence of additional security measures to keep unauthorized intruders from entering the apartment complex and the resulting assault because,in that case,there was no evidence the assailants were unauthorized intruders.id.at.saelzler cautioned it was not setting an impossible bar for a plaintiff opposing a summary judgment motion on causation,explaining plaintiff overstates her case when she contends that adopting the substantial factor approach to the causation issue would make it virtually impossible to recover from landlords or other property owners for negligence in failing to take reasonable protective measures to safeguard others from the criminal assaults of third persons.plaintiff asserts that a finding of causation would be justified only if a criminal is caught,and then only if the criminal testifies what specific lack of deterrence on the property made easier his or her opportunity to commit the crime we disagree,for we can readily hypothesize cases in which the evidence discloses an actual and substantial causal link between the criminal assault and the defendant negligence.thus,in a given case,direct or circumstantial evidence may show the assailant took advantage of the defendant lapse such as a failure to keep a security gate in repair in the course of committing his attack,and that the omission was a substantial factor in causing the injury.eyewitnesses,security cameras,even fingerprints or recent signs of or unauthorized entry,may show what likely transpired at the scene.in the present case no such evidence was presented,but the circumstances in other cases may well be different.id.at,d.
the evidence absent in saelzler is present here the assailant was caught,he testified to the easy mode of entry presented by the plywood patch over the opening,and he testified his instinct would likely have dissuaded him from punching through a glass pane.we therefore conclude the evidence,viewed most favorably to plaintiffs,raises at least a triable issue of fact whether the condition of the door was a substantial factor in bringing about the attack.we express no opinion on whether the jury would so find.
superseding cause 
owners assert they are absolved from liability because jesus act was an intervening or supersedi
