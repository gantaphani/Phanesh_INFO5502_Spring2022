a jury found that the defendant walter case case violated provisions of the fair housing act fha and awarded the plaintiff don weaver weaver compensatory and punitive damages.case raises three issues on appeal the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,weaver lacked standing to sue,and the district court erred by not reducing or eliminating the punitive damages award.for the following reasons,we affirm in part,reverse in part and remit the punitive damages award to.
factual and procedural background 
case and his wife rita case case own a home at louque place in the lakeview area of new orleans which they have been renting since.the home was converted into four rental apartments,and louque place the upstairs units,and and general diaz the downstairs units.beginning in,the downstairs units were repaired and renovated for a period of over months.by november,the apartment at general diaz was ready and available for rent.
the cases ran an ad in the new orleans advertising an apartment for rent at per month.several people called to inquire about the apartment and case told the callers to meet him at the apartment between and on november,the friday after thanksgiving.he contends that he showed the apartment to approximately eight to ten people at that time,and that he indicated to those people that he had a deposit on the apartment.according to case,he agreed to rent the apartment to his daughter,deanna case,in early november because the home she was renting at the time was being sold.case asserts that deanna case gave him a cash deposit of on november.case asserts that he left the property after showing it on the morning of november,and did not return later in the afternoon.specifically,case denies ever having an encounter with weaver and his girlfriend lisa lincoln lincoln at the apartment later that day.
weaver and lincoln were a biracial couple looking for a new apartment.weaver is and lincoln is.lincoln claims that on the morning of november,she called the number listed by the cases in the newspaper ad to inquire about the apartment for rent.according to lincoln,she and case had a friendly conversation and he told her drive by.if you like it,give me a call,at least you can see the inside of it.lincoln claims that case never mentioned that he was holding a deposit on the apartment during that phone conversation.
according to lincoln and weaver,the following events transpired later that afternoon.lincoln and weaver allege they drove by the property,liked it,and called the telephone number listed in the ad once again using a cell phone to arrange to see the inside of the apartment.lincoln contends that case answered and indicated that her husband was already on his way to the property and would arrive shortly.when case drove up,lincoln and weaver got out of their car and stood in front of the front door,under the awning.numerous for rent signs were posted nearby.after seeing lincoln and weaver,case walked away from the couple.lincoln went after case and he told her i wish you would have called.i would have told you that i was holding a deposit.i have a deposit on the apartment.at lincoln request,case nevertheless showed the couple the inside of the apartment.case claims there were no showings that afternoon and that the allegations of discrimination asserted by weaver and lincoln were concocted.
on the following monday,lincoln asked a caucasian to call the cases and inquire into the availability of the apartment.a woman answered the call and indicated that the apartment was available b ut you need to speak to my husband.lincoln then contacted the greater new orleans fair housing action center,fhac.the fhac assigned two testers and two caucasian testers to inquire about the availability of the apartment.beginning december,the testers contacted the cases by telephone.essentially,each of the caucasian testers was told the apartment was available,while the testers were told it was unavailable.
lincoln and weaver filed suit against the cases alleging violations of the fair housing act fha,et,as well as and,and state discrimination laws.the cases moved for summary judgment which the district court dismissed as untimely filed.a few days before trial,the district court granted lincoln and weaver motion to dismiss their civil rights claims and state law claims,as well as all of their claims against case.the remaining claims against case were tried before a jury and the jury found in favor of lincoln and weaver.the jury awarded no damages to lincoln,but awarded in compensatory damages and in punitive damages to weaver.
case filed two motions a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and a motion for judgment pursuant to rule b,alternatively a motion for a new trial pursuant to rule a,in the alternative for a remittitur.the district court denied both motions,as well as a subsequent motion for reconsideration.case appeals,contending that the district court lost subject matter jurisdiction once lincoln and weaver dismissed their civil rights claims,weaver lacked standing to sue under the fha,and the district court erred in failing to reduce or eliminate the punitive damages award.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is subject to plenary review by an appellate court.julian city of houston,cir.
weaver and lincoln allege that case violated two provisions of the fha,a and d by refusing to rent,and by misrepresenting unavailability,based on weaver race.section states as follows 
as made applicable by section and except as exempted by sections b and b,it shall be unlawful 
a to refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer,or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of,or otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any person because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.
d to represent to any person because of race,color,religion,sex,handicap,familial status,or national origin that any dwelling is not available for inspection,sale,or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.
case argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the fha did not apply to either case or the property at issue specifically,case argues that he qualifies for an exemption from the strictures of the fha pursuant to b.weaver contends that case misinterprets the exemption.we agree.
section b provides an exemption for any house sold or rented by an owner provided that four requirements are satisfied we need not address whether case meets the four requirements because we find that the fourplex at issue is not a house.thus,we find that case does not meet the threshold qualification for the b exemption.
the fha does not define house.case cites to lamb sallee.and hogar agua y vida en el desierto,cir as relevant to the proper interpretation of house.although these cases are informative,neither supports a finding that case meets the threshold requirement for a b exemption.in lamb,it was undisputed that the property in question was a house.in determining whether the owner owned more than three other such houses,for purposes of determining whether the remaining requirements of the b exemption were met,the district court held that a duplex was not a house within the meaning of b.thus,lamb does not support case contention that his fourplex was a house.in hogar agua,the first circuit noted that the district court had found that the house at issue,comprised of separately equipped apartments on each floor,constituted a house.at.the defendant and his family lived primarily in one apartment,while his son lived in the other.id.due to physical impairments,however,the defendant lived interchangeably in both apartments.id.in this case,the residents of case property were not members of an extended family,living amongst all of the four apartments 
as the district court stated in this case,it seems real clear that under the black letter law this piece of property was not a single family dwelling,so it does not get to the exception.we agree.thus,we reject case argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
ii.standing under the fha 
this court reviews case standing challenge de novo.maiz virani,cir.
the supreme court has stated that s tanding is a jurisdictional requirement that focuses on the party seeking to get his or her complaint before a federal court and not on the issues he or she wishes to have adjudicated.united states hays,d.the fha affords a private cause of action to any aggrieved person.a a.an aggrieved person includes any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that such person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.i.the supreme court has held that the sole requirement for standing under the fha is the article iii minima.havens realty coleman,d see also san pedro hotel city of los angeles,cir.three elements are required to establish article iii standing 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
case argues that weaver does not have standing to sue for violations of his rights under d misrepresentation of unavailability because weaver does not assert that a misrepresentation was made to him personally.case contends that the only alleged deception concerning the apartment availability occurred during conversations between he and lincoln,and case and lincoln.weaver asserts that the fact that case words evidencing the deception appear to have been directed toward lincoln personally does not impact his standing to sue.we agree.lincoln inquired into the availability of the apartment for both she and weaver,in essence,she was the spokesperson for the couple.weaver was present when the apartment suddenly became unavailable.the fact that case words may have been physically directed toward lincoln is of no importance.it does not diminish weaver injury,nor the fact that weaver injury can be fairly traceable to case actions.see james city of dallas,cir causation requires that the injury be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we reject case argument that weaver lacked standing to sue.
iii.punitive damages 
after the trial,case filed a motion for judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,alternatively a motion for a new trial pursuant to rule a,in the alternative for a remittitur.the district court heard the parties arguments and denied each of case requests without a written opinion.weaver now asserts a myriad of challenges to the district court refusal to eliminate or reduce the punitive damages award.
a motion for judgment as a matter of law in an action tried by jury is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict.coffel stryker,cir internal quotations omitted.we review the district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.id.in this case,however,we review case sufficiency of the evidence arguments only for plain error because case failed to properly preserve his challenges to the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a punitive damages award.see flowers regional physician,cir if a party fails to move for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a on an issue at the conclusion of all of the evidence,that party waives both its right to file a renewed rule b motion and also its right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on that issue on appeal.under plain error review,we must decide whether there was any evidence to support the jury verdict.flowers,at.if any evidence exists that supports the verdict,it will be upheld.id.with respect to case motion for a new trial under rule and his motion for remittitur,we review the district court denial of both for abuse of discretion.industrias magromer cueros y pieles.bayou furs,cir thomas.dep t of criminal justice,cir.there is no abuse of discretion unless there is a complete absence of evidence to support the verdict.at quoting sam style shop cosmos broadcasting,cir.finally,we review case constitutional challenge to the size of the punitive damages award de novo.cooper,leatherman tool group,d.
case contends that the district court erred in allowing the punitive damages award to stand because there was no evidence showing a willful and gross disregard for the plaintiff rights,and no evidence demonstrating case subjective consciousness that he was violating a statute which subjected him to punitive damages.in a civil action to enforce the fha,if the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred the court may award to the plaintiff actual and punitive damages.c.case appears to argue that the district court was confused regarding the requisite showing necessary to obtain punitive damages in fha cases in.acorn fair housing,this court held that a punitive damages award under the fha can not stand absent an actual damages award,unless there was a violation of a constitutional right.at.in doing so,we specifically did not decide whether a punitive damage award under the fha must be based on egregious conduct or merely predicated on a violation of the statute.see generally kolstad am.dental ass n,d.id.at.
in smith wade,the supreme court held that a jury may award punitive damages in a federal civil rights action based on when the defendant conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent,or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others,d.in kolstad,which involved a title vii action,the supreme court rejected a requirement that the conduct be egregious in order to support a punitive damages award,but held that an employer must at least discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages.at.as the supreme court explained,the existence of intentional discrimination may not always give rise to punitive damages because the defendant may be unaware of the relevant prohibition or the defendant may discriminate with the distinct belief that his discrimination is lawful.id.three of our sister circuits have held that the standard for punitive damages in a federal civil rights action,as delineated in smith and kolstad,is applicable in the context of the fha.see preferred properties,indian river estates,cir,cert.denied,d badami flood,cir alexander riga,cir.consistent with our sister circuits,we are persuaded that the question for the availability of punitive damages is whether the defendant acted with malice or reckless indifference that his actions might violate a federal statute of which he was aware.preferred properties,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we find that the district court applied the proper standard.
we further find that there was sufficient evidence to support an award of punitive damages.the jury found that weaver race was a motivating factor behind case not renting the apartment to lincoln and weaver.the jury was further persuaded that case misrepresented the unavailability of the apartment and that weaver race was a motivating factor in that misrepresentation.there can be little doubt that case,an experienced landlord,knew that discriminating against prospective tenants based on race violated federal law,and has for over years.indeed,case defense at trial was that he did not discriminate at all,not that he was ignorant of the law prohibiting race discrimination in housing.the jury concluded that case acted maliciously,wantonly,oppressively,or intentionally with respect to violating weaver rights under the fair housing act and awarded weaver punitive damages accordingly.we are convinced that there was evidence,indeed legally sufficient evidence,to support the jury verdict 
case further argues
