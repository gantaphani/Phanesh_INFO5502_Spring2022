background 
in,plaintiffs entered into an agreement with george and mary karsant,under which plaintiffs agreed to lease a portion of a building for the purpose of installing and operating a restaurant.the lease was for a term of months,with options allowing them to extend the lease for two periods.george karsant died in.in,mary karsant and her children formed the partnership.mary karsant assigned to it her right,title and interest in the leasehold.mary karsant managed the partnership until,when her son,peter karsant karsant,who by then apparently had taken on most of the managing duties,formally became the managing general partner.according to plaintiffs original complaint,karsant devised and carried out a persistent and protracted scheme of harassment and effort designed to force plaintiffs either to vacate their restaurant or to renegotiate a new addendum to their lease doubling their rent from per month to per month.
the alleged scheme involved a series of complaints and claims emanating from karsant that plaintiffs had breached or were breaching the lease.the complaints and claims often were accompanied by threats to terminate the lease.the alleged scheme began in,when karsant demanded plaintiffs pay taxes retroactive to the beginning of the lease even though,according to plaintiffs,george and mary karsant had agreed they would not be required to pay property taxes and it was undisputed no one previously had attempted to collect property taxes from them.plaintiffs settled the claim,paying,under an agreement reciting this sum brought their rent current.in the summer of,karsant claimed plaintiffs wrongfully had appropriated a room,which they had converted and were using to store wine.he threatened to terminate the lease if plaintiffs did not vacate the room by july.plaintiffs vacated the room,but karsant nonetheless insisted they had breached the lease because they had not completely removed a drainpipe that had been attached to a dessert case.karsant claimed he therefore was entitled to terminate the lease.plaintiffs presumably removed the drain.
in december,despite the earlier agreement that plaintiffs had brought their rent current,karsant informed plaintiffs they owed in unpaid insurance premiums and threatened to terminate the lease if they did not pay.plaintiffs did not believe they owed the money,but agreed to pay it in three installments beginning in january.plaintiffs sent a letter to karsant in december,confirming the first payment would be made on january.karsant took the position plaintiffs were required to make the first payment on january,accused them of choosing not to abide by their agreement,asserted the entire therefore was immediately due and threatened to terminate the lease if they did not pay.plaintiffs paid.
by this time,the attorneys were representing karsant.in july,the attorneys wrote a letter to plaintiffs reporting plaintiffs had committed uncured and in some cases uncurable defaults and breaches of the lease related to repairs plaintiffs were having done on the restaurant floor.the attorneys did not respond to a request from plaintiffs contractor asking for more information about the alleged breaches.the attorneys instead wrote to plaintiffs that,on information and belief,plaintiffs had failed to remedy the violations identified in the earlier letter.the attorneys wrote,further,it was their impression plaintiffs had abandoned all efforts to comply with an obligation to obtain the landlord prior written consent provide plans and specifications showing the work they intended to have done karsant the attorneys letter,along with a fifth addendum to the lease,which essentially raised the rent to per month.a few days later,karsant delivered his own letter asserting plaintiffs were breaching the lease by leaving a fire exit door open,telling plaintiffs their failure to heed repeated warnings to keep the door closed and keep the area free from debris proved the breach to be incurable.karsant demanded plaintiffs cease further operations and deliver the keys to the premises to him within three days.
in september,an employee damaged the exterior of the building by running into it with her car.karsant had his contractor inspect the damage and prepare a cost estimate.plaintiffs signed off on the estimate,but wrote to karsant and the attorneys that they did not wish to get involved with the exterior repairs,pointing out the contractor had reached an agreement with karsant,and plaintiffs had no say in the repair work.the attorneys responded with a notice to perform or quit,taking the position plaintiffs were responsible for overseeing the work.plaintiffs agreed to oversee the work,and sent authorization to karsant contractor and to the attorneys to have the work done.the contractor,however,reported he was busy with other work.when the work was not done,the attorneys served another notice to perform or quit,complaining the repairs had not been effected.the attorneys also complained plaintiffs had failed to install intake vents plaintiffs explained the situation to the attorneys and it appears the matter was dropped,temporarily.in april,the contractor informed plaintiffs he would do the work in may,but stated it would cost over his original estimate of.plaintiffs sent the revised estimate to the insurance company for approval.the insurance company responded by sending out its own adjuster and contractor,who estimated the job would cost only.ultimately,karsant and plaintiffs agreed the insurance company contractor could do the repairs.karsant then apparently sought to take over and oversee the exterior repairs and the installation of the air vents.
plaintiffs further claimed that in august,karsant and the attorneys had attempted to persuade clay hogan of the san francisco plumbing company to exaggerate the severity of a problem with the building sewer system and falsely report plaintiffs were the sole cause of the problem.hogan refused.
in the meantime in march,as permitted by the lease,plaintiffs filed a petition to arbitrate claims of breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and intentional infliction of emotional distress,naming the partnership and karsant as respondents.karsant opposed the petition,claiming he was not bound by the lease arbitration provision.plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the petition as to karsant without prejudice.plaintiffs claims against the partnership were arbitrated by the honorable david garcia,retired judge of the san francisco superior court,who,in a march,decision,awarded plaintiffs compensatory damages of,representing the sum paid for insurance,plus various forms of declaratory and injunctive relief.judge garcia also found karsant,as managing general partner,intentionally had inflicted emotional distress on plaintiffs,engaging in outrageous conduct.judge garcia therefore also awarded to nicholas panoutsopoulos and ordered karsant to pay in punitive damages.plaintiffs also were awarded attorney fees and costs.
in the meantime,on may,plaintiffs filed their original complaint against karsant and doe defendants.plaintiffs later filed a case management statement indicating an intention to join the attorneys as additional defendants to the complaint,and in february,plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to file an amended complaint to include claims of civil conspiracy.the court denied the motion without prejudice,ruling it did not comply with section,which requires a party seeking to bring an action against an attorney for civil conspiracy with his or her client,to obtain a court order allowing the party to file the pleading.
plaintiffs then filed a petition
