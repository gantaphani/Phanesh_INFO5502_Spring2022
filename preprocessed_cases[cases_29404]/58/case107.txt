four mobilehome park owners in yucaipa,california appeal the dismissal of their suit under the fair housing amendments act of fhaa challenging a city zoning ordinance prohibiting any mobilehome park currently operating as senior housing from converting to housing.because the fhaa is silent on whether such zones are permissible and because federal regulations allow for them,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in september,the city of yucaipa,california the city adopted ordinance number the ordinance,which amended the city plan by creating a senior mobilehome park overlay district the overlay district.the ordinance prohibits any of the mobilehome parks in the city that currently operate as senior housing,defined as a park in which either eighty percent of the spaces are occupied by or intended for occupancy by at least one person who is age or older or one hundred percent of the spaces are occupied by or intended for occupancy by people who are age or older,from converting to housing.yucaipa,ordinance.specifically,the ordinance requires that a t least of the spaces in mobilehome parks in the senior mobilehome park overlay district shall be occupied by at least one person years of age or older,and that t he signage,advertising,park rules,regulations,rental agreements and leases for spaces in a senior mobilehome park in the overlay district shall state that the park is a senior park.id.among its findings accompanying the ordinance,the yucaipa city council described the need to preserve affordable housing and independent living options for the city significant senior population as well as to protect the reliance interests of those seniors who had purchased homes in existing parks.
plaintiffs appellants putnam family partnership,mission valley oaks,caravan estates,and dejager children trust collectively,putnam,mobilehome park owners that currently operate parks in yucaipa,filed suit,alleging that the ordinance violated the fhaa by forcing them to discriminate on the basis of familial status,see,and by interfering with their ability to aid or encourage families with children in the enjoyment of fair housing rights,id.putnam also argued that the ordinance was preempted by the fhaa because it required putnam to take action that the fhaa prohibited.see id.in addition to these claims,putnam alleged violations of california housing law.the city filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,arguing that the ordinance fell within the fhaa senior exemption,which allows communities that provide housing for older persons to exclude families with children.id.b.the city contended that,as amended by the housing for older persons act of hopa and as interpreted by department of housing and urban development hud regulations in,the senior exemption applied to senior housing like the overlay district.putnam argued that the senior exemption did not apply because the senior exemption requires that the housing provider intend to operate senior housing,and putnam lacked this intent.
the district court granted the city motion to dismiss,holding that the ordinance was covered by the federal senior exemption because,under the hopa amendments,the required intent to provide senior housing need not be that of the private property owner.because the city enacted the ordinance,the court held,the required intent to provide senior housing was that of the city rather than putnam.the court rejected putnam arguments to the contrary as based on language requiring that the owner or manager of the housing entity intend to provide senior housing for the senior exemption to apply.for similar reasons,the court held that the ordinance was not preempted.after dismissing the federal claims,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.putnam timely appealed,repeating its argument that the decision whether to operate senior housing belongs exclusively to the housing provider and,thus,that the intent to provide senior housing which the senior exemption requires must be that of putnam,not the city.in addition,putnam contends that the hud regulations on which the district court relied are inconsistent with the statute or otherwise outside the scope of the agency authority.

b.the federal senior exemption 
as originally enacted,the federal fair housing act prohibited,inter alia,discrimination in the rental or sale of a dwelling on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.in,congress enacted the fhaa,which amended the fair housing act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of familial status.see also id.k defining familial status as children younger than eighteen living with a parent or legal custodian.the fhaa also provided two exemptions to the new prohibition against discrimination the prohibition would not affect local,state,or federal restrictions on maximum occupancy and would not apply to housing for older persons.id.b.the senior exemption permit s communities satisfying certain requirements to discriminate on the basis of familial status.balvage ryderwood improvement serv.ass n,cir.the senior exemption is an affirmative defense,for which the defendant has the burden of proving eligibility.id.at citing massaro mainlands section civic ass n,cir.moreover,the defendant must show that all requirements for the senior exemption were met at the time of the alleged discriminatory act.id.
under the provision as originally enacted in the fhaa,housing for older persons included housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person years of age or older per unit.b c,amended by b c.the fhaa further stated that,
in determining whether housing qualifies as housing for older persons under this subsection,the hud secretary shall develop regulations which require at least the following factors 
i the existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons,or if the provision of such facilities and services is not practicable,that such housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons and 
ii that at least percent of the units are occupied by at least one person years of age or older per unit and 
iii the publication of,and adherence to,policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons years of age or older.
focusing on the language in subpart iii that eligibility for the senior exemption requires that the owner or manager intend to provide senior housing,several district court cases held that a city could not interfere with a private housing entity decision whether to meet the senior exemption.mobile home vill.twp.of jackson,fair lending p h holding zoning ordinance invalid as applied cedar hills developers,twp.of wyckoff,fair lending p h same see also united states city of hayward,city rentcontrol board decision to reduce rent when mobilehome park owners opened the park to families with children violated the fhaa,rev in part on other grounds,cir.
in,congress amended the requirements to qualify for the senior exemption.under hopa,housing for older persons remains exempt from the prohibition against discrimination.hopa replaced the fhaa definition of housing for older persons with a provision defining housing for older persons as housing 
c intended and operated for occupancy by persons years of age or older,and 
i at least percent of the occupied units are occupied by at least one person who is years of age or older 
ii the housing facility or community publishes and adheres to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent required under this subparagraph and 
iii the housing facility or community complies with rules issued by the secretary for verification of occupancy,which shall 
i provide for verification by reliable surveys and affidavits and 
ii include examples of the types of policies and procedures relevant to a determination of compliance with the requirement of clause ii.such surveys and affidavits shall be admissible in administrative and judicial proceedings for the purposes of such verification.
the legislative history reveals that the central purpose of the hopa amendments was the elimination of the fhaa significant facilities and services requirement.see,at the purpose of is to eliminate the burden of the significant facilities and services requirement in the seniors housing exemption of the fair housing act,reprinted in.the house and senate judiciary committee reports criticized administrative interpretations of that provision that made compliance with the senior exemption difficult and thus limited the availability of senior housing.id.at,at,wl,at.the senate report also expressed congress desire to clarify whether housing qualifies for the senior exemption and its general purpose to preserve housing for older persons,at.
hopa also removed the fhaa requirement that the intent to provide senior housing demonstrated in published policies and procedures must be that of the owner or manager.in addition,hopa specified that the duty to publish and adhere to such policies and procedures lies with the housing facility or community.b c ii.unlike with the elimination of the significant facilities and services requirement,however,the legislative history does not offer a reason for the deletion of the reference to owner or manager.nor do the statute or the committee reports define housing facility or community or otherwise explain why that phrase was added.
in,hud issued regulations interpreting the amended senior exemption.the agency defined housing facility or community as any dwelling or group of dwelling units governed by a common set of rules,regulations or restrictions.b.as examples,hud listed a condominium association,a cooperative,property governed by a homeowners association,leased property under common private ownership,a mobile home park,a manufactured housing community,and,most notably for this case,a municipally zoned area.id.the hud regulations also explained how a housing facility or community could satisfy the senior exemption requirement that it publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate its intent to operate as senior housing.id.in an appendix to the final rule intended to provide guidance to housing facilities or communities in applying these hud requirements,the agency listed specific examples of how various facilities and communities could meet this intent requirement.one such example dealt with a zoned area 
an area zoned by a unit of local government as senior housing satisfies the intent requirement if 
zoning maps containing the senior housing designation are available to the public 
literature distributed by the area describes it as senior housing 
the senior housing designation is recorded in accordance with local property recording statutes and 
zoning requirements include the or older requirement or a similar provision.
id.at ex.the appendix also explained that,overall,the regulations were intended to reflect hopa goal of protect ing senior housing.id.at.
c.the validity of the city of yucaipa ordinance 
does the ordinance violate the fhaa 
putnam contends that the ordinance violates the fhaa by requiring that putnam discriminate against families with children and by interfering with its ability to aid such families in the exercise of their fair housing rights.as described above,however,discrimination on the basis of familial status does not violate the fhaa if the federal senior exemption applies because the fhaa ban on such discrimination does not apply to housing for older persons.b.if the requirements for the senior exemption are met,any limits that the ordinance places on putnam ability to sell units in its mobilehome park are lawful under the fhaa and putnam has thus failed to state a claim for violation of the fhaa.
putnam contends that the federal requirements are not met if the housing provider lacks the intent to operate senior housing,and,thus,that the senior exemption does not apply when a city forces an unwilling housing provider to operate senior housing 
the city counters that the senior exemption does not require that the housing provider has the intent to operate senior housing when a city seeks to provide senior housing through the exercise of its zoning authority,the intent to provide senior housing can be that of the city itself.as long as the other requirements for the senior exemption are met,the city asserts that any discrimination against families with children that results from the ordinance does not violate the fhaa.
a.the relevant intent 
the question of whether the federal senior exemption can apply when the intent to provide senior housing is that of a city is apparently one of first impression in the courts of appeals.by including a municipally zoned area as an example of a housing facility or community that can qualify for the senior exemption,the hud regulations clearly allow senior housing like the city overlay district.see b.further,hud has explained that a housing facility or community satisfies the senior exemption intent requirement if,inter alia,z oning requirements include the or older requirement and z oning maps containing the senior housing designation are available to the public.at ex.these actions reflect the city intent to provide senior housing,because they are actions that the city undertakes.
we will defer to an agency interpretation of a statute that it is charged with implementing if the statute is ambiguous and the agency interpretation is reasonable.chevron,natural res.def.council.a statute is ambiguous if congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.we routinely defer to hud reasonable interpretation of the fha a.balvage,at citing meyer holley,
in determining whether a statute is ambiguous,we apply the traditional tools of statutory construction,including looking to the plain meaning of the text or the underlying purpose of the statute.see chevron,at.
the fhaa provision,as amended by hopa,refers to intent in two places.first,the statute requires that housing be intended and operated for occupancy by persons years of age or older,b c,but does not explain whose intent to provide senior housing is required.second,the statute requires that the housing facility or community publishes and adheres to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent required under this subparagraph,id.b c ii.this second reference to intent clarifies that the intent to provide senior housing must be that of the housing facility or community.
putnam contends that,as a linguistic matter,a city can not qualify as a housing facility or community.whatever the lexical merits of this argument,it is not dispositive of the issue of whether a city intent to provide senior housing can trigger the federal senior exemption.even if the city as a whole is not a housing facility or community,a municipally zoned area which the city created can be.further,as the district court recognized,b ecause the ordinance creating the municipally zoned area was enacted by the city,the relevant inquiry is the intent of the city.dist.op.at.just as the intent of a mobilehome park might be the intent of the company that owns the park or the intent of the residents who live there,the intent of a municipally zoned area is the intent of the city that created it.the city made the decision to zone the area as senior housing and provided the common set of rules that made it a community.thus,the more precise question is whether the overlay district which the city created can qualify as a housing facility or community.
neither the statute nor the committee reports on hopa define housing facility or community.we need not consider what this phrase could mean in the abstract,however,as the text and history of the provision provide some clarification as to
