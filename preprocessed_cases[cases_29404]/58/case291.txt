plaintiff asp properties group,landlord appeals a judgment in favor of defendant fard,tenant in landlord unlawful detainer action against tenant.on appeal,landlord contends the trial court erred in interpreting the lease and its amendment as not requiring tenant to install new roofs and allowing tenant to rely on affirmative defenses not pleaded in its answer.
factual and procedural background 
on march,jim lin landlord and tenant entered into a lease lease for certain commercial property located on el cajon boulevard in la mesa premises the term of the lease was from april,to march.paragraph of the lease provided that tenant would use the premises for auto sales,repair,auto related business,or other uses paragraph of the lease provided 
repairs and maintenance tenant shall maintain at his sole expense and without contribution from landlord,the p remises in good and safe condition,including,but not limited to,plate glass,electrical wiring,plumbing and heating installation.italics added.
on july,lin and tenant entered into a first amendment to the lease amendment,providing tenant with a reduction in monthly rent for the remainder of the lease term.the amendment added the following provision to paragraph of the lease regarding use of the premises 
tenant agrees to comply with any and all requirements,laws,ordinances or other mandates of the city of la mesa and at tenant expense to cure any condition,use or perform any necessary modification,maintenance or repairs as may from time to time be required by the city of la mesa,or landlord,within sixty days of receipt of written notice that such a defect,violation or other condition exists which is unacceptable to the city of la mesa or landlord.tenant failure to make any improvement,correct any condition,or otherwise comply with any written notice shall constitute a breach of this lease if tenant permits such condition,violation or use to continue on or after the day after receipt of such notice.
the amendment also replaced paragraph of the lease with the following language 
repairs and maintenance tenant shall maintain at his sole expense and without contribution from l andlord,the p remises in good and safe condition,including,but not limited to,the roof,plate glass,electrical wiring,plumbing and heating installation.
a tenant shall comply with any and all zoning regulations,laws,ordinances and other requests of the city of la mesa concerning the use,repair and maintenance of the premises as set forth in the correspondence received from the city of la mesa and any future correspondence which concern s the use maintenance and repair of the p remises.in addition to correcting the existing violation as of the date of the amendment,tenant agrees to submit a plan plan as requested by the city of la mesa for the remodel of the building to include,but not be limited to,the installation of handicap access and other changes as may be required by the city of la mesa.such plan shall be submitted to landlord for landlord consent prior to tenant submitting the plan for approval by the city of la mesa.after the plan is approved by the city of la mesa,tenant agrees that it shall implement the plan at tenant sole cost and expense,except that landlord agrees that upon approval of the plan by the city of la mesa,he shall pay tenant the sum of as landlord contribution toward the actual cost of construction required under the approved plan.any additional cost or expense in order to implement the plan,complete the construction or otherwise comply with the plan or to cure any existing or future violations as noted by the city of la mesa or landlord shall be at the sole cost and expense of the tenant.italics added.
the amendment also provided all other terms and conditions as set forth in the lease remain in full force and effect except as modified as in this first amendment.
in lin sold the premises to landlord.on may landlord hired dennis parra,a building consultant,to inspect the premises.among other observations or deficiencies,parra found the two roofs of the premises buildings were leaking badly and needed to be replaced 
on june landlord sent tenant a letter demanding that tenant complete specific modifications,maintenance or repairs within days.on or about november landlord sent tenant a notice demanding that tenant complete the modifications,maintenance and repairs or quit its possession of the premises.
on november landlord filed the instant unlawful detainer action against tenant,alleging tenant did not comply with the notice.following a bench trial,the trial court entered judgment for tenant,finding 
that the parties entered into a lease in and an amendment to that in.
from the a mendment the court gathers that there were some issues with the city of la mesa,some code violations that were likely cited and that the l andlord was concerned that the t enant should take care of those issues and that an amendment was crafted and signed.
in it appears the roof was put on the building by the testimony of landlord expert.
the life expectancy of that roof at the outside was years according to that expert.that would take us to.
the l ease was not entered into until,already beyond the life expectancy of this roof.
the expert testified this roof could not be repaired,could not be maintained and had to be replaced.
the court does not find that the language in paragraph of the amendment requiring the t enant to maintain in a good and safe condition,the roof,among other things,had the same meaning as the t enant must replace a roof that had already exceeded its life expectancy at the time tenant took possession.italics added.
the court subsequently issued supplemental findings and a statement of decision,making the following additional findings 
the amendment,drafted in by landlord predecessor attorney,provided for tenant to maintain the roof,plate glass,electrical wiring,plumbing and heating installation.the court does not find that maintain means to replace or to install initially.thus,the court finds tenant had no obligation to install a new roof or to install heating or air conditioning.when tenant entered this tenancy,the life of the roof was already expired and no heating or air conditioning had ever been installed.the court finds these were structural issues and the responsibility of the landlord,not the tenant.
based upon the testimony of landlord expert,the court finds that tenant could not further repair the men or women bathroom,a supplemental roof or the exterior until the roof was repaired.the court finds that tenant the asphalt and all other requested corrections listed in the june,letter.the court does not find that the l ease and the amendment required tenant to improve or modify anything and everything the landlord requested.the exchange between the parties was that tenant brought the property into compliance with the city of la mesa codes and expended maintaining the leasehold.
the language of the amendment is less than clear and must be construed against the drafter landlord.the court will not read into the a mendment any more than it states.it does not say that tenant must replace the roof.when the a mendment was drafted,the testimony of the witnesses was that replacing the roof was not discussed.
landlord timely filed a notice of appeal.

we generally apply an independent,or de novo,standard of review to conclusions of law regarding interpretation of the lease and the amendment.the precise meaning of any contract,including a lease,depends upon the parties expressed intent,using an objective standard.citations.when there is ambiguity in the contract language,extrinsic evidence may be considered to ascertain a meaning to which the instrument language is reasonably susceptible.citation.we review the agreement and the extrinsic evidence de novo,even if the evidence is susceptible to multiple interpretations,unless the interpretation depends upon credibility.citation.if it does,we must accept any reasonable interpretation adopted by the trial court.citation.golden west baseball city of anaheim th,d,fns.omitted.w here the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict,construction of the agreement is a question of law for our independent review.citation.appleton waessil th,d schaefer ambulance service county of san bernardino th,d t o the extent the evidence is not in conflict,we construe the instrument,and we resolve any conflicting inferences,ourselves.in contrast,i f the parol evidence is in conflict,requiring the resolution of credibility issues,we would be guided by the substantial evidence test.citation.appleton,supra,at,d.however,extrinsic evidence is not admissible to ascribe a meaning to an agreement to which it is not reasonably susceptible.wells fargo bank marshall th,d.

different standards of appellate review may be applicable to each of these two steps,depending upon the context in which an issue arises.the trial court ruling on the threshold determination of ambiguity,whether the proffered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language is reasonably susceptible is a question of law,not of fact.citation.thus the threshold determination of ambiguity is subject to independent review.citation.

trial court interpretation of the lease and amendment 
landlord contends the trial court erred in interpreting the lease and amendment not to require tenant to install new roofs.landlord argues tenant breached the lease and amendment by not replacing the roofs of the premises.
the purpose of the law of contracts is to protect the reasonable expectations of the parties.edmar th,d.a lease agreement establishing a relationship is a contract and is subject to the general rules governing the formation and interpretation of contracts.horton converse cal d,vallely investments bancamerica commercial th,d.formation of a contract requires parties capable of consent,the consent of those parties,a lawful object,and sufficient consideration.mutual assent or consent is necessary to the formation of a contract.citations.mutual assent is determined under an objective standard applied to the outward manifestations or expressions of the parties,the reasonable meaning of their words and acts,and not their unexpressed intentions or understandings.citation.mutual assent is a question of fact.citation.alexander codemasters group limited th,d.
the fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,controls judicial interpretation.citations.l anguage in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists.citation.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.interpretation of a contract must be fair and reasonable,not leading to absurd conclusions.citation.transamerica ins.sayble d.the court must avoid an interpretation which will make a contract extraordinary,harsh,unjust,or inequitable.citation.strong theis d.section provides a contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried into effect,if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.in the event other rules of interpretation do not resolve an apparent ambiguity or uncertainty,the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.stipulations which are necessary to make a contract reasonable are implied,in respect to matters concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.
at trial,the court received,at least provisionally,extrinsic evidence on the parties intended meaning of language in the lease and amendment relevant to tenant obligation to maintain the two roofs of the premises.furthermore,it may have admitted some or all of that extrinsic evidence in resolving any ambiguity of language reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning accordingly,we first apply an independent standard of review in determining whether the extrinsic evidence in this case shows the language of the lease or amendment is ambiguous,reasonably susceptible to two different meanings.pacific gas thomas drayage,supra,cal d at,winet price,supra,th at,d.
in appellate briefs,each party cites certain extrinsic evidence supporting its interpretation of the lease and amendment.because it is not our responsibility to scour the appellate record for evidence to support a party position,we consider only evidence cited by the parties in independently determining whether the language of the lease and amendment is ambiguous regarding tenant purported obligation to replace the roofs.in support of landlord argument that tenant was contractually obligated to replace the roofs,landlord cites extrinsic evidence that in tenant knew the roofs needed replacement and,pursuant to the amendment in,tenant received a rent reduction over the remaining term of the lease.landlord argues that rent reduction supports an inference tenant agreed to replace the roofs and make other improvements in exchange for the rent reduction.landlord cites lin testimony,in which he stated tenant told him the roof was leaking and tenant rent was reduced accordingly pursuant to the amendment.lin testified that tenant told him it would take care of the problems there the city of la mesa was asking sic and the roof leaking landlord also cites parra testimony that the roofs life expectancies were to years,yet the roofs were about years old 
noting tenant entered possession of the premises in about the time the roofs life expectancies expired,landlord argues tenant,in assuming obligations in the lease in and amendment in to maintain the roofs,necessarily must be obligated to replace them because at those points in time they presumably were unmaintainable.however,landlord does not cite any testimony necessarily showing the roofs were unmaintainable in or.furthermore,although parra and apparently one or more roofing contractors concluded the roofs needed to be replaced,those opinions do not show tenant maintenance obligation necessarily includes a duty to replace the roofs.
in response to landlord argument tenant was contractually obligated to replace the roofs,tenant cites extrinsic evidence supporting a finding it had no such obligation,including other testimony by lin landlord.lin testified that in negotiating the amendment he and tenant never agreed tenant would make improvements to or increase the value of the premises.also,he and tenant did not discuss the need for the roofs to be replaced,but discussed only tenant obligation to maintain and repair the roofs.tenant also cites testimony of pour apparently tenant president owner,in which he stated that at the time he negotiated the amendment and presumably the lease,he never thought tenant would be expected to install a roof,but only to maintain the roofs.pour testified that tenant had maintained the roofs over the term of the lease and had receipts showing completed roof repair work.furthermore,prior to execution of the lease,although one roofing contractor told him a new roof was required,tenant hired another contractor who repaired the roof.when pour was asked whether he understood at the time of negotiating the amendment tenant would be required to improve the premises,he answered,absolutely not.
the primary purpose of the amendment was to provide for tenant correction in exchange for the rent reduction of various code violations in the premises found by the city of la mesa,electrical,fencing,disability regulation compliance.as the trial court found,f rom the a mendment the court gathers that there were some issues with the city of la mesa,some code violations that were likely cited and that the l andlord was concerned that the t enant should take care of those issues and that an amendment was crafted and signed.the court further found the exchange between the parties was that tenant brought the premises into compliance with the city of la mesa codes and expended maintaining the leasehold.landlord apparently does not challenge that aspect of the trial court findings 
considering the extrinsic evidence in this case,tenant duty of maintenance under the lease and amendment can only be reasonably construed as requiring tenant to maintain the roofs in their conditions as of the time those written agreements were executed in and,in their conditions.had the parties intended tenant to assume the obligation to replace the roofs,one would reasonably expect the lease amendment to expressly so state rather than merely stating tenant was required to maintain the roofs and other parts of the premises.
case law supports a conclusion that,absent an express provision or undisputed extrinsic evidence showing a tenant has an obligation to replace a roof,a tenant obligation to maintain or repair the premises including a roof does not include an obligation to replace an old,dilapidated roof with a new roof at tenant expense.in iverson spang industries,d,a lease required the tenant to leave the premises in good order,condition and repair except for reasonable use and wear.id.at.iverson stated 
such covenants are generally reasonably interpreted to avoid placing any unwarranted burden of improvement on the tenant.citations.the tenant is certainly not obligated to restore the premises to his landlord in a better condition than they were at the inception of the tenancy.citations.citation.iverson,supra,d at.see also kanner globe bottling d.
in haupt la brea heating,d supp,a lease required the tenant to make whatever repairs are necessary to the floor and to repair the floor to a usable state.id.at.haupt concluded neither the lease nor statutory provisions,obligated the tenant to restore the premises to a better condition than existed at the inception of the lease.haupt,supra,at.haupt stated 
if,at the time of the letting,the roof was old and worn,certainly the tenant was not required to repair the same and should not be held liable for the cost of a new roof nor for damages occasioned by rainwater finding its way into the premises.citation.haupt,supra,d supp.at,italics added.
likewise,in lynn depue warehouse d,the court stated 
modern cases show reluctance to place too literal an interpretation on the tenant covenant to repair.the covenant will be reasonably interpreted to avoid placing any unwarranted burden of improvement of the landlord premises on the tenant.citation.
the tenant is not bound to make repairs of a substantial nature,involving the substitution of new structures,or parts thereof,for old,though these latter be defective and worn out through age.lynn,supra,d at.
in american trust truck ins.exch.d,a lease provided the tenant was required to maintain the premises including the sidewalk in good order and repair.id.at.in that case,the court stated it is thus clear that all that the tenant was required to do under the lease was to maintain the sidewalk involved in a personal injury action.to maintain means to repair or keep in good condition things that exist,and not the creation of something new.citations.there is nothing to indicate that the sidewalk was in any different condition on the date of the accident than it was at the time of entry by the tenant.see also whalen ruiz cal d,the word repair in its ordinary sense relates to preservation of property in its original condition,and does not carry the connotation that a new thing should be made.
those california cases are consistent with cases from other jurisdictions.see,calderon johnson so d,simple maintenance does not include the replacement of a system worn out because of age.chow tim lopez haw,a covenant to keep the leased premises in repair does not obligate the tenant to keep the building up as new buildings the extent of the repairs he is obliged to make necessarily depends upon the age and the class of the buildings.he need not give the landlord the benefit of a new replacement.scott prazma.in scott,which involved a lease that commenced in and required the tenant to keep the premises in good repair and condition as they then were,the wyoming supreme court stated 
the lease in this case had about seven and a half years to run at the time the tenant quit the premises.this is a relatively short time to justify the extensive repairs by the tenant,the greater benefit of which would revert to the landlord,and which are obviously inequitable and not within the contemplation of the parties.the landlord is not entitled to a remodeled building.the building had been constructed in or and as nearly as can be determined from the record,the roof and roof structure are the original,as are the eaves,rain
