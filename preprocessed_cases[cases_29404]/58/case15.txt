this litigation has its genesis in a purchase and sale agreement the p s executed on may.under it,the kenneth mcculloch and two corporations wholly owned by him mandorico,and tip top donuts,agreed to purvey,inter alia,a baked goods manufacturing business located in puerto rico and certain equipment associated therewith to norberto vélez malavé,his wife,their conjugal partnership,and caribbean bakers,collectively,the purchasers or the defendants.the sellers also agreed to assign,and the purchasers agreed to assume,an existing lease for the business premises between the puerto rico industrial development corporation as lessor and tip top donuts as lessee 
the p s required the purchasers to make installment payments and granted the sellers the right to retrieve the business and the equipment if the purchasers committed an event of default and failed to remedy it within a specified cure period.mcculloch alleges that an uncured default occurred in or around may of.in all events,he took an assignment from mandorico of its rights under the p s and,together with his wife and their conjugal partnership,filed suit in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.federal jurisdiction was premised on diversity of citizenship the mccullochs are citizens of new york and the defendants are citizens of puerto rico and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount.a.the complaint charged that the defendants had defaulted on the p s and owed in unpaid installments,at least as the value of equipment entrusted to them,and at least in back rent.
in due course,the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.the defendants opposed the motion.they also moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to.b and.b.that motion questioned the district court subject matter jurisdiction on two grounds,namely,i whether the plaintiffs had made a claim for an amount sufficient to give the court jurisdiction,and ii whether true diversity existed in view of the defendants assertion that mandorico a corporation organized under the laws of puerto rico was an indispensable party the real party in interest on the plaintiffs side of the case.
on september,a magistrate judge recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied.he opined that the requirement had been satisfied and that mandorico was not an indispensable party.the defendants objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.while that objection was pending,the plaintiffs moved to enjoin the defendants from continuing to occupy the business premises and from removing any equipment.they also filed a second motion for summary judgment which apparently superseded their earlier summary judgment motion.
the district court reviewed the magistrate judge report and recommendation de novo.b,and granted the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.mcculloch vélez malavé,d.the court did not,however,place its principal reliance on the arguments advanced by the defendants,but,rather,focused on mandorico assignment of rights to mcculloch and concluded that the assignment was an improper attempt to create federal jurisdiction where none existed.id.at.consequently,the assignment had to be disregarded for jurisdictional purposes.id.at citing.only then did the court revert to the original grounds raised in the motion to dismiss it concluded that,stripped of the assignment,mandorico would become an indispensable party whose joinder would destroy diversity the plaintiffs could not establish damages in a sum sufficient to satisfy the requirement.id.at.accordingly,the court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.consistent with that ruling,the court denied as moot the pending motions for injunctive relief and for summary judgment.id.
this appeal ensued after the district court rejected a timely motion for reconsideration.e.the plaintiffs advance no fewer than five separate assignments of error.they claim that the lower court erred by i precluding mcculloch from serving as ii dismissing the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction iii denying the motion for reconsideration iv denying the motion for a preliminary injunction and v denying the motion for summary judgment.we start with a preliminary point and then address the first two claims of error.for reasons that will become apparent,we stop there.
we begin by sorting out wheat from chaff.when several plaintiffs with separate and distinct demands join together in a single suit premised on diversity jurisdiction,each plaintiff must independently satisfy the requirement.see zahn int l paper,d clark paul gray.here,mcculloch,his wife,and their conjugal partnership appear as plaintiffs and appellants.they have gone to great lengths in attempting to establish that mcculloch has a claim in the requisite amount.there is nothing in the record,however,to show that any plaintiff other than mcculloch fulfills the requirement neither mcculloch wife nor their conjugal partnership is a party to the p s or to the assignment from mandorico.nor is there any evidence that these two plaintiffs have some sort of common or undivided interest in the amounts claimed by mcculloch.accordingly,we are bound to dismiss the appeal as to both mcculloch wife and the conjugal partnership.see zahn,at.see also united states zannino,cir warning that claims advanced without developed argumentation are deemed abandoned.the appeal proceeds only to mcculloch behoof.
we need not linger long over mcculloch asserted right to represent himself.mcculloch is both a lawyer and a member of the bar of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.thus,he ordinarily would have a right,in that capacity,to enter his appearance as counsel in a pending case.but this case is out of the ordinary in that mcculloch is a principal in the transaction that underlies the litigation.he has been deposed at length,and there is every reason to expect that he would be one of the main witnesses should a trial ensue.a lawyer is under an ethical obligation to refrain from appearing as counsel in a case in which he reasonably can anticipate that he will be called as a percipient witness.see aba model rules of prof l conduct a see also a formerly rule b incorporating the aba model rules to govern attorney conduct in the district of puerto rico.given the salience of that apothegm,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit mcculloch to act as in this matter.see hutchinson spanierman,cir see also united states merlino,cir.
nor did mcculloch have a right to appear as in his personal capacity,pro se.he has by other counsel in the district court proceedings.a party has a right to represent himself or to be represented by an attorney,but he can not have it both ways.there is no right to hybrid representation in the federal courts.united states campbell,cir united states nivica,cir.
to be sure,hybrid representation occasionally may be permitted in the trial court discretion.nivica,at.such largesse is,however,to be dispensed sparingly.id.there is nothing in the record that suggests that this case should come within the exception to this general rule.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying mcculloch plaint for what amounts to hybrid representation.
we turn next to the district court jurisdictional ruling.the key component of the court analysis was its determination that mandorico assignment of rights to mcculloch did not pass muster under.that statute is an measure,enacted to prevent parties from manufacturing diversity jurisdiction in order to channel litigation from the local courts into a federal forum.see kramer caribbean mills,d.in terms,the statute strips the district court of jurisdiction over any civil action in which any party,by assignment or otherwise,has been improperly or collusively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court.
the district court decision to delve into the bona fides of the assignment can not be faulted.it is law that a federal court has an obligation to inquire sua sponte into its own subject matter jurisdiction.in re recticel foam,cir.h.this obligation,coupled with the e
