background 
the hotel san diego was a weathered octogenarian by august,a building in the heart of downtown san diego which was beginning to show signs of its age.what it lacked in aesthetics and upkeep it made up for in abutted san diego federal courthouse,and sat just across the street from the municipal courthouse.its location attracted various restauranteurs,including the appellants,josephson management company josephson and sushi deli express,sushi deli.
josephson operated a chain of some burger king franchises,nine bruegger bagels shops,five tony roma restaurants,and a hooligan restaurant in four states.josephson thought the hotel san diego location would be prime for a burger king franchise which catered to the downtown lunchtime traffic,and on march,signed a lease with western sun san diego,western sun,the predecessor to the current owner,appellee sdh properties,llc sdh.the lease provided for a term,plus four successive options.josephson agreed to provide all the improvements and furniture,fixtures and equipment ff e necessary to operate a burger king restaurant.in exchange,josephson received a very favorable base rent of per square foot,approximately half that charged in nearby locations.
in addition,the lease dealt with the prospect of an eminent domain condemnation,which was a distinct possibility given the building prime location near multiple courthouses in the downtown area.specifically,paragraph provided that josephson would be entitled to receive compensation for the undepreciated value of its improvements and ff e,plus the loss of goodwill to the extent proven by tenant.in exchange,josephson agreed to forgo its right to the bonus value of the unexpired term of the lease.
josephson fulfilled its obligations under the lease for twelve years.it substantially renovated the premises by strengthening the floor of the restaurant,constructing new restrooms and a new mezzanine,razing and rebuilding the interior,and adding a new heating and cooling system.it built a substantial customer base for its burger king by capitalizing on the central downtown location,which produced a ready supply of lunch patrons throughout the workweek.
sushi deli arrived at the hotel san diego a bit later.sushi deli owner and president,hiroe otake,was recruited to the hotel san diego by western sun principal,glass,in.otake and her husband,moto,had overseen the maturation of a small,square foot sushi restaurant into a local cultural institution which,by,was prepared to expand.sushi deli,like josephson,was enamored with the location of the hotel,particularly its proximity to the various downtown courthouses.ultimately,after some months of negotiations,sushi deli entered into a lease with western sun on september.sushi deli lease,like josephson,contained a provision concerning the effect of an eminent domain proceeding,article.article reserved to sushi deli the right to recover its ratable percentage also known as bonus value of any condemnation award or settlement.
like josephson,sushi deli occupied the premises at the hotel san diego without incident.it too built up a loyal customer base,which contributed to its profitability during the years it occupied the hotel.when sushi deli became aware of the imminent eminent domain proceedings,it began its own search for a suitable building in which to relocate.sushi deli eventually moved its operations to the spreckels theater building,approximately two blocks away from the hotel san diego.unfortunately,the move entailed significant costs.for about half the space it had in the hotel san diego,sushi deli was now paying twice the rent.its customer base began to erode,and it has suffered substantial financial losses since the relocation.
on august,the hotel san diego was officially condemned by the united states in an eminent domain proceeding.united states acres of land,et.no party challenged the condemnation,and none of the parties before this court has any outstanding claims against the government in that regard.rather,both josephson and sushi deli chose to pursue claims against sdh in the apportionment stage of the condemnation proceedings,pursuant to the terms of their respective leases.each alleged that they were entitled to share in the million settlement obtained by sdh as just compensation for the taking.
on june,judge james singleton issued his decision,which sided with appellee sdh.the district court concluded that neither josephson nor sushi deli had any basis for a claim against sdh independent of the condemnation award from the united states.specifically,it determined that the plain language of the josephson lease contemplated compensation only to the extent that josephson interests were specifically provided for by the condemning authority.moreover,although it failed to specifically address the language of the sushi lease,the district court concluded that no bonus value had been proven,and that the fact that rental rates were below market value was merely a reflection of the poor quality of the hotel san diego building.
in general,interpretation of the language of a contract is a question of law which is reviewed on a de novo basis,with no deference accorded to the decision of the district court.in re tamen,cir warehouse transfer burlington northern,cir.this is particularly true where the intent of the parties is easily ascertainable from the clear and explicit language of the contract.cal.civ.code bank of the west superior court,cal.conversely,when the district court renders an opinion on a contract language which is premised on extrinsic evidence,the court findings of fact must be upheld unless clearly erroneous.tamen,at.
the parties to this case have disputed the appropriate standard of review to which the decision of the district court should be subject.their dispute turns on the issue of whether the district court decision in the instant matter was a purely legal interpretation of the plain language of the lease agreements,or was arrived at through the consideration of extrinsic facts.
the district court order regarding the interpretation of the language of the josephson lease can best be described as a conclusion of law,which must therefore be reviewed de novo.very little extrinsic evidence was adduced at trial in fact,the only testimony regarding the appropriate interpretation of the lease was offered by julian josephson,the principal of the josephson management company.however,in arriving at its ultimate decision,the district court declined to rely upon that testimony,reasoning that it could not reconcile josephson testimony with the plane sic language of the lease.rather,the court concluded that it was satisfied that this particular lease did not compel sdh to compensate josephson for any loss.thus,because the district court did not rely on any extrinsic evidence in rendering its decision with regard to josephson claim under the lease,its decision must be reviewed on a de novo basis.
the district court findings with regard to the interpretation of sushi deli lease with sdh were sparse at best.the court concluded that it could find no basis for a claim by the tenants against the landlord independent of the condemnation award from the united states.though it failed to make the basis for its argument explicit,the district court must have concluded that the express language of article,which provided that any condemnation award shall be the property of both the landlord and the tenant in proportion to the respective possessory interests,did not afford sushi deli the right to any residual bonus value of the lease otherwise,there would have been some basis for the claim asserted.therefore,the district court interpretation of the sushi deli lease agreement must be reviewed on a de novo basis,with no deference accorded to its finding.tamen,at,at.
contrary to the standard of review applicable to a district court evaluation of the language of a lease,when the court interpretation of a lease provision is based upon the consideration of extrinsic evidence,the decision is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.tamen,at.the court decision will be upheld unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.easley cromartie,d see also hernandez new york,d where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.
discussion 
since the district court rendered its decision regarding the merits of the underlying claims based principally on the express language of the respective lease agreements,we now consider on a de novo basis whether each of the appellants presented a valid claim entitling it to compensation from the appellee.to the extent that its decision regarding the interpretation of either lease was premised on extrinsic evidence,we review the district court determination for clear error.
on march,following approximately six months of negotiations,josephson and western sun entered into a lease agreement.paragraph of that lease provided 
in the event of eminent domain,josephson shall be entitled to receive the following i a sum attributable to the undepreciated value of all improvements and or alterations made to the premises by josephson in accordance with this lease ii a sum attributable to the undepreciated value of all furniture,fixtures and equipment installed on the premises except to the extent fully salvageable and,iii compensation for loss of goodwill to the extent proven by josephson.any and all other amounts awarded shall be payable to sdh it is expressly understood and agreed that in the event of a taking or partial taking,and whether or not this lease is terminated,josephson shall have no claim in respect to the award or payment for the value of the unexpired term of this lease.
the primary bone of contention between sdh and josephson is the extent to which josephson is entitled to receive compensation from sdh,rather than from the condemning authority.sdh argues that josephson is not entitled to collect payment from sdh for either the loss of goodwill,or the undepreciated value of improvements or ff 
loss of goodwill 
sdh contends that the language of paragraph was merely an affirmation of josephson right to receive,in accordance with california law,compensation from the state for lost goodwill.see cal.code civ.proc.a the owner of a business conducted on the property taken shall be compensated for loss of goodwill.sdh points out that the lease agreement was drafted to be governed by california law,suggesting that loss of goodwill was only compensable to the extent provided for under california law.josephson,by contrast,argues that sdh interpretation would render paragraph mere surplusage.
under california law,contracts are to be interpreted as a unified whole,with effect given to each provision to the greatest extent possible.cal.code civ.proc.courts interpreting the language of contracts should give effect to every provision,and an interpretation which renders part of the instrument to be surplusage should be avoided.appalachian ins.mcdonnell douglas,d,see also united states hathaway,cir a fundamental rule of construction is that a court must give effect to every word or term employed by the parties and reject none as meaningless or surplusage in arriving at the intention of the contracting parties.if paragraph were intended to be nothing more than a recitation of rights to which josephson was already entitled under california law,its inclusion in a lease governing the rights of the parties one another as landlord and tenant would be unnecessary.section authorizes a tenant who operates a business on condemned property to recover goodwill from the state condemning authority,regardless of whether or not a contractual provision purports to confer that right.thus,to interpret paragraph in such a manner would effectively render it mere surplusage.
in addition,sdh reading of paragraph is inconsistent with the provision of that paragraph which relates to bonus value.in paragraph,josephson waives its right to recover any compensation for the bonus value of the unexpired term of th e lease.the bonus value of a lease,like lost goodwill,is recoverable under california law as part of the condemnation award.cal.code civ.proc.see also new haven unified sch.dist.taco bell,d,where the lease rental falls below market value,the lessor will have a claim to less than the full market value of the property,since he is restricted to the present value of actual contract rental but the lessee will have a right to recover the balance of the market value,above that recovered by the lessor,as lease bonus value.if indeed paragraph is intended simply to make explicit the rights to which josephson would be entitled under california law,the waiver of its right to recover the bonus value of the lease would be odd,to say the least.it is almost unfathomable that a lease agreement would require a tenant to forsake rights it has against the state,particularly when that waiver occurs immediately after a statement of the tenant other preserved rights against the state.the much more plausible interpretation would be that paragraph was intended to define the rights of the contracting parties one another.
finally,sdh interpretation completely ignores the implicit quid pro quo of paragraph.as sdh concedes,josephson would be entitled to receive compensation from the state condemning authority for the loss of goodwill.in addition,josephson would be entitled to a share of any award made to sdh in the amount of the bonus value of the lease.given that the lease was negotiated by experienced attorneys representing sophisticated businesspeople,it confounds the imagination to conclude that josephson would simply waive its statutory right to the bonus value of the lease without receiving something in return.
paragraph represents josephson bargained for exchange.sdh promised to compensate josephson for the loss of business goodwill,perhaps in the event that it was the federal rather than the state government which condemned the property.under federal law,as opposed to california law,tenants are not entitled to compensation for the loss of goodwill in eminent domain actions.united states general motors.recognizing that possibility,josephson in turn agreed to forgo its right to the bonus value of the lease,to which it was entitled under both state and federal law,essentially ceding that amount of compensation to the landlord.new haven,d at gawzner lebenbaum,cir implying that bonus value is available in eminent domain actions instituted by the united states,since the tenant right of recovery was not limited to the bonus value.in order to ensure that,if the federal government was the condemning authority,it would still be able to collect for the loss of goodwill,in paragraph josephson relinquished its right to the bonus value of the lease.no other interpretation of paragraph is sensible.
thus,the district court erred in concluding that paragraph was nothing more than a recitation of josephson rights under california eminent domain law.the appropriate reading of paragraph is that josephson is entitled to receive compensation for its lost goodwill from its landlord,sdh.
however,because of its interpretation of paragraph,the district court chose not to render an opinion regarding the value of the lost goodwill,which josephson is required to prove under the terms of its lease tenant shall be entitled to receive iii compensation for loss of goodwill to the extent proven by tenant.emphasis added.though josephson presented the testimony of an appraiser who valued the goodwill of the burger king operated by josephson in the hotel san diego at,the appraiser did not con
