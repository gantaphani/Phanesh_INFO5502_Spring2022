ii.statutory and contractual attorney fee provisions 
the introductory language in section provides except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties similarly,the introductory language in section b is of the same effect,stating,except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.under section a,attorney fees are allowable as costs when authorized by contract,statute,or law.
here,dorsey contends the cap on attorney fees in section c is a statutory exception within these introductory parts of sections and.he asserts that as a result,attorney fees incurred on appeal in a small claims case are governed by section and parties can not contract otherwise.
dorsey cites two cases that discuss the interplay between a statutory right to attorney fees and a potentially conflicting contractual prevailing party attorney fee clause.in carver chevron,th carver,service station franchisees brought an action against chevron alleging,among other things,breach of their gas station lease agreements and violations of the cartwright act bus,et.the lease agreements contained an attorney fee clause.after the franchisees lost on appeal,the trial court awarded chevron more than million in attorney fees for defending both contract and cartwright act claims.
the cartwright act contains a unilateral fees clause,providing for an award of fees to any person who is injured by enumerated statutory violations,but no reciprocal right on the part of a prevailing defendant to any award incurred in successfully defending the cartwright act claim.carver,supra,th at.this court reversed and remanded for reduction of the amount of the attorney fee award incurred in defending the cartwright act claims.we held the trial court award of defense fees for those claims under the contract was erroneously attempting to override the legislature intention to provide such recovery by statute.carver,at.
the appellate court in county of sacramento sandison th sandison faced a similar legal issue,but in an entirely different statutory context and reached the opposite result.there,the county of sacramento and a property owner entered into a settlement agreement with a stipulated injunction and a prevailing party attorney fee clause.the county later sought to enforce the injunction,lost,and the owner recovered in attorney fees under the contract.
government code section,subdivision c,pertaining to abatement of a nuisance,provided that in no action shall an award of attorneys fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the county in the action or proceeding.the county argued this statute limited recovery under the parties contractual prevailing party attorney fee clause.however,the sandison court rejected the argument because government code section,subdivision b provided that recovery of costs pursuant to this section shall be in addition to and shall not limit any prevailing party right to recover costs pursuant to sections and of the code of civil procedure or any other provision of law.thus,because recovery of costs under code of civil procedure section a includes attorney fees when authorized by contract,government code section,subdivision b itself provided that a recovery of attorney fees authorized by contract was to be in addition to,and not limited by,government code section,subdivision c.sandison,supra,th at.
the sandison court distinguished carver and summarized the applicable rule as follows 
t he question is whether the statutory attorney fee provision expressly,or the policy of the statute implicitly,overrides the freedom to contract for a different outcome.sandison,supra,th at.
accordingly,our task is to interpret section c to determine if it expressly,or the policy of the small claims statutes implicitly,overrides the freedom to contract for a higher amount of attorney fees incurred in a small claims court appeal.

rules of statutory interpretation 
the supreme court reiterated the rules of statutory interpretation as follows when we interpret a statute,o ur fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.bridges city of wildomar th.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretatio
