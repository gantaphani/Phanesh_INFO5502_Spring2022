factual and procedural background 
a.the federal assisted housing program 
the federal government provides rental assistance for low and moderate income families,the elderly,and the disabled through what is known as the section program.congress added the section program to the united states housing act of in by enacting the housing and community development act of,a,stat,codified as amended at.the express congressional purpose of the section program is aiding families in obtaining a decent place to live and promoting economically mixed housing.a.the program is managed federally by hud,and administered locally by public housing authorities pha.section tenants must sign a lease and pay a portion of their income toward rent.the remainder of the rent charge is paid by pha pursuant to a housing assistance payment hap contract between pha and the owner,which mandates that a lease shall be for a term of not less than one year,id.o a,shall contain terms and conditions that are consistent with state and local law,id.o b ii i,and shall provide that during the term of the lease,the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease,for violation of applicable federal,state,or local law,or for other good cause,id.o c.
there are two relevant variations of assisted housing voucher subsidies.under the standard housing choice voucher program,the voucher is portable.the tenant may choose to live in any property if the landlord agrees to accept the voucher and comply with the applicable regulations.the government subsidy is limited to the difference between the amount the family is required to contribute and the payment standard established by pha based on fair market rents for the area.id.o b,o a b.
the second program is called the enhanced voucher program,a recent legislative creation aimed at keeping tenants in their homes despite changing market conditions.beginning in the,the federal government subsidized and insured mortgage loans for the construction of housing for assisted tenants section program.see housing and urban development act of,a,a g,stat,codified as amended at.owners of the housing were allowed to prepay their loans after twenty years,at which time they could exit the assisted housing program.a ii.in the,congress became concerned that a large proportion of assisted housing would disappear from the market when owners prepaid their section loans.to prevent massive relocation and an inadequate supply of assisted housing,congress passed a number of laws aimed at restricting the prepayment option.see low income housing preservation and resident homeownership act of,a,stat,emergency low income housing preservation act of,title ii,stat.in,however,congress decided to take a different approach.it allowed landlords to prepay their mortgages but increased the available subsidy to fair market value so as to allow the subsidized tenants to remain in the same apartment after prepayment.see,stat,currently codified as amended at t thus,the enhanced voucher authority provides that the assisted family may elect to remain in the same project in which the family was residing on the date the loan was prepaid,and that the government will pay the difference between rent for the dwelling unit and the tenant required contribution during any period the family makes such an election and continues to so reside even as rent may be increased from.t b.
as evidenced by the congressional statement of purpose,congress and hud have been perennially concerned about making assisted housing available and affordable,and a key means to that end is the creation of incentives for private owners to participate in the section program.in legislation enacted in,congress protected tenants from arbitrary eviction by giving the local pha the sole right to give notice to vacate and to evict the tenant.housing and community development act of,a,stat,see also swann gastonia hous,cir.in response to owner complaints about this additional burden,hud proposed in that congress harmonize the private and assisted markets by eliminating pha approval where state or local law governing evictions affords adequate tenant protection.hearings before the subcomm.on hous.cmty.dev.of the comm.on banking,fin.urban affairs,cong.statement of patricia harris,hud sec y.congress refused,noting that adoption of the proposal would leave section tenants to rely on state and municipal laws for protection,and the committee does not feel that hud has provided ample information on the extent to which this protection would be sufficient,at,reprinted in.to ameliorate the burden on owners within the bounds of existing law,hud issued a proposed regulation that required pha to proceed with issuance of the eviction notice in accordance with state and local law as long as grounds to do so existed.
in,hud again proposed that congress remove the pha approval requirement and legislate that state and local law govern assisted tenants procedural and substantive rights.hearings before the subcomm.on hous.cmty.dev.of the comm.on banking,fin.urban affairs,cong.while the senate agreed to eliminate the pha requirement and make procedural and substantive rights of the assisted tenant s the same as those applicable to tenants in order to encourage more owners to participate,reprinted in,the unsure that state and local law would provide sufficient not.congress reached a compromise later that year by eliminating the pha approval requirement but explicitly amending the senate version to add that the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease,applicable state,local or federal law,or for other good cause,at,reprinted in,codified as amended at d b ii.this new condition barring owners from evicting a tenant or from refusing to renew a lease without cause became known as the endless lease requirement.
hud issued an interim implementing rule in,withdrawing its earlier regulation permitting termination on thirty days notice,and specifying that good cause was needed to terminate a tenancy or to refuse to renew.it excused the owner from the good cause requirement if it wished to withdraw a unit from the section program at the end of the lease term.id.at.finally,it expressly refused to define good cause,providing that a pplication of the statutory standards to particular cases should be determined by the courts on a basis.id.
hud final rule,issued in,continued to require good cause for all terminations and nonrenewals,march.in addressing owners comments about the creation of a perpetual tenancy terminable only for cause,hud noted that it shares the concern that the new requirement could reduce the desire of private landlords to offer units for rental under the program,but that the program options open to hud must accord with the statutory prohibition of a termination of tenancy in section existing housing other than for statutory good cause grounds.id.it further indicated its desire to keep t enancy requirements as simple as possible,with minimal demands on the owner beyond the normal requirements of an unsubsidized tenancy.id.at.finally,it indicated that a comp re hensive regulatory definition of good cause is neither possible nor desirable,and,therefore,t he good cause category should remain open to case by case determination by the courts.id.however,for the first time,hud chose to provide examples of other good cause,including among them a business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy such as desire to rent the unit at a higher rental.id.at.this definition is currently codified at d iv,the federal regulation before us.
in,the national apartment association commissioned a report by abt associates on assisted housing abt report.it recommended making the section process as similar to regular market operations as possible by eliminating the good cause requirement for nonrenewal and retaining protections provided to all renters in the local jurisdiction.thereafter,landlord groups pushed for the adoption of the abt report recommendations,including the elimination of the endless lease provision,claiming that s ection families should get all the protections that their nonsubsidized friends and neighbors receive but no greater protections.hearing on before subcomm.on hous.cmty.opportunity of comm.on banking,fin.urban affairs,wl,testimony of christina garcia,vice president of wildwood mgmt.group.
hud final rule provides that the good cause requirement applies during the term of the assisted lease,but not after a termination of the assisted lease,july,and emphasizes that its regulation strikes a reasonable balance between the interest of the assisted tenant and the owner because the lease protects the tenant against arbitrary and ungrounded termination by the owner,while the owner is not locked in,but may terminate the tenant for lease violation or other good cause,including a business or economic reason,id.at.
in,congress repealed the endless lease provision by eliminating the good cause requirement for nonrenewal,though it retained the requirement for termination of a tenancy during the term of the lease,c,stat.in,congress made the changes permanent,a,stat.the current governing statute provides that during the term of the lease,the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease,for violation of applicable federal,state,or local law,or for other good cause.o c.in,hud issued final implementing regulations,leaving its definition of good cause unchanged.thus,the relevant hud regulation currently provides that o ther good cause may include,but is not limited to a business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy such as sale of the property,renovation of the unit,or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental.d iv.the regulations also provide that d uring the initial lease term,the owner may not terminate the tenancy for other good cause,based on a business or economic reason,id.d,and that the initial lease term must be at least one year,id.a.
the city of los angeles adopted larso in.it is a comprehensive rent and eviction control ordinance,which creates an exception to the general rule allowing terminations at the end of a lease term.its express purpose is to regulate rents so as to safeguard tenants from excessive rent increases,while at the same time providing landlords with just and reasonable returns from their rental units.under larso,landlords and tenants may set the initial terms of the tenancy,including the rental rate,id.at c,but thereafter,the landlord may only increase the rent in small increments each year,absent special permission,id.most importantly,larso restricts possible grounds for eviction to thirteen enumerated reasons,including violation of material terms of the lease,damage to property,or criminal activity.id.a.the only reasons are renovation,removal of the unit from the rental market,or placement of a family member or resident manager into the unit.id.a.expiration of the lease term or the desire to raise rent to current market levels with a new tenant are not permissible grounds for eviction.through vacancy decontrol,however,when a tenant voluntarily leaves or is lawfully evicted,the landlord may raise the rent to market levels.id.though some public housing is exempt,larso specifically applies to rental units for which rental assistance is paid pursuant to the housing choice voucher program codified at cfr part.rental units.
factual and procedural background 
the parties have stipulated to the relevant facts.appellees are tenants tenants residing in morton gardens,an apartment complex in los angeles,california,managed by appellant morton llc.all tenants reside in apartments covered by larso.the building of morton gardens was financed through a section loan,which was prepaid in.sixteen of the tenants were residing in morton gardens at that time and received enhanced voucher subsidies enhanced voucher tenants.the other six tenants,who moved into morton gardens after the prepayment,rent their apartments with the standard housing choice vouchers standard voucher tenants.the housing authority for the city of los angeles hacla administers tenants subsidies pursuant to hap contracts with morton.
on march,morton served each tenant with a notice of withdrawal from section assisted housing program and notice of change in terms of your tenancy,informing tenants of its intention to remove the subject premises from the federally assisted section housing program and to rent the unit at market rents withdrawal notices.responding to tenant complaints,hacla and the los angeles housing department informed morton that,absent the tenants consent,the hap contracts could be terminated only upon lawful eviction of the tenants under state and local law.morton therefore rescinded the withdrawal notices and issued ninety day notices to terminate tenancy eviction notices.the eviction notices informed tenants that 
t he grounds for termination of your tenancy are based upon paragraph of your housing assistance payments contract and cfr d iv,which allows the landlord to terminate the rental agreement for a business or economic reason,including but not limited to,the desire to of the tenant based section program and or the desire to lease the unit at a higher rental rate.prior to the service of this notice,the landlord made a business decision to no longer participate in the section voucher program for your unit.
tenants filed this action in the district court for the central district of california,seeking a declaratory judgment that the eviction notices violated federal law and larso,and a permanent injunction barring unlawful eviction of tenants.the parties stipulated to a preliminary injunction.the district court granted summary judgment to tenants,entered a permanent injunction barring morton from evicting tenants without complying with larso and the enhanced voucher provisions,denied morton motion for reconsideration,and granted tenants attorney fees.morton timely appeals

iii.discussion 
the district court granted summary judgment to tenants,concluding that the eviction notices violated the enhanced voucher tenants statutory right to remain in their apartments despite rent increases under t b that larso and hud are in actual conflict,but that hud definition of good cause,insofar as it includes the desire to raise the rent,exceeded hud statutory authority we affirm summary judgment and the entry of the permanent injunction on somewhat different grounds.see sec.life ins.of am.meyling,cir per curiam w e can affirm on any ground supported by the record.though we agree that the eviction violated the enhanced voucher tenants right to remain,we hold that larso is not preempted by hud good cause regulation because it does not actually conflict with the federal regulation.
federal preemption of larso 
the district court held that larso actually conflicts with hud good cause regulation because it takes away a right specifically granted by the hud regulation.it granted summary judgment to tenants,however,because it concluded that hud definition of good cause insofar as it includes the desire to raise the unreasonable and manifestly contrary to the statute,and therefore exceeded hud authority.we do not agree that larso and the hud regulation actually conflict.the hud regulation does not create a right to evict tenants to raise the rent that larso takes away.the hud regulation merely creates a floor of protection,which local laws may enhance.thus,although we disagree with the district court preemption analysis,we do agree that larso controls morton ability to evict tenants when morton desires to raise the rent.
the preemption doctrine is rooted in the supremacy clause of the constitution,art.vi,cl.t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.medtronic,lohr,d alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.morton does not suggest that congress expressly preempted state law or intended federal law exclusively to occupy the field of lease terminations.see english,d.state law,however,is also nullified to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.such a conflict arises when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also wyeth levine,d.

applying de la cuesta,we consider whether the agency intended to preempt the local law and whether larso stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of congressional purposes.
hud did not intend to preempt local eviction controls 
in reaching its conclusion that hud never explicitly intended to preempt state and local eviction restrictions,the district court found that the central purpose of the good cause regulation was to mirror the private rental market so as to encourage owner participation.that conclusion is supported by both the language and the legislative history of the good cause regulation.when hud prompted congress to eliminate the requirement of pha approval for eviction in and,it sought to make assisted tenancies as similar to unassisted tenancies as possible.similarly,when congress instituted the other good cause requirement in,hud initially declined to define good cause,instead providing that a pplication of the statutory standards to particular cases should be determined by the courts,normally in the course of the eviction proceeding brought by the owner.at.
when hud did create the good cause definition,it again reassured owners that it was trying to make assisted tenancies as simple as possible,with minimal demands on the owner beyond the normal requirements of an unsubsidized tenancy,or as similar to the private market as possible.at.it explained that a comp re hensive regulatory definition of good cause is neither possible nor desirable.id.thus,it emphasized that its definition constituted only examples of cases that may be good cause and reiterated its position that t he good cause category should remain open to case by case determination by the courts.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.nothing in this language indicates that hud intended to prevent certain state laws from operating in such determinations in state courts.
it is true that no regulation expressly allows the operation of local eviction controls on assisted tenancies,while a hud regulation expressly subjects section rent reasonableness determinations to local rent control.see.that regulation,however,is a specific directive to local phas in setting reasonable rent.the lack of a similar express directive to state courts to apply local eviction controls in determining whether good cause exists to evict assisted tenants,aside from the questionable permissibility of such a directive,does not itself suggest that state courts should reject local eviction controls.in fact,the preemption of larso would nullify,because an owner would be able to escape rent control by evicting tenants in order to raise their rent.in other words,as tenants persuasively argue,the preemption of local eviction controls by hud good cause regulation would lead to absurd results in a vacancy decontrol jurisdiction like california,because it would make assisted tenants special victims of eviction by landlords desiring to take advantage of vacancy decontrol to raise rents.we refuse to construe l egislative enactments as establishing statutory schemes that are illogical,unjust,or capricious.bechtel,united of carpenters,cir.thus,the district court correctly held that hud did not specifically intend to preempt local eviction laws with its good cause regulation.
the hud regulation and larso do not actually conflict 
we disagree with the district court conclusion that the hud regulation and larso actually conflict.the hud regulation does not grant a right to terminate a tenancy based on a desire to increase rents.nor does larso otherwise present an obstacle to the accomplishment of federal objectives 
the goals of the hud regulation and larso,as expressed in the purposes of each governing statute,are the increase the availability and affordability of housing.compare a,with.morton argues that hud goal in defining good cause was to encourage owner participation in the section program,an objective not found in larso this argument is illogical,however,as hud and congress have deemed owner participation an important means to the ultimate end of providing housing,but not a goal in itself.thus,while hud may have listed examples of good cause in order to provide explicit regulatory assurance to prospective section owners that legitimate owner concerns will be recognized as grounds for termination of tenancy.at,the fact remains that the same regulation specified that good cause is determined in local landlord tenant courts,id.at.any agency assurance that it considers the desire to raise the rent as good cause to terminate a lease is,by the very terms of the regulation,necessarily subject to evaluation by state courts,which are also required to apply local law.
as evidenced by a variety of legislative enactments,such as the provision for pha approval of evictions and the good cause requirement at issue here,congress and hud intended to provide assisted tenants with more protections than unassisted tenants,not less.congress only rejected the application of substantive state and local law to section lease terminations when asked to eliminate federal controls over such terminations altogether.compare,reprinted in,with,at,reprinted in.thus,it refused to allow substantive state and local law to supplant wholly federal termination standards.by enacting the federal good cause requirement,it desired to maintain a uniform federal floor below which protections for tenants could not drop,not a ceiling above which they could not rise.importantly,congress and hud never explicitly rejected the application of more protective local standards to assisted tenants,and,in certain cases,expressly allowed for it.see,o d vi n othing in this section shall be construed to supersede any provision of any federal,state,or local law that provides greater protection than this section for victims of domestic violence d nothing in part is intended to operation of state and local laws that prohibit discrimination against a section because of status as a section.
in determining whether a state law presents an obstacle to the full implementation of a federal law,however,it is not enough to say that the ultimate goal of both federal and state law is the same.int l paper ouellette,d.a state law also is if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach this goal.id.
for example,in de la cuesta,a federal regulation permitted the inclusion of clauses in mortgages allowing lenders to make the entire loan immediately payable upon transfer of property,and expressly stated that it preempted state laws to the contrary.at.california courts had created a state law doctrine to the contrary.id.at.in addition to concluding that the federal regulation expressly preempted the state doctrine,the supreme court found that the two actually conflicted.id.at.it held that while compliance with both was not physically impossible because the federal regulation only permitted,and did not require,the conduct that the state doctrine forbade,the state doctrine presented an obstacle to the federal objective because the state courts have deprived the regulated party of the flexibility given it by the federal regulations.id.
by contrast,in chevron,hammond,cir,owners of oil tankers challenged a state regulation forbidding the discharge of any ballast or the state shores,claiming that it was preempted by federal agency regulations that expressly permitted the discharge of clean ballast water close to shore.id.at.we found no actual conflict because the goals of the two regulations were the same,id.at,and because it was not physically impossible to comply with both,id.at.we recognized that the state law prohibits acts that the federal regulations allow but do not require.id.at.we further noted that a finding of preemption is particularly inappropriate when the state is regulating conduct permitted by federal regulation,but only as an exception to a broad federal prohibition.id.citing exxon governor of,d.we then distinguished de la cuesta,on the ground that in hammond,the state is merely eliminating one exception to a general federal prohibition,rather than asserting authority over an area in direct conflict with overriding federal policy.id.at.
the district court reasoned that this case presents a question more like the one in de la cuesta than in hammond,because,as in de la cuesta,where the state deprived owners of the flexibility in choosing whether to utilize the clauses,larso deprived owners of the flexibility in choosing whether to terminate tenants in order to increase the rent.de la cuesta and hammond,however,suggest the opposite reading.the federal agency in hammond set forth an exception clean discharge permissible to a federal prohibition no discharge,that the state law took away.similarly,hud set forth an exception termination to increase the rent permissible to a federal prohibition no termination without good cause,that larso took away.on this reading,this case is more like hammond and less like de la cuesta,in which the federal agency permitted an action inclusion of clauses that the state forbade.in addition,the de la cuesta court relied heavily on the unambiguous intent of the federal agency to preempt contrary state law.at.see also id.at.the preamble unequivocally expresses the board determination to displace state law.that sort of unambiguous intent,as explained above,is not present here.further,the district court finding of conflict was based on its conclusion that larso takes away a right specifically granted by the hud eviction regulations.however,as in hammond,where it was difficult to argue convincingly that the congress or the coast guard intended to create a federal right to discharge ballast containing oil into a state coastal waters,at,it is similarly difficult to argue,given the statutory context and legislative and administrative history,that congress or hud intended to create a federal right to terminate assisted tenants in order to raise the rent on their units.
moreover,larso conflict preemption arguments have failed in two previous federal cases.in topa equities,owners challenged the amendments to larso,which set the maximum rent subsequent to an owner exit from the federal program at the amount last charged under the federal program,thereby preventing vacancy decontrol and prohibiting owners from raising the rent to market level.at.as here,owners argued that larso is by federal law because it impedes federal objectives by disincentivizing private owner participation in section housing.we found that larso was not actually preempted because n othing in the hud regulations purports to limit states from enacting their own rent control laws of general applicability.id.at.in concluding that federal legislation creating the network of subsidized housing laws is superimposed upon and consciously interdependent with the substructure of local law relating to housing,we placed special emphasis on the fact that congress never either the text or legislative history of the national housing act of,ch,stat.codified as amended at or in any ancillary it intended to abrogate state rent control laws.topa equities,at quoting kargman,at.thus,we held that larso is a generally applicable rent control ordinance that does not unduly interfere with federal housing programs.it is not expressly preempted by federal law,nor is it preempted on conflict grounds.id.at.
in independence park apartments united states,owners successfully argued that the government temporary withdrawal of their right to prepay section loans constituted a regulatory taking and were awarded damages.id.at.the government argued that the damages award should be reduced because after exiting the federal program,owners would not be able to raise the rent due to larso,and landlords responded that larso was inapplicable because it was by congress desire to incentivize private development of housing.id.at.the federal circuit rejected the owners preemption argument.applying the presumption against preemption of traditionally local laws,it held that the government made no guarantees about the effect of local laws on profitability and so did not intend to preempt the operation of more protective local laws.id.at.the national housing act provided certain benefits and imposed certain burdens on owners of subsidized housing.it did not,however,provide them with any protection against the application of a variety of state and local laws that could affect the profitability of their investments.id.at.
although topa equities and independence park apartments concerned a different federal housing statute,it follows from the reasoning in those decisions that the operation of larso in conjunction with federal housing laws does not impede federal objectives.
the litigation position of hud and recent hud regulations support a finding of nonpreemption 
responding to our invitation to hud to express its view on whether larso eviction controls actually conflict with d iv,the united states informs us that larso eviction controls do not pose an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of hud regulation providing that other good cause for terminating a section tenancy may but does not a landlord desire to raise the rent.in support of its position,the united states first notes that the statutory language and its own regulations expressly contemplate the interdependence of federal assisted housing law and state and local housing law o b ii i provides that the lease must contain terms that are consistent with state and local law o e mandates that the hap contract shall provide that any relief from termination shall be consistent with applicable state and local law c allows pha the right to decline to approve the tenancy if the pha determines that the lease does not comply with state or local law and e i requires section owners to use the eviction notice used under state or local law.second,the united states highlights the use of may in d,which provides that o ther good cause for termination of tenancy by the owner may include,but is not limited to,any of the following examples.it notes that m ay is permissive and connotes discretion,absent clear indication to the contrary.brief for the united states as amicus curiae supporting affirmance of the district court citing fernandez brock,cir.third,the united states argues that n either the wording nor the intent of gives a landlord an unqualified right to terminate a section tenancy because he wants to raise the rent,as the regulation utilizes general terms and intentionally leaves the determination of good cause to the courts on a basis.finally,the united states assures us that hud has never interpreted as prohibiting state and local governments from providing additional protection from eviction to tenants.
moreover,a recently published hud guidance document,notice pih ha,state and local law applicability to lease terminations in the housing choice voucher hcv program,june,mirrors the litigation position expressed in the amicus brief of the united states.it states that while good cause may include a business or economic reason,when there is no state or local law prohibiting termination of tenancy for such cause,in other circumstances it may not include a business or economic reason.id.if a state or local law prohibits the termination o f tenancy for a business or economic reason such as a desire to lease the unit at a higher rental,the n that specific ground for termination of the tenancy does not constitute other good cause under cfr d in that particular instance.id.in conclusion,hud dictates that nothing in cfr d any applicable state or local laws that restrict or prohibit the termination of tenancy.this applies to all hcv vouchers.id.
the position of the united states is entitled to deference,as is hud most recent guidance document.w hen an agency invokes its authority to issue regulations,which then interpret ambiguous statutory terms,the courts defer to its reasonable interpretations.fed.express holowecki,d.t he agency is entitled to further deference when it adopts a reasonable interpretation of regulations it has put in force.id.at citing auer robbins,d deferring to the agency position unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation internal quotation marks omitted.further,an agency litigation position in an amicus brief is entitled to deference if there is no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter.auer,at.and,as explained above,the interpretive policy statements are at least entitled to a measure of respect under the less deferential skidmore standard.fed.express.at internal quotation marks omitted.of course,we do not defer to an agency conclusion that state law is.rather,we have attended to an agency explanation of how state law affects the regulatory scheme.wyeth.at.agencies have a unique understanding of the statutes they administer and an attendant ability to make informed determinations about how state requirements may pose an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also sprietsma mercury marine,d geier,at.moreover,while t he weight we accord the agency explanation of state law impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness,consistency,and persuasiveness,wyeth.at,hud has amply demonstrated its thoughtful consideration of,and its commitment to,the principle that local eviction control laws that are more protective of tenants are not preempted by its own good cause regulation.
our independent analysis of the statutory language and legislative history,the persuasive reasoning of prior larso decisions by us and the federal circuit,the litigation position of the united states,and hud most recent publication lead us to conclude that the hud regulation and larso do not actually conflict.larso does not impede the federal objective of providing affordable housing to families.larso,therefore,is not preempted by d iv to the extent the hud regulation permits eviction in order to obtain a higher rental,in the absence of contrary state or local law 
injunction issued by the district court 
the district court granted summary judgment to tenants on the ground that although the hud regulation and larso actually conflict,hud regulation exceeded the federal agency statutory authority.because we hold there is no actual conflict between larso and the hud regulation,we do not reach the question of whether promulgation of the regulation was within hud authority though we disagree with the district court reasoning,because we may affirm the district court judgment on any ground supported by the record,sec.life ins.of,at,we affirm the grant of summary judgment and the permanent injunction entered by the district court.
morton also challenges the scope of the injunction,arguing that it must be limited to proscribing it from terminating tenants in order to raise the rent.the district court enjoined defendant and any of its agents from failing to allow the enhanced voucher plaintiffs to remain at morton gardens with enhanced voucher assistance,and from evicting or terminating the tenancy or lease of all plaintiffs without complying with all the requirements of larso.tenants respond that morton did not object to the scope of the injunction before the district court and,therefore,has waived the objection.see ritchie united states,cir concluding that failure to raise an issue before the district court waives it on appeal when the issue involves an exercise of the district court discretion and the district court might have been able to deal with the problem see also.life ins.new images of beverly hills,cir this issue is raised for the first time on appeal,and we can not entertain the argument because further factual development would be required.we agree with tenants that morton waived the objection to the scope of relief by failing to raise it before the district court.a
