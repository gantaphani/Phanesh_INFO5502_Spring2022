plaintiffs robert trujillo,william gradie,and ronald friedman appeal from an order granting summary adjudication and a final judgment in favor of defendant first american registry,on their causes of action pursuant to the consumer credit reporting agencies act ccraa,et,the unfair competition law ucl bus,et,and the investigative consumer reporting agencies act icraa et.plaintiffs alleged defendant had prepared tenant screening reports that correctly showed unlawful detainer actions had been filed against plaintiffs,but which wrongly failed to note the actions had been dismissed or the resulting judgment had been satisfied plaintiffs further alleged the incomplete reports had caused property managers to reject their rental applications.
we affirm summary adjudication on each of the three causes of action.
first,defendant was entitled to summary adjudication on the ccraa cause of action because plaintiffs suffered no damage from the incomplete reports.defendant evidence showed the property managers did not rely upon the omitted unlawful detainer resolutions in rejecting the rental applications they would have denied the applications even if the tenant screening reports had been complete.plaintiffs offered no evidence to the contrary,and failed to raise a triable issue as to whether they had suffered resulting damage.because the alleged violation caused no damage,plaintiffs ccraa cause of action fails as a matter of law.
second,defendant was entitled to summary adjudication on the ucl cause of action for a similar reason.plaintiffs failed to raise a triable issue as to whether they had suffered injury in fact or lost money or property as a result of the incomplete reports.the lack of injury dooms their ucl cause of action as a matter of law.
finally,defendant was entitled to summary adjudication on the icraa causes of action.the icraa is unconstitutionally vague as applied to tenant screening reports containing unlawful detainer information,like the ones here.because defendant was entitled to summary adjudication on each of plaintiffs causes of action,the court correctly entered judgment in defendant favor.

the litigation 
plaintiffs filed a class action complaint,asserting defendant had violated various credit reporting laws.first,trujillo and gradie alleged defendant violated the ccraa,which requires credit reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information in the reports,by failing to note the unlawful detainer actions filed against them had been dismissed,subd.b.second,gradie alleged the same conduct violated a similar provision of the icraa,subd.b.third,gradie and friedman alleged defendant violated the icraa by failing to provide a required notice to them.fourth,gradie and friedman alleged defendant violated the icraa by failing to verify their tenant screening reports accuracy within days,subd.c.finally,all three plaintiffs alleged defendant conduct violated the ucl.
defendant moved for summary judgment summary adjudication.it contended the ccraa and ucl causes of action were meritless because the undisputed evidence showed trujillo and gradie suffered no damage from the incomplete tenant screening reports.it further contended the three icraa causes of action were meritless because plaintiffs suffered no damage,the tenant screening reports were not investigative consumer reports subject to the icraa,federal law preempted the icraa,and the icraa is unconstitutionally vague.
to show plaintiffs had suffered no damage from the incomplete reports,defendant submitted declarations from the property managers who had received plaintiffs rental applications.the property managers asserted they would have rejected the applications even if the tenant screening reports had accurately indicated the unlawful detainer actions had been dismissed in trujillo and gradie case or the resulting judgment had been satisfied in friedman case.they followed policies against renting to persons involved in unlawful detainer actions,regardless of how the actions were resolved.the property managers who had rejected trujillo and gradie applications further stated they did so also because of the misrepresentations in their applications.the property manager who had rejected friedman application stated he did so also because of friedman low credit score and poor credit history.plaintiffs offered no opposing evidence,instead contending the statutes did not require that they suffer any damage.
