in march,plaintiff los altos el granada investors parkowner applied for a per month space rent increase for castle mobile estates castle,its rent controlled mobile home park in capitola.in april,defendant city of capitola granted an increase of per space per month,raising rents to about per month.in july,parkowner sued capitola and codefendant city of capitola mobilehome rent review board board,collectively,city for inverse condemnation and the taking of its property in violation of the california constitution and it petitioned for a writ of administrative mandamus.parkowner now appeals the sustaining of city demurrer without leave to amend and denial of the writ petition.parkowner raises claims under the california constitution and challenges the trial court findings and the sufficiency of the evidence.
we state the facts in some detail because of the sufficiency of the evidence challenge.on july,parkowner purchased castle for million.castle was built in the within walking distance of the santa cruz beach.it had a laundry building,asphalt streets and streetlights.by,the area,a desirable location,was booming.it was close to the beach it had a robust economy and proximity to a good job market.housing prices were rising.parkowner alleged that the average or median cost of housing in capitola was more than and that the median price of a single family home statewide,including condominiums,stood at as of june.underscoring omitted.more than million in public redevelopment money had been invested in the area.amenities included a park with sports and play structures,a branch library,underground utilities,and streetscapes improved with sidewalks,bike lanes,streetlights,and landscaping.private funds revitalized a marginal shopping center.
mobile home rents in capitola were regulated by its mobile home park rent stabilization ordinance which was enacted in and amended several times thereafter.currently,the mobile home rent control ordinance is found in capitola municipal code,chapter,rental adjustment procedures for mobile home parks.however,when the application was heard by city,the ordinance then in effect was chapter,and we will use the latter section numbers and language in this opinion 
section permitted park owners to increase space rents annually by the lesser of percent of the change in the applicable consumer price index cpi,or percent of the existing base rent.park owners could obtain additional increases to recoup expenses for capital improvements.the ordinance presumed that allowed rent increases would provide park owners a fair return but a park owner could rebut this presumption by showing it was not receiving a fair return.in determining fair return applications,the city council sat as the board.if a park owner was successful,additional increases would be allowed.other increases were prohibited except as permitted under the ordinance.
castle was covered by the provisions of chapter when parkowner bought it.rents were around per month.immediately after the purchase,parkowner asked for and received a space rent increase to about.the record of the application included in the administrative transcript does not show that parkowner complained then that the base rent set in deprived it of a fair rate of return on its investment.on the contrary parkowner notified homeowners of the increase in rent due to for increased taxes,sewer charges,and supplied the board with additional information as requested.in subsequent years,additional increases were granted,and by,years later,rents had gone up about to approximately per month per space 
in march,parkowner applied to city for the rent increase even though it believed if it was successful,rents would still be less than half of market,because the rent control ordinance did not specify what analytical approach should be used in requesting a rent increase,parkowner used two alternative analyses,a premium approach and a fair return on equity approach.
under the premium approach,parkowner justified the size of the increase by claiming that market space rents were about a month and that the resale prices of mobile homes on rent controlled spaces had soared because full vacancy control created a premium by precluding increases in space rent upon resale of mobile homes.
parkowner opined that rent increases to remove at least a sizable portion of the premium representing the difference between the kelly sic blue book value of mobilehomes in the park and sale prices would range from to.for example,parkowner calculated a premium of from the february sale of a galaxy x with a kelley blue book value of.the premium was the difference between the kelley blue book value and the fair market value.the premium from the november sale of a galaxy x with the same blue book value was,the difference between the selling price of and the blue book value.using the calculation that a increase in space rent corresponds to approximately in the value of a mobile home,parkowner concluded a per month rent increase would be an appropriate administrative remedy.
in the alternative,parkowner presented a fair and reasonable return on equity fair return calculation based on the acquisition value of the property as adjusted for inflation.parkowner experts,accountants corbin wertz corbin,initially computed the minimum rent adjustment necessary for a fair return at per month an updated report in september recalculated it to be per month.parkowner asserted that the calculation did not account for the true value and equity of the applicant but was limited to the economic criteria based upon artificially depressed rent levels.the true value of the property,without rent control,would be between and million,depending upon market level rents.
corbin defined fair return as the measure of financial reward attributed to purchasing,holding,or reselling an investment which compensates the investor for capital investment and assuming risk.the unit of measurement in this case is the percentage of funds invested by the mobile home park owner that is returned on an annual basis.using a rii approach,parkowner indexed investment in was the original investment of million stated in current dollars.corbin stated that buyers evaluate real estate investments using a capitalization rate on the income stream available from the property.the fair capitalization rate for this property was calculated as.multiplying the indexed investment,by percent produced the fair return on the indexed value.fair rent expressed as annual revenue is the sum of the fair return and current operating expenses that is.this annual amount,divided by rentable spaces over months yields the minimum average rent of,a increase,or a increase over the current average rent of.in the september update,corbin used a fair capitalization rate of percent producing a fair return on indexed value of.adding that to the park estimated operating expenses of totals.corbin adjusted the management fee and reached a reduced total rent of.divided by spaces and months,corbin calculated the monthly average fair rent to be.subtracting the average monthly space rent of,corbin reached a rent increase for a minimum reasonable return for this project.
the homeowners homeowners objected.they challenged some expenses in parkowner ledger in detail and they contended the park potential appreciated sales price should be considered in determining an appropriate rate of return because at some point in the future,parkowner is very likely to make a very healthy profit on the sale of castle mobile home park sic.they claimed that the owners of castle mobile home park sic follow a business practice of purchasing mobile home parks with the goal of later selling them at a profit to the homeowners.they had had such an offer from doug davis,the owner of parkowner management company and a junior partner in the ownership of the park,who had called a meeting with homeowners on september.he renewed a offer to sell castle to homeowners,this time at from to per space,up from per space.the park had appraised at million on november.homeowners stated that if parkowner offer had been accepted,parkowner would have received million for the park four years before the million appraisal.if davis offer had been accepted,parkowners would have gotten between and million for the park two years after the million appraisal.
homeowners submitted copies of an escrow statement which showed that parkowners had just sold tropics mobile home park in union city for its purchase price.homeowners believed parkowner was pursuing the hardship rent increase application to terrorize homeowners into purchasing the park for an inflated amount.homeowners offered to settle the hardship application with an offer of a rent increase which was rejected 
homeowners also asserted that there was no premium.they compared sales prices of mobile homes in the park and mobile homes in adjacent jurisdictions without rent control.castle average sales prices did not exceed those sold in other jurisdictions.the average sales price at castle was while those in three controlled parks in campbell were between and,and,in monterey,in two controlled parks,were from to.
sharon lake,a tenant and licensed realtor,testified at the hearing before the board that there was little vacancy risk factor for parkowner.a s long as the mobile home that occupies the space is owned,the space rent is paid if the mobile home is removed that a bonanza because then they can bring in a replacement,and it can be filled.lake stated that the state of california computes the sales tax on both new and used mobile homes using the kelley blue book value.however,she stated,it not a realistic value for what that mobile home represents.blue book values do not include any of the attachments such as decks,awnings,landscaping,sheds,any other items that are personal property that belongs to that owner they are not appreciated in that blue book value.
finally,individual homeowners testified they felt pressured by parkowner management practices.one resident stated that,in the last eight years,we have not existed except for three months without some threat to close the mobile home park.first parkowner required people to sign leases or they would not allow them into the park.that of course took people off of rent control.when parkowner was stopped from doing that,it started to close the park one space at a time,which of course made it very difficult for people to sell their coaches.a court battle stopped that.then the management came up with an impact report to close ten more spaces.they also applied for quiet title to certain people on roland drive which would give them a second interest in the park because they could close half the park.we had about a break between when the supreme court refused to hear their appeal and when they came up with a new scheme to close the park,which is the one that been in effect since.
other tenants noted the hardship that a monthly space rent increase would cause.one stated he had been evicted after failing to pay rent for days.he had been sick and had just started a new job.parkowner would not permit him to sell his mobile home in place.a buyer would have to remove it.the homeowner expected to be homeless and lose an investment worth.
city retained the accounting firm of hutchinson and bloodgood llp hutchinson to prepare a report analyzing parkowner application and kenneth baar baar to review the ordinance fair return standard based on return on indexed investment and return property interest lost due to the rent ordinance.
hutchinson determined that parkowner adjusted net operating income for ranged from to,depending on how certain attorney fees and expenses were treated.
on september,the hearing before the board began.parkowner called corbin accountant guy knuf,who opined that,based on his return on investment at risk approach,a monthly space increase of less than would be confiscatory.
knuf stated he rejected the maintenance of net operating income mnoi approach advocated by baar for three reasons.first,a base year must be established by look ing at a controlled time frame relatively close to that base year,when market forces,and supply and demand are at work to get market rents at that time.knuf stated he felt that we could not establish an accurate base year for castle due to the fact that parkowner acquired the property after it had been under rent control for some years.in addition,knuf did not feel he could rely on the numbers and books and records from,years earlier,because he did not have the detail to dive into the numbers as i should to come up with a proper calculation.
finally,knuf stated the mnoi approach requires the identification of a point in time where you can assume that the property owner was reasonably pleased with the return he was then receiving.by,rent control had been around since the late.knuf could not determine a base year net operating income without knowing whether base year rent levels were artificially high or low.
parkowner appraiser,john neet,testified to the empirical data that supported his conclusion that several mobile homes in the park had sold for values in excess of their blue book values.he stated that buyers of old mobile homes often removed and replaced them with newer homes.w hen people pay to for a to,when they can purchase a new off of a lot for or,there something obviously going on besides the improving value sic of that mobile home.and what is going on is the rents in castle as well as throughout the city,are held down far below what market rents would be.
neet stated that a fremont study showed that for every decrease in rent below market level there was a corresponding increase in the value of a mobile home.he stated that a rise in rent was far below the reasonable amount nevertheless,a minimum rent increase of was necessary to provide a fair return and anything less than the increase recommended by corbin would not provide a reasonable return on investment.
neet testified that the percent rate of return that knuf used in his calculations was a supportable rate of return,and that investors in mobile home parks typically expect a to percent range.any less than that,it really does take into consideration the risk and give the reward to the investor for the responsibilities he is taking on as a result of making this investment.
neet found outdated baar statement that the components of return on real estate investments include tax flow,appreciation,and tax shelter benefits.the source of that statement was mayes jackson tp.rent leveling,supra.neet stated that case could not have taken into consideration the changes that happened to real estate investment practices as a result of the income tax reform act of.marginal tax rates were dropped,appreciation schedules were lengthened,and limitations were placed upon deductions of losses from real estate against income from other sources.prior to that,a lot of people bought real estate and lost money on it,but they were happy doing it because they could write those losses off against their income.after,that ceased to exist.
neet stated that similarly,the appreciation factor baar utilized in his analysis was stunted and minimized in a rent controlled environment such that it no longer existed.for example,he declared that parkowner increase in net operating income since was percent a year,less than inflation.when we talk about a return,it a return on an investment,not a return on getting cheaper dollars.looking at the rate of return for an investment with similar risks,and surveys show that controlled mobile home parks across the country had a to percent rate of growth,including regions with depressed economies as well as urban areas with rising housing costs.an investor in a rent controlled mobile home park would expect a higher rate of to or the investor in a controlled park because their upside is limited.neet stated he had no information on rates of return for rent controlled parks.
baar,in his report and testimony,discussed fair return using an mnoi standard including indexing for inflation,although he also calculated rent increases using the alternative rii approach presented by corbin.baar stated he used the index investment because it was what the applicants used i t not the actual cash investment or the actual total price they paid for the property that being used as the base rate.it this investment they made in the property,adjusted by the cpi.
baar determined that the proper mnoi base period was calendar year,the last year in which the city had conducted a thorough review of the park income and expenses.at the hearing,he defended his use of as a base year on the ground that an earlier board decision based on that year had been accepted by parkowner and had provided a fair return.he calculated castle adjusted net operating income to be.indexing this by percentages ranging from to percent of the cpi increase from april through december resulted in monthly space rent increases of at percent cpi net operating income noi indexing,at percent,and at percent.with an adjusted investment,parkowner rate of return was percent.using percent indexing,the increased rate of return would be approximately percent.capitalization rates for mobile home park sales averaged about percent and did not include appreciation.this was the rate of the noi to the value of the property.baar used capitalization rates from sales in the san francisco area from to,unlike parkowner rate of return which was calculated on projected operating expenses.
baar stated that one reason for indexing noi at less than percent of the change in the cpi was that real estate is often a leveraged investment.in a leveraged investment,a substantial part of the investment is financed.the investor invests a small amount of cash,but gets appreciation on percent of the value.
baar stated the noi from a property is only part of the return on investment.another part is appreciation.when other witnesses said investors expect to percent rates of return,those rates include appreciation.comparing those rates to a mobile home park percent rate derived from noi is like comparing apples and oranges.the part of the rate of return that the board was being asked to adjust was what the rent would be based on an adjustment of the noi.you not adjusting the value and deciding how much appreciation the park owner should get and calculating that in the return,although that might affect what rate you consider is reasonable.
baar also opined that the premium theory based on an increase in value of mobile homes in the park was not a fair return theory and was therefore inapplicable.fair return is determined by whether a regulated property owner is permitted a fair return fair profit,rather than by computing the benefit of the regulation to the protected consumer.the property interest theory which bases the allowed rent increase on the increase in the value of the mobilehomes sic is not a fair return criteria sic and,therefore,is not applicable in this case.
finally,baar reviewed parkowner application rii approach.he stated that using the purchase price as the investment base was inconsistent with the ordinance.furthermore,under the rii approach,the result differed depending upon what rate of return was used.parkowner percent rate would justify a monthly increase of,but a more normal percent capitalization rate based on data from mobile home sales in the area would justify only a monthly rate increase.
the board found that in parkowner accepted the board determination that castle noi was,that it could have contended that it was not receiving a fair rate of return under section,but it did not.the board found mnoi to be the best approach under chapter because it was consistent with the purposes of the existing rent control ordinance and courts have upheld the approach in the past.the mnoi approach was a reasonable means for providing a fair return and noted that section stated,it will be presumed that the application of this chapter and previous rent review ordinances has resulted in a fair rate of return.the board found the mnoi approach observes this direction by using as a base fair return a prior noi,which in was determined by the city to be fair,and was accepted by the applicant.
in determining the rent increase,the board recognized the necessity of adjusting the december noi for inflationary effects.it selected the san jose area all items less shelter index with the relevant period running from december through december.during that period,the cpi increased by percent.increasing the december noi by percent resulted in a december noi of.the board found that the noi based on current rents was.therefore in order to increase noi to,total rents must be increased by.the board divided this amount by spaces and months,subtracted the rent increase for calendar year which had already been allowed percent of cpi,and determined the rent increase would be.
the board rejected parkowner return on investment approach based on the purchase price as contrary to section because it wa s premised on the assumption that return must be calculated on the basis of the price which the applicant paid for the park.underscore original.further,parkowner did not cite legal authority that mandated the starting point of rent control analysis must be the applicant purchase price as required by section.the board found that theory defective for reasons stated by baar and by the board staff the central defect of that approach is that it results in the rent rates being controlled by park buyer and seller,not the rent board,such that rents would be quite capable of rising to the levels that would exist without rent control.moreover,the applicant approach is entirely theoretical.no empirical data is supplied to verify the assumptions the applicant uses in formulating its version of a return on investment formula.
the board found that the increases it granted not only provided a fair return per the mnoi approach,but they also resulted in a fair return on investment,even if investment was equated with parkowner purchase price.the noi at the beginning of was percent of the purchase price.the level of returns that were attracting new purchases of mobile home parks indicated that the prevailing capitalization rate price ratio was.in of the cases the capitalization rate was less than.the median was percent.most of the parks in the sample were subject to mobilehome sic rent control.the most comparable type of investments to mobilehome sic park investments besides other mobilehome sic park investments would be apartment investments.in recent years,capitalization rates for apartments have been about.fn.omitted.the board found that the granted increase provides the applicant with growth in income and appreciation.it would double the equity of a typically leveraged investor within the twelve year holding period,a period when the increase in the cpi was.
the board specifically rejected parkowner risk premium theory and cited the october,staff report which set out specific defects in the analysis.the report quoted parkowner statement,real estate projects carry business risk,which is based on the overall impact of the property.for example,a property which is to tenant sic carries a lower business risk than one which is built on spec and relies on a large number of less tenants who are yet to be signed up.management is also an element of business risk because the operational skills of the management to collect rents,maintain the property,relate to tenants and so forth,can dramatically impact returns.market risk is associated with supply and demand factors such as overbuilding,urban blight,and local regulations such as rent control.financial risk is impacted by factors such as the ability to maintain net operating income and cover debt service.for instance,a large variable rate loan can severely impact returns during periods of high interest rates.
the report found that in light of the realities of castle,there is nothing analogous to a property that has been built on spec and has yet to locate tenants.the management element and the supply and demand factors,are exceedingly minor risks for a mobilehome sic park located in the city of capitola.the report quoted the findings in section there was a shortage of mobile home spaces in capitola and the surrounding area,resulting in a low vacancy rate and,but for rent control,rapidly rising space rents.mobile home owners invested substantial sums in their mobile homes and appurtenances,and alternative sites for the relocation of these homes were difficult to find and moving and reinstallation costs were expensive,with possibilities of damage to the units.
the report pointed out that parkowner acknowledged a significant gap between controlled rent rates and market rates,and found t he obvious result is a considerable demand for spaces.this virtually guarantees that rents will not drop below their levels as a result of any lack of demand or mediocre management.an ordinance based on an mnoi formula insulates a park from the risk that it will not be able to maintain net operating income.
no evidence in the record showed that parkowner had a large variable rate loan finally,the applicant risk premium concept entirely ignores the probabilities of appreciation.t he possibilities of appreciation more than offset the risks articulated in the application as justifying the risk premium.
the report pointed out that in building its case for risk,parkowner claimed that castle was worth only million.however,parkowner asking price,in its negotiations with homeowners to buy their spaces,was between and per space.this would translate into an approximate valuation of to million.
the board found parkowner return on fair value approach also defective because the applicant treated debt service interest as a cost,but inconsistently computed return with reference to the full purchase price rather than the unleveraged portion of the purchase price.
at its meeting on april,city adopted the rent board final findings,and granted a rent increase of per space per month with a surcharge for months up to for costs for city expert witnesses attributed to parkowner.rents increased to approximately per month.
the lawsuits 
on june,parkowners and others filed a federal action,hillsboro properties city of capitola cal,no.hillsboro.on june,parkowner filed a separate action based upon the same facts,los altos el granada investors city of capitola cal,no.los altos i raising the same claims as in the instant case.parkowner asserted in both that the rent control ordinance violated the united states constitution as applied to parkowner.the causes of action contained in the federal case were all predicated on the violation of rights protected under the federal constitution and section except for parkowner petition for a writ of mandamus,included as a supplemental claim pursuant to section.no claim was based on a violation of the california constitution.on january,the district court dismissed both of parkowner complaints but allowed parkowner to file an amended complaint that addressed the pleading deficiencies in los altos the dismissal was affirmed in an unpublished decision of the ninth circuit,los altos el granada investors city of capitola cir,wl.
on july,parkowner filed the instant action in the santa cruz county superior court,and on august,parkowner filed los altos el granada investors city of capitola,no.los altos ii.los altos ii was dismissed because the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over parkowner takings,due process claims,and petition for a writ of administrative mandamus under state law,which were essentially an application parallel to that pending in the superior court.the writ petition in the instant action was dismissed in june.
parkowner filed an appeal in the instant case on august,and a fourth federal action on december,los altos el granada investors city of capitola cal.july,no.pvt los altos iii.city filed a motion to dismiss.this court has taken judicial notice of the opinion filed in that case on july.the district court dismissed the fifth cause of action alleging the ordinance failed to substantially advance a legitimate state interest under lingle chevron usa,d lingle.
as for parkowner takings claims,the district court characterized them as timely challenges because p arkowner claim was not based solely upon enactment of the ordinance but also upon complex economic factors and the rent control board refusal to grant requested rent increases.the court found that the claims were ripe under the williamson planning comm hamilton bank,d test and that the state had been given fair warning that the plaintiff was asserting a takings claim and a fair opportunity to provide just compensation under hacienda valley mobile morgan hill cir.
the district court stated that the doctrine of res judicata did not apply to parkowner public takings and due process claims because the district court dismissal was for lack of jurisdiction and not on the merits and that although the private takings claim dismissal technically raises a res judicata bar to plaintiff assertion of a private takings claim in the instant action,the court in los altos i did not intend to effect a final adjudication of that claim on the merits.the court clarifie d that its prior dismissal of the private takings claim was without prejudice.the court stated that since the state court appeal was still pending,it was appropriate to abstain from considering the claims pending disposition of the state court appeal under younger harris,d younger.the court stayed the case pending disposition of the state appeal.
state action claims 
in superior court,the first cause of action for declaratory relief sought a judicial declaration that city application of the rent control ordinance was unconstitutional under the california constitution because it effected an uncompensated taking of property alleged that the ordinance failed substantially to advance a legitimate state interest as required by richardson city and county of honolulu cir,certiorari denied,d richardson claimed that city denied parkowner due process and equal protection under the california constitution and asserted that the ordinance as applied by city did not provide parkowner with a just and reasonable return as required by the california constitution.parkowner also claimed it was deprived of due process of law as one of only five private park owners in capitola subject to vacancy control.it was deprived of equal protection of the law as it was being treated differently from all other property owners in capitola in that it was required to bear the burden of providing affordable housing.
the cause of action for inverse condemnation asserted that denial of the requested rent increase caused a taking and an intentional diminution in the value of the park.the third cause of action for administrative mandamus asked the court to compel city to give parkowner a fair hearing and a rent increase sufficient to allow for a just and reasonable return and to provide plaintiff with due process.
the complaint included an england reservation england medical examiners,d england,that is,it notified the state court that parkowner intended to pursue only its state law claims in state court and to reserve the federal claims for subsequent litigation in federal court.
city filed a demurrer and a motion to strike the england reservation.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to both the first and second causes of action stating that a declaratory relief action was improper to attack a rent decision by an administrative agency.also,the first two causes of action were facial challenges to the ordinance which were barred by the statute of limitations and the res estoppel effect of the two prior federal decisions,and,to the extent these causes of action were as applied challenges to the rent decision,they were unripe because parkowner had not exhausted its state court remedies by first obtaining a decision on its petition for a writ of administrative mandamus cause of action.the court granted city motion to strike parkowner england reservation,and set a hearing on the petition for a writ of mandamus on the administrative record only.
at the hearing on the writ petition,the trial court stated that a landowner application to raise the rent does not involve a fundamental right for purposes of review and applied a substantial evidence standard of review.
the trial court found that any premium was not due solely to rent control,but involved other factors such as the cost of moving a mobile home,scarcity of spots within mobile home parks,desirability of location in a park,and anticipated rents.an important factor that would give rise to a premium is the rising cost of other housing making people willing to pay more for mobile homes.so the assertion that the premium is due solely to the rent control law is suspect.
using evidence that the average prices paid for mobile homes in the five controlled parks closest to capitola were between to from january of to the present,and that the average sale price at castle was about during the same period,the trial court stated the implication was that the difference between the book value and the sales price was not solely due to rent control.the court concluded that substantial evidence supported city decision.
parkowner had requested a statement of decision which the trial court ordered city to prepare.parkowner later objected to city proposed statement of decision the trial court denied a hearing and signed it without revision.
parkowner petition for a writ of administrative mandamus was heard on may.the trial court found that parkowner regulatory takings claims were meritless and that the ordinance as applied was reasonably related to and substantially advanced its stated purposes.the court denied the petition and awarded city costs.
issues on appeal 
parkowner claims the trial court erred in sustaining a demurrer to its constitutional claims striking its england reservation and denying issuance of a writ of administrative mandamus.on the latter point,parkowner alleges the trial court improperly made new findings never made by the board made a decision not supported by the evidence mistakenly failed to apply its independent judgment made no findings upholding the board rii analysis failed to consider whether a rent increase was necessary to prevent a regulatory taking and issued an unclear and inconsistent statement of decision which fails to address critical findings.
standard of review 
denial of parkowner petition for a writ of administrative mandamus is reviewed by using the substantial evidence test.code civ,subd.c san marcos,supra,d at.the substantial evidence test requires the court to begin with the presumption that the record contains evidence to sustain the board findings of fact.citation.the board interpretation of an ordinance implementation guidelines is given considerable deference and must be upheld absent evidence the interpretation lacks a reasonable foundation.citation.the burden is on the appellant to prove the board decision is neither reasonable nor lawful.carson harbor village,city of carson mobilehome park rental review bd.th,d.

demurrer on the count constitutional claims 
parkowner claims there is no basis in california law for the trial court to have sustained city demurrer to its inverse condemnation,due process,and equal protection claims alleged in count on the basis that they were not ripe until the writ of mandamus cause of action was decided.parkowner states,the ripeness doctrine arises from federal law and,by definition,ha s no application in state court.in any event,even under federal law,the ripeness doctrine does not require the completion of a judicial challenge to the administrative decision prior to bringing a damage claim.
in its order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend on count,the trial court stated,the challenges to the alleged premium are facial challenges which are barred by the statute of limitations and the res estoppel effect of the two prior federal actions any as applied challenge to the rent review board rent decision whether taking,equal protection or due process challenges are not ripe because parkowner has not exhausted its state court remedies by first obtaining a decision on its petition for writ of administrative mandamus cause of action which may render those claims moot.
under the ripeness doctrine,a court may deny review where the issues raised by a general challenge to an administrative rule or policy are not sufficiently concrete to allow judicial resolution even in the absence of a precise factual context.the court must evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.citation.witkin,cal.procedure ed.administrative proceedings,original italics.
our case did not involve just a general challenge to an administrative rule or policy but also raised taking,due process,and equal protection claims.parkowner faults the trial court for using the word ripe when it is clear from the whole sentence that the trial court was finding parkowner had not exhausted its administrative remedies.california courts have sometimes used the word ripe in this context.see,for example,county of alameda superior court th,d ripeness and finality in taking cases montclair parkowners city of montclair th,fn,d,montclair sandpiper mobile village city of carpinteria th,d sandpiper.it is clear they were invoking the concept of finality which requires that an administrative adjudication result in a final administrative order or decision before it can be reviewed by the courts.witkin,cal.procedure,administrative proceedings,op.cit.supra,at.
the impact of a law or regulation on the owner right to use or develop the property can not be assessed until an administrative agency applies the ordinance or regulation to the property and a final administrative decision has been reached with regard to the availability of a variance or other means by which to exempt the property from the challenged restriction.a final administrative decision includes exhaustion of any available review mechanism as is the issue here.utilization of available avenues of administrative relief is necessary because the court can not determine whether a regulation has gone too far unless it knows how far the regulation goes.citations.hensler city of glendale cal th,d,hensler.the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional,rather than discretionary with the court.witkin,cal.procedure,administrative proceedings,op.cit.supra,at but see grant comp usa,th,d.
in this case,parkowner took the first step in exhausting administrative remedies by making a meaningful application for a rent increase,receiving a fractional rise,and thereafter challenging the board decision by filing a petition for writ of administrative mandamus.however,parkowner had not completed the final step,judicial review through a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus,at the time the demurrer was heard.
this case presents an interesting procedural tangle.parkowner had the right to present its constitutional claims in a state forum along with its petition of a writ of administrative mandamus.our supreme court in hensler,supra,cal th at page,d,stated that an as applied challenge to restrictions imposed by the administrative agency,may be properly made in a petition for writ of administrative mandamus to review the final administrative decision citation and that action may be joined with one for inverse condemnation.a declaratory relief action also may be joined with an action in inverse condemnation.citation.damages for the taking may be sought in an administrative mandamus action citation,or,if the plaintiff seeks a jury trial,in the joined inverse condemnation action.
however,the viability of parkowner first and second causes of action depended upon its obtaining a resolution of the third cause of action,the writ petition,which claimed that city denial of the rent application was an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion which denied parkowner a fair return,denied it reimbursement of costs of the administrative hearing to which it was entitled,and resulted in the denial of a fair hearing.the allegations in the writ petition as in the other causes of action were based on the general allegations in the complaint raising constitutional issues.
city,on the other hand,had the right to challenge parkowner complaint by demurrer.code civ.a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint.citations.on appeal from an order of dismissal after an order sustaining a demurrer,our standard of review is de novo,we exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.citation.we deem to be true all material facts properly pled citation and those facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.montclair,supra,th at,d.
we think the trial court followed a reasonable course in hearing the demurrer first,but,as will become clear,it should have granted parkowner request to amend its complaint.
in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend on challenges it ruled to be facial challenges,the court did not abuse its discretion.montclair,supra,th at,d.parkowner alleged that the rent control ordinance,as drafted and as applied,caused a taking over time by causing a premium,and did not substantially advance a legitimate state interest as contemplated by richardson,supra,and chevron usa,cayetano cir.furthermore,parkowner sought an administrative remedy for the lack of vacancy control sic,decontrol so as to prevent a regulatory taking.
the trial court correctly found that these claims were facial challenges to the ordinance.see montclair,supra,th at,d premium theory challenge is facial challenge yee mobilehome park rental review bd.th,d vacancy control challenge not claim sandpiper,supra,th at,d claim that vacancy control did not advance a legitimate governmental interest was a facial challenge.as facial challenges,these claims were barred by the statute of limitations and parkowner could not amend them to state a cause of action 
there is another problem with this case,however,and that is the reliance by the parties and the court on the concept that the ordinance either did or did not substantially advance a legitimate government interest.the united states supreme court has held that the substantially advances formula is not a valid method of identifying regulatory takings for which the fifth amendment requires just compensation.lingle,supra,at.t his formula prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process,not a takings,test,and has no proper place in our takings jurisprudence.id.at.
in the instant case,in denying the writ petition,the trial court found that parkowner regulatory takings claims were meritless and that the ordinance as applied was reasonably related to and substantially advanced its stated purposes.the error of applying a due process test in determining a takings claim requires reversal furthermore,since the error permeates the case from pleadings to final determination,and because parkowner was not allowed to amend its takings,equal protection,and due process claims when they were ripe,parkowner should be allowed to amend its complaint.
the england claim 
next,parkowner claims the trial court erred in striking its england reservation england,supra,at.the order sustaining the demurrer simply stated,city motion to strike parkowner england reservation is granted because an england reservation is irrelevant and not proper in the context of this case.
on appeal,parkowner claims the order striking the england reservation is a nullity because the trial court effectively concluded it could decide for the federal courts whether or not parkowner could reserve its federal claims for litigation in federal court.parkowner contends the trial court misapplied federal law because neither city in opposing the england reservation or the court in striking it cite d a single case for the proposition that a state court can strike an england reservation or that an england reservation can not be asserted after a federal action is dismissed on the grounds of ripeness.underscoring original.
in england,plaintiffs,graduates of chiropractic schools,filed suit in federal court challenging the educational requirements of a state statute which limited their right to practice in louisiana.because there were unsettled questions of state law which,when resolved,would obviate the need for a decision on the federal constitutional questions presented,the federal court abstained from considering the issues.railroad comm pullman.the state court held that the state law applied to chiropractors and found that it was not unconstitutional.when plaintiffs returned to federal court to resume their constitutional challenge,the district court dismissed the action on the ground that the state court determination was entitled to preclusive effect.england,supra,at.the supreme court reversed,holding that a party who has been subject to a pullman abstention may reserve his federal claims for federal adjudication by informing the state court of the nature of his federal claims,that he does not wish to litigate those claims in state court,and that he intends,should the state courts hold against him on the question of state law,to return to the district court for disposition of his federal contentions.id.at.in reaching its holding the high court stressed that in the pullman abstention context,the plaintiff presence in state court is compelled and involuntary.in contrast,if a party freely and without reservation submits his federal claims for decision by the state courts,litigates them there,and has them decided there,then he has elected to forgo his right to return to the district court.id.at.
in its brief,parkowner states it presumes that the trial court adopted city arguments in striking the reservation.city had argued that an england reservation must be stricken unless the case involves a case brought to state court after assertion of pullman abstention.in this case,when parkowner filed the instant action,its hillsboro and los altos i federal actions had been dismissed,although parkowner had leave to amend los altos i to address its pleading deficiencies.see ante,the lawsuits,at.it was not until a year after the state action was filed that parkowner filed los altos iii,the case in which the district court refrained from considering parkowner claims pending disposition of the state court appeal.
the district court abstained under younger,supra,not under pullman,although the district court agreed that pullman abstention would be an appropriate alternative.the younger doctrine espouses a strong federal policy against interference with pending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.middlesex ethics comm.garden state bar,d.younger abstention is required when the state proceedings are ongoing,implicate important state interests and provide the plaintiff an adequate opportunity to litigate federal claims.citation.the san remo hotel city and county of san francisco cir.the district court found that the state proceedings were ongoing at the time of its decision because state court proceedings are deemed for purposes of younger abstention until state appellate review is completed gilbertson albright cir,fn.gilbertson the state proceedings implicate the important state interest in enforcing and considering the constitutionality of mobile home park rent control ordinances mission oaks mobile home park city of hollister cir,mission oaks,overruled on other grounds,green city of tucson cir and state courts provide an adequate forum for raising federal constitutional takings claims.mission oaks,supra,at.parkowner did not attempt to raise its federal constitutional takings claims in the instant case.however,when a plaintiff could have presented all of his constitutional claims in the state proceeding,but chose not to do so,this failure to avail himself of the opportunity does not mean that the state procedures are inadequate and does not preclude younger abstention.gilbertson,supra,at.
a prerequisite to a younger abstention is a finding that the federal action would have the same practical effect on the state proceeding as a formal injunction.gilbertson,supra,at.the district court concluded that a determination that the federal plaintiff constitutional rights were violated would be just as intrusive as a declaratory judgment,and thus that abstention was appropriate.id.at.in the instant case,a determination that the city effected a taking of plaintiff property without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment would have the practical effect of a declaration establishing that plaintiff was denied a fair rate of return by the board and that the application of the ordinance effected a confiscatory taking under state law.this is precisely the type of interference that was found adequate to warrant younger abstention in gilbertson.the district court stayed los altos iii pending disposition of the state court appeal.
city cites numerous federal cases for the proposition that the england doctrine is limited to cases where there has been a federal court abstention and a federal litigant is compelled to seek state court determination of claims.montana united states,d.see,for example,fuller ramon gil,cir,notwithstanding state court defendant repeated statement it was reserving a federal question,federal court held england federal claims reservation is available only by properly invoking the jurisdiction of the federal court in the first instance tarpley salerno cir,england reservation has no application in a case in which there was never an abstention by a federal court schuster martin cir,plaintiff filing of a state court document purporting to reserve all his federal claims under england was ineffective where the plaintiff voluntarily chooses to pursue the state action first and in which there never was an abstention by a federal court duty free shop administracion de terrenos cir,duty free shop england state court federal claims reservation is ineffective if the federal court abstention is on younger rather than pullman grounds mission oaks,supra,at england reservation inappropriate in the context of younger abstention.
notwithstanding,city also refers us to montclair,supra,th at page,footnote,d,where the court mentioned that plaintiffs had made an england reservation and limited its claims to state constitutional questions.apparently there was no objection to the england reservation in the trial court.the opinion in montclair gave no details about the timing of the filing of the two actions,whether there was an abstention in the federal case,or whether there was consent by the city to the reservation.see dodd hood river county cir.montclair does not seem to be helpful to us here.
we conclude the trial court did not err in striking the england reservation.england,and its reservations,are not relevant here,in the younger context,where the purpose of abstention is not clarification of state law,but reluctance to interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding.duty free shop,supra,at.
parkowner cites bradley pittsburgh bd.of educ.cir and united parcel service california pub.utilities cir for the propositions,respectively,that the core principal sic of england is its preservation of litigation access to a federal forum he originally chose,and a free and unreserved submission to the state court of all federal claims for complete and final resolution is necessary to bar return to the federal court.id.at.
although parkowner chose federal district court as its original forum,by the time it filed its state court claims,there was no federal forum with jurisdiction over the matter for parkowner to go back to.the trial court did not err in striking the england reservation.
next,parkowner complains the board utilized a base year which was eight years after rent control had been adopted in.parkowner states it was necessary to adopt a control year as a base year.no evidence was presented at the hearing to support the use of a control base year there was no evidence that the rents were at fair market levels in.parkowner also complains that there was a finding that parkowner had agreed in a prior rent increase application that parkowner had accepted its noi as fair.parkowner complains there is no evidence in the administrative record supporting this finding.
we conclude the board had discretion to use as a base year and its decision was a reasonable one based on expert testimony.the purpose of selecting a base year is to find a starting point at which base rent levels reflect general market conditions vega city of west hollywood d.so as to provide the property owner a fair return and then adjust those rents going forward to maintain that return.courts have approved the selection of base years that significantly postdate the enactment of rent control.see mhc operating limited partnership city of san jose th,fn,d base year of permissible even though ordinance was adopted in.
in the instant case,data for any year preceding the enactment of the ordinance was unavailable.baar selected because that was the year parkowner purchased castle and presumably adjusted its purchase price to provide it with a fair return based on the rent levels in effect at the time.see carson harbor village city of carson cir,park owner lacked standing to allege rent control ordinance effected a facial taking because it purchased the park after the enactment of the ordinance and therefore t he price paid for the property presumably reflected the market value of the property minus the interests taken.
parkowner challenges the board conclusion that it had an opportunity in and in subsequent applications to rebut the presumption that it was receiving a fair return but it did not do so.if parkowner had objections to the rent in,or thereafter,it did not communicate them to city.the board was entitled to rely on the presumption stated in section,that the application of this chapter and previous rent review ordinances has resulted in a fair rate of return.
section states,i t will be presumed that application of this chapter and previous rent review ordinances has resulted in a fair rate of return.a park owner who believes that presumption can be overcome may apply to the city council for determination of the minimum increase necessary to produce a fair rate of return.any such application must articulate the definition of fair rate of return under which the claim is being made and cite the authority which establishes that the existing return is less than the minimum fair rate of return.the application should also contain all such supporting information as is necessary for an accurate disposition of the application.if the application is successful,rents shall be increased to the minimum amount necessary to produce a fair rate of return.
a presumption is an assumption of fact that the law requires to be made from another fact or group of facts found or otherwise established in the action.a presumption is not evidence,subd.a.a statute providing that a fact or group of facts is prima facie evidence of another fact establishes a rebuttable presumption.however,in a comment to evidence code section,burden of proof,the law revision commission stated,some presumptions such as presumption of innocence or of sanity do not arise from the establishment or proof of a fact in the action.in fact,they are not presumptions at all but are preliminary allocations of the burden of proof in regard to the particular issue.this preliminary allocation of the burden of proof may be satisfied in particular cases by proof of a fact giving rise to a presumption that does affect the burden of proof.for example,the initial burden of proving negligence may be satisfied in a particular case by proof that undamaged goods were delivered to a bailee and that such goods were lost or damaged while in the bailee possession.upon such proof,the bailee would have the burden of proof as to his lack of negligence.citation.cal.law revision com,deering ann.ed.foll.
although called a presumption,what section does is preliminarily allocate the burden of proof.applying evidence code section to section,the fact which is to be application of the rent control ordinance resulted in a fair rate of not triggered by another fact established in the action.what section does is establish a procedure for a park owner to challenge the current rent rate by requiring the park owner to initiate the process by submitting evidence showing that the current rent does not provide a fair rate of return.
section affects the burden of producing evidence because it operates to implement no public policy other than to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied.the effect of a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence,in which case the trier of fact shall determine the existence or nonexistence of the presumed fact from the evidence and without regard to the presumption.nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the drawing of any inference that may be appropriate.in hearing parkowner application,parkowner evidence prompted the board to present rebuttal evidence.city determined the issue on the evidence,not on the presumption.it appeared from the record that parkowner had an opportunity in and in subsequent applications to rebut the presumption that it was receiving a fair return,and it did so.it received rent increases.what parkowner apparently did not do was raise the separate issue then whether should be used as the base year.since parkowner did not do so,but accepted the rent increases and applied for subsequent increases based on those numbers,the board was entitled to rely on the presumption stated in section,that application of this chapter and previous rent review ordinances has resulted in a fair rate of return.
parkowner complains that the board reliance on baar opinion did not support the selection of as the base year.baar is an urban planner and an attorney.baar does not have a degree or expertise as an accountant or economist,is not an mai appraiser,is not a financial consultant,and does not undertake financial analysis as an expert.baar has no expertise upon which he could rely to conclude a park owner which has been subject to the capitola ordinance for eight years could be presumed to be earning a fair return.
baar testimony was admitted as expert opinion evidence.it is the function of the trial court or other presiding officer cooper board of medical examiners d.to determine the qualifications of an expert,and the degree of his knowledge is a matter affecting the weight of his testimony,not its admissibility.people stuller d.the essential questions which must be favorably answered to qualify a witness as an expert are two does the witness have the background to absorb and evaluate information on the subject does he have access to reliable sources of information about the subject two aspects of the witness history are thus involved the first,a subjective aspect,the capacity of the witness to understand and report the second,an objective aspect,the witness access and exposure to relevant data on the subject matter on which his opinion is sought.naples restaurant,coberly ford d.

the term originated in the context of apartment rent control and is somewhat of a misnomer with respect to mobile home rent control because a mobile home space is not vacated when the mobile home is sold or transferred.see yee escondido,d.
parkowner assured the board that no one will be forced from the mobile home park by virtue of an inability to pay the rent.parkowner established a rent deferral program which allowed homeowners to refrain from paying all or a portion of the increase until the mobile home was sold,the homeowner moved,or something else happens in their condition that indicates that they no longer in the mobile home park.
see testimony of hutchinson and bloodgood llp representative hutchinson,infra.
parkowner designated one space a management space and excluded the amount of its space rent as rental income.the board rejected this approach.noting that spaces were used in the rent calculation,it used the figure in determining space rents in this application.
board members asked davis why he and the principal representative of parkowner,abraham keh,had purchased castle if they truly believed that it was not bringing in enough money under rent control davis replied,we purchased this park with the intention of breaking rent control.he added that parkowner did not expect to get the large rent increase it had requested,but that it would keep it up until homeowners bought the park.

the staff report quoted baar,who had written theories such as the premium theory are not the subject of a fair return hearing.fair return is determined by whether a regulated property owner is permitted a fair return fair profit,rather than by computing the benefit of the regulation to the protected consumer.the property interest theory which bases the allowed rent increase on the increase in the value of the mobilehomes sic is not a fair return criteria sic and,therefore,is not applicable in this case.the staff added that in,the mobile home rent control law,ordinance,contained only one approach for determining a fair rate of.at the time parkowner made the investment,based on ordinance,and at the time of the application,when section provided,fair rate of return shall be determined with reference to reasonable investment rather than property value,parkowner should have expected mnoi determination of rent increase applications.
los altos i was consolidated with parkowner earlier federal action in hillsboro.parkowner and city were parties in both of them.in hillsboro,after city declined to amend the rent control ordinance to include a mechanism which prevented mobile home owners from capturing any premium,parkowners sued in federal court.the court found the taking claim to be unripe,and the premium and
