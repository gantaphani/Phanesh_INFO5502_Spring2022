we granted review to decide whether a city ordinance imposing an inspection fee on private landlords violates article xiii d of the california constitution article xiii d,added by initiative measure,proposition,in.we conclude that it does not.
in july,the city of los angeles put into effect the los angeles housing code.it is codified as article of chapter xvi of the los angeles municipal code et.later that month,plaintiffs sued the city for declaratory and injunctive relief,alleging that los angeles municipal code section,imposing an inspection fee on private landlords,is unenforceable because it was enacted without complying with section of article xiii d.the city demurred.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,finding that the fee was not subject to the constitutional requirements.it entered judgment for the city.
in its statement of decision,the trial court recognized that the inspection fee appears arguably to fall within the wide range of assessments which proposition was apparently written to encompass.but it added,in pennell city of san jose cal d,the california supreme court held that a fee charged to cover the costs of operating san jose rent control ordinances,and not used to raise general revenue,is not subject to article xiii a of the california constitution.the city ordinance here fits squarely within both the reason and rule of pennell.the ordinance levies only property used for residential apartment rentals,and the money is used only to pay for regulat ing such rentals to insure,among other things,that they do not degenerate into what is commonly called slum conditions.the assessment is not imposed on all property a subset of owners who rent apartments.
the court of appeal reversed,holding that the state constitutional provision invalidated the city ordinance.the court wrote there is nothing in proposition that exempts regulatory fees imposed on residential rental properties.it thus adds nothing to say,as does the city,that the fees are not imposed upon property owners in general,but only those who voluntarily engage in the business of renting,generate the risks of slum housing,and specially benefit from regular inspections as they contribute to the overall reputability and safety of the housing provided.quite plainly,proposition applies to any fee or charge,both of which are defined to mean any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a service.art.xiii d,subd.e however well intentioned the city program to abolish slum housing may be,we find it impossible to say that a fee imposed upon the owners of rental units so the city can locate and eradicate substandard housing is anything other than a user fee or charge for a service.italics and fn.omitted.
section of the los angeles municipal code states the reason for enacting the los angeles housing code it is found and declared that there exist in the city of los angeles substandard and unsanitary residential buildings and dwelling units the physical conditions and characteristics of which render them unfit or unsafe for human occupancy and habitation,and which conditions and characteristics are such as to be detrimental to or jeopardize the health,safety and welfare of their occupants and of the public.
it is further found and declared that the existence of such substandard buildings as dwelling units threatens the physical,social and economic stability of sound residential buildings and areas,and of their supporting neighborhood facilities and institutions necessitates disproportionate expenditures of public funds for remedial action impairs the efficient and economical exercise of governmental powers and functions and destroys the amenity of residential areas and neighborhoods and of the community as a whole.
los angeles municipal code section,entitled scope,declares that the los angeles housing code applies to all residential rental properties with two or more dwelling units on the same lot,the land,buildings and structures appurtenant thereto,but not to units,dormitory housing,hotels,motels,or certain other types of housing also specifically exempted.
division of the los angeles housing code et is entitled housing inspection fees.section limits the scope of division to residential rental properties with two or more dwellings subject to the provisions of this code.those properties will be subject to regular inspection by the general manager or an authorized representative.inspections may also be.ibid.
section of the los angeles municipal code,at issue here,sets forth the inspection fee schedule.it provides,in its entirety owners of all buildings subject to inspection shall pay a service fee of per unit per year.the fee will be used to finance the cost of inspection and enforcement by the housing department.should the owner fail to pay the required fee,the city of los angeles will recover it,plus accrued interest,utilizing any remedies provided by law including nuisance abatement or municipal tax lien procedures established by ordinance or state law.this fee shall be known as the systematic code enforcement program fee,boldface omitted.
in november the voters approved proposition,the right to vote on taxes act.ballot,text of,reprinted as historical notes,west ann.cal.const.supp.foll.art.xiii c.the proposition amended the california constitution,adding article xiii section,subdivision a of article xiii d provides that,with certain exceptions not relevant here,no tax,assessment,fee,or charge shall be assessed by any agency upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership except as provided by this article.an agency is a local or regional governmental entity,subd.a cal,art.xiii c,subd.b.
section of article xiii d provides that it applies to all assessments,fees and charges,whether imposed pursuant to state statute or local government charter authority.fees and charges are defined in subdivision e of section thereof.fee or charge means any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a service.ibid.
service is further defined.it means a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.art.xiii d,subd.h.
thus,and in summary,article xiii d applies,with certain exceptions not relevant here,to any levy upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a service.art.xiii d,subd.e.as will appear,the outcome of this case turns on the meaning of this language.
before us is a question of law for the appellate courts to decide on independent review of the facts.sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th,d.though our reasoning turns on the language of the constitutional stricture,it may be helpful to explain,as did the court of appeal in howard jarvis taxpayers city of riverside th,d howard jarvis,the reasons that led to placing proposition on the ballot.
proposition can best be understood against its historical background,which begins in with the adoption of proposition.the purpose of proposition was to cut local property taxes.citation.citation.its principal provisions limited ad valorem property taxes to percent of a property assessed valuation and limited increases in the assessed valuation to percent per year unless and until the property changed hands.cal,art.xiii a.
to prevent local governments from subverting its limitations,proposition also prohibited counties,cities,and special districts from enacting any special tax without a vote of the electorate.cal,art.xiii a,rider county of san diego cal th,d.it has been held,however,that a special assessment is not a special tax within the meaning of proposition.knox city of orland cal th,d,and cases cited.accordingly,a special assessment could be imposed without a vote.
in november,in part to change this rule,the electorate adopted proposition,which added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.proposition allows only four types of local property taxes an ad valorem property tax a special tax an assessment and a fee or charge.cal,art.xiii d,subd.a see also id,subd.a.it buttresses proposition limitations on ad valorem property taxes and special taxes by placing analogous restrictions on assessments,fees,and charges.howard jarvis,supra,th,d.
the court of appeal explained the parties differing views of the effect of article xiii d on the city ordinance.as viewed by plaintiffs,the fee is imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership and is,therefore,subject to the procedural requirements of proposition.as viewed by the city,the fee is imposed upon a business activity the rental of residential dwellings,separate and apart from property ownership,and purely for regulatory purposes,and it is therefore not subject to proposition.italics omitted.
adhering before us to their point of view,plaintiffs contend that nothing in proposition support s the contention that it was not meant to affect the ability of local governments to impose and collect business regulatory fees.the city also adheres to its position,devoting much of its briefing to an argument that because its inspection fee is a regulatory fee on business operations,it falls outside the purview of article xiii examining the ballot arguments for and against proposition and the legislative analyst analysis of the measure,the city also contends that article xiii d was intended only to restrict fees imposed directly on property owners in their capacity as such.a regulatory fee imposed on residential rental businesses,the city argues,necessarily falls outside article xiii d ambit,even if the fee bears some relation to ownership of real property 
as will appear,neither party is entirely correct.the relevant language of article xiii d does not compel a conclusion in plaintiffs favor rather,it compels the opposite.the city also misses the mark when it contends or at least implies that a regulatory fee or a levy on the operation of a business necessarily falls outside the scope of article xiii 
but both parties are partly correct.plaintiffs accurately state that the constitutional provision does not speak of regulatory fees or levies on business operations.hence,the mere fact that a levy is regulatory as this inspection fee clearly is or touches on business activities as it clearly does is not enough,by itself,to remove it from article xiii d scope.but the city is correct that article xiii d only restricts fees imposed directly on property owners in their capacity as such.the inspection fee is not imposed solely because a person owns property.rather,it is imposed because the property is being rented.it ceases along with the business operation,whether or not ownership remains in the same hands.for that reason,the city must prevail.
section of proposition stated the measure purpose.the people of the state of california hereby find and declare that proposition was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases.however,local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax,assessment,fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases,but also threaten the economic security of all californians and the california economy itself.this measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.ballot,supra,text of,reprinted as historical notes,west ann.cal.const.supra,foll.art.xiii c.
the repeated references to taxes and taxpayers suggest an intent to prohibit unratified exactions imposed on property owners as such,rather than on the business of renting or leasing,residential rental properties with two or more dwellings.
as explained in howard jarvis,supra,th,d,proposition is proposition progeny.accordingly,it must be construed in that context.people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d.specifically,because proposition was designed to close loopholes in proposition,the intent and purpose of the latter informs our interpretation of the former.proposition was directed at taxes imposed on property owners,in particular homeowners.the text of proposition,the ballot arguments both in favor and against,the legislative analyst analysis,and the annotations of the howard jarvis taxpayers association,which drafted proposition,all focus on exactions,whether they are called taxes,fees,or charges,that are directly associated with property ownership.
the legislative analyst analysis,printed in the november ballot pamphlet,is illustrative.it explained that proposition would constrain local governments ability to impose fees,assessments,and taxes,meaning fees,including fees for water,sewer and refuse collection,but excluding gas and electricity charges see cal,art.xiii d,subd.b and development fees see,subd.b.ballot,supra,legis.analyst analysis.it did not refer to levies linked more indirectly to property ownership.
the ballot arguments for proposition are also illustrative.proposition guarantees your right to vote on local tax when they are called something else,like assessments or fees and imposed on homeowners.ballot,supra,argument in favor of.after voters passed proposition,politicians created a loophole in the law that allows them to raise taxes without voter approval by calling taxes assessments and fees.ibid.there are now over local districts which can impose fees and assessments without the consent of local voters.special districts have increased assessments by over over years.likewise,cities have increased utility taxes and raised benefit assessments,a increase.ibid.to confirm the impact of fees and assessments on you,look at your property tax bill.you will see a growing list of assessments imposed without voter approval.the list will grow even longer unless proposition passes.ibid.
the ballot arguments identify what was perhaps the drafter main concern tax increases disguised via euphemistic relabeling as fees,charges,or assessments.but in fairness to plaintiffs,it can not be denied that the text of article xiii d does not limit its scope to taxes and taxpayers.we turn to the definitive language restrictions on any levy imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership.art.xiii d,subd.e.
the foregoing language means that a levy may not be imposed on a property owner as,in its capacity as property it meets constitutional prerequisites.in this case,however,the fee is imposed on landlords not in their capacity as landowners,but in their capacity as business owners.the exaction at issue here is more in the nature of a fee for a business license than a charge against property.it is imposed only on those landowners who choose to engage in the residential rental business,and only while they are operating the business.
the contrary reasoning of the court of appeal,and of plaintiffs,stems from a reliance on the word incident,leaving aside that the constitutional provision does not refer to fees imposed on an incident of property ownership,but on a parcel or a person as an incident of property ownership.as amicus curiae for the city persuasively argue,the distinction is crucial.
were the principal words parcel and person missing,and were as replaced with on,so that article xiii d restricted the city ability to impose fees on an incident of property ownership,plaintiffs argument might have merit.for among the incidents of estates in land are the bundle of rights that flow from such tenure.estates.among them is the fundamental right to alienate one property held in fee simple,holien trydahl,davis geyer,so d,hardy galloway,see also yee city of escondido,d.that incident,or right,has been called inseparable holien,supra,at hardy,supra,at,indispensable dukes crumpton,so d,and necessary re collier nfld,per puddester.
the power to alienate property or a property right is not limited to the right to sell or assign it.it means generally the power to transfer or convey it to another.black law,supra.the conveyance need not be the whole fee.the right of alienation applies when fee holders seek to convey lesser estates t he power or right of alienation incident to the ownership of an estate in include s the power or right to dispose of property held in fee by lease,mortgage,or other mode of conveyance porter barrett,quoting manierre welling,italics added here.
accordingly,if article xiii d restricted the city ability to impose a tax,assessment,fee,or charge on an incident of property ownership,subd.e,plaintiffs argument might be persuasive.the business of renting apartments is an incident of owning them,an activity necessarily dependent on that ownership but not vice versa.one can own apartments without renting them,but no one can rent them without owning them.see fn,ante,d at,at.
but the language of article xiii d is materially dissimilar.as stated,article xiii d,section provides that n o tax,assessment,fee,or charge shall be assessed by any agency upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership except as provided by this article.see also,subd.e.in other words,taxes,assessments,fees,and charges are subject to the constitutional strictures when they burden landowners as landowners.the ordinance does not do so it imposes a fee on its subjects by virtue of their ownership of a,because they are landlords what plaintiffs ask us to do is to alter the foregoing as an incident of property ownership to on an incident of property ownership.but to do so would be to ignore its plain,that it applies only to exactions levied solely by virtue of property ownership.we may not interpret article xiii d as if it had been rewritten.accord,people ex rel.lungren superior court,supra,cal th,d.
the language of article xiii d,sections,subdivision e,and,shows that it applies to levies imposed on a person or on property strictly as an incident of property ownership.had the law included levies imposed on incidents of the ownership or use of residential real property as relevant here,the exercise of the right to rent one property,its text would have said so.but it did not.and although the plain language of the relevant constitutional provisions requires us not to consider extrinsic evidence of the voters intent,we reiterate,purely as an aside,that neither the ballot arguments nor the legislative analyst analysis suggested that article xiii d was intended to encompass fees of the type at issue here.
the subordinate clause in section,subdivision e,of article xiii d,as clarified in section,subdivision h,supports our conclusion.it may be recalled that among the fees or charges covered by article xiii d,section,subdivision e,is a user fee or charge for a service.such a service means a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership,subd.h.in this case,the relationship between the city inspection fee and property ownership is is overlain by the requirement that the landowner be a landlord.
as stated,the foregoing clause is subordinate.it does not include all possible fees and charges that fall within the ambit of article xiii d.but it does provide additional evidence of the scope of the constitutional provision 
at oral argument,plaintiffs emphasized article xiii d exemptions for existing development fees and all charges to provide gas and electrical service.art.xiii d,subd.b,subd.b.they assert that a developer fee is a fee on an incident of right to improve that there would have been no need to exempt such fees if other fees imposed on incidents of property did not fall within article xiii d scope.similarly,they argue that one can own property without having utility service,and that if article xiii d applied strictly to levies that are imposed solely on the basis of property ownership,there would have been no need to exempt such utility charges in the constitutional provision.
we note,however,that the provision regarding development fees refers only to those existing at the time of article xiii d enactment.moreover,it is unclear to us whether a fee to provide gas or electricity service is the same as a fee imposed on the consumption of electricity or gas.in any event,we believe that the aforementioned exemptions may have been included in an abundance of caution in case court interpretations of article xiii d similar to the court of appeal should prevail.finally,we do not believe that any incongruity can trump the plain language we have discussed herein.in short,we are unpersuaded.
similarly unpersuasive is plaintiffs contention,also emphasized at oral argument,that the city ability to enforce payment of the inspection fee by imposing a lien on the property shows that the fee is,not.the fact is that the city is simply availing itself of all possible means to collect the fee.property liens may be precipitated by at least one cause unconnected to land ownership except ownership of the land on which the lien is imposed the cost of removing graffiti.a lien may be imposed on parents land to defray the cost of removing graffiti their child has scrawled on that belonging to another,subd.b.
plaintiffs also advert to section of proposition,which requires that t he provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.ballot,supra,text of,reprinted as historical notes,west ann.cal,supra,foll.art.xiii c.but l iberal construction can not overcome the plain language of proposition limiting its scope to levies based on real property.howard jarvis taxpayers city of san diego th,d.as a rule,a command that a constitutional provision or a statute be liberally construed does not license either enlargement or restriction of its evident meaning people cruz cal d.thus,given that article xiii d scope is,as we have explained,unambiguously limited to burdens on landowners as such,no resort to this command of liberal construction is required howard jarvis,supra,th,d,quoting buhlert trucking workers comp.appeals bd.d,fn.or even permitted.
the court of appeal judgment is reversed.
i respectfully dissent.
under the provisions of proposition,affected property owners must approve the imposition of any new or increased fee,which is any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a service.cal,art.xiii d,subd.e article xiii d.the dispositive determination in this case is whether a rental inspection fee is imposed upon a person as an incident of property ownership.ibid.to find that it is not,the majority concludes the court of appeal erroneously substituted on for as.it is the majority that errs,however,in assuming incident denotes the bundle of rights that flow from estates in land,ante,at see,ante,at.in my view,the voters did not intend the courts to look any further than a standard dictionary in applying the terms of article xiii 
a constitutional amendment should be construed in accordance with the natural and ordinary meaning of its words.citation.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,people ex rel.lungren.superior court cal th,d.nothing in the ballot arguments in favor of or against proposition or in the legislative analyst analysis implies that a different rule should obtain with respect to incident,or that the voters intended it to have other than a plain meaning.the dictionary defines an incident as something incident to something else,that is,dependent upon or involved in something else.webster new world dict.college ed see also black law dict.ed,used as a noun,incident denotes anything which inseparably belongs to,or is connected with,or inherent in,another thing also,less strictly,it denotes anything which is usually connected with another,or connected for some purposes,though not inseparably.in other words,if the imposition of a fee depends upon one ownership of property,it comes within the purview of article xiii d unless otherwise excepted.
the fee at issue here plainly meets this definition.pursuant to its police powers,the city of los angeles city enacted a housing code,et,which provides that residential rental properties are subject to regular inspection for substandard and unsan
