we are here called upon to interpret various provisions relating to santa monica rent control law rcl,specifically those relating to evictions in condominium units.the rcl was adopted in.it provided that landlords could evict tenants for.under this initial version of the rcl,landlords were prevented from converting their apartments into condominiums unless they obtained removal permits.
two important changes occurred in.first,in may of that year,santa monica voters adopted a second means by which apartments could be converted into condominiums,the tenant ownership rights charter amendment torca.under torca,a conversion could be accomplished without a removal permit if the tenants were offered an opportunity to purchase their units,and of the tenants supported the conversion application.torca also granted a protection against evictions to all tenants in the building at the time of the conversion who chose not to purchase with respect to the tenants who rented after the conversion,torca gave no protection,and the general provision of the rcl permitting evictions applied.
second,and also in,the santa monica city council became concerned that landlords were converting their buildings into condominiums without obtaining removal permits as required under the rcl.some landlords took the position that they could simply subdivide their property into separate units,sell the interests in the individual units,and the new owners could then evict the tenants for.to prevent this construction,and put buyers of illegally converted units on notice that they could not evict tenants for,the city council adopted an ordinance that evictions would be prohibited in all condominium units unless a removal permit had been obtained for the conversion.shortly thereafter,in november of,the voters incorporated this restriction into the rcl.
the dispute in this case involves the owner of a condominium unit legally converted under torca,who seeks to evict a tenant who was not in possession at the time of the conversion,a tenant.the landlord argues that eviction is permitted under torca.the tenant,and the santa monica rent control board board,say the eviction is impermissible,relying on the rcl provision prohibiting all evictions in condominium conversions unless a removal permit has been obtained.
based upon our review of the legislative history of the rcl amendments,we conclude that the rcl provision prohibiting evictions in conversions,unless a removal permit has been obtained,was clearly intended to prohibit evictions in illegally converted condominiums only,and therefore has no effect in this case,where the condominium was legally converted under torca.
we also conclude that a board regulation prohibiting all attempts at evictions for four years after the landlord voluntarily dismisses an attempt at eviction is invalid as contrary to statutory law.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are not seriously in dispute.in,a torca application was approved for the conversion of the condominium at issue.defendant susan cope was not a tenant at the time of conversion.she became a tenant in.in may,plaintiff yoann bohbot purchased the condominium unit cope was renting.shortly thereafter,he served cope with a notice to quit,based on.in july,bohbot filed an unlawful detainer action against cope,seeking possession of the unit.unbeknownst to him,however,bohbot management company had continued to collect rent from cope,thus invalidating his initial notice to quit.therefore,on august,bohbot dismissed the unlawful detainer action without prejudice on august,bohbot served cope with a second notice to quit,intending to start the eviction proceedings again.cope attorney responded by letter asserting the notice to quit was invalid under the board regulation prohibiting a second attempt at eviction within four years of the dismissal of a previous attempt.
bohbot then brought the instant action against cope and the board,seeking a declaratory judgment that the regulation on which cope relied was void.bohbot sought summary judgment on this basis.the board responded that the trial court need not consider the validity of the regulation.the board argued that,regardless of the regulation,bohbot would never be able to evict cope for due to the rcl provision prohibiting evictions in all condominium units which had been converted without removal permits.
the trial court denied bohbot motion for summary judgment.bohbot was permitted to file a first amended complaint which directly challenged the applicability of the rcl provision,as well as the regulation.for summary judgment were filed.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the board,concluding that bohbot was prohibited from evicting cope for because his condominium unit had been converted without a removal permit.judgment was entered to that effect.bohbot filed a timely notice of appeal.
issues on appeal 
there are two issues raised by this appeal.first,whether the rcl permits the owner of a condominium unit legally converted under torca to evict for a tenant who was not a tenant in the unit at the time of the conversion.second,whether the regulation prohibiting a second attempt at eviction within four years after dismissal of an initial attempt,is invalid.

eviction from torca condominium units 
we are concerned with the interpretation and interaction of several provisions of the santa monica charter,as set forth in the rcl and torca.we first look at the plain language of the relevant provisions.
we begin with the relevant provisions from the current version of the rcl.
santa monica charter section,subdivision t provides,any landlord who desires to remove a controlled rental unit from the rental housing market by conversion is required to obtain a permit from the board prior to such removal from the rental housing market in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the board.section,however,provides,section t of this article shall not apply to any building for which approval has been received pursuant to torca.all other provisions of this article,however,shall continue to apply with full force and effect to each unit in any building receiving approval pursuant to torca.
section,subdivision a sets forth the bases for which a landlord of a controlled rental unit may evict a tenant.section,subdivision a allows evictions for,but section,subdivision a vi provides,no eviction for shall be allowed in any condominium which has been converted from an apartment or other rental unit after the effective date of the rcl,unless the board has issued a removal permit or declared a vested right for said unit.
put simply,the plain language of the rcl provides that no conversion can be made without a removal permit no eviction can be made from a condominium converted without a removal permit but torca conversions can be made without removal permits.to say the least,these provisions give rise to a potential ambiguity.does the exemption of torca conversions from the removal permit requirement of section,subdivision t,exempt them from the removal permit prerequisite for evictions of section,subdivision a vi or,in the alternative,does the exemption of torca conversions from the removal permit requirement result in their failure to meet the requirements for evictions 
certain provisions from torca are also relevant.section,subdivision j defines the term participating tenant as any tenant residing in the building at the date of the approval of the torca application.
section,subdivision b provides,no participating tenant shall at any time after the approval of the torca a pplication be evicted for the purpose of occupancy by the owner in the event the participating tenant does not exercise his or her right to purchase within the time period set forth in torca,the owner may transfer the unit without any price restriction to the participating tenant or any other person.however,in the event such transfer is to someone other than the participating tenant,the transfer shall be expressly made subject to the rights of the participating tenant to continue to occupy the unit as provided for in torca.
section,subdivision b provides,each unit shall at all times remain subject to all terms and conditions of the rcl,before,during and after any torca c onversion.if any unit is rented,the maximum allowable rent for each unit shall be no greater than the maximum allowable rent allowed under the rcl.
section provides,section t of this charter shall not apply to any building for which a torca application has been approved.any provision of any ordinance of the city or any provision of the municipal code or any appendix thereto inconsistent with the provisions of this article,to the extent of such inconsistency and no further,shall not apply to the extent necessary to effect the provisions of this article.italics added.
in sum,the plain language of torca protects participating tenants from evictions,but gives no additional protections to tenants.while the rcl,in general,applies to a torca conversion,torca conversions are expressly exempt from the rcl removal permit requirement.
considering the language of the rcl in conjunction with torca,the construction that best gives effect to all provisions is one which renders torca conversions exempt from the rcl provision requiring removal permits for evictions from condominium units.the entire torca scheme was designed to create an alternative to the procedure of conversion by removal permit.if all torca conversion owners are required to obtain a removal permit in order to evict tenants for,torca advantage of bypassing the removal permit requirement disappears.this conclusion is supported by torca express limitation on eviction of participating tenants.had the santa monica voters intended to prevent eviction of all tenants in torca conversions,such a provision easily could have been enacted as part of torca that the restriction on eviction of all tenants is found in the rcl rather than torca supports the conclusion it was not meant to apply to torca conversions.it should logically follow that the rcl prohibition on evictions in the absence of removal permits does not apply when torca has exempted the conversion from the removal permit requirement.
the board,however,argues that this interpretation of the charter provisions is erroneous.the board contends that our interpretation of section,subdivision a vi,as not applying to torca conversions effectively renders that provision a nullity.indeed,the board contends that section,subdivision a vi applies only to torca conversions,and suggests it was adopted as a response to torca,to give greater protection to tenants.we disagree.
the board argument is simply not supported by the relevant legislative history.on april,the voters of santa monica adopted article xviii of the charter,the rcl.the rcl applied to all controlled rental units in the city,including condominium units which were rental properties.it established limits on the rent which could be charged and the grounds on which tenants could be evicted.it also regulated the removal of controlled rental units from the housing market.the rcl was intended to respond to the housing shortage and rising rents that were becoming increasingly problematic to the public health and welfare of santa monica tenants,especially the poor,minorities,students,young families,and senior citizens.as initially enacted by voters,the rcl allowed evictions for occupancy by the owner or the owner relatives for any controlled rental units,fmr.subd.h.the rcl also provided that any landlord who desires to remove a controlled rental unit from the rental housing market by conversion is required to obtain a permit from the board prior to such removal,fmr.subd.t.the board was permitted to approve a removal permit only if it found that removal of the unit would not adversely affect the city housing supply,if it would be economically infeasible for the landlord to retain and maintain the unit in habitable condition,or if the landlord intended to develop multifamily dwelling units,a minimum portion of which were to be housing.ibid.
nearly five years later,on june,the santa monica voters adopted torca,which radically increased the number of conversions by allowing conversions without removal permits if the tenants agreed.under torca,an application for condominium conversion had to be approved if tenants representing of the units agreed to the conversion and tenants representing of the units indicated their intent to purchase the units,subds.f h.torca specifically provided that rcl section,subdivision t,requiring removal permits for conversions,would not be applicable to torca conversions.
torca provided that each unit would remain subject to the provisions of the rcl including those governing maximum rent with the exception of the removal permit requirement,subd.b.torca provided additional protection for participating tenants in the event they declined to buy their units.most important was that,under a torca conversion,participating tenants could never be evicted for,subd.b.this protection was not extended to tenants,who would still be subject to eviction for under the rcl.see santa monica city attorney informal opinion number.
during the same five year period between the adoption of the rcl and the adoption of torca,building owners fought the restrictions of the rcl in court.prior to the adoption of the rcl,building owners had been able to convert their apartment buildings into condominiums simply by obtaining planning commission approval of their tentative tract maps.some owners argued that obtaining planning commission approval prior to the effective date of the rcl gave them a vested right to proceed with the conversion without the need for removal permits,development,unkefer,d supp.in june,the city council adopted an ordinance setting forth the circumstances in which it would be presumed that a property owner had a vested right to convert a building.santa monica pines,rent control board cal d.when certain owners application for a vested rights exemption was denied,they litigated the issue up to the california supreme court,arguing,among other things,that the state subdivision map act preempted the city attempt to regulate condominium conversions in the rcl.in april,the supreme court rejected this argument,and upheld the rcl.id.at.in the course of its opinion,however,the supreme court noted that obtaining subdivision map approval does grant the owner the right to subdivide the building,that is,to sell fee interests in single apartment units.id.at.the court held,however,that the owner could not transfer those interests free of the general requirement that the owner of a controlled rental unit must obtain a permit before removing it from the rental market.id.at.
building owners interpreted this language to create a loophole in the law the santa monica pines loophole.santa monica pines held that fee interests in single apartment units could be sold,based on subdivision map approval alone.but since the rcl provided for evictions,each new owner of an individual unit could then evict the tenant in the unit,thereby effectively removing the entire building from the controlled housing supply without obtaining removal permits or establishing a vested right.
the santa monica city council reacted to this interpretation with ordinance ccs,which added section to the santa monica municipal code,prohibiting evictions in condominiums converted without removal permits the ordinance expressly stated that its intention was to close the santa monica pines loophole by prohibiting evictions in unlawfully converted condominiums this ordinance was adopted on october.although the ordinance was adopted a few months after torca,it was clearly not intended to impact torca conversions at all indeed,the whereas sections of the ordinance are written as though torca did not exist.specifically,the ordinance states,whereas,it has been the understanding of the city of santa monica and the santa monica rent control board that a removal permit is required in all cases of condominium conversion,including those cases where the landlord has secured and filed a final subdivision map while this is true with respect to the language of the rcl itself,a removal permit is not required in cases of condominium conversion under torca.the language of santa monica municipal code section was enacted only to address the santa monica pines loophole.clearly,it was not intended to address any perceived deficiency in torca.
although torca had been adopted in june,the voters were not given an opportunity to enact conforming changes in the rcl until november.section,subdivision t was the section of the rcl which required a landlord to obtain a removal permit prior to removing a unit from the rental housing market by conversion.torca had already provided that this section was not applicable to torca conversions.in november,section was added to the rcl,providing,section t of this article shall not apply to any building for which approval has been received pursuant to torca.all other provisions of this article,however,shall continue to apply with full force and effect to each unit in any building receiving approval pursuant to torca.tenants residing in such units,whether or not qualifying,participating,or any other such designation under torca,shall enjoy all the rights and remedies provided by the rcl without limitation as to duration or to ownership of the unit.this section is declarative of existing law and does not impose any new requirements or limit any existing ones.
at the same time,two other changes were made to the rcl,for the purpose of permanently closing the santa monica pines loophole.first,section,subdivision h,allowing evictions,was amended to incorporate the language of former santa monica municipal code section,preventing evictions in condominiums converted after the effective date of the rcl unless the rent control board has issued a removal permit or declared a vested right for said unit,fmr.subd.h,now subd.a vi.second,a new subsection was added to section,subdivision t,governing removal permits.that subsection provides,the housing element of the general plan of the city of santa monica shall at all times contain a provision that neither the city council nor any city agency shall approve an application for tentative subdivision map or tentative parcel map for a converted unit until and unless the applicant first obtains a removal permit as required by this section.this subsection shall not apply to any tentative subdivision map or tentative parcel map approved in accordance with torca,subd.t.
what is clear from this history is that the voters did not adopt the language now codified at section,subdivision a vi as a response to torca,in order to strengthen protections for tenants.instead,the voters were simply adding to the rcl the language of a municipal code section which had been enacted to close the santa monica pines loophole 
this conclusion is supported by the fact that,at the same time the voters adopted the language which was to become section,subdivision a vi,they also adopted the language of section which made all sections of the rcl,except the removal permit requirement,applicable to torca units.section specifically indicated it was declarative of existing law and was not adding any additional requirements.it is therefore unlikely the voters intended the simultaneously enacted section,subdivision a vi requirement to impose an additional burden on torca conversions.
this legislative history supports our interpretation of the relevant charter language.torca exemption from the removal permit requirement likewise exempts torca conversions from section,subdivision a vi prohibition on evictions in units converted without removal permits.
invalidity of regulation precluding eviction four years after dismissal of eviction attempt 
section,subdivision g of the rcl grants the board the authority to promulgate rules and regulations as will further the purposes of the article.in,the board promulgated regulation,subdivision b,which is specifically intended to govern evictions for.subdivision b of regulation this subdivision shall be referred to as the regulation provides,any owner who files suit against a tenant for eviction for owner or relative occupancy and who subsequently has the action dismissed,either voluntarily or involuntarily,is precluded from terminating that tenant tenancy for owner or relative occupancy for four years from the date of dismissal,unless such dismissal is pursuant to a written settlement agreement between the owner and tenant negotiated at arms length and signed by both parties.
a rent control provision enacted by a city can not be given effect to the extent that it conflicts with general laws either directly or by entering a field which general laws are intended to occupy to the exclusion of municipal regulation.birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d.in birkenfeld,our supreme court found no preemption of a rent control law that created additional substantive defenses to eviction,but struck down that part of the law which imposed additional procedural requirements on landlords attempting eviction.id.at.unlike the limitations imposed by the rent control law upon chargeable rents and upon the grounds for eviction,which can affect summary repossession proceedings only by making substantive defenses available to the tenant,the mandated procedures raise procedural barriers between the landlord and the judicial proceeding.id.at.similarly,in fisher city of berkeley cal d,the supreme court struck down that portion of a rent control law which not only provided that retaliation would be a defense to an eviction,but also provided that any eviction within six months of a tenant exercise of rent control rights would be presumed to be retaliatory.the provision directly conflicted with the evidence code allocation of the burden of proof,and was therefore invalid.
in this case,bohbot contends the regulation creates an impermissible conclusive presumption that a second eviction attempted within four years of dismissal of an earlier eviction is brought in bad faith.the board contends the regulation is permissible as it creates only a substantive defense to eviction,not an improper procedural requirement 
we find bohbot argument persuasive.to the extent the regulation creates a substantive defense,the defense it creates is based on the fact that the landlord voluntarily dismissed without prejudice a previous attempt to evict for.the procedures governing unlawful detainer actions specify that,unless otherwise indicated,the general provisions of the code of civil procedure apply to unlawful detainer actions.code civ.these provisions include code of civil procedure section,which permits plaintiffs to obtain voluntary dismissals without prejudice if sought prior to the commencement of trial.code civ,subd.b.in other words,the regulation conflicts with the provisions of the code of civil procedure which allow for the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of an unlawful detainer action.c
