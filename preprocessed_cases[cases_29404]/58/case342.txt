the city of santa monica requires landlords of residential rental property to place tenants security deposits in accounts at federally insured financial institutions.since january,the city has required landlords to pay tenants percent interest per year on security deposits.
a group of landlords filed this action,alleging that,due to market conditions,financial institutions are paying less than percent on security deposits,and,as a result,landlords must make up the difference with their own funds.the landlords contend that this type of exaction constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation cal,art.i,amend.
the trial court dismissed the action on demurrer.we conclude that the complaint sufficiently pleads a takings claim because the percent interest requirement does not substantially advance a legitimate state interest and has an adverse impact on landlords.we therefore reverse.
background 
in,the city of santa monica adopted a rent control charter rent control law santa monica charter,and created a rent control board board to prevent landlords of residential rental property from charging unreasonably high rents while,at the same time,allowing landlords to make a fair return on their property.pursuant to the rent control law,the board adopted regulations that use a net operating income noi formula to determine whether rents are providing landlords with a fair return on their property and,if not,the amount of a rent adjustment.
under the noi formula,a landlord income in the base year usually is presumptively a fair return.rent bd,reg.e.in subsequent years,a fair return is maintained by permitting rents to be raised based on increased operating expenses and inflation.noi is defined as gross income less operating expenses,reg.a.gross income includes gross rents computed as gross rental income at percent paid occupancy,cleaning fees,parking fees,and income from laundry facilities,reg.b.operating expenses include real property taxes,utility costs,insurance expenses,management fees,normal repair and maintenance expenses,and expenditures for capital improvements,reg.c see generally kavanau santa monica rent control bd.cal th,d,kavanau.
as amended,the rent control law states any payment or deposit of money the primary function of which is to secure the performance of a rental agreement or any part of such agreement,including an advance payment of rent,shall be placed in an interest bearing account at a federally insured financial institution until such time as it is returned to the tenant or entitled to be used by the landlord.unless and until the board enacts regulations directing that the interest on such accounts be paid directly to the tenant,the landlord may either pay such interest directly to the tenant or use it to offset operating expenses the board may regulate the amount and use of security deposits consistent with the purposes of this article and state law.santa monica charter,s,italics added.
the board amended its regulations in to state that a ll security deposits shall be placed in an account at an institution whose accounts are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or the federal savings and loan insurance corporation until such time as they are returned to tenants or entitled to be used by the landlord.rent bd,reg.a.the amended regulations did not require that tenants receive the interest on security deposits.accordingly,landlords could either pay the interest to tenants or use it to benefit the property.santa monica charter,s see rent bd,former reg.b.until recently,that was the state of affairs in santa monica.
on january,the board approved regulations stating a landlord shall pay simple interest per annum on all security deposits held for at least one year.the rent control board shall review the market interest rates at least every three years to determine the rate for the next three years.interest shall begin accruing on january.a tenant shall be given unpaid accrued interest either by direct payment or by a credit against the tenant rent.rent bd,reg.b,c.
with the enactment of the regulations,the board exercised its authority under the rent control law to direct that the interest on security deposit accounts be paid directly to the tenant santa monica charter,s.as a consequence,landlords could no longer use the interest to benefit the property.instead,they became obligated to pay tenants a fixed rate of percent per security deposits.the rent control law requires that security deposits be placed in a federally insured financial institution.for simplicity,we will use the term bank to include all such institutions.
on march,action apartment association,an organization of residential landlords,and herb balter,a landlord who owns rental units,filed this class action,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages for inverse condemnation.we sometimes refer to the association and balter collectively as plaintiffs or the association.
the complaint alleged as follows a ll members of the plaintiffs class pay their tenants interest on security deposits at a rate more than the amount of interest paid by the banks on the deposited funds 
at the time that the first interest payment to tenants was due,landlords were receiving between and per year on their security deposited funds.this means that at least half of the payment of by landlords was not and is not offset by the receipt of interest from the bank and amounts to confiscation by regulation of the landlords own funds.
t here are approximately owners of residential rental property in santa monica and approximately residential rental units.this means that the regulations concerning interest on security deposits have caused or will cause the residential rental landlords of santa monica to pay approximately per year which they should not have had to pay.
the board will not review the interest rate set by the regulations for more years.thus before the next scheduled review,landlords will lose in excess of due to the wrongful regulations.the lost interest payments are not offset by any corresponding general rental increase or any other payment of monies to landlords.
the difference between the interest received and the interest paid out has caused and will cause plaintiffs to have losses 
the complaint alleged that the regulations concerning security deposit interest were invalid under the takings clauses of the state and federal constitutions cal,art.i,amend.preempted by a state statute that governs the payment,use,and return of security deposits,and unlawful as being in excess of the board authority under the rent control law santa monica charter,s.
on july,the association filed an amended complaint that,in most respects,was identical to the first one.the association added an allegation that it did not challenge the maintenance of security deposits or the payment of interest on security deposits the association challenge s only the mandated payment in excess of interest earned on the deposited funds with its effect of requiring landlords to reach into their own pockets to pay the additional interest.the association also added a cause of action seeking a writ of prohibition.
on august,the board filed a demurrer,arguing that the association legal theories were without merit.the association filed opposition.on september,the matter was heard and taken under submission.on october,the trial court issued its ruling,sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.an order and judgment were entered to that effect.the association filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
in reviewing the ruling on a demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.blank kirwan cal d,citations omitted.all material allegations of the complaint are accepted as true.hensler city of glendale cal th,fn,d.
we begin our analysis by discussing the characteristics of rent and security deposits under the rent control law.we then apply takings principles to the allegations of the amended complaint.next,we consider the board arguments that a viable takings claim has not been pleaded.finally,in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we discuss whether the board regulations are preempted by state law and whether they exceed the board authority under the rent control law.
rent is the consideration paid by the tenant to the landlord for the use,enjoyment and possession of the leased premises.smith state bd.of equalization th,fn,d.it is the means by which landlords make a profit on their property.rent is paid throughout the tenancy,usually once a month,in advance.friedman et,cal.practice guide landlord tenant the rutter group to,to.as a general rule,a lease must include a definite description of the property leased and an agreement for rent to be paid at particular times during a specified term.beckett city of paris dry goods cal d.
under the rent control law,the board must adjust rents under the noi formula to provide landlords with a fair return on their property.see santa monica charter,e rent bd,reg.the board implements a general adjustment each year by holding public hearings and,thereafter,adjust ing upward or downward the rent ceiling for all controlled rental units in general for particular categories of controlled rental units deemed appropriate by the board.santa monica charter,a,italics added see rent bd,reg.the board generally adjusts rents upward to reflect any increases in taxes,utility bills,or the cost of maintenance.santa monica charter,b.a downward adjustment is warranted only if taxes have decreased.ibid.
if a landlord is not satisfied with the general adjustment,it can file a petition for an individual rent adjustment,that is,an increase in rents.see santa monica charter,c,d rent bd,reg,a.a hearing examiner will conduct a public hearing on the petition and render a written decision in accordance with the noi formula.a landlord,tenant,or board member can appeal the hearing examiner decision to the board,which will conduct a public hearing and issue a written decision.santa monica charter,c,d rent bd,reg.
in making both individual and general adjustments t he board may adopt as its fair return standard any lawful formula,including but not limited to one based on investment or noi.the board shall consider all factors relevant to the formula it employs such factors may include increases or decreases in operating and maintenance expenses,the extent of utilities paid by the landlord,necessary and reasonable capital improvement of the controlled rental unit as distinguished from normal repair,replacement and maintenance,increases or decreases in living space,furniture,furnishings,equipment,or services,substantial deterioration of the controlled rental unit other than as a result of ordinary wear and tear,failure on the part of the landlord to provide adequate housing services or to comply substantially with applicable housing,health and safety codes,federal and state income tax benefits,the speculative nature of the investment,whether or not the property was acquired or is held as a long term or short term investment,the landlord rate of return on investment,the landlord current and base date noi,and any other factor deemed relevant by the board in providing the landlord a fair return.santa monica charter,e,italics added see,f h rent bd,reg.
security deposit 
unlike rent,which belongs to the landlord,a security deposit is the property of the tenant.see,subds.d f korens zukin d.comment,interest on security or burden to the tenant ucla,fn,citing former,subd.b,added by stats,ch,now,subd.d.

while rent adjustments provide landlords with a fair return on their property,a security the landlords a different purpose to protect and preserve their property and investment.security deposits may be a landlord best guarantee against risks of rent nonpayment and damage to the premises.friedman et,cal.practice guide,supra.
landlords may use a security deposit in several ways,including the compensation of a landlord for a tenant default in the payment of rent.the repair of damages to the premises,exclusive of ordinary wear and tear,caused by the tenant or by a guest or licensee of the tenant.the cleaning of the premises upon termination of the tenancy.to remedy future defaults by the tenant in any obligation under the rental agreement to restore,replace,or return personal property or appurtenances,exclusive of ordinary wear and tear,if the security deposit is authorized to be applied thereto by the rental agreement,subd.b see,subd.e.
the maximum amount of a security deposit is determined by the amount of the first rent payment the deposit can not exceed two months rent for an unfurnished unit or three months rent for a furnished unit,subd.c rent bd,reg.b.in general,rents increase over time.in contrast,a security deposit is usually paid once and does not increase,subd.c rent bd,reg.c.thus,even though the first rent payment determines the ceiling on security deposits,rents will increase over time as will the cost of most goods and services,but the security deposit generally will not change with each passing year,the security deposit provides less protection for the landlord property and investment.
as one leading treatise has explained all security deposits received by a landlord are held for the benefit of his tenants,and subject to total or partial refund,and a tenant claim for refund has priority over the claims of the landlord creditors.the deposits are subject to refund to the tenant at the termination of the tenancy,after lawful deductions there are no nonrefundable or forfeitable security deposits,and the right of the tenant to receive a refund can not be altered or modified by any agreement between the parties.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,fns.omitted see.
as stated,the noi formula is used to adjust rents.with respect to interest on security deposits,neither the rent control law nor the regulations provide a formula for setting the interest rate.
takings law 
our state constitution provides that p rivate property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation has first been paid to,or into the court for,the owner.cal,art.i.the federal constitution states n or shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation,amend see chicago,burlington r chicago.federal takings clause applies to the states.
as a preliminary matter,we point out that most regulatory takings cases involve a regulated or affected business a landlord contending that the applicable regulation rent control does not allow it to make a sufficient profit.this case does not fall into that category.the issue here is not whether landlords in santa monica make a fair return on their property.
rather,we start with the recognition that two distinct groups make a profit under the rent control law and the board regulations landlords,by collecting rents and tenants,by earning percent interest on security deposits.the present case involves the tenants profit,and,more specifically,whether the interest forcibly paid by landlords is too high.traditional takings principles did not develop with this scenario in mind.even so,we find that current takings jurisprudence provides an adequate framework for analyzing the issue before us.
the association challenges the obligation to pay percent interest on security deposits,as decreed by the board,while the interest paid by banks is lower,alleged to be to percent.concededly,the board has the authority to require that tenants receive the amount of interest paid by the banks.
the takings clause preserves governmental power to regulate,subject only to the dictates of justice and fairness.there is no abstract or fixed point at which judicial intervention under the takings clause becomes appropriate.formulas and factors have been developed in a variety of settings resolution of each case,however,ultimately calls as much for the exercise of judgment as for the application of logic.andrus allard,d,citations omitted.the concepts of fairness and justice underlie the takings clause palazzolo rhode island,d conc.opn.of,palazzolo accord,concrete pipe products of,construction laborers pension trust for southern cal,d.
t he united states supreme court has held that a regulation of property that goes too far may effect a taking of that property,though its title remains in private hands.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.t he court has recognized that there will be instances when government actions do not encroach upon or occupy the property yet still affect and limit its use to such an extent that a taking occurs.in justice holmes,if less than,formulation,while property may be regulated to a certain extent,if a regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.palazzolo,supra,at.at.the united states supreme court has concluded that the inquiry in any particular case is essentially ad hoc and a question of degree that can not be disposed of by general propositions kavanau,supra,cal th at,d,citations omitted.
nevertheless,a per se rule can be applied to two discrete categories of regulatory action which constitute takings as a matter of law first,government action that effectuates a permanent physical invasion of property,no matter how slight,constitutes a per se taking second,regulatory action that deprives an owner of all economically beneficial or productive use of land effects a taking as a matter of law.cwynar city and county of san francisco th,d,citations omitted cwynar accord,kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.
government conduct that does not fall into a per se category may,however,constitute a regulatory taking.such regulations must be evaluated under the ad hoc analysis courts have employed two basic tests have been developed to assist courts in applying this essentially analysis.the first test focuses on the government purpose for enacting the regulation under this formula,a regulation of property effects a taking if it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests.the second test focuses on the impact of the regulation on the property owner.under this test,a variety of factors may be relevant depending on the facts of the case at issue there is no comprehensive list to be mechanically applied the two general tests are interrelated,and are sometimes combined into one part test.cwynar,supra,th at,d,citations omitted accord,kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.here,we apply both parts of the test.
governmental purpose 
a property owner can prove that a regulation of his or her private property constitutes a taking by showing that the regulation does not substantially advance a legitimate state interest there must be a sufficient nexus between the effect of the ordinance and the objectives it is supposed to advance.
the united states supreme court has expressly stated that this standard is not the same as that applied to due process or equal protection claims the court has required that the regulation substantially advance the legitimate state interest sought to be achieved,not that the state could rationally have decided that the measure adopted might achieve the state objective.
some courts have applied a heightened level of scrutiny to discretionary governmental determinations requiring owners to dedicate property or pay fees as a condition for an otherwise lawful use of property at the other extreme,generally applicable zoning or price control regulations are sometimes subject to a more deferential review.cwynar,supra,th at,d,citations and italics omitted see ehrlich city of culver city cal th,d,plur.opn.of arabian,discussing levels of scrutiny in takings cases id.at,d,conc.opn.of mosk,same id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard,same.

here,we need not decide which level of scrutiny applies or whether there is only one level of scrutiny in regulatory takings cases.our ultimate conclusion would be the same regardless of the resolution of those issues.it is well settled that a regulation of property effects a taking if it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d,quoting agins city of tiburon,d accord,santa monica beach,supra,cal th at,d.the board has not offered any state interest,much less a legitimate one,for requiring landlords to pay percent interest when banks are paying a lower rate.
the purpose of the rent control law is to provide an adequate supply of affordable rental housing,especially for the poor,minorities,students,young families,and senior citizens,while allowing landlords to make a fair return on their property.see santa monica charter.we fail to see how that purpose is served by forcing landlords to pay a higher rate of interest on security deposits than the rate prevailing in the open market.under the board scheme,a security deposit is a better investment vehicle than a money market account.there is no logic,fairness,or justice in that.when economic conditions cause banks to pay less than percent on deposit accounts,as is the case today,a landlord should not become a tenant cash cow.
in sum,the board has not offered a legitimate reason for making landlords pay percent interest on security deposits.we therefore conclude that the board regulations do not substantially advance a legitimate state interest.
impact of government regulations 
when a regulation does not result in a physical invasion and does not deprive the property owner of all economic use of the property,a reviewing court must evaluate the regulation in light of the factors the united states supreme court discussed in penn central transp.new york city,d penn central and subsequent cases.penn central emphasized three factors in particular t he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct expectations and the character of the governmental action.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d,accord,palazzolo,supra,at.at.the united states supreme court has also considered other factors in examining the impact of a regulation 
but t his list of factors is not a comprehensive enumeration of all the factors that might be relevant to a takings claim,and we do not propose a single analytical method for these claims.rather,we simply note factors the high court has found relevant in particular cases.thus,instead of applying these factors mechanically,checking them off as it proceeds,a court should apply them as appropriate to the facts of the case it is considering.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.
we reach our conclusion in this case by applying the three penn central factors that traditionally have informed the supreme court regulatory takings analysis.eastern enterprises apfel,d plur.opn.of,see id.at.plur.opn.of,applying three penn central factors id.at.dis.opn.of breyer,same palazzolo,supra,at.at,emphasizing penn central factors.
the economic impact of the regulations on landlords the first penn central factor can be assessed in more than one way.for instance,the amended complaint alleges that banks have been paying between and percent interest on tenants security deposits.on average,then,landlords have been required to use their own funds to pay a significant portion of the annual to percent.
further,during the period contemplated by the board reviews the interest rate at least every three years rent bd,reg.b landlords,as a group,will be out of pocket million.during that period,each landlord,on average,will use of its own funds to pay all of its tenants.the individual plaintiff,herb balter,will pay.over three years,landlords will contribute per rental unit.
although the board views these figures as de minimis,we do not.a small taking is still a taking.and there are additional burdens concomitant with requiring a landlord to account for interest payments.these include the costs of calculation,the time involved in explaining the calculations to the dissatisfied tenant,billing,handling,and,in the case of large management companies,the cost of computer time.comment,interest on security or burden to the tenant,supra,ucla.at.t he administration of interest payments may create tremendous problems for small landlords who handle only a few deposits and can not afford to spend a great deal of time on their rentals.while the large landlord may have a system whereby he can administer interest payments,the small landlord does not.id.at,fn.
as for the second penn central factor,the percent interest regulations,as applied,are contrary to the landlords reasonable expectations.landlords might have expected that,some day,they would have to pay security deposit interest to their tenants see santa monica charter,s,but they surely did not expect that the payments would exceed the interest paid by banks.nevertheless,since january,landlords have paid roughly per year to cover the difference between the mandatory percent rate and the banks rate.
with respect to the character of the board action the third penn central factor,t he provision of the ordinance requiring that interest on security deposits be paid by landlords at a specified rate,regardless of market conditions,is remote from any concern with the health or safety of santa monica residents,the quality of housing in santa monica,or the welfare of santa monica as a whole.the ordinance only apparent rationale is to transfer wealth from landlords to it an unedifying example of class legislation chicago bd.of realtors,city of chicago cir,opn.of posner.
in addition,the board action is quite unusual,treating private landlords like banks but not allowing them to lower interest rates during an economic downturn.as a practical matter,tenants enjoy the benefit of a certificate of in a higher rate of interest than on other deposit incurring the corresponding penalty for early withdrawal.many tenants have tenancies,terminable on days notice.see.within three weeks after a tenant vacates the premises,a landlord must give the tenant an itemized statement indicating the basis for retaining any part of the security deposit and refund the deposit or,where appropriate,the remaining portion of the deposit,subd.f.as a result,landlords must keep security deposit funds relatively liquid in order to return security deposits,in whole or in part,on short notice.yet,the board insists that landlords pay interest on security deposits at a rate commensurate with a longer term investment.
moreover,t he determination that governmental action constitutes a taking is,in essence,a determination that the public at large,rather than a single owner,must bear the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest.the question in any case where government action is challenged as violative of the right to just compensation,is whether the uncompensated obligations and restrictions imposed by the governmental action force individual property owners to bear more than a just share of obligations which are rightfully those of society at large.cwynar,supra,th at,d,citation omitted.
here,the board has taken an investment opportunity provided by payment of interest on deposited imposed it on private landlords.national banks are quasipublic institutions mercantile nat.bank langdeau,d accord,intrawest financial western nat.bank.a banking corporation is unlike a purely private corporation in that a banking corporation is a institution it is a institution in the sense that t he whole stream of commerce,whether interstate or intrastate,largely depends upon its existence.b anks are indispensable agencies through which the industry,trade,and commerce of all civilized countries and communities are carried on the business which they transact,though for private profit,is of a public nature in re invol.dissol.of battle creek bank.
as one of our own courts has stated though banks are organized and financed by private individuals for personal gain,they are in a sense public institutions,subject to legislative regulation,examination and control in the progress made in the industrial and economic world,the business of banking has ceased to be,if it ever was,a purely private enterprise.such business affects intimately the commercial welfare and business interests of the people the public patronage which the banker invites and receives is of such a character that he becomes an observer of the fiscal affairs of the people of the state frankini bank of america d,citations and italics omitted.in fact,a bank depositor funds are insured by an agency of the federal government,albeit with certain exceptions and caps.see a fed.deposit ins,your insured deposit.
no doubt,the board can compel landlords to give tenants the interest paid by the bank.but it is an entirely different matter for the board to require that security deposits be placed in a bank and then demand that landlords pay tenants more than the interest earned on the account.purely private entities like interest rates and pay interest on deposited funds.the board should therefore look to the banking industry,which is in nature,to determine the appropriate interest rate.
the security deposit law in the state of new york provides an apt example.it does not specify a particular rate of interest but requires that landlords give tenants the interest paid by the bank.the landlord serves as a mere intermediary in the process.under the statute,the landlord is entitled to keep percent per year as compensation for administrative and custodial expenses.oblig.law mckinney.the statute further states the balance of the interest paid by the banking organization shall be the money of the person making the deposit or advance and shall either be held in trust by the person with whom such deposit or advance shall be made,until repaid or applied for the use or rental of the leased premises,or annually paid to the person making the deposit of security money,italics added.this regulatory scheme avoids the need to amend rent control laws and regulations to reflect changes in market conditions.
in conclusion,based on the constitutional prohibition against the taking of private property for public use without just compensation,the association has adequately pleaded a cause of action,provided the board we discuss merit.
d.the board contentions 
according to the board,the association has not adequately pleaded a takings claim because the claim is not ripe,the association did not exhaust administrative remedies,and the challenged regulations did not result in a cognizable injury.
the ripeness requirement,a branch of the doctrine of justiciability,prevents courts from issuing purely advisory opinions it is rooted in the fundamental concept that the proper role of the judiciary does not extend to the resolution of abstract differences of legal opinion.it is in part designed to regulate the workload of courts by preventing judicial consideration of lawsuits that seek only to obtain general guidance,rather than to resolve specific legal disputes.however,the ripeness doctrine is primarily bottomed on the recognition that judicial is best conducted in the context of an actual set of facts so that the issues will be framed with sufficient definiteness to enable the court to make a decree finally disposing of the controversy 
the controversy must be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests it must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical set of facts.the actual controversy is one which admits of definitive and conclusive relief by judgment within the field of judicial administration,as distinguished from an advisory opinion upon a particular or hypothetical state of facts.the judgment must decree,not suggest,what the parties may or may not do.the principle that courts will not entertain an action which is not founded on an actual controversy is a tenet of common law jurisprudence,the precise content of which is difficult to define and hard to apply a controversy is ripe when it has reached,but has not passed,the point that the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made.pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d,citations and italics omitted.
a claim that the application of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue 
the courts reluctance to examine taking claims until such a final decision has been made is compelled by the very nature of the inquiry required by the just compensation clause.although t he question of what constitutes a taking for purposes of the fifth amendment has proved to be a problem of considerable difficulty,the supreme court consistently has indicated that among the factors of particular significance in the inquiry are the economic impact of the challenged action and the extent to which it interferes with reasonable expectations those factors simply can not be evaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at a final,definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question.
the question whether administrative remedies must be exhausted is conceptually distinct,however,from the question whether an administrative action must be final before it is judicially reviewable while the policies underlying the two concepts often overlap,the finality requirement is concerned with whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual,concrete injury the exhaustion requirement generally refers to administrative and judicial procedures by which an injured party may seek review of an adverse decision and obtain a remedy if the decision is found to be unlawful or otherwise inappropriate.williamson planning comm hamilton bank,d,citations omitted accord,palazzolo,supra,at.at.
in this case,the issues are framed with sufficient definiteness.the challenged regulations impose an actual concrete injury landlords are forced to contribute their own funds to pay tenants percent interest on security deposits.the controversy is real and substantial,not hypothetical.the board arrived at a final,definitive position on the regulations some time ago,more specifically,january.the regulations are sufficiently final for us to we have already economic impact of the challenged action and the extent to which it interferes with reasonable expectations.williamson planning comm hamilton bank,supra,at.see pt,ante.thus,the case is ripe for decision.
exhaustion 
the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedy is founded on the theory that the administrative tribunal is created by law to adjudicate the issue sought to be presented to the court,and the issue is within its special jurisdiction.if a court allows a suit to go forward prior to a final administrative determination,it will be interfering with the subject matter of another tribunal consequently,the requirement of exhaustion is a jurisdictional prerequisite,not a matter of judicial discretion tahoe vista concerned citizens county of placer th,d,citations omitted accord,styne stevens cal th,d.
there are several reasons for the exhaustion of remedies doctrine.the basic purpose for the exhaustion doctrine is to lighten the burden of overworked courts in cases where administrative remedies are available and are as likely as the judicial remedy to provide the wanted relief.even where the administrative remedy may not resolve all issues or provide the precise relief requested by a plaintiff,the exhaustion doctrine is still viewed with favor because it facilitates the development of a complete record that draws on administrative expertise and promotes judicial efficiency.it can serve as a preliminary administrative sifting process,unearthing the relevant evidence and providing a record which the court may review sierra club san joaquin local agency formation com.cal th,d,citations omitted see hensler city of glendale,supra,cal th at,d,where government regulations restrict the development of real property,landowner must first pursue available administrative remedies such as a variance or a change in permit conditions and then seek judicial relief by way of a petition for writ of administrative mandate.
in the case before us,the board argues that the association had to seek administrative relief through the general adjustment process or a petition for an individual rent adjustment.based on the pleadings,the rent control law,and the board regulations,we can not say at this early stage that the association failed to exhaust administrative remedies.we begin with some general comments about exhaustion and then discuss in more detail the two remedies mentioned by the board.
it is settled that the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply where an administrative remedy is unavailable or inadequate tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d,citations omitted accord,automotive management group,new motor vehicle bd.th,d.here,we conclude that general and individual rent adjustments do not offer an available or adequate remedy.
as stated,general and individual rent adjustments are concerned solely with setting rents.the adjustments are not pertinent to the issue before us the interest to be paid on security deposits.general and individual rent adjustments involve the application of numerous factors in performing a complex assessment under the noi formula to determine whether rents are providing a landlord with a fair return.see pt,ante.
in addition,the law applicable to rents is fundamentally different from the law governing security deposits,largely because rent is the property of the landlord,and a security deposit is the property of the tenant.see pts,ante.in light of these divergent interests in ownership,we fail to see how an administrative process for setting rents is of any value in determining the rate of return a landlord can be required to pay on a security deposit.
the association specifically alleged in the amended complaint that t he lost interest payments are not offset by any corresponding general rent increases or any other payment of monies to the landlords.fairly read,the association alleged that general and individual rent adjustments would not remedy the landlords injury.
we now turn to the particular administrative remedies that,according to the board,the association should have pursued.
general rent adjustment 
in making a general rent adjustment each year,the board conducts a public hearing and thereafter adjust s upward or downward the rent ceiling for all controlled rental units in general for particular categories of controlled rental units deemed appropriate by the board.santa monica charter,a,italics added.for the moment,we put aside our previous observation that a general rent adjustment applies to rents and not security deposits.
landlords can increase security deposits in limited situations.see rent bd,reg.c,a fn,ante.and there may be occasions when tenants are entitled to a reduced security deposit.see rent bd,reg.b fn,ante.but,as provided by regulation,a general adjustment does not apply to a security deposit.rent bd,reg.c.given that a general adjustment can not be used to change the amount of a security deposit,it would be odd indeed if such an adjustment could be used to change the amount of interest on a security deposit.
further,in papers filed on appeal,the board has stated nor is it likely that the board would ever be called upon to consider interest on security deposits in general adjustment hearings,since landlords could individually pursue rent increases italics added see pt,post individual rent increase is inadequate remedy.similarly,at the hearing in the trial court on the board demurrer,the trial judge asked,is there any particular hearing procedure to address the amount of interest that is required to be paid counsel for the board replied,no there is no separate proceeding for that.it would simply be under the normal rent increase petition.see pt,post discussing petition to increase rent.
in sum,a general rent adjustment does not provide the association with an administrative procedure for challenging the percent interest regulations.but that is not to say that the board lacks the authority to change the interest rate.the regulations expressly state that t he rent control board shall review the market interest rates at least every three years to determine the rate for the next three years.rent bd,reg.b,italics added.the board therefore has the authority to review and change the interest rate at any time during a given period.
individual rent adjustment 
in a petition for an individual rent adjustment,a landlord relies on unique or particular circumstances that purportedly justify an increase not adequately covered by a general adjustment.a petition is filed by an individual landlord,not a group of landlords.see santa monica charter,rent bd,reg.as a result,in order to reduce the amount of interest that landlords pay on security deposits,each of the city landlords would have to file its own petition.
the processing of a petition can be lengthy and costly.the petition itself,which consists of pages and schedules,requires considerable information and documentation.for example,a landlord must submit expert witness reports,any and all invoices,canceled checks,receipts and ledger sheets or other documentation for the base year and the current year of the petition,showing the following rents collected from all tenants the amount of other income received in the period property taxes assessed and paid amounts billed and paid for electricity,gas,water service,and trash service amounts expended for maintenance and repair capital expenses license fees or other fees paid labor and the applicable hourly rates and miscellaneous expenses paid.rent bd,reg.c.
a hearing examiner conducts a public hearing at which the landlord and any opponents can express their views.rent bd,reg.within days after the filing of the petition,the hearing examiner renders a written decision,reg,which is based on the noi formula and is intended to provide the landlord with a fair return on its property,reg.
within days after the date of the hearing examiner decision,the landlord,a tenant,or a board member can appeal to the board.rent bd,reg.a staff report is prepared that contains a written recommendation to affirm,reverse,or modify the decision of the hearing examiner,reg.the board gives written notice of the place and time it will act on the appeal,reg.unless the board decides to conduct a de novo hearing,its decision is limited to the administrative record before the hearing examiner,any information submitted in connection with the appeal,and any testimony heard by the board,reg.the board decision must be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of law,reg.see generally kavanau,supra,cal th at,d.
consistent with the process for resolving individual rent petitions as set forth in the regulations above,the association states in its opening brief that t o prosecute a noi rent increase petition cost s thousands of dollars and to months of time.and we,like a general rent adjustment,a petition for an individual rent adjustment is concerned with rent,not security deposits.a petition determines whether a landlord is making a fair return under the noi formula,not whether the interest rate on security deposits is excessive.in short,there is no available or adequate administrative remedy.
moreover,even if a petition for an individual rent adjustment could somehow provide a means of challenging the percent interest regulations,we would still several exhaustion is not required.see sierra club san joaquin local agency formation,supra,cal th at,d,discussing purpose of doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges,supra,cal d at,discussing exceptions to exhaustion doctrine public employment relations bd.superior court th,d same see styne stevens,supra,cal th at,d,purpose of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is to reduce the burden on courts while benefiting from the expertise of an agency.
for one thing,the validity of the challenged regulations is a straightforward legal issue that needs little in the way of factual development.the challenge to the regulations also presents a dispositive question within judicial,not administrative,competence a n administrative agency is not competent to decide whether its own action constitutes a taking hensler city of glendale,supra,cal th at,d.the board expertise is of no assistance here.
further,the board is not likely to resolve the dispute in a manner that makes judicial review unnecessary.that is so given the board position that the city landlords must file individual rent petitions,which would be separately processed to determine whether a landlord is making a fair return under the noi formula.yet,the issue validity of the percent interest a single,discrete point that is not related to whether landlords are making a fair return on their property.see pt,ante.as against the piecemeal review of the same issues by individual challenges to the same regulations,the present action appears singularly economical.venice town council,city of los angeles th,d.
nor will judicial resolution of the dispute impair the board functioning.the dispute can be efficiently and inexpensively resolved in a judicial forum.as the association states in its opening brief,the processing of an individual rent petition imposes a severe time and financial burden on a landlord and require s a long administrative process and a public airing of his or her entire financial condition to obtain a small increase in rents to offset overpayment of interest on security deposits held.
finally,a lthough waiver is the general rule when parties fail to exhaust their administrative remedies,we may agree to hear a case involving important questions of public policy.lindeleaf agricultural labor relations bd.cal d.we therefore conclude that the association members did not have to pursue individual rent petitions.
the board argues that the damage suffered by the association members,if any,was not sufficient to state a takings claim.the board also contends that the remedy sought by the association,if granted,would lead to judicial micromanagement of the rent control law.we disagree with both contentions.
