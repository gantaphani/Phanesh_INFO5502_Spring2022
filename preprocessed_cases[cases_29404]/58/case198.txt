discussion 
standard of review and principles of statutory interpretation 
the interpretation of a state statute presents a question of law,which we review de novo.apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles th,d.rules govern construction of a statute.our primary task is to determine the intent of the legislative body,so as to construe the statute to effectuate that purpose.doe brown th,d.we begin with the words of the statute.ibid.words used in a statute or constitutional provision should be given the meaning they bear in ordinary use.citations.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature citations.lungren deukmejian cal d.
but the court is not prohibited from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed citation.lungren deukmejian,supra,cal d at.
if the statutory language is ambiguous or reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation,we will examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes,and we can look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.pacific sunwear of california,olaes enterprises,th,d.
we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.realmuto gagnard th,d.we presume that the legislature,when enacting a statute,was aware of existing related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules.citation.manhattan loft,llc mercury liquors,th,d.
exemption based on certificate of occupancy 
landlord contends tenant unit is exempt from rent control under section,subdivision a,because a certificate of occupancy was issued for the unit after february.tenant contends the exemption refers to the first certificate of occupancy issued for the unit,and does not apply in this case,because his tenancy was established long before the new certificate of occupancy.we conclude the language of subdivision a,standing alone,is susceptible to both parties constructions,but reading the section as a whole,the exemption can only apply to certificates of occupancy that precede residential use of the unit.
section,subdivision a,provides three exemptions from local rent control laws,any of which allow an owner to establish the initial and subsequent rental rates for a unit the first exemption is for a unit that has a certificate of occupancy issued after february,subd.a.the second exemption is for units already exempt from rent control pursuant to a local exemption for newly constructed units,subd.a.the third exemption is for a unit that is alienable separate from the title to any other dwelling unit or is a subdivided interest in a community apartment project,a stock cooperative project,or a limited equity housing cooperative,subd.a.condominium units are included in the third exemption,because they are alienable separate from the title to any other dwelling unit.the third exemption does not apply if the prior tenancy terminated because the landlord served a notice of termination or a change in the tenancy terms.
effective january,the legislature amended the third exemption for condominium units to exclude a condominium dwelling or unit that has not been sold separately by the subdivider to a bona fide purchaser for value however,if a condominium dwelling or unit meets the criteria of paragraph or of subdivision a,or if all the dwellings or units except one have been sold separately by the subdivider to bona fide purchasers for value,and the subdivider has occupied that remaining unsold condominium dwelling or unit as his or her principal residence for at least one year after the subdivision occurred,then subparagraph a of paragraph shall apply to that unsold condominium dwelling or unit,subd.a b ii.
the legislative history of the amendment is instructive.as explained in the analysis by the assembly committee on the judiciary on senate bill reg.sess.as amended may,at pages according to the sponsors,this amendment is necessary to close a loophole in law that allows landlords to avoid local rent control laws.the exemption was originally created to spur construction of condominiums,seen as an affordable housing alternative,and in recognition that condominiums were built with the same purpose as apartment units.however,the language was broadly written and,as a consequence,some apartment property owners have taken advantage of the law by obtaining a permit to convert to condominiums,but never completing the process.in the meanwhil
