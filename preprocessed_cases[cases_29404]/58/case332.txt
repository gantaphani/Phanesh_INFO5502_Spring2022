introduction 
these related petitions challenge the public utilities commission puc exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to,and its interpretation of,public utilities code section that section controls the utility rates mobilehome park owners and other landlords may charge their tenants where the utility company does not service the tenants directly,but rather provides natural gas and electricity service to the landlord,who in turn distributes service to the tenants.tenant robert hambly hambly,for himself and on behalf of the residents of los robles mobilehome park los robles,filed a complaint against the city of novato city and hillsboro properties hillsboro,the owner of los robles.the puc determined that hillsboro had assessed annual rent increases that,although authorized by the city under its municipal rent control ordinance,increased the rates for electricity and natural gas service in violation of section.petitioners make numerous arguments that can be reduced to two key issues whether the puc has improperly usurped the city rent control jurisdiction and whether the puc erred in interpreting section to prohibit hillsboro from passing through certain utility costs to its tenants in the form of rent increases without first obtaining puc authorization to do so.
we conclude the puc was correct in all respects.by ordering hillsboro to recalculate its net operating income to exclude income and expenses from tenant gas and electricity usage and rent increases to exclude certain utility improvement costs,the puc has exercised its ratemaking authority and has not exceeded its jurisdiction.in addition,the puc determination that issues related to utility rates pursuant to section must be raised in a context broader than a complaint proceeding comports with statutory language and intent,is consistent with several prior decisions,and is within the puc discretion.
ii.factual and procedural background 
hillsboro owns nine mobilehome parks in california,including the los robles in novato.los robles is a submetered park,meaning that pacific gas and electric company pg e delivers electricity and natural gas to a master meter and bills its customer,hillsboro.tenants receive natural gas and electricity via a submeter system within the park that is owned,serviced and administered by hillsboro.
pg e charges hillsboro for total park natural gas and electricity service in a bill that does not separate tenant usage from common area usage,pool,clubhouse,overhead street lighting.in accordance with section,hillsboro bill from pg e contains a,submeter discount that represents the costs pg e avoids by not providing the submeter service directly to the tenants.hillsboro provides its tenants with an itemized monthly bill for gas and electricity based on each tenant usage.as required by section,subdivision a,hillsboro charges its tenants at the same rate pg e would charge for residential service if it were providing the services directly.because of the submeter discount,hillsboro monthly receipts from tenants for their utility usage,which does not include common area usage,exceed the total amount hillsboro pays each month to pg e for total park usage.
mobilehome parks in novato are subject to the city mobilehome rent control ordinance the ordinance.the ordinance provides for an automatic annual rent adjustment by a percentage of the annual change in the consumer price index cpi.if a park owner concludes that this adjustment does not provide a fair return,the owner may petition for an individual adjustment based on a maintenance of net operating income noi formula.the ordinance defines noi as gross income less operating expenses.gross income is defined to include gross rents,interest from security deposits,and all other income or consideration received or receivable in connection with the operation of the park.operating expenses are defined to include utility costs not paid by the tenants and to exclude any expense for which the owner has been reimbursed from a source other than rental income.
rent increases are based on a park noi for base year,the last full calendar year before rent control took effect.it is presumed that the noi for the base year provided the owner with a fair return on the property.the base year noi is adjusted by the difference between the cpi in the base year and the cpi in the rent increase petition year.if the park owner petition year noi is less than the base year noi adjusted for inflation,a rent increase is granted to restore a fair return.
as approved by the city,hillsboro calculated its base year noi by including submetered utility receipts from tenants as an item of gross income and the utility bill total park usage as an operating expense.in its rent increase petition,hillsboro sought to pass through to tenants in the form of a rent increase certain costs,including costs associated with trenching and laying conduit for overhead street lighting in the amount of.the city approved inclusion of these costs as part of the rent increase petition.the city also approved hillsboro rent increase petition,which included in costs related to repairing and replacing electric pedestals structures that support the service panels through which mobilehomes connect to the electricity supply.the rent control hearing officer authorized the inclusion of these expenses based on evidence from hillsboro that the submeter discount did not take them into account.
the city decisions approving hillsboro base year noi and its and rent increase petitions,which included the base year noi adjusted for inflation and certain utility costs,became final.no party sought judicial review through a writ of administrative mandamus pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
hambly complaint alleged that,as a result of the city rent control process,tenants at los robles were being charged more for gas and electricity service than directly metered customers.hambly contended that hillsboro improperly included income from submetered utility service in its base year noi.as a result,tenants pay twice for submetered service they first pay regular monthly bills for utility usage they then also pay in the form of rent increases that are inflated by using the net operating income which includes income from submetered utility service as a multiplier to calculate such raises.hambly also contended that hillsboro improperly passed through its costs for common area lighting and electric pedestals to tenants in the form of rent increases.the rent increases resulted in double reimbursement to hillsboro because the submeter discount already compensated hillsboro for operating and maintaining the submeter service.
hambly sought an order prohibiting hillsboro from charging its tenants more than directly metered customers pay for utilities and requiring that hillsboro refund to tenants all excess charges from january to present.hillsboro filed an answer denying that its tenants were charged more and claiming the puc was without jurisdiction to interfere with the rights conferred upon hillsboro by virtue of the legislative enactment of the city rent control ordinance.
during preliminary proceedings,the assigned administrative law judge alj and the assigned commissioner both ruled that the puc had subject matter jurisdiction to resolve the complaint.the golden state owners league intervened in support of hambly.later,the alj permitted western manufactured housing community association wma,a trade association of mobilehome park owners,to intervene in support of hillsboro.the presiding officer decision pod was against hillsboro,which appealed to the commission on the principal ground that the decision exceeded its jurisdiction.on august,the puc issued its decision,hereafter decision affirming the pod with certain changes and denied the appeals.
the puc concluded that hambly was correct in his allegation that the inclusion of net utility income in noi,although approved by the rent board,resulted in higher gas and electricity charges to los robles tenants in violation of section.it also concluded the costs for common area lighting and electric pedestals should not have been included in the rent increase petitions because hillsboro did not follow the required procedure for determining whether those costs could be passed through to tenants.the puc decision modified the pod recommendation that hillsboro apply to the city for a rent adjustment.out of deference to the city assertion that its municipal code lacked a mechanism to reopen a final rent determination,the puc ordered hillsboro to make the refund calculations itself.finally,the decision directed the parties to meet and confer to try to agree on the methodology for calculating the refunds and provided for additional proceedings,if necessary,to resolve that issue.
specifically,the puc ordered hillsboro to refund on a pro rata basis the difference between the rent actually charged and the rent that should have been charged in the three years preceding the filing of the complaint the period beginning january.the ordering paragraphs direct hillsboro to recalculate the base year noi and the noi in each petition year to exclude submetered gas and electricity receipts as an item of gross income exclude the bill as an item of operating expense and include as an item of operating expense the common area usage of gas and electricity calculated on the basis of the rate schedule in the tariffs of pg e that were in effect at the time.
the order also requires that in expenses for trenching and conduit for common area lighting be removed from the rent increase petition and that in expenses related to electric pedestals be removed from the petition.the puc recommended but did not order that hillsboro examine its practices at its other mobilehome parks,amend its future rent control applications where appropriate,and implement refunds where warranted.
in addition,the puc recommended but did not order that the city amend its rent control ordinance in accordance with the decision we conclude that rent refunds are warranted and will require that they be based on the same methodology we urge novato to adopt going forward in order to disentangle cpuc utility rate setting jurisdiction and its own rent control jurisdiction,as it must.
hillsboro and wma sought rehearing,which the puc denied these timely writ petitions followed.

petitioners arguments 
hillsboro contends that the puc,without finding a conflict between a general law and the local ordinance,invaded the city rent control jurisdiction,violating the city rights under the california constitution.hillsboro also contends that the puc acted without jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction when it reviewed a final order of the city rent board.hillsboro next argues that the puc revision of the rent control formula violated hillsboro constitutional rights because the city formula is set at a level which will avoid a confiscatory taking of the owner property and satisfy federal and state constitutional requirements.finally,hillsboro contends that,because it presented evidence to the rent board that costs associated with trenching and laying conduit for common area lighting and with electric pedestals are not compensated for by the submeter discount,there is no substantial evidence supporting the puc order that those costs be disallowed as part of hillsboro rent increase petitions.
wma also argues that the puc has usurped the authority of the rent board.in addition,wma contends that the puc has misinterpreted section,that the section does not confer exclusive jurisdiction upon the puc to determine the utility charges park owners can pass through to their tenants,and that it does not limit the utility costs park owners can recover solely to the costs covered by the submeter discount.finally,wma argues that section does not empower the puc to regulate mobilehome park owners or to order refunds 
c.the puc interpretation of section 
the relevant portion of the statute at issue is section,subdivision a,which provides 
the commission shall require that,whenever gas or electric service,or both,is provided by a customer to users who are tenants of a mobilehome park,apartment building,or similar residential complex,the customer shall charge each user of the service at the same rate which would be applicable if the user were receiving gas or electricity,or both,directly from the gas or electrical corporation.the commission shall require the corporation furnishing service to the customer to establish uniform rates for service at a level which will provide a sufficient differential to cover the reasonable average costs to customers of providing submeter service,except that these costs shall not exceed the average cost that the corporation would have incurred in providing comparable services directly to the users of the service.
the statute thus requires pg e and other utility companies to discount its rates to landlords by an amount that covers the reasonable average cost incurred by the landlord in distributing energy to the tenants not to exceed the average cost avoided by the utility and requires the landlord to charge its tenants the same rates pg e charges its directly served residential customers.
in,in an investigatory proceeding,the puc construed section,subdivision a,to preclude mobilehome park owners from recovering costs associated with submetered utility systems from their tenants in the form of rent increases.re rates,charges,and practices of electric and gas utilities providing services to mobile home parks d,wl rehg,d,wl rates,charges and practices.interpreting the language of the statute,the puc concluded that section,subdivision a expressly limits a mobile home park customer recovery of reasonable incurred costs of owning,operating,and maintaining a submetered system to the reimbursement provided by the submetering discount.d at,wl.
to conclude otherwise would result in submetered park tenants having to pay more for their utility services,in the form of rent increases,than those nonsubmetered park tenants who receive utility services directly from the gas or electrical corporation.this would be contrary to the statute and the legislative intent because mobile home park owners would be charging their submetered tenants a different rate than tenants directly receiving service from the utility.the statute requires the same rate.citation.in enacting this statute,the legislature intended that the tenants be indifferent whether they received utility services under a submetered system or directly from the utility,and thus,the intent was to limit the recovery of costs related to the submetered system to what is provided in the statute.rates,charges and practices order denying rehearing,supra,d at,wl.in its principal decision,the puc stressed its exclusive jurisdiction over utility rates and the amount recoverable by park owners for submetered system costs.rates,charges and practices,supra,d at,wl.this decision became final when the supreme court denied review on october,sub nom.western mobilehome parkowners association public utilities commission.

d.the puc jurisdiction 
petitioners make several arguments to the effect that the puc exceeded its jurisdiction by usurping the rent control authority of the city.hillsboro defends the rent board determinations,contending that the city acted within its constitutional powers in regulating rents,and that the puc decision violates both the city and hillsboro rights under article xi,section,of the california constitution this provision of the california constitution confers on a city or county the power to make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.cal,art.xi.hillsboro contends that the city acted in accordance with this power in enacting the ordinance and setting rent levels pursuant to rent control.
the puc does not dispute the city basic power to make and enforce local ordinances and regulations.the puc has also acknowledged that,while it does have complete jurisdiction over utility rates,it does not have rent control jurisdiction over mobile home parks and park owners.rainbow,supra,th at,d discussing rates,charges and practices,supra.however,t hat the puc lacks rent control jurisdiction does not mean rent control boards are free to ignore its rulings concerning utility rates.rainbow,supra,at,d.as provided by the california constitution,a city,county,or other public body may not regulate matters over which the legislature grants regulatory power to the commission cal,art.xii.the legislature has delegated to the puc the authority to regulate utility costs paid by submetered tenants as well as the rates utility companies can charge their customers.thus,when the puc sets utility company tariffs and the submeter discount,it acts pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction and constitutional authority.steiner,supra,d at,wl.
moreover,hillsboro ignores an apparent conflict between the ordinance and a general law,section.see cal,art.xi.the fourth district has noted that an order of the puc controls over a local ordinance where the two conflict.rainbow,supra,th at,d,citing orange county air pollution control dist.public util.com.cal d,where a general law and a local ordinance conflict and the matter is one of statewide concern,the general law is controlling.it is clear that the utility rates master meter mobilehome park owners may charge to their tenants is a matter of statewide concern.pursuant to the ordinance,and in the absence of prior consideration of the matter by the puc,the city made decisions as to whether hillsboro could include certain types of utility income and expenses in calculating noi and rent increases.to the extent that the ordinance permits the city in the first instance to make rent determinations that impact utility rates charged to submetered tenants,it conflicts with section and is controlled by it.orange county air pollution control dist.public util,supra,at.
hillsboro also contends,in a related argument,that the puc acted without jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction when it reviewed the city final administrative decisions and that the decision constitutes an impermissible collateral attack.the tenants,it argued,were required to pursue their administrative remedies under code of civil procedure section the now final decisions are no longer subject to a court review.
the flaw in hillsboro argument is that the city had no jurisdiction to make rent determinations that resulted in higher utility rates for hillsboro submetered tenants.in concluding that hillsboro improperly included net utility revenue in its noi calculation and utility costs in its rent increase petitions,the puc was giving effect to section and exercising its exclusive ratemaking authority,not rent control authority.see rainbow,supra,th at,d.
the puc addressed a similar situation in steiner,supra,d,wl,in which a mobilehome park resident challenged the palm springs rent board approval of a rent increase that included utility charges.the puc ruled that the rent board had impermissibly intruded on the constitutional and statutory ratemaking authority of this commission.id.at,wl.because the state through the puc has occupied the field regulating the costs paid for utility services by mobilehome tenants and by park owners,the puc concluded that the rent board order in question in this proceeding is,therefore,unconstitutional because it directly conflicts with both the current tariffs applicable to the mobilehome park and its tenants,and the orders in rates,charges and practices.just as the rent commission does not have authority to approve the tariffs of utility companies,by the plain language of section,it is preempted from ordering the rates and charges the mobilehome park tenants pay for utility service,including service delivered through a submeter system,notwithstanding the label applied to the order.id.at,wl.
similarly here,the rent board acted without jurisdiction to set utility rates for mobilehome park tenants.while it would have been prudent for the los robles tenants to have filed a writ of mandate in the superior court to challenge the rent board decisions,their failure to do so did not divest the puc of jurisdiction.
in its decision,the puc took care not to overstep its jurisdiction.it recommended that the city amend the ordinance to disentangle cpuc utility rate setting jurisdiction and its own rent control jurisdiction decision at,but the ordering paragraphs are directed only to hillsboro.it ordered hillsboro to calculate the refunds in response to the city assertion that it could not reopen a final rent decision.id.at finding of fact.the puc invalidated the rent increases approved by the city only to the extent that they included unauthorized utility costs and were based on maintaining net utility income.that the rent board decisions became final when the tenants failed to seek a writ of administrative mandamus in the superior court does not change the fact that the city had no jurisdiction in the first place over utility rates that can be charged to mobilehome tenants.
hillsboro next argues that the puc decision impermissibly alters the noi formula the city has chosen for calculating fair return and lowers the fair return rents hillsboro is authorized to charge under the ordinance.hillsboro contends this is a violation of its rights under the just compensation clauses of both the california and united states constitutions.the basis for this assertion of constitutional violation is the statement in the ordinance that rents are set at a level which will avoid a confiscatory taking of the owner pr
