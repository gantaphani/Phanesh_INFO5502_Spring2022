the ordinance 
santa monica municipal code sections and are found in a chapter titled tenant harassment,adopted after the santa monica city council took testimony from tenants and reviewed statistics which showed an increase in the rates at which rent controlled housing units were vacated after state vacancy decontrol laws took effect.
the tenant harassment ordinance prohibits a wide variety of malicious acts by landlords with regard to tenants in rent controlled housing.a landlord may not,for instance,abuse a tenant with offensive words,subd.e,threaten a tenant with physical harm,subd.g or interfere with a tenant right to quiet use and enjoyment,subd.j.appellants have challenged only one portion of section,that which provides that no landlord shall do any of the following with malice i take action to terminate any tenancy including service of any notice to quit or other eviction notice based upon facts which the landlord has no reasonable cause to believe to be true or upon a legal theory which is untenable under the facts known to the landlord

the complaint 
the first amended complaint alleged that action apartment association is a corporation established to protect the rights of housing providers in the ownership and maintenance of their real property in santa monica,and that doreen dennis is the owner and manager of apartment buildings in santa monica,which come under santa monica rent control laws.
dennis filed the action as a class action on behalf of herself and all other similarly situated housing providers who own rent controlled residential housing in santa monica.in the class action allegations,the complaint alleged that the city had engaged in a custom and practice of threatening housing provider class members with criminal and civil prosecution for simply talking to their tenants,serving their tenants or having their attorneys serve their tenants with a notice to cure or quit or notice to terminate tenancy filing an unlawful detainer complaint or having their attorneys file an unlawful detainer complaint.the complaint also alleged that the city had threatened dennis with criminal and civil prosecution for asking her attorney to serve her tenant with a notice to quit for owner occupancy possession,and asking her attorney to file an unlawful detainer lawsuit.
the city demurred,contending that appellants lacked standing to raise the constitutional arguments and that they had failed to state a cause of action,as to each cause of action.
discussion 
t he litigation privilege is intended to encourage parties to feel free to exercise their fundamental right of resort to the courts for assistance in the resolution of their disputes,without being chilled from exercising this right by the fear that they may subsequently be sued in a derivative tort action arising out of something said or done in the context of the litigation.citation.edwards centex real estate th,d.
the privilege exists to protect the right to petition the government for redress of grievances,a right which includes the right to sue.undergirding the immunity conferred by section b is the broadly applicable policy of assuring litigants the utmost freedom of access to the courts to secure and defend their rights albertson raboff cal d at.rubin green cal th,d.to this end,our supreme court has reemphasized the importance of virtually unhindered access to the courts.ibid.
the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson cal d.the privilege is absolute,which means it applies regardless of the existence of malice or intent to harm.citations.wise thrifty payless,th,d.any doubt as to whether the privilege applies is resolved in favor of applying it.citations.adams superior court th,d.
pleadings in a case are generally viewed as privileged communications,navellier sletten th,d,but the privilege is not limited to pleadings or process.it applies not only to statements made during litigation,but to communications,made outside the courtroom,as long as they have a connection or relationship to an anticipated litigation rubin green,supra,cal th at,d.there is no doubt that the statutory notices which are addressed by the ordinance are covered by the privilege 
notably,the litigation privilege bars a plaintiff from seeking injunctive relief against privileged communications rubin green,supra,cal th at,d,something which this ordinance would allow.
in sum,under the litigation privilege,a landlord serving an eviction notice or filing an unlawful detainer is immune from suit based on those notices or filings,and can not be enjoined from that conduct,even if the motivation is malicious,the factual allegations known to be untrue,and the legal theory untenable under the true facts.under the ordinance,that same landlord,with that same lawsuit,is subject to criminal penalties,a civil lawsuit,and an injunction.the ordinance thus punishes what the civil code protects,is contradictory to state law,and is preempted.city of los angeles cal th,d,cal,art.xi.
the city makes several arguments,that the ordinance does not conflict with the privilege because it does not address communications,but acts because malicious prosecution is an exception to the privilege and because the litigation privilege is a defense.we find none of them persuasive.
we first discuss the question of communicative acts versus noncommunicative conduct.as our supreme court has made clear,there is a distinction between injury arising from privileged communicative acts and injury arising from nonprivileged noncommunicative acts.see,ribas clark cal d,eavesdropping is noncommunicative and thus not privileged,while testimony which resulted from eavesdropping is communication and therefore privileged kimmel goland cal d,acts of tape recording not privileged,while publication or broadcast of information contained in recorded conversations privileged see also,susan israels th,d unauthorized reading of confidential medical records are noncommunicative acts,and thus not privileged.wang hartunian th,d.the proper inquiry is whether the alleged acts were communicative in their essential nature.rubin green,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,in wang hartunian,supra,th,d,we held that the act of making a citizen arrest is not a publication or broadcast under civil code section,subdivision b.id.at,d.drum bleau,fox associates th,d,found that the process of obtaining a writ of execution was essentially communicative in that the documents reflected statements about the judgment and the property,but that the act of levying on the writ was not,and was not privileged.id.at,d.in navellier sletten,supra,th,d,the plaintiffs sought to impose fraud liability based on counterclaims the defendants had made in an earlier lawsuit,in which the defendants sought recovery for claims which had already been released.the court found that plaintiffs are challenging the content of the classic example of the act,or the manner citation of their assertion.navellier sletten,supra,th at,d and the cases collected therein.
the city argument on this point is that the privilege does not apply to the action of filing a wrongful case since that action is not communication,and thus that the ordinance does not run afoul of the privilege.it is true that filing an unlawful detainer complaint or serving an eviction notice involves an act,but that fact does not save the ordinance.the essential nature of what the ordinance addresses is not acts,but communication.a cause of action under santa monica municipal code section,subdivision i would not be based on allegations that the landlord acted by filing a complaint or serving a statutory notice,but would instead rest on allegations concerning the statements made in those documents.the complaint would not say,for instance,my landlord served an eviction notice.such an allegation would not state a cause of action for violation of the ordinance.instead,the complaint would allege that my landlord served an eviction notice stating that i had not paid my rent,although the landlord had no reasonable cause to believe that that was true.
an unlawful detainer complaint is a landlord communication to the court that a tenant has failed to pay rent or has violated another portion of the rental agreement,and as such is privileged.
we note,too,that a landlord need for access to the courts is an unusually vital one,in that the landlord business relationship with his customers,the tenants,is highly regulated by law.a merchant who is,for instance,paid with a bad check may need access to the courts to recover the amount of the check,but can cut short any future damages by refusing to do business with that customer.a landlord can not end the business relationship with a tenant without access to the courts.
we now turn to the city claim that the ordinance does not conflict with civil code section,subdivision b because civil code section,subdivision b does not apply to malicious prosecution actions.
in furtherance of the right to petition,courts and,by inference,the legislature have allowed only one exception to the litigation privilege,a malicious prosecution action silberg anderson,cal d at.to establish a cause of action for malicious prosecution,a plaintiff must plead and prove that the prior action was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his,plaintiff,favor citations was brought without probable cause citations and was initiated with malice citations.bertero national general cal d.the elements of the common law cause of action have evolved over time as an appropriate accommodation between the freedom of an individual to seek redress in the courts and the interest of a potential defendant in being free from unjustified litigation.oren royal oaks venture greenberg,bernhard,weiss karma cal d.
the ordinance departs from this accommodation in significant ways.a defendant in a malicious prosecution action does not face minimum statutory damages which may be greater than actual damages,or an attorney fee recovery.instead,settled law sets the components of malicious prosecution damages as the cost of defending the prior action,compensation for injury to reputation or impairment of social and business standing in the community,and mental or emotional distress.preferred couriers,golden eagle ins,th,d.and,unlike the ordinance,nothing in the tort of malicious prosecution allows for an injunction 
the civil cause of action under the ordinance also differs from the tort of malicious prosecution in that the ordinance does not require favorable termination of the underlying action before the civil action can be commenced.this is a very important difference indeed.the favorable termination requirement is a critical part of the legal accommodation which the malicious prosecution tort represents.the core policy protecting access to the courts underlying section b has led to the requirement that a derivative tort action seeking redress for communications within the privilege be delayed until the original suit is terminated in favor of the derivative plaintiff.rubin green,supra,cal th at,d.
under the sole exception to the litigation privilege,a plaintiff will never have to defend the secondary lawsuit while prosecuting the first in contrast,under the ordinance,a landlord could be forced to litigate a civil action which may be brought by any person,including the city,an action for an injunction which may be brought by any aggrieved person,by the city attorney,or by any person or entity who will fairly and adequately represent the interest of the protected class,and a criminal prosecution,while the unlawful detainer action is pending,multiplying not only the number of actions but,potentially,the number of opponents.
the lack of a favorable termination requirement could easily lead to abuse of the civil cause of action created by the ordinance.there would no doubt be a great temptation for tenants to file civil injunctive actions under the ordinance as a litigation or negotiating tactic,and while we would prefer to believe that tenants and their counsel would resist that temptation,such a belief would not be realistic.the malicious prosecution exception to the litigation privilege is designed with that in mind.the ordinance would threaten free access to the courts by providing an end run around the limitations on the tort of malicious prosecution.pacific gas electric,supra,cal d at.
on,the city argues that in order to prevail,appellants had the burden of showing that the ordinance was invalid in the majority of its applications,citing american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d,and california teachers association state of california cal th,d.neither case concerns preemption,and for that reason neither is on point.what is more,we disagree with the city companion arguments,that the ordinance is not preempted insofar as it allows suits by tenants who have already obtained favorable termination of the underlying case and suits by third parties,and insofar as it imposes criminal penalties.
first,as we have pointed out,tenants suing under the ordinance after first obtaining a favorable termination of the underlying action would have significant and improper advantages over a malicious prosecution plaintiff,including statutory penalties and attorney fees.
next,we do not agree with the city contention that the litigation privilege does not apply if the suit is brought by a third party,rather than by a tenant seeking redress of his or her own grievances.the city relies on rubin green,supra,cal th,d,in which a law firm communications to mobilehome park residents,potential clients,were found to be privileged,so that a mobilehome park owner suit against the firm for attorney solicitation was not maintainable.that is surely an instance in which communications from the potential litigation between tenants and owners fell within the privilege.
the city focuses on a comment in the court discussion of the mobilehome park owner claim that he could sue for injunctive relief under business and professions code section.the court found that he could not,noting that its conclusion was
