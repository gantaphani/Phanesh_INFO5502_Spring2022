sheila white filed a complaint with the united states department of housing and urban development hud,claiming that property owner gertie wooten violated the fair housing act fha,c.at issue is whether wooten comments to white indicated a preference against renting to white on the basis of familial status,which under the fha means at least one minor child living with a parent or guardian.after holding a hearing at which wooten did not appear,the administrative law judge alj concluded that white failed to prove wooten statements indicated a preference against renting on the basis of white familial status.the alj also refused to allow white to amend her complaint after the close of the evidentiary hearing to include new allegations that,white contends,first came to light at the hearing.we agree with the alj decision to deny white motion to amend her complaint.however,we disagree that white failed to prove that wooten discriminated against her on the basis of her familial status.we therefore reverse the alj decision as to white c claim.
background 
white filed an administrative complaint with the secretary of hud,alleging that wooten violated c by engaging in discriminatory conduct when she told white that she would not rent an apartment to her because she was not married and had two children.the secretary of hud issued a determination of reasonable cause and charge of discrimination in april,alleging that wooten discriminated against white because of her familial status.shortly thereafter,the alj granted white motion to intervene on her own behalf.in july,after prolonged discovery,white filed a motion she entitled a motion for summary judgment.the alj subsequently scheduled a hearing for february.
despite being duly notified about the hearing,neither wooten nor anyone on her behalf appeared.the alj,acting on hud request,found wooten in default,and directed white to present a prima facie case that wooten had violated c.three witnesses testified at the hearing white white grandfather,robert houston and a family friend,marsha johnson.
white testified that,in,she was living with houston and looking for an apartment for herself and her two children then ages five and nine when she saw a newspaper advertisement for a two bedroom apartment for rent in harvey,illinois.on august,white called the telephone number listed in the notice to inquire about the apartment.white claimed that she spoke to an elderly woman with broken speech who stated that she would not rent to white because white had children and was not married.white also stated that after the conversation ended she wrote down detailed notes recounting the conversation.the notes read 
me i was calling about the apartment in harvey.

her are you married 
her well she ca rent to you because you have two children and no husband and this girl has to pay her mortgage.

her you are not married this 
me thank you very much,but i not interested.i hung up.
on september,white noticed another newspaper advertisement for the same apartment that listed the same telephone number.she called to inquire about the apartment,but unlike before,white stated that she was married rather than single.according to white,she spoke with the same elderly lady with broken english with whom she spoke in the first telephone conversation.this time the woman identified herself as gertie wooten.white also stated that,as with the previous phone call,she wrote down detailed notes that recounted her conversation with wooten.those notes state 
me.i called about the apartment 
her how many in your family 
her what are you married 
her how many kids 
her do your husband work

her gertie wooten 
white stated that after this second telephone conversation she filed a complaint with hud that complaint forms the basis of this case.in november,white also filed a complaint with the cook county commission on human rights,alleging that she was denied the opportunity to rent an apartment on the basis of her marital status and parental status.
white grandfather,houston,testified that he received a telephone call from an unidentified woman asking to speak to white shortly after white filed her cook county complaint.when houston replied that white was not home,the caller began asking a number of questions about white because she had called about renting an apartment.the following day,the same unidentified woman called houston again asking for white.when houston again replied that white was not home,the caller began shouting and swearing.houston unsuccessfully attempted to calm the caller,and then hung up the phone he informed white of the telephone calls when she returned home.
family friend marsha johnson testimony corroborated houston version of events surrounding the telephone calls.she stated that she was with houston when he received the two calls.she added,however,that she saw the name wooten,g displayed on the caller id box after each call.she also stated that she was present when houston informed white of the telephone calls.
before the hearing concluded,white orally requested to amend the pleadings to include a harassment charge under,based on houston and johnson testimony that wooten twice telephoned houston in response to white housing discrimination claims.white acknowledged that it was unlikely that wooten was even aware of the hud complaint at the time of the harassing telephone calls because it had not yet been processed for jurisdictional reasons.white did state,however,that she believed it was very likely that wooten obtained houston telephone number from the cook county complaint that was served on her.to supplement her request,white filed a motion to amend complaint to conform to the proof adduced at trial motion to amend,alleging that wooten violated.
on december,in a written decision,the alj concluded white failed to show by a preponderance of evidence that wooten violated c.the alj first determined that white did not prove that she even spoke with wooten during the first telephone call,citing the fact that the speaker consistently spoke in the third person,such as when she stated,t his girl has to pay her mortgage and you do have a husband and you have children.and,the alj continued,even if white could prove that she spoke with wooten,she did not prove that the telephone call violated c because an ordinary listener would not have believed that the speaker discriminated against her because of familial status rather,the speaker indicated a concern with financial matters.
the alj also denied white motion to amend to add the harassment claim under.he stated that amending the complaint would be prejudicial to wooten because she was not given notice of the new allegation.the alj further noted that white knew or should have known about the allegedly harassing telephone calls that houston received since the beginning of the litigation and,therefore,she should have amended her complaint earlier.the alj also denied the motion for substantive reasons
