background 
appellants are the owners of various multifamily rental housing projects in minnesota.the housing projects were developed and financed pursuant to section d and section of the national housing act nha through a arrangement including the owners,the department of housing and urban development hud,and private lenders.the section d and section programs the programs were designed by congress primarily to encourage creation of housing.generally,in exchange for an agreement by property owners to maintain particular properties as housing properties subject to federal regulations,the united states granted various tax benefits and committed to insuring the mortgages of the owners.prior to,this mortgage insurance enabled the owners to obtain rate mortgages section d.after,the nha was amended to enable owners to obtain a mortgage with an interest rate subsidy from the united states and enabled the lenders to issue mortgages amortizable over a period section.in addition,as appellants contend,another incentive was the option to prepay the mortgages,without hud approval,at the end of a term and thus eliminate the restrictions on the property imposed by federal regulation.these changes to the federal regulations,including the elimination of the prepayment option,are the subject of the present,and other,litigation 
the transaction was essentially a real estate development deal between the owners and the lenders.the united states role in the transaction was to act as an insurer for the owners in the event of default of the owners mortgage commitments.in exchange for the united states commitment,the owners agreed to various restrictions on the use of the properties in the programs.these obligations included constructing and maintaining housing in accordance with hud specifications renting only to low and tenants charging only rents maintaining cash reserves to against default and limiting return on investment to no more than an annual return of six percent on initial investment.
the three parties to this complicated transaction made various commitments to each other,evidenced by the execution of at least five separate independent agreements,including a mortgage note note and a mortgage between the owners and the lenders a regulatory agreement and a mortgagor certificate between the owners and hud and a commitment for insurance advances insurance commitment between the lenders and hud none of the agreements included any clause integrating the agreements as a single transaction or making the united states,the owners,and the lenders parties to each separate agreement.
the mortgage and note issued by the owners to the lenders were the documents that evidenced the funding for the programs.the note outlined the terms and conditions of the repayment from the to the lender and was payable over a period with an option to prepay the note,without hud approval,after twenty years.hud endorsed the note as part of its insurance commitment but was not otherwise a party to the note.the mortgage on the subject properties secured payment of the note.
the insurance commitment between hud and the lenders memorialized hud agreement to provide an insurance endorsement for the notes.the mortgagor certificate between the owners and hud referenced this agreement between hud and the private lenders regarding hud insurance endorsement of the owners notes.the mortgagor certificate stated that the owner agrees to accept a loan insured by you hud upon the terms set forth in your commitment 
the regulatory agreement between hud and the owners memorialized the owners agreement to the affordability restrictions,including restrictions on the income levels of tenants,allowable rental rates,and the rate of return on investment the owners could receive from the project discussed above.
the only document that explicitly references the prepayment option is the note.the prepayment option in the note reflected the contemporaneous hud regulations,see a ii,a i,governing the section d and section programs.cienega iv,at.the relevant sections of the regulations provided that 
a mortgage indebtedness may be prepaid in full and hud controls terminated without prior consent of hud i if the prepayment occurs after the expiration of years from the date of the final insurance endorsement of the mortgage 
a i and ii.
the regulations also stated that 
the regulations in this subpart may be amended by hud at any time and from time to time,in whole or in part,but such amendments shall not adversely affect the interests of a mortgagee or lender under the contract of insurance on any mortgage or loan already insured and shall not adversely affect the interests of a mortgagee or lender on any mortgage or loan to be insured on which hud has made a commitment to insure.
emphasis added.
by prepaying the balance of the outstanding loan represented by the note,an owner could terminate hud affordability restrictions imposed on the property and convert the property into a conventional rental property,thereby charging market rental rates and increasing the owners return on investment to a rate of return.cienega iv,at.
in the late,the united states became concerned that a large number of owners participating in the programs might exercise their prepayment option,creating a shortage in the supply of housing and injuring existing tenants.id.consequently,in,congress enacted the emergency housing preservation act elihpa.elihpa placed a moratorium on mortgage prepayments to allow congress time to devise a permanent solution to the potential shortage of housing.id.
in,elihpa was replaced by the housing preservation and resident homeownership act lihprha.lihprha made permanent the moratorium on prepayment and authorized hud to provide additional incentives to owners in exchange for remaining in the programs,including,inter alia increased access to residual receipts accounts increased rents additional financing for capital improvements and the ability to draw funds from the project by accessing a portion of the equity in the housing project through a second mortgage,insured by hud.supp.ii.a key aspect of lihprha required hud approval for any election to prepay a mortgage.id.lihprha included a number of criteria required for hud approval,including written findings by hud that prepayment would not materially increase economic hardship for current tenants result in a monthly rental payment that exceeds percentages set by statute involuntarily displace current tenants without good cause or diminish the supply of housing that would be sufficient for the needs of the community.a supp.ii.
in,congress enacted the housing opportunity program extension act hope.hope restored the prepayment rights to owners,without hud approval,provided the owners agreed not to raise rents for a period of sixty days after the prepayment of any unpaid balance of the notes.id.
by accepting a loan pursuant to the section or section program,each owner was required to agree to the numerous regulatory restrictions discussed above.the prepayment option period began at different times for the various participants in the programs.for example,chancellor option period began on august,oak grove option period began on january,and gateway investors option period began on june.thus,at the time when the parties respective prepayment options began,all three parties were prevented from prepayment by lihprha.
pursuant to the regulations promulgated under lihprha,the appellants notified hud requesting permission to prepay their remaining debt under the provisions in each of their notes.each appellant was advised at various times in that they would not meet the criteria for prepayment under lihprha,would not be permitted to prepay the mortgage,and could only leave the programs by selling the property to a organization approved by hud.chancellor manor,fed.cl.at.consequently,all three owners filed with hud an initial notice of intent to terminate or extend affordability restrictions,electing to extend the affordability restrictions by requesting additional incentives pursuant to.specifically,in exchange for extending the hud restrictions for an additional fifty years,all three owners elected to obtain a second insured mortgage on their properties up to an amount equal to their equity in the properties.id.at.this second insured mortgage allowed the owners to withdraw their appreciated equity from the projects.
election to receive the additional insured loan also required the execution of an amendment of existing regulatory agreement.id.at.this document was voluntarily executed by chancellor manor on february,before enactment of hope despite their expressed intentions,gateway investors and oak grove did not execute the amendment of existing regulatory agreement prior to the enactment of hope.id.thus,only chancellor manor election became legally binding before enactment of hope.id.accordingly,chancellor manor is the only owner remaining in hud section program.pursuant to hope,oak grove and gateway investors prepaid their notes in and withdrew from the regulatory restrictions imposed by hud.oak grove and gateway investors increased their rents to market levels in october.id.at.
all three owners filed a complaint at the court of federal claims on january,alleging that the lihprha legislation enacted in anticipatorily repudiated their contractual rights to prepay their mortgages after twenty years without hud approval and resulted in a taking of the subject properties for public use without just compensation.id.
on february,the united states filed an unopposed motion to stay the proceedings pending resolution of cienega iv.chancellor manor,fed.cl.at.cienega iv was decided on december,and the stay was lifted in june.id.in cienega iv,this court dismissed cienega gardens,et breach of contract claims for lack of jurisdiction because cienega gardens,et were not in privity of contract with the united states with regard to the prepayment option.cienega iv.
once the stay was lifted,the owners argued that,notwithstanding this court decision in cienega iv,they were entitled to relief based on three distinct theories of contract liability that were not addressed by cienega iv a contract was formed between each owner and the government by virtue of hud offer,the commitment for insurance of advances,and each owner acceptance of this offer,the mortgagor certificate each owner was an intended beneficiary of the contracts executed between hud and the lenders and the united states is judicially estopped from denying privity of contract between the owners and the united states based on previously asserted,prevailing arguments in united states david,wl,dist.lexis,at.
with respect to the takings claims,the owners argued they had protectible real property interests in their housing them to the economically productive use and enjoyment of the properties,exclusive possession,and other common real property that lihprha effected a taking of these property rights without just compensation.the owners also argued that lihprha effected a fifth amendment regulatory taking of contract rights to prepay the mortgages after twenty years 
the united states moved for summary judgment on january,arguing that the owners contract claims must be dismissed based on this court decision in cienega iv and that the owners did not possess any property or contract rights that could be taken by the united states.chancellor manor,fed.cl.
the court of federal claims granted the united states summary judgment motion with regards to the breach of contract claims,holding that in light of cienega iv,the owners were not in privity of contract with the united states with regard to the prepayment option,regardless of the presence of the mortgagor certificate the owners were not beneficiaries to the insurance commitment and the united states was not judicially estopped from arguing lack of privity,citing this court characterization of david in greenbrier united states.chancellor manor,fed.cl.
the court of federal claims also granted the united states summary judgment motion with regard to the takings claims,holding that 
the fundamental flaw in the plaintiffs argument is the premise that the owners were entitled to unfettered control of their housing projects after the anniversary dates of their mortgage note endorsements by hud f ederal regulations in effect during the did allow owners in the nha section program to prepay their mortgage notes after years without hud approval.the prepayment terms in the mortgage notes tracked these regulations.however,as the federal circuit found in cienega gardens,at,the regulations expressly stated that they were subject to amendment by hud at any time.thus,when plaintiffs entered into the section program they knew,or should,have known,that the regulations governing the prepayment of their mortgage notes could be changed in a manner that might restrict the owners option to prepay after years in other words,the plaintiffs expectations or hopes of converting their projects to conventional,rental properties after years did not inhere in their ownership of the properties.when lihprha was enacted,therefore,the plaintiffs did not even hold the state law property rights they are claiming,and the prepayment prohibition could hardly effect a taking of property rights which the plaintiffs did not possess.
the owners timely appealed the court of federal claims decision and we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment de novo.berkley united states.whether a taking compensable under the fifth amendment has occurred is a question of law based on factual underpinnings.bass enters.prod.united states,citing penn cent.transp.city of new york,d.
on appeal,appellants advance two distinct legal premised upon contract law,the other premised upon regulatory takings law 
as an initial matter,to succeed under either theory,appellants must prove that the united states waived its sovereign immunity,for t he united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued.united states sherwood.waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly.united states nordic,d.the united states has waived immunity from suit under the tucker act in actions brought in the court of federal claims founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages not sounding in tort.a.the court of federal claims thus has jurisdiction over claims based on any express or implied contract with the united states.id.
this court has consistently held that for the government to be sued on a contract pursuant to the tucker act,there must be privity of contract between the plaintiff and the united states.see,cienega iv,at the effect of finding privity of contract between a party and the united states is to find a waiver of sovereign immunity.katz cisneros,absent privity between plaintiffs and the government,there is no case.
in an attempt to establish privity of contract,and thus a waiver of sovereign immunity,appellants allege two distinct errors as to the court of federal claims decision on their breach of contract claims.first,appellants argue that the insurance commitment was a legally binding offer that was accepted by the appellants execution of a mortgagor certificate.second,appellants contend they were intended beneficiaries of the contracts between hud and the lenders.
mortgagor certificate 
the specific question before us is whether the agreements framed by the insurance commitment and the mortgagor certificate each of which was in a form approved by hud gave rise to privity of contract between hud and the owners with respect to the prepayment terms.
this court,in cienega iv,stated that in order to find privity of contract,we must find on the part of hud the type of direct,unavoidable contractual liability that is necessary to trigger a waiver of sovereign immunity,the inevitable result of finding privity of contract.cienega iv,at quoting leased hous.ass united states.applying this standard to a virtually identical set of facts and agreements,this court,in cienega iv,determined it necessary to start from the premise that the united states,hud,was a named party to only one contract in connection with each of the relevant projects,that contract being the regulatory agreement.at.the regulatory agreement did not incorporate by reference any other agreement,including the note containing the prepayment terms.id.at.although hud did provide its insurance endorsement,it was not expressly made a party to any note.id.the court went on to state that while the note and the regulatory agreement were part of the same transaction,each document stands alone and is unambiguous on its face.id.at.this court determined privity of contract did not exist,because none of the relevant documents in those transactions expressly contained the prepayment terms or listed hud and the owners as parties.
the new theory asserted by appellants in this case does not change this analysis.the only new document that appellants allege,in combination with the insurance commitment,creates privity of contract is the mortgagor certificate.the mortgagor certificate also does not contain any reference to terms regarding prepayment.thus,under this court holding in cienega iv,appellants privity of contract theory based on the insurance commitment and the mortgagor certificate fails.as the court of federal claims stated in its decision 
it is true that the federal circuit did not address the mortgagor certificate in its opinion.considering the nature and substance of the hud commitment,however,it is clear that bringing the mortgagor certificate into the analysis could no more establish prepayment privity between hud and the plaintiffs than the hud commitment could standing alone.the hud commitment and mortgagor certificate established a contract of mortgage insurance between hud and each of the plaintiffs.there is no language in either of those documents,however,that refers to prepayment rights in connection with the mortgage notes,which the federal circuit found to be separate contracts between the owners and lenders.
chancellor manor,fed.cl.at.
the mortgagor certificate authorizes and provides the representations made by the owners in accepting the loan insured by the united states.the owners certified they had the necessary power and authority to develop the project.this is a typical officer certificate and is a standard document obtained in virtually any financial transaction wherein the officer of the borrower affirms the possession of authority to proceed with the project and that the borrower shall abide by the representations and certification made in order to induce the united states to insure the loan.the mortgagor certificate contains no prepayment provisions and therefore does not create privity of contract between hud and the owners with respect to the prepayment terms.accordingly,the court of federal claims correctly addressed and decided this particular issue in its decision.
appellants also argue that the insurance commitment and the mortgagor certificate together create a contract between hud and appellants for mortgage insurance and incorporate by reference all the relevant regulations,including the prepayment terms,thereby creating privity of contract for the prepayment terms.in particular,appellants point to language in the insurance commitment that states that hud 
will endorse for insurance under the provisions of section of the national housing act,and the regulations thereunder now in effect,a mortgage note to be secured by a mortgage the insurance endorsement will be subject to compliance with the requirements of the regulations,and the terms and conditions set forth below.
emphases added.
there are two flaws in this argument.first,the insurance commitment is an agreement between hud and the lenders.despite appellants arguments,it does not incorporate by reference the prepayment regulations and therefore there is no privity of contract between the appellants and hud with respect to the prepayment option.greenbrier,at holding that the various agreements between hud and the owners did not incorporate the prepayment provisions by reference.second,as stated by this court in cienega iv,the very regulations now asserted to be incorporated by reference contain an express provision that the regulations may be amended by hud at any time 
i t would have been inconsistent for hud to have entered into the regulatory agreement if the agreement fixed the prepayment rights of the owners,in view of the express power to amend the section d and section program regulations at any time that was reserved to hud,subject only to the caveat that mortgagees interests not be adversely affected.
at.for these reasons,appellants incorporation by reference argument fails.
in short,there is simply no evidence that the united states was a party to any agreement containing the prepayment terms.absent privity of contract,there is no waiver of sovereign immunity.katz,at.
beneficiary 
appellants also argue that they are beneficiaries to the agreements between hud and the lenders.while appellants could establish privity of contract if they are intended beneficiaries of a contract with the united states,first hartford.pension plan trust united states,in order to prove beneficiary status,appellants must demonstrate that the contract not only reflects an express or implied intention to benefit the party,but that it reflects an intent to benefit the party directly,castle united states,petition for cert.filed.this direct benefit requirement reflects the reality that beneficiary status is an exceptional privilege.see glass united states,amended on reh g,quoting german alliance ins.home water supply.
none of the alleged agreements between the lenders and hud contains any explicit evidence showing that hud or the lenders intended to benefit the owners directly.appellants contend they were the direct intended beneficiaries by virtue of the insurance commitment between hud and the lenders because without appellants there would be no other reason for hud agreement to insure each owner repayment of the loan.at best,this shows that appellants were indirect beneficiaries of the insurance commitment.the primary,direct beneficiary of the insurance commitment was the public.see katz,at if there is a third party beneficiary at all,it is probably the tenants for whom the housing was ultimately intended.appellants have not pointed to any persuasive evidence showing they were direct intended beneficiaries of the insurance commitment.accordingly,we hold that appellants were not beneficiaries of the insurance commitment between hud and the lenders 
regulatory takings 
appellants also appeal the court of federal claims decision denying their claims that lihprha effected a taking of a protectible property interest in their land and their contracts without just compensation.
the fifth amendment provides,in relevant part,nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.analysis of a regulatory taking claim involves a inquiry into the government act alleged to have constituted a taking.m j coal united states.first,a court considers the nature of the interest allegedly taken to determine whether a compensable property interest exists.id.at.it is axiomatic that only persons with a valid property interest at the time of the taking are entitled to compensation.wyatt united states.

protected property interest 
appellants advance two separate property interests they believe are protected by the fifth amendment,one based in their real property rights and the other based on contract.we address each in turn.
property within the fifth amendment denotes the group of rights inhering in the citizen relation to the physical thing,as the right to possess,use and dispose of it.united states general motors.the fifth amendment clearly protects interests in real property,such as the owners interests in the land and buildings.see lucas coastal council,d stating that a fee simple interest in real property is an estate with a rich tradition of protection at common law.courts have long recognized that property owners have the right to exclusive possession.indeed,the supreme court has stated that the right to exclusive possession is one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights commonly characterized as property.kaiser aetna united states,d.an interest in real property is defined not only by the metes and bounds that describe the geographic dimensions of the property but also by the term of years that describes the temporal aspect of the owner interest.council,tahoe reg l planning agency,d.both dimensions must be considered if the interest is to be viewed in its entirety.id.
in the present case,the general partners of the owners purchased the land on which the housing was built before the owners participated in the programs.with their participation in the programs,the owners voluntarily contracted away,for a limited temporal period,their right to exclusive possession.in particular,the owners agreed to remain in the programs for a minimum period of at least twenty years.at the time the owners entered into the programs,they had the right to exit the programs by prepaying their mortgages upon expiration of a period.thus,the owners possessed a protectible real property interest with a limited temporal moratorium on the unfettered use of their property and right to exclusive possession.
the enactment of elihpa and lihprha imposed additional restrictions on the owners real property interest,prohibiting prepayment absent hud approval based on stringent requirements,which were not in existence when the owners entered the programs.in other words,elihpa and lihprha essentially extended,in revised form,the limited temporal moratorium on the owners right to unfettered use of their property.the property interest which is identifiable and recognized is the owners real property interest in the projects,the land and the buildings.the owners entered into the programs and subjected their real property interests to a regulatory scheme,which allowed them to develop the projects.the owners agreed to be subject to a temporal moratorium on their right to exclusive possession however,lihprha imposed an additional and continued limitation on the owners ability to unfettered use of the property.the issue to be determined is whether this resulted in a compensable taking of a property interest protected by the fifth amendment.see id.at.stating that a moratorium on development of land while a commission studied the effects of development on lake tahoe was better characterized as a regulatory taking rather than a categorical taking.the court of federal claims determined the appellants held no protectible property interest because they knew,or should have known,that the regulations governing the prepayment of their mortgage notes could be changed in a manner that might restrict the owners option to prepay after years.we disagree with this analysis because it does not take into account the limited use imposed upon the real property of the owners by the amended regulations.whether the appellants knew or should have known that the regulations could be changed is more properly an issue germane to the penn centra l analysis,not to whether the appellants possessed a protected property right.see lucas,at.because the court of federal claims erred in determining that appellants did not hold a protected real property interest,we reverse the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment with respect to appellants takings claims.
additionally,appellants also argue that elihpa and lihprha effected a compensable taking of a protected contractual right,the option to prepay after twenty years,as presented in cienega vi.that option right,however,is not really the issue here,except insofar as it is a trigger for exiting the federal housing program.appellants complain about the continued restrictions on the use of their property,not their inability to prepay the mortgage and the concomitant obligation to pay the rate of interest fixed in the mortgage instrument.
the only value this right provided appellants was the ability to terminate the regulatory restrictions imposed on appellants real property.appellants simply do not allege a contractual right separate and distinct from the real property right discussed above.for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the contract right appellants assert was taken is,in fact,a right grounded in real property,and not in contract.
penn central analysis 
having determined appellants possessed a protected property right in their real property,the second step of a proper takings analysis requires an analysis of the penn central factors.this analysis is a question of law based on factual underpinnings,bass enters,at,and involves a complex of factors including the regulation economic effect on the landowner,the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable expectations,and the character of the government action.palazzolo rhode island,d.while this analysis is essentially an ad hoc,factual inquiry,id.at.penn central,at,it is nonetheless an objective one.see palazzolo,at.the determination whether an existing,general law can limit all economic use of property must turn on objective factors commonwealth edison united states,en banc applying penn central analysis to issue of whether congress change in regulations was retroactive and in violation of the due process clause of the constitution.the subjective expectations of the appellants are irrelevant.id.the critical question is what a reasonable owner in the appellants position should have anticipated.id.the point in time when the analysis is conducted is the time at which the complaining party entered into the activity that triggered the obligation,id.at,specifically when the appellants entered the programs.
the court of federal claims in this case determined that no protected property interest exists hence the court of federal claims made no factual findings and conducted no penn central analysis.the government nonetheless argues that we should hold as a matter of law that there has been no taking because the owners could not have had reasonable expectations.it advances three arguments for this proposition.first,it argues that,because hud was empowered to amend its re
