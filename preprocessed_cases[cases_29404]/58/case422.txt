we deny respondents motion for rehearing.we withdraw our opinion of august,and substitute the following in its place.
in these consolidated proceedings,lessors under three oil and gas leases contend that the leases terminated because intermittently over the years there were periods of time ranging from to days when there was no actual production.we do not decide whether the leases terminated because even assuming they did,the lessees thereafter acquired by adverse possession fee simple determinable interests in the mineral estates that are identical to those the lessees held under the leases.accordingly,we reverse the judgments of the court of appeals and render judgments for petitioners.
two separate suits were brought in the same trial court by the same lessors against the same defendants.the first suit involved two leases the second suit involved a third lease.the cases were not consolidated in the trial court or the court of appeals,and the court of appeals issued an opinion in each case we consolidated the cases in this court.for ease of reference,we will refer to the suit as pool and the second as pool 
in pool,two leases were executed by sneed and his wife in and,respectively.in a separate agreement,the leases were consolidated as to a portion of the lands they covered for purposes of natural gas exploration and production.the lease at issue in pool provided it would remain in effect for a term of ten years and as long thereafter as oil or gas,or either of them,is produced from said land by the lessee.the lease similarly provided that it would remain in effect so long as natural gas is produced.
a well,known as the sneed well,was drilled on the consolidated acreage,and it produced gas until a replacement well was drilled in.the replacement well has produced without interruption.but according to records from the texas railroad commission,there were periods of time when there was no production from the sneed.those periods were in august,june through september,july and august,june,march,and july.there is evidence that the sneed did not produce for consecutive days in the summer of and for consecutive days in.the other periods of were shorter.
the lease at issue in pool was executed in.it provided that s ubject to the other provisions herein contained,this lease shall remain in force pending the commencement and continuation of drilling operations on said land as hereinafter provided,and as long thereafter as natural gas is produced and marketed from any well on said land.
two producing wells were drilled on the acreage covered by the lease at issue in pool.however,there was no actual production from either of these wells in august,july and august,june and july,june through october,july and august,and june.the periods of no actual production ranged from to days.another well was drilled on the pool lease in,and it has produced in paying quantities without interruption.
the plaintiffs in the trial court,who are the respondents in this court,are the successors of the sneeds interests in all three leases,and they contend that the leases terminated due to cessation of production.they brought suit to quiet title,for trespass,conversion,and fraud,and for actual and exemplary damages.the defendants in the trial court,who are the petitioners in this court,are natural gas pipeline company of america,midcon gas services,and chesapeake panhandle limited partnership.they are the current owners and operators of the leases.for simplicity,we will refer to them as the lessees.they contend that the leases did not terminate because there has been production in paying quantities at all times,notwithstanding the periods of,or that production was restored within a reasonable period of time under the temporary cessation of production doctrine.in the alternative,the lessees contend that the lessors claims are barred by laches,or that the lessees obtained a fee simple determinable in each of the mineral estates by adverse possession.
in both suits,the trial court granted motions for partial summary judgment in favor of the lessors,declaring in the partial summary judgment that the leases had terminated due to one or more cessations of production from said land.the trial court then tried the remaining issues in pool to a jury.in a verdict largely favorable to the lessees,the jury found that the lessees had produced gas in good faith after august and failed to find that the lessees had produced gas after as a result of fraud.the jury also found that the lessees failure to produce gas was excused because the lessors were guilty of laches,and that the lessees had acquired title to the leases by adverse possession under the three,five,ten,and statutes of limitations.however,the jury found that the lessors had not executed any formal document that expressly recognized the validity of the leases and thus that the leases had not been revived.the trial court rendered judgment notwithstanding the aspects of the verdict that were favorable to the lessees.the trial court declared that the two leases had terminated,and based on stipulated damage calculations,awarded in actual damages to be paid by natural gas pipeline and midcon,and in actual damages to be paid by chesapeake panhandle the trial court also awarded attorneys fees and costs to the lessors.
the trial court tried the remaining issues in pool to a different jury in a trial that began a few days after the conclusion of the pool trial.unlike the jury in pool,the jury in pool rendered a verdict that was entirely favorable to the lessors.the jury found that the lessees had acted in bad faith in producing gas after august,that the lessees produced gas after that date as a result of fraud,that the lessors were not guilty of laches,that the lessees did not acquire title by adverse possession,and that the lessors had not executed any formal document that expressly recognized the validity of the lease and thus that the lease had not been revived.the trial court rendered a judgment declaring that the lease had terminated,that the lessees were jointly and severally liable for in actual damages,that the lessors recover exemplary damages of from natural gas pipeline,from midcon and from chesapeake panhandle,and awarded attorneys fees,costs,and prejudgment interest.
the lessees appealed both judgments.in pool,the court of appeals held that the leases had terminated due to cessation of production,the lessees could not establish adverse possession even if they were trespassers because they had not given notice of repudiation of the lessors title,laches was not a defense,the lessors were not entitled to attorneys fees because the suit was essentially a trespass to try title action rather than an action for declaratory judgment,and certain offsets should be applied to reduce damages.the court of appeals accordingly modified and then affirmed the trial court judgment 
in pool,the court of appeals held that the lease had terminated due to cessation of production,laches was unavailable as a defense,the lessors execution of division orders did not revive the lease,the lessees did not establish adverse possession because there was no notice to the lessors that the lessees repudiated the lease,the evidence did not support the fraud finding and therefore exemplary damages were not recoverable,the evidence supported the finding that the lessors had produced gas in bad faith,the limitations periods applied to the trespass and conversion claims for recovery of actual damages,and the lessors could not recover attorneys fees.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment as modified 
we granted the lessees petitions for review.because the lessees established adverse possession as a matter of law,and resolution of that issue is dispositive,we do not reach other issues presented by the lessees petitions.
in texas it has long been recognized that an oil and gas lease is not a lease in the traditional sense of a lease of the surface of real property in a typical oil or gas lease,the lessor is a grantor and grants a fee simple determinable interest to the lessee,who is actually a grantee consequently,the acquires ownership of all the minerals in place that the owned and purported to lease,subject to the possibility of reverter in the the lessee grantee interest is determinable because it may terminate and revert entirely to the upon the occurrence of events that the lease specifies will cause termination of the estate in the cases before us today,the lessors retained only a royalty interest.when an oil and gas lease reserves only a royalty interest,the lessee acquires title to all of the oil and gas in place,and the lessor owns only a possibility of reverter and has the right to receive royalties a royalty interest,as distinguished from a mineral interest,is a interest 
a mineral estate,even when severed from the surface estate,may be adversely possessed under the various statutes of limitations once severance occurs,possession of the surface alone will not constitute adverse possession of minerals generally,courts across the country including texas courts have said that in order to mature title by limitations to a mineral estate,actual possession of the minerals must occur in the case of oil and gas,that means drilling and production of oil or gas 
in order to acquire title under a statute of limitations,that statute requirements must be met.in these cases,we consider the three,five,and statutes of limitations.suit was filed in both cases more than ten years after the last cessation of actual production.the last period of nonproduction occurred in in pool and in in pool.both suits were filed in.
the statute of limitations says a person must bring suit to recover real property held by another in peaceable and adverse possession under title or color of title not later than three years after the day the cause of action accrues.the statute says,
a a person must bring suit not later than five years after the day the cause of action accrues to recover real property held in peaceable and adverse possession by another who 
cultivates,uses,or enjoys the property 
pays applicable taxes on the property and 
claims the property under a duly registered deed 
the jury in this case was instructed that an oil and gas lease is to be considered as a deed.the statute of limitations requires suit to be brought within ten years to recover real property held in peaceable and adverse possession by another who cultivates,uses,or enjoys the property.
adverse possession is defined in the civil practice and remedies code as an actual and visible appropriation of real property,commenced and continued under a claim of right that is inconsistent with and is hostile to the claim of another person.peaceable possession is defined as possession of real property that is continuous and is not interrupted by an adverse suit to recover the property.
the court of appeals concluded in these cases that the lessees continuation of oil and gas operations and possession of the minerals after the leases terminated was not adverse because no notice of repudiation had been given to the lessors.the court reasoned in pool that because the lessees original possession of the mineral estate was permissive,adverse possession could not be established unless notice of the hostile nature of the possession or repudiation of the record title owners title is clearly manifested.the court of appeals employed similar reasoning in pool 
we first consider the relationship between the parties,which guides us in determining whether the lessees possession was adverse.the parties to the leases were not.as discussed above,the lessors retained only a royalty interest and the possibility of reverter.the lessors had no right to possess,explore for,or produce the minerals.the exclusive right to do so was conveyed to the lessees.accordingly,even when the lease was in effect,there was no more importantly,if the leases terminated as the lessors contend,the lessees retained no interest whatsoever in the minerals.the entire mineral interest reverted to the lessors.there was no.
a lessee position after a lease expires is more analogous to one holding over after the execution of a deed or after a judgment vesting title in another is entered.we have long said that as a general rule,a party holding over after the execution of a deed or the rendition of an adverse judgment is merely a permissive tenant.in such circumstances,possession can not be considered adverse until the tenancy has been repudiated,and notice of such repudiation has been brought home to the titleholder.but we have said that actual notice of repudiation is not required.rather,notice can be inferred,or there can be constructive notice 
this court held in johnson that a jury may infer notice of a repudiation without any change in the use of the land,if there has been use.in,the court cited some of its early decisions to that effect.one of those decisions was vasquez meaders this court said in that case 
it is not necessary that actual notice of adverse claim and disseisin be given to the landlord.it is sufficient if constructive notice is given,and constructive notice will be presumed where the facts show,as they do in this case,that the adverse occupancy and claim of title to the land involved in this suit has been long continued,open,notorious,exclusive and inconsistent with the existence of title in the respondent 
the court also quoted at length from the decision in mauritz thatcher 
it is the settled law in this state that a tenant can not dispute the title of his landlord by setting up a title either in himself or in a third person during the existence of his tenancy until such notice of a termination thereof is given to the landlord as amounts to an actual disseizin.limitation upon an adverse possession in a case of this kind begins to run from the time of such notice of a termination of tenancy.it is not necessary,however,that actual notice of an adverse holding and disseizin be given to a cotenant or owner.such notice may be constructive and will be presumed to have been brought home to the or owner when the adverse occupancy and claim of title to the property is so,open,notorious,exclusive and inconsistent with the existence of title in others,except the occupant,that the law will raise the inference of notice to the or owner out of possession,or from which a jury might rightfully presume such notice.
this court had articulated the same principles even earlier in moore knight the court also said in moore that the failure of the record titleholder to assert a claim during possession was highly significant from an evidentiary perspective possession and assertion of claim by one tenant with nonclaim on the part of one out of possession has always been regarded as a strong circumstance tending to authorize an inference of notice of the adverse possession.
in this case,the lessors asserted no claim for at least fourteen years with regard to the pool leases,and for at least years with regard to the pool lease.that is a strong circumstance tending to authorize an inference of notice of adverse possession.there is also uncontroverted evidence that the lessees possession was open,notorious,exclusive,and inconsistent with the existence of title to all the minerals in the lessors.
it is important to bear in mind that the lessees were not required to give actual or constructive notice that they were no longer claiming an interest under the leases,but instead that they were claiming an interest that was inconsistent with the lessors title to all the minerals when the leases expired.thus,it was not the leases that the lessees must have been adverse to,but the lessors fee title to all the minerals after the leases allegedly terminated.the lessees continued to claim rights under the leases,and it was that claim that was adverse to the lessors fee title,unencumbered by the leases.
it is also important to recognize that the holding over of an oil and gas lessee after the lease has expired can differ from a tenant of the surface with regard to what is open,notorious,exclusive,and inconsistent.a tenant of the surface that holds over and does nothing more than continue to occupy the premises as before,paying the same rent as before,is not in the same position as an oil and gas lessee who holds over.surface leases do not typically contemplate that the tenant will remove permanent fixtures on or improvements to the property or consume or destroy the property itself.but an oil and gas lease contemplates that the mineral estate itself may be permanently and irrevocably depleted by removing and exhausting the minerals.an oil and gas lessee that holds over continues to physically remove and dispose of the very valuable,minerals for its own account.such actions are by their nature hostile to the lessor ownership of all the minerals in place once the lease expires and the mineral estate reverts to the lessor in its entirety.
in both of the cases before us,the court of appeals relied on a decision from this court,killough hinds in the killough case,hinds acquired an oil and gas lease on forty acres of land,the surface of which was owned by the killoughs or their predecessors.hinds and his wife were given permission by the surface owners to construct a home on the property.hinds later sold his interest in the oil and gas lease to a third party,but he and his wife continued to live on the surface of the property.this court held that hinds had failed to establish title to the surface under the statute of limitations because the erection of the barn,pig pen,chicken house and the grazing of milk cows,all of which were relied on to show adverse possession,were not inconsistent with the permissive use and the right by which hinds entered upon and occupied the property and built his residence,nor are they sufficient as a matter of law to afford the record owner constructive notice of a repudiation of that permissive use.
in killough we relied on and quoted from an earlier decision of this court,evans templeton in explaining the character of evidence necessary to show constructive notice of repudiation to the record owner.quoting evans,we said 
in order to make the plea of limitation effectual in such case,he must show some notorious act of ownership over the property,distinctly hostile to the claim of the grantee and the adverse possession after this must continue for a sufficient length of time before suit to complete the statutory bar.the possession must not only be actual,but also visible,continuous,notorious,distinct and hostile,and of such a character as to indicate unmistakably an assertion of claim of exclusive ownership in the occupant.
there is evidence of a notorious act of ownership over the property,distinctly hostile to the claim of the lessors that indicate s unmistakably an assertion of claim of exclusive ownership to show notice in the cases before us today.assuming that the leases terminated because of cessation of actual production,an issue that we again note we are not deciding,the character of the lessors real property interests changed dramatically and instantaneously,as did the lessees interests,as we have explained above.the lessors had owned a mere possibility of reverter in the respective mineral interests as long as the leases covering those interests remained in effect.the lessors had no right to possess or explore for minerals.that right had been granted in toto to the lessees.the lessees had the right to explore for and remove all of the oil and gas from the premises,subject only to the obligation to pay royalties on the oil and gas that was actually produced.and if the lessees did not properly account to the lessors for that royalty,the leases would not terminate.the lessors would be relegated to bringing suit to recover the unpaid royalties.as long as the leases continued in effect,the lessees were entitled to recover and sell one hundred percent of the oil and gas,to the point of totally exhausting those valuable resources.once the leases terminated,the lessees had no right to explore for,produce,or sell any of the oil and gas,much less one hundred percent of all that was produced.those rights reverted to the lessors.thereafter,it was the lessors that had the exclusive right to all the proceeds from production,subject only to an equitable accounting to the former lessees for the actual cost of production.
after the leases allegedly terminated,the lessees continued production and sale of all the oil and gas and payment of royalty on only a relatively small percentage of the proceeds was open,notorious,and hostile to the lessors,who received payments each month of only a royalty for more than ten years after they say the leases terminated moreover,the lessees drilled new wells after the time the lessors contend the leases terminated.the act of drilling wells is an act hostile to the lessors exclusive right to explore for and remove the valuable minerals as well as the lessors exclusive right to make the decision whether to drill and therefore impact the speculative value of the mineral estate if the well were unsuccessful.
our conclusion is consistent with the fifth circuit decision in louis royalty continental oil in which the facts were similar to those before us today.in louis royalty,the lessors brought suit long after the lessees had conducted successful exploration,drilling,and production operations,contending that the lease had expired many years earlier because there was no actual production during the primary term.the lease had a drilling clause,and a well had been successfully drilled during the period after the primary term expired.the fifth circuit held that the well maintained the lease under the clause.but that court also held,as an alternative ground,that the lessees by open,notorious,and adverse possession for more than five years with payment of taxes,under a claim of right brought home to plaintiff,acquired a good and perfect title,to the leasehold interest.the opinion in louis royalty further observed that the things lessees were doing were not done secretly and in a corner,but openly and in the face of all the world,with full knowledge thereof brought home to plaintiff and its predecessors in title.our court later described louis royalty alternative holding and the facts supporting it,saying,
t he plaintiff and its predecessors in title,although fully informed of the lessee claim to and operations under the lease,did not assert that the same had terminated until some ten years after the end of the primary term,during which time the lessee had developed the property by drilling seven producing wells the fifth circuit then went on to say that if the leases had lapsed,the plaintiff was still not entitled to recover because the evidence established as a matter of law that the defendants had perfected a limitation title to the leasehold estate 
in the cases before us today,the fact that the lessees were claiming the right and title to all of the production and the right to drill and explore for oil and gas,subject only to the royalty obligation,was open and notorious and was hostile to the lessors claim that all title and interest reverted to the lessors and that the lessees ceased to own any interest in the minerals.as one noted treatise has concluded,a lessee who develops and produces under a lease which previously terminated may acquire title to such lease by adverse possession.
the lessors also contend that the lessees possession was never adverse because the lessees did not recognize that the leases had terminated when they continued operations and therefore lacked the requisite intent to adversely possess the mineral interests.our decision in calfee leads us to disagree with this contention.in that case,calfee,an heir to duke,occupied approximately fenced acres of land.his deed from his parents did not include of those acres.the other duke heirs brought a trespass to try title suit,claiming that they and calfee became upon calfee parents death with regard to the undeeded acres.we observed that calfee never thought of himself as claiming adversely to anyone for the simple reason that he thought he was the rightful owner and had no competition for that ownership.we held that this satisfied the statute requirement of adverse possession 
that being his claim of right,and it being coupled with his actual and visible possession and use,the adverse claim and possession satisfy the statutory requirements and can not be defeated by calfee lack of knowledge of the deficiency of his record title or by the absence of a realization that there could be other claimants for the land 
in the cases before us today,the lessors essentially contend that the lessees should have notified them that the leases had terminated and that the fee interest in the minerals had reverted to the lessors.this is tantamount to saying that the running of limitations is suspended until the record titleholder obtains actual knowledge of what it owns.this is a novel proposition indeed.it would mean,for example,that limitations would be suspended whenever heirs did not realize that they had inherited an interest.that has never been the law in texas.a record titleholder ignorance of what it owns does not affect the running of limitations.the lessees possession of the mineral estates in the cases before us today was adverse,and all the requirements of the three,five,and statutes of limitations were met.
statutes of limitations require someone with a claim to assert that claim within a specified period of time,and the statutes of limitations dealing with real property are no different.the legislature has required those claiming an interest in real property to bring suit within certain periods of time statutes of limitations are designed to compel the assertion of claims within a reasonable period while the evidence is fresh in the minds of the parties and witnesses and to prevent litigation of stale or fraudulent claims.the lessors in the cases before us contend that title reverted to them a number of years ago,perhaps as long as years before suit was filed under the pool leases,and as long as years before suit was filed under the pool lease.the last occasion when title could have reverted under the pool leases was years before suit was filed,and for the pool lease,it was years.these are the types of claims that statutes of limitations were intended to foreclose.
our decision should not be read as awarding fee simple absolute interests to the lessees in the oil and gas resources at issue.the lessees acquired the same interest that they adversely and peaceably possessed,that is,the oil and gas leasehold estates as defined by the original leases those interests are fee simple determinable interests in the respective properties on the same terms and conditions as the original leases.the terms that made the original mineral estates determinable continue to apply to the fee simple determinable interests acquired by adverse possession.
the court of appeals accordingly erred in failing to hold that the lessees acquired leasehold interests by adverse possession.
in pool,the lessors have brought forward a cross point in which they contend that some of the instructions and definitions in the trial court charge to the jury on the limitations issues were incorrect.among these complaints is the contention that the definition of notice of repudiation accompanying the question regarding the statute of limitations allowed the jury to find adverse possession based on possession coupled with a repudiation that occurred less than ten years before suit was filed.the trial court instruction said in pertinent part 
you are instructed that,with respect to this question only,adverse possession means that the plaintiffs or their predecessors as titleholders,had notice that the defendants gas lease has been repudiated,and defendants were in peaceable and adverse possession of the lease and drilled for or operated and produced gas from wells thereon and used or enjoyed the property under a title instrument for a period of ten years after august of.for purposes of this instruction,a gas lease is to be considered as a title instrument.
notice of repudiation may be inferred to have been brought home to a titleholder where there has been possession by the adverse possessor under a claim of ownership coupled with the of claim by the titleholder by of claim by titleholder means the absence of an overt act of ownership on part of the record owner which is inconsistent with the possession of the adverse possessor.
the language explaining notice of repudiation substantially tracks the holding of this court in johnson which concerned the fee simple title to a tract of land.this court said,w e hold that the jury may infer that notice of repudiation has been brought home to the titleholder where there has been possession under claim of ownership and nonassertion of claim by the titleholder.in that case,alexander lost title to acres of a tract in foreclosure proceedings.he,and after him his family,nevertheless continued to occupy the entire tract for years,from to,without any intervening claim by the record titleholder this court held that this extended period of time was evidence from which the jury could infer notice of repudiation to the record titleholder the court explained that its holding was an application of rules regarding circumstantial evidence 
our holding is nothing more than an application of the rule of circumstantial evidence that the existence of certain facts tends to support a reasonable inference that the record owner has been put on notice that the tenancy has been repudiated.to this extent,both satisfy the rationale for requiring such notice.where a tenancy relationship has arisen,the landlord is normally justified in assuming that the tenant use of the premises is permissive and in recognition of the landlord title.however,under certain circumstances,this assumption ceases to be justifiable.thus acts which are inconsistent with the original use of the property may be sufficient to put the owner on notice that the tenancy has been repudiated.the same has been held to be true in cases of possession by the tenant under claim of ownership where the landlord has failed to assert any claim.under such circumstances,the jury may find that continued reliance on the tenancy by the landlord was unreasonable and unwarranted 
we further explained that the extended period of possession must have occurred and thus have constituted notice of repudiation before the applicable statute of limitations began to run we reiterated what had been said in sweeten park which was that possession for three and years before the limitations period began was insufficient but we said in that years in excess of the statutory period falls within the mauritz rule,as constituting possession.
in pool,the first period when there was no actual production under the leases occurred in,years before suit was filed and years before the statute allegedly began to run.the last period of nonproduction occurred in,fourteen years before suit was filed and four years before the statute allegedly began to run.it is thus unclear why the date of august was used in the instruction regarding the statute of limitations.but we need not parse through whether another date should have been used,or whether a period of possession before a period of possession occurred would be adequate to comport with the possession principles set forth in and the cases cited therein.for the reasons discussed above in section ii,as a matter of law,the lessors were put on notice that the lessees claims were hostile to the claim that the lease had terminated when the lessees continued to operate the leases,produce oil or gas,sell it,and pay only a royalty to the lessors.adverse possession under the statute was conclusively established.any error in the charge to the jury was harmless.and,because adverse possession under the statute of limitations was established as a matter of law,we need not consider whether there was any error in the charge to the jury regarding the three and statutes of limitations.
as noted throughout this opinion,we have not reached the question of whether the leases terminated due to cessation of production.specifically,it is unnecessary to decide whether the terms is produced or so long as natural gas is produced as used in the leases before us mean that the leases would terminate whenever actual production ceased,or instead,whether the leases would terminate only when production in paying quantities ceased.nor do we decide whether the doctrine of temporary cessation of production includes or should include cessation of production for economic reasons.
the dissent contends that in deciding these cases based on statutes of limitations,we have put the cart before the horse.the dissent proposes that these cases be remanded for a trial of fact issues that it concludes are raised under its view of the temporary cessation of production doctrine.
for reasons of judicial economy,this court has long required that dispositive issues must be considered and resolved and that a judgment moving the case to the greatest degree of finality must be rendered.we held in bradleys electric,cigna lloyds insurance that when a party presents multiple grounds for reversal of a judgment on appeal,appellate courts should first address issues that would require rendition in accord with that principle,in cmh homes,daenen,we addressed whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the judgment,and concluding that it was not,rendered judgment without considering whether venue was proper any error in venue would have only required a remand we similarly have admonished courts of appeals that p rior to ordering a remand,points calling for rendition of judgment should be considered.the disposition of the statutes of limitations questions resolves the cases before us,and therefore,we do not reach other issues presented.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the court of appeals erred in failing to hold that the lessees in these two cases acquired fee simple determinable mineral estates by adverse possession.accordingly,we reverse the judgments of the courts of appeals and render judgments for the lessees.
because the court evades a pressing issue in this case,i write separately.the court characterizes the issue as whether the lessees acquired a fee simple determinable interest in the mineral estate by adverse possession and concludes that the court of appeals erred in failing to hold that the lessees acquired leasehold interests by adverse possession.this characterization bypasses the real the leases terminated due to cessation of production.the parties have clearly presented and fully briefed this question,which is undoubtedly important to the jurisprudence of the state.although the court has devised an elegant solution in this particular case,the overarching legal question will surely recur in circumstances where adverse possession is not a viable defense.
the court repeatedly disavows any intent to decide whether the leases in these cases terminated when production ceased.instead,it concludes that the lessees acquired,by adverse possession,the same interest they held under the leases.resolving the case in this way is premature.by deciding that the lessees acquired a leasehold interest by adverse possession without first resolving whether the leases actually terminated,the court puts the cart before the horse.i suspect that future lessors will cite this case as implicit authority that a profitable production is not in on the sole ground that the lessee suspended operations temporarily to advance the lease profitability for all concerned.
the court resolution of the case introduces a new twist on adverse possession that,at least on its face,divests a prior owner of property without the sort of notorious ouster we have previously mandated.traditionally,adverse possession requires hostility.killough hinds.in the cases the court decides today,however,the lessees had permission to market and produce oil and gas on the lessors property.as a predicate to adverse possession,we have required the ostensible new owner to have given notice of its repudiation of the prior owner title.id sweeten park.that the lessees resumed production after periods of temporary nonproduction,drilled a replacement well,erected signs on the property,and paid ad valorem taxes is not inconsistent with the rights they enjoyed under the lease.both the lessees and lessors proceeded as though the leases were still in effect.thus,the lessees possession was arguably permissive and not hostile the court concludes that the lessors here were on constructive notice of termination of their leases for the following reasons the former lessee remained on the property for a statutory period of time the former lessor did not receive the full portion of royalties it would be due if the lease were terminated and the former lessee continued to deplete the mineral resources of the property.but each of the factors would be status quo for the relationship.nothing in the court reasoning indicates how the lessor should know that these activities differ from those undertaken while the lease was in effect.without actual notice of cessation,and thus no notice of termination,the lessor would not be aware that the adverse possession period had begun.such a rule would be difficult for any lessor,and particularly impossible where a royalty interest is split among multiple parties.i raise these concerns not to answer them here but to emphasize that we need not disturb our law on adverse possession to resolve the question squarely the leases terminated upon a temporary cessation of production.
the record in these consolidated cases suggests that production ceased for short periods of time so that the lessees and lessors could benefit from higher winter prices.we should remand this cause to permit the trier of fact to determine whether a temporary cessation that furthers the economic interest of both lessors and lessees was reasonable under the circumstances.
the typical habendum clause in texas mineral leases grants a lessee mineral rights to the leased land for a fixed primary term and,if the lessee begins production by the end of the primary term,for a secondary term that lasts as long thereafter as oil and gas is produced.the durational language in the habendum clause conveys a fee simple determinable estate in the secondary term,leaving the lessor with a possibility of reverter.waggoner estate sigler oil,stephens county oil gas.when,as here,there is no savings clause,we have held that periods of nonproduction during the secondary term automatically terminate the lease.watson rochmill.
the primary object of an oil and gas lease is to secure development of the property for the mutual benefit of the parties.garcia king.but under the automatic termination rule,without a savings clause,cessation of production in the secondary term automatically terminates the lease,even if profitable production is later restored.amoco prod.braslau,watson rochmill.to mitigate the harshness of this automatic termination rule,courts necessarily impl y a temporary cessation of production tcop doctrine.midwest oil winsauer,watson,at.the tcop doctrine presumes that the parties understood that mechanical problems,reworking operations,or other similar events would inevitably interrupt production from time to time.smith weaver,texas law of oil and gas b.it also presupposes that the parties did not intend for such occurrences,which are incidental to normal oil and gas operations,to terminate the lease.winsauer,at sunray dx oil texaco,paso,writ ref williams meyers,oil gas law.the doctrine gives lessees a reasonable period of time in which to remedy the defect and resume production.winsauer,at.

the strictness of the automatic termination rule has been modified where there is only a temporary cessation of production due to sudden stoppage of the well or some mechanical breakdown of the equipment used in connection therewith,or the like.under such circumstances there are authorities which hold that the lessee is entitled to a reasonable time in which to remedy the defect and resume production.

the court of appeals in this case applied the traditional interpretation of this doctrine.it first explained that because the lessors had established that there was a cessation of production and that the leases contained no applicable savings clauses,the lessees were required to prove that the cessation fell within the tcop doctrine.pool,at pool,at.the court then conducted its tcop inquiry and stated that,for a cessation to be temporary,not only must it be due to some mechanical breakdown or something similar,but production must resume within a reasonable time.pool,at pool,at.the court of appeals did not decide whether the lessees established that the reason for the stoppage was a mechanical breakdown or something similar,but instead assumed that to be the case.pool,at pool,at.it then held,however,that the lessees failed to meet their burden to show that production was restored within a reasonable time.pool,at pool,at.on that basis,the court of appeals affirmed the trial courts judgments regarding cessation of production.pool,at pool,at.
the court of appeals,employing the traditional tcop rule,did not consider factors other than a mechanical breakdown or something similar that could have caused the cessation consequently,it did not review the extent to which economic factors may have excused a temporary cessation of production,or the relationship between those factors and the lessees diligence in restoring production.thus,the court of appeals opinion,while it reflected a correct application of the current texas tcop doctrine,nonetheless disregarded evidence that the leases remained commercially profitable despite brief periods of nonproduction.as such,this case highlights the necessity for modification of the texas tcop doctrine to better reflect the fundamental purpose behind oil and gas leases.
it is true,of course,that any proposed modification of the tcop doctrine will draw into sharp relief the divergence in economic interests that underscore oil and gas leases.lessors generally urge strict construction of the doctrine because it affords either immediate financial benefits in the form of royalty payments or permits renegotiation of their lease on terms superior to the bargain initially struck.if,for example,an existing lease terminated due to cessation of production,the lessor would be free to renegotiate the lease and obtain significant monetary benefits including higher bonuses and increased payments.see nancy forbis,the royalty clause balancing the interests of lessors and lessees.allowing a lease to continue despite a cessation of production,on the other hand,deprives lessors of the immediate and expected benefits of production and subjects the lease to potential drainage of oil and gas from beneath the land by producing wells on neighboring tracts.id.
while lessors prefer a strict construction of the tcop doctrine,lessees favor minimizing the circumstances under which their rights to production and marketing terminate.when a lease is terminated for,the lessee forfeits not only its capital investment in the well,but also any profits that would have been realized over the course of the lease.in contrast to lessors,lessees are more willing to tolerate in the short term to increase the well profitability over time.lessees have argued in many jurisdictions that the temporary loss of a market for their product,or cyclical periods during which production is economically disadvantageous,justifies a tcop that does not threaten the continued vitality of the lease.when determining the scope of the tcop doctrine,we must consider these conflicting interests.
the tcop doctrine recognizes that lessors and lessees have a mutual interest in maintaining a lease that produces in paying quantities.under current texas law,however,if there is nonproduction for a valid economic reason,the lease will nevertheless terminate and revert back to the lessor.see,bachler rosenthal,writ denied.this is so even though we judicially imply a right to continue the lease after a mechanical breakdown because the parties intended that the well be profitable.such a narrow application of the tcop doctrine is contrary to the primary function of oil and gas leases and the tcop doctrine purpose.our decisions limiting application of the doctrine have been described as narrow,disproportionately favorable to the lessor,arbitrary,inequitable,and harsh.see,somont oil v.a g drilling,treiweiler,dissenting cotner warren.
this case provides an opportunity to adopt a more balanced approach,one that promotes the parties shared economic interest while maintaining strong incentives for the lessees to avoid speculative interruptions in the production and marketing of oil and gas.under the traditional tcop doctrine,lessees would be required to produce even if it would be more beneficial to both parties to cease production for a short period while prices were depressed.such a construction disregards the primary goal of oil and gas leases,whereas a more liberal construction effectuates the purpose of the lease.construing the tcop doctrine to apply to interruptions in not simply when there is a mechanical with both parties financial interests and avoids an unnecessarily harsh result.the tcop doctrine developed because courts recognized that breakdowns in equipment and reworking operations are bound to occur and cause a temporary cessation of production.sunray dx oil,at.courts also recognized that it would be patently unfair to terminate a lease when these events resulted in no actual production.just as it is illogical to terminate a lease because of a mechanical breakdown,it is illogical to force a lessee to produce when the market penalizes production.market fluctuations are as much a reality in oil and gas leases as broken equipment.
here,there was some evidence that the lessees shut in their wells during the summer months when demand was slow in order to produce the maximum possible amount of gas in the winter,when prices were high.in these circumstances,deferred marketing of oil or gas could actually benefit the lessors as long as there is no drainage to other wells,no oil or gas is lost by ceasing production,and production is delayed only until the earliest possible point at which conditions for production are favorable.this approach permits both parties to realize greater profits and accomplishes the lease primary of minerals for the parties mutual benefit.garcia,at.thus,i would hold that the tcop doctrine should be equally applicable to interruptions as it is to stoppages caused by mechanical or other physical events.
in watson rochmill,this court applied the tcop doctrine to a two year and cessation.at.despite the fact that it was physically possible to extract oil,economic realities caused by the depression were disincentives to production.id.after stating the general tcop rule,this court concluded that the lease terminated because the cessation of production,which lasted for two years and seven months,was not temporary,and t he cessation of production for this long period of time was not brought about nor induced by any mechanical breakdown or other condition in connection with the well or the equipment used in connection therewith.id.we noted that the demoralized condition of the oil market in no wise prevented the operation of the well by the lessee for whatever oil it would produce.at.we also noted,however,that t hese conditions may have rendered it unprofitable to operate the well and could have been contracted against.id.thus,even though market conditions may have penalized production,we nonetheless required production to maintain the lease because the parties did not explicitly state in the lease tha
