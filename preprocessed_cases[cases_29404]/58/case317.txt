defendant contends that when a landlord sells leased property after the tenant has abandoned the lease,the landlord may not recover from the tenant expenses incurred in selling the property.we conclude the law does not impose that blanket prohibition.instead,the landlord entitlement to recover selling expenses from a breaching tenant depends upon the evidence adduced in a particular case,as is true with respect to other expenses incurred by the landlord in mitigating damages,and as is true generally when calculating damages from breach of contract.in this case,substantial evidence supports the court award of selling expenses to the landlord.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.

discussion 
the sale of property after a tenant terminates a lease by abandonment does not deprive the landlord of its contract remedies for breach of lease 
defendant contends section of the civil code requires a landlord to mitigate damages after the lease is terminated by the tenant abandonment of the premises the landlord sale of the property constitutes a breach of the duty to mitigate and,therefore,expenses incurred in breaching the duty to mitigate are not recoverable against the tenant.defendant argument rests entirely upon its premise that the only way a landlord may mitigate damages upon the tenant breach is to relet the property.we disagree both with defendant premise and its proposed rule of law.while it is nearly always the case that a jilted landlord will attempt to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to relet the property,we find nothing in the law,or in reason,that would prohibit a landlord from selling the property to mitigate his loss,provided the trier of fact finds a sale to be a reasonable means to avoid the further loss of rental revenue.
we begin our analysis with the language of section.i f a lessee of real property breaches the lease and abandons the property before the end of the term,the lease terminates.section continues by providing remedies for the landlord loss of rental revenue,discussed post,even though the tenant leasehold estate has been terminated.
because it becomes important to our analysis of the cases relied upon by defendant,we first note that termination of the lease upon abandonment by the tenant departs from the common law rule by which the lease terminated only upon a surrender of the lease term.at common law,a surrender of the lease could be accomplished by an express agreement of the parties for cancellation or rescission of the lease.citations.surrender usually occur ed,however,by operation of law,where the parties do something inconsistent with the continuance of the old estate,and an estoppel results.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.real property.prior to the enactment of section in,if,after abandonment by the tenant,the landlord reentered and took unqualified possession for his own benefit,a surrender occurred,and the tenant was released.citations.section changed the rule so as to permit the landlord to recover damages or rent after an abandonment.id.at.
describing section,the court in danner jarrett d,commented,section is an admirable attempt to engraft the contract remedy of loss of bargain onto real property law.citation.it abrogates the common law rule that the lessee obligation to pay rent depends on the continued existence of the term.it encourages the lessor to mitigate damages by no longer requiring the reletting of the property to be for the benefit of the lessee.its formula for damages permits the lessee to prove what rental loss could have been avoided.
thus,section provides contract remedies to the landlord that would have been unavailable at common law upon termination of the lease by surrender or otherwise.these remedies are defined by the landlord contract with its tenant,not by rules derived from the common law of real property.specifically,upon termination of the lease by the tenant abandonment before the end of the term,the landlord may recover the worth at the time of award of the unpaid rent which had been earned at the time of termination the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided if the lease provides this remedy,or the premises were relet before the award,the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the lessee proves could be reasonably avoided and any other amount necessary to compensate the lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by the lessee failure to perform his obligations under the lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom,subds.a a.
with one inapposite exception,notably absent from section is any requirement that the landlord take action to mitigate his damages in any particular way.the exception occurs in section,subdivision c.the recovery of lost rental revenue accruing for the balance of the term after the date of judgment under section,subdivision a is conditioned upon the lease providing this remedy,or,if the lease does not provide this remedy,the property must actually be relet before the time of the award.and where future rents are sought based on an actual reletting of the property,the landlord must prove that he acted reasonably and in a effort to mitigate the damages,subd.c.
but paragraph a of the lease in the instant case does allow the landlord remedy under section,subdivision a.thus,section,plainly paraphrased,and as applied to the instant case,provides that the landlord may recover all contract damages adjusted to present value on the date of the award caused by the tenant breach,unless the tenant can prove that some or all of the rental loss could have been avoided.the statute refers to the unpaid rent as such rental loss.by this phrasing of the statute,rental loss means the unpaid rent.
rental loss can be avoided in the traditional manner by reletting the premises.if the landlord is not diligent in doing so,the tenant can meet its burden of proving avoidable rental loss by offering evidence,for example,of the existence of a vibrant marketplace of potential tenants willing to bid up the price on a limited supply of equivalent rental space.but we find no language in the statute,or in any other authority,requiring that a rental loss be avoided solely by offsetting rental revenues.
if the property is sold,other means are available by which the tenant may prove avoidable rental loss.most commonly,if one assumes the income producing property is sold at its fair market value,the sale price is the capitalized value of the reasonable net rental value attributable to the land and existing improvements.the appropriate market capitalization rate could be established by reviewing sales of comparable leased premises.with an assumed
