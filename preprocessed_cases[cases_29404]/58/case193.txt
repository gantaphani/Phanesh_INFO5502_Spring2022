here we hold,among other things,that homeowners associations may adopt reasonable rules and impose fees on its members relating to short term rentals of condominium units.
two owners of one lot in a common interest development and one of two owners of another lot brought an action challenging regulations and fees adopted by the homeowners association.the association against all owners of both lots for fees and declaratory relief.the association prevailed on the complaint and.the trial court also awarded the association statutory attorney fees and costs on the complaint and.as we explain in the unpublished portion of this opinion,the judgment must be clarified so that the attorney fees awarded on the complaint are against plaintiffs only,and not against the who was not a plaintiff.in all other respects,we affirm.

oak shores consists of parcels of land.six hundred sixty parcels are developed with homes.only about percent,to,of the homes are occupied by residents.approximately absentee homeowners rent their homes to vacation renters.

the association against watts and robert burlison,for unpaid fees and fines and for injunctive relief to require to comply with association rules and regulations.at the time of filing,the burlisons owed in unpaid assessments and the wattses owed.the burlisons paid the assessment under protest.at the time of trial,the wattses owed.
the association has a rule stating that the minimum rental period is seven days.the association general manager testified that,based on his discussion with board members,staff and code enforcement officers,as well as his review of gate and patrol logs,renters cause more problems than owners or their guests.the problems include parking,lack of awareness of the rules,noise and use,and abuse of the facilities.expert james smith testified that,unlike guests who are typically present with the owners,renters are never present with the owner.guests tend to be less destructive and less burdensome.renters require greater supervision and increase administrative expenses.
a fee is charged to all owners who rent their homes.a study calculated each rental cost the association per year.
watercraft 
all renters and guests who bring watercraft into oak shores pay a fee of per day or per week.renters and guests are limited to one boat or two personal watercraft.owners and renters do not pay such special fees and are not limited in the number of watercraft they can bring into oak shores.
boats have a negative impact on the association roads.there are also costs of maintaining the docks and parking lot used by the renters and increased costs for code enforcement.
expert smith testified that renters comprise only percent of the people entering the gate,but renters bring in percent of the boats.
parking restrictions 
association rules restrict parking in the lower marina lot to owners on weekends and holidays during the summer months.a lot not much further away is available to all.
construction permits 
the association charges a fee of and a road impact fee of for new construction.expert smith testified that heavy equipment used to construct homes places more wear on the roads and results in greater usage.it is appropriate to consider the need for reserves in determining the amount of the fee.the board president testified that road resurfacing and repair are the basis for the fee.
trash collection fees 
the association contracts with a trash collector.it passes the fees pro rata onto all owners of developed lots.the association does not distinguish between and residences because it is too difficult to make that determination.it does not charge the owners of undeveloped lots because they do not produce trash.
former civil code section 
former section repealed by stats,ch,and reinstated with nonsubstantive changes as,subd.b provided,an association shall not impose or collect an assessment or fee that exceeds the amount necessary to defray the costs for which it is levied.
david levy and travis hickey are certified public accountants.levy testified that the expenses generated by owners who rent short term far exceed the income generated from those owners.he analyzed fees and costs contained in the association financial statements and reserve studies.he concluded the fees charged were reasonable and complied with the law.levy also consulted with the association former auditors.levy and hickey concluded that the fees were reasonable and did not violate former section.levy also testified the fees charged by comparable associations for similar activities were higher or equivalent to fees charged by oak shores.
hickey testified that he is the association former auditor.he studied the fees and consulted with another former auditor.he concluded the fees were fair,reasonable,and in compliance with the law.they do not exceed the costs for which they are levied.no association conducts a formal study to set fees.nor does any association conduct time and motion studies.in fact,time and motion accounting is not possible.
homeowners association expert karen conlon testified the association met the standard of care for giving members notice of rule and fee changes.fee increases can be enacted by adopting a budget for the year.
swimming pool 
the association paid a pool contractor to repair a swimming pool.the contractor absconded with the money without repairing the pool.a former director testified that a former board president wrote a check to the contractor without board approval.expert smith testified it is not typical,nor within the standard of care,for an association to purchase a performance bond.
release and unclean hands 
lynda burlison filed a previous lawsuit against the association.her complaint included an attack on the association cc r,rules and regulations restricting the use of her property for rental purposes.she settled the suit for and the association agreement to accept her suggestions for changes in the rental policies,rules and regulations.as part of the settlement,she executed a release of all claims known or unknown arising out of the complaint.
ken watts has never obtained a business license to rent his home,nor has he paid transient occupancy taxes since at least.he owes at least in back taxes.watts has repeatedly mischaracterized his renters as guests in order to avoid applicable rental rules and regulations.portions of his testimony at trial were demonstrably false.throughout his tenure at oak shores,he has adopted a rancorous,accusatory and obstructionist style of interaction with board members and staff.he has occasionally intimidated staff with bizarre and threatening behavior.
the trial court found for the association on the complaint.the court found lynda burlison had no standing because she had previously released her claims against the association.the court found that the wattses are denied relief under the doctrine of unclean hands.the court determined that,although all the inequitable conduct was committed by ken watts,joyce watts claims are inextricably tied to those of her husband.therefore,joyce watts is also denied relief.the court found that the association rules and regulations are reasonable and comply with the association governing documents and the law,and that the fees charged comply with former section.
the trial court also found for the association on the.it granted the association an injunction ordering the to abide by the rules and regulations.it also granted the association a money judgment against ken and joyce watts in the amount of plus interest for unpaid assessments.
the association moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to former section,subdivision c.in an action to enforce the governing documents,the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs,repealed by stats,ch,and reenacted without substantive changes as,subd.c.the trial court found the association was the prevailing party in its efforts to enforce the governing documents,both as to the complaint and.the trial court awarded for defending the complaint and on the.
discussion 
on appeal,watts does not challenge the trial court findings that lynda burlison must be denied relief because she had previously released the association from liability and that ken and joyce watts are denied relief under the doctrine of unclean hands.watts failure to raise the issues in his opening brief waives the issues on appeal.tisher california horse racing bd.d.because lynda burlison and the wattses are the only plaintiffs,we must affirm the trial court judgment denying any relief under their complaint.we discuss the issues raised on appeal only as they relate to the and the award of attorney fees.
watts contends that the judgment is based on incorrect legal grounds.
watts claims that the rule applying judicial deference to association decisions applies only to ordinary maintenance decisions.but in lamden la jolla shores clubdominium homeowners cal th,our supreme court stated,generally,courts will uphold decisions made by the governing board of an owners association so long as they represent good faith efforts to further the purposes of the common interest development,are consistent with the development governing documents,and comply with the public policy,at,quoting nahrstadt lakeside village condominium,cal th.it is true the facts in lamden involve the association board decision to treat termites locally rather than fumigate.but nothing in lamden limits judicial deference to maintenance decisions.common interest developments are best operated by the board of directors,not the courts.
watts reliance on affan portofino cove homeowners th,is misplaced.there,an owner sued the association for failing to properly maintain the sewer lines.in applying judicial deference,the court stated that the lamden rule gives deference to the reasoned decisionmaking of homeowners association boards concerning ordinary maintenance.affan,at.but there is no reason to read lamden so narrowly.in fact,courts have given deference to board decisions that do not concern ordinary maintenance.thus,for example,in dolan king rancho santa fe th,the court gave deference to an association board decision denying an owner application for a room addition on aesthetic grounds.
article of the cc r gives the board broad powers to adopt rules for oak shores.nothing in the article or elsewhere prohibits the board from adopting rules governing rentals,including fees to help defray the costs such rentals impose on all owners.the board may reasonably decide that all owners should not be required to subsidize watts vacation rental business.
that renters cost the association more than renters or permanent residents is not only supported by the evidence but experience and common sense places the matter beyond debate.renters use the common facilities more intensely they take more staff time in giving directions and information and enforcing the rules and they are less careful in using the common facilities because they are not concerned with the consequences of abuse.
in arguing the cost of rentals must be borne by all members,watts cites california code of regulations,title,section a.that regulation provides,regular assessments to defray expenses attributable to the ownership,operation and furnishing of common interests by the association shall ordinarily be levied against each owner according to the ratio of the number of subdivision interests owned by the owner assessed to the total number of interests subject to assessments.watts reliance on the regulation is misplaced for a number of reasons.first,the regulation applies to subdivision developers.watts cites no authority that it also applies to continuing operations of a common interest development.second,the regulation is qualified by the word ordinarily.ibid.it clearly does not state an immutable rule.third,the regulation applies to r egular assessments.ibid.watts cites no authority that it applies to the type of use fees at issue here.
watts reliance on the association articles of incorporation,article ii,paragraph d,is also misplaced.the paragraph under the heading general purposes states in part to fix and establish the fees,dues and assessments that each member of this corporation shall pay to this corporation for the purpose of providing funds to carry out the community purposes and objects of this corporation,and to receive and collect such fees,dues and assessments.nothing in the paragraph provides that each member shall pay the same amount regardless of his or her activities on the premises.it does confirm,however,the power of the association to impose fees as well as assessments.thus,it confirms the power of the association to impose the type of fees at issue here.
watts reliance on laguna royale owners darger d,laguna royale is misplaced.there,a common interest development was built on a year ground lease.defendants purchased a unit in the development.later,defendants transferred undivided interests to three other families.no more than one family would use the unit at a time and each of the four families agreed to week periods of exclusive use.the ground lease contained a provision prohibiting transfer of the unit without the development association approval.the association refused to approve the transfer on the ground,among others,that use by the four families would place an undue burden on the other owners in their use and enjoyment of their units so as to be inconsistent with their quiet enjoyment and maintenance of security.the trial court invalidated the assignments.the court of appeal reversed.
in reversing,the court of appeal affirmed that the association had the authority to enact reasonable regulations on the use and alienation of the condominiums.laguna royale,supra,d at.the court also determined that the reason given for refusing consent to the transfer is rationally related to the proper operation of the property and purposes of the association,at.the court concluded,however,there was no evidence that consecutive use of the unit by the four families one at a time would be so disruptive as to interfere substantially with the other owners use and enjoyment or the maintenance of security,at.the court pointed out that the association bylaws allowed leasing of a unit for days or more,a use more intense than the weeks excusive use agreed to by each of the four families.ibid.
if anything,laguna royale is favorable to the association.it confirms the authority of the association to enact reasonable regulations governing transfers so as to preserve the owner quiet enjoyment of the premises and the maintenance of security.there was simply no evidence in laguna royale that four week periods of occupation by a single family would have a significant impact on the enjoyment of the premises by other owners or on security.here there is more
