wanting to train for the olympics,klemencic alleges that she entered into an unwritten agreement with crawford whereby she would continue to train with ohio state cross country team.pursuant to that agreement,she would be permitted to train with the women cross country team during the season in exchange for her serving as the team volunteer assistant coach.if ohio state did not agree to those arrangements,crawford agreed to continue as her coach on his own time.
during the summer of,after her eligibility had expired,crawford attempted to establish a romantic relationship with klemencic.she alleges that his romantic overtures,her rejection of those overtures,and her desire to train with the team during led to quid pro quo sexual harassment.in september,after she refused to date crawford,klemencic telephoned him to ask about the training schedule for the cross country team.he allegedly told her that she could not train with the team because of her bad attitude,because she treated him badly and overreacted to his romantic overtures,and because she did not sufficiently train,as was required,over the summer.klemencic admits that crawford offered her the opportunity to take a time trial and that,if she passed the time trial,he would allow her to train with the team.she refused a time trial.klemencic believes that crawford precluded her from training with the team because she refused to date him.
klemencic later complained to ohio state officials that because she would not date crawford,he was not permitting her to train with the cross country team during the season.ohio state athletic director,jones,met with crawford and began an investigation.in the course of his investigation,he met with and admonished crawford,and he placed a letter of reprimand in crawford personnel file.he did not,however,order that klemencic be permitted to train with the track team.he did not believe that she was the caliber of athlete who should be allowed to train with an ohio state team.he believed that crawford job was to train eligible,not ineligible athletes.from the time that klemencic first made contact with jones,she had no further contact with crawford.
in addition to undertaking an investigation,jones provided klemencic with contact information for various individuals who could assist her.he offered her the opportunity to meet with an ohio state athletic sports psychologist,an offer that she accepted.additionally,he provided her with contact information for the athletic department faculty representative and,upon learning that klemencic was considering filing sexual harassment charges against crawford,referred her to ohio state ombudservices department.after conversations with these individuals,and further conversations with jones,klemencic decided to file a sexual harassment complaint against crawford.
in january,klemencic filed a formal sexual harassment complaint with ohio state office of dispute resolution office.the office,in the person of gail,conducted an investigation and concluded that crawford behavior toward klemencic violated ohio state sexual harassment policy.based on that conclusion,recommended that the athletic department keep jones reprimand letter in crawford personnel file for one year,that a copy of that reprimand letter be permanently kept in a file in human resources,and that crawford participate in counseling and a training session on sexual harassment.those recommendations were implemented.additionally,she recommended that klemencic be allowed to train with the team.while the parties dispute whether ever offered klemencic an opportunity to train with the team,it is undisputed that klemencic did not train with the team.
in,klemencic filed this suit in the district court.in an amended complaint,she alleged that ohio state was liable for crawford quid pro quo sexual harassment and for his excluding her from the benefits of the athletic programs at ohio state to which she was entitled.she charged that ohio state,along with jones and crawford in their official capacities,denied her the benefits of and subjected her to discrimination under the educational programs of ohio state on the basis of her sex in violation of title ix of the civil rights act of.additionally,she charged that jones and crawford were liable in their individual capacities under.klemencic also alleged violations of state law,including intentional infliction of emotional distress and sexual harassment.she sought compensatory and punitive damages.

for the first time,in,klemencic began to characterize her complaint as having raised sexually hostile environment claims as well as quid pro quo sexual harassment claims.crawford filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to this newly identified hostile environment claim.he also sought summary judgment on the claim arising from his alleged quid pro quo sexual harassment of klemencic.additionally,as case law interpreting title ix had developed substantially since the court order,ohio state filed a second motion for summary judgment on all liability issues.while these motions were pending,the supreme court issued its decision in gebser lago vista indep.sch,d,which clarified the standard of proof that a plaintiff alleging sexual harassment by a school employee would have to meet before the school could be liable under title ix.
in july,the district court granted crawford motion for summary judgment on the hostile environment claim.it also dismissed klemencic belatedly identified claims of hostile educational environment under title ix against ohio state because plaintiff fails to allege conduct sufficient to establish such a claim.next,the court applied gebser and granted summary judgment to ohio state on klemencic title ix quid pro quo sexual harassment claim.and,third,the court denied crawford motion for summary judgment on the quid pro quo claim.later that same month,a jury returned a verdict in favor of crawford on klemencic quid pro quo sexual harassment claim.
in august,klemencic filed a notice of appeal.in her notice,klemencic appealed only the july order that granted summary judgment for ohio state on her title ix claim.she did not appeal the jury verdict in favor of crawford on the quid pro quo sexual harassment claim or the district court grant of summary judgment to crawford on the hostile environment claim.in response to klemencic notice of appeal,ohio state filed a motion to dismiss klemencic appeal on the ground that the final judgments in favor of crawford on klemencic quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile environment claims rendered the question of ohio state li
