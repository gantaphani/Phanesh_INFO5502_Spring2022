facts and procedural background 
slender summary judgment motion 
on december,jamgotchian filed a complaint against slender and mark glatt,jkg trainer,for trespass to chattels and injunctive relief based on allegations that they raced jkg against his express instructions.an amended complaint was filed on january.on september,slender filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that jamgotchian could not establish the elements of trespass to chattels and slender had immunity under government code section.on november,jamgotchian filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment on the grounds that slender acted outside his authority,intentionally interfered with jamgotchian possession of jkg,and no immunity applied.
the undisputed evidence submitted in connection with the summary judgment pleadings showed the following facts.slender has been a racing steward appointed by the california horse racing board chrb for more than years.jamgotchian is licensed by the chrb and owns more than thoroughbred race horses,including jkg.
in august,jamgotchian and glatt discussed potential races for jkg.they preferred a race scheduled to be held at del mar on august.their second choice was a stakes race in seattle,washington on august,for which jkg had been nominated.their third choice was a stakes race at del mar on september.their fourth choice was a race scheduled to be held at del mar on august.
on august,glatt went to the racing secretary office and spoke with assistant racing secretary rick hammerle.glatt explained that he wanted to enter jkg in the august race,but the race did not yet have enough horses entered to go forward.he asked about conditionally entering jkg in the august race.
the deadline to request to withdraw a horse from a race is called the scratch time.the scratch time for the august race was on august.in general,after the scratch time has passed,a horse may not be entered in another race unless the horse is excused from the first race by the stewards.however,a horse may be scratched from a race and entered into a stakes race without obtaining the permission of the stewards.glatt would not know whether the august race was going forward before the scratch time for the august race.
in order to get race cards filled and generate additional revenue for the racetrack and the horsemen,it is a practice of the racing secretary office to solicit and accept provisional entries that allow the licensee to scratch a horse from the race.the racing secretary is a del mar track official and not a chrb employee.the racing secretary office does not represent the chrb.however,when the racing secretary office has accepted a provisional entry,the stewards routinely permit the licensee to scratch the horse.
hammerle told glatt that the racing secretary office would contact the stewards and make arrangements for a provisional entry.if the august race did not fill,then jkg would stay in the august race.hammerle did not contact the stewards,because he did not think the august,race had any chance of going forward.if it did fill,hammerle felt confident that he could explain the situation to the stewards and persuade them to scratch jkg on the entry day in favor of the later race.therefore,the conditional entry was not discussed with or approved by any of the stewards.
on august,slender was one of three stewards on the board of stewards which supervised the horse racing meeting at the track.he was the duty steward,which meant he reported early and was responsible for handling entries and scratches before the other stewards arrived.
at,jamgotchian told glatt that he wanted jkg withdrawn from the august race in order to enter jkg in the stakes race in seattle.glatt called and spoke to slender to request a scratch of jkg from the race.glatt said jkg had no physical infirmities and was sound and fit to race.
slender stated we are not going to allow any horse owner to control our business.you obligated to run.if you do not race the horse,you are being threatened with a suspension of your license.glatt responded with disbelief and tried to explain the situation slender was putting him in,but slender was steadfast in his decision.
at,jamgotchian spoke to racing secretary tom robbins.another horse had already scratched from the august race and robbins wanted to keep the race intact as best he could,but robbins found jamgotchian reasons for withdrawing jkg compelling.robbins agreed to tell the stewards that the racing office would find the scratch acceptable,but he warned jamgotchian that it was the stewards decision whether to scratch the horse.
at,robbins called slender.robbins explained the arrangement discussed between glatt and hammerle.he also explained that although the august,race had failed to fill,jamgotchian and glatt still wanted to scratch jkg in order to run in a race the following weekend in seattle.he told slender that the racing department would find it acceptable if the stewards withdrew jkg.slender responded that jkg would be running in the august race.robbins told jamgotchian that slender would not permit a scratch.
jamgotchian and glatt called slender again.based on information from glatt,jamgotchian told slender that jkg had an injured heel that would be better with a few more days of rest.jkg was coming off the veterinarian list for a similar injury.slender responded that the horse was obligated to race,he would not permit a veterinarian scratch because glatt had told him earlier that the horse was fine,the horse was ready to run,and slender had ordered her to run.jamgotchian explained the myriad reasons why he believed the posted scratch time did not apply,insisted that the horse was not going to race at del mar that day,and stated that he would remove jkg from the del mar grounds before the race.
slender told glatt that if he did not saddle and race jkg that day,he would be immediately fined and immediately have his trainer license suspended for a period of to days.glatt told slender that any suspension would effectively put him out of business.slender said that he would immediately fine jamgotchian and suspend his owner racing license,as well as bar all of his horses from racing anywhere in california,which would effectively put jamgotchian racehorse operation out of business in california.as a licensee,jamgotchian was aware that a steward acting alone may not lawfully impose punishment.even acting as a board,the board of stewards may not impose a fine or suspension on a licensee without first conducting a full and impartial hearing with a court reporter,providing the licensee with notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard.jamgotchian told slender that he was being unfair to glatt and asked that slender not fine or suspend glatt,because jamgotchian had made the determination to scratch the horse.slender repeated his threats.slender told glatt that race track security would not permit the horse to leave the grounds.
slender told the other stewards on the board that jamgotchian wanted to run jkg in a stakes race in seattle.he did not tell them that the horse had been conditionally entered in a race later in the week at del.he did not tell them that the racing secretary had called him and said the racing department would find it acceptable if the stewards scratched the horse because of the provisional entry.he told them that he said there would possibly be a penalty imposed if glatt did not run the horse.the stewards discussed the request,found no valid reason to scratch jkg,and unanimously voted that the horse was obligated to race under california code of regulations,title,section 
at about,slender called chrb investigator douglas aschenbrenner and asked him to prevent jamgotchian from taking jkg off the del mar grounds.slender told aschenbrenner that jamgotchian wanted to scratch jkg and run the horse somewhere else,but he did not want that.slender said to go to the barn to make sure the horse did not leave the grounds.aschenbrenner asked,how far do you want me to go with this slender paused and said,we want the horse to race.aschenbrenner asked,george,why do you just let him scratch and fine him the was the typical fine imposed by the stewards for a late scratch.slender replied,no.i going to suspend him for days.aschenbrenner told slender that the investigators do normally get involved with that,but he would go to the barn.slender instructed him to make sure that the horse was raced.
aschenbrenner went to the barn to confirm that the horse was still stabled at del.after aschenbrenner left the barn,he contacted the security guard at the gate to ensure that the horse did not leave the del mar grounds,in accordance with slender instructions.he also asked the racetrack staff to post a security guard at glatt barn.
jamgotchian and glatt decided that in order to protect glatt from a potentially devastating suspension,jamgotchian would terminate glatt,effective immediately.jamgotchian called trainer peter miller.miller has the use of a trailer and occasionally hauls his own horses.jamgotchian asked miller to pick up jkg,take her to san luis rey downs,and train her.
at noon,jamgotchian called glatt and said,i officially terminating you,and i going to be having a van company come and pick my horse up.he faxed glatt a notice of termination,effective immediately,which stated that he was making arrangements to have jkg shipped out of del mar immediately.jamgotchian faxed a copy of glatt termination notice to the stewards.glatt accepted the termination and agreed to prepare jkg for departure from the del mar grounds.once a trainer is terminated,the trainer insurance no longer covers the jockey or other employees of the trainer.however,the stewards refused to recognize the termination and transfer jkg from glatt to another trainer.
miller spoke to jamgotchian and said he could not pick up jkg until the following day.jamgotchian explained that he needed miller to pick up jkg because he had fired glatt.
at,jamgotchian sent a fax to several people,including chrb assistant executive director roy minami,the stewards,and glatt,informing them that jkg would not run in the race that day and threatening to commence litigation if the horse was raced against his authority.he stated that he was going to remove jkg,as well as all of his other horses,from the property.no one responded to jamgotchian faxes and telephone calls.
two chrb investigators were posted at the barn at to make sure the horse did not leave the barn.a race security person was also posted at the barn.glatt believed race track security was not going to allow the horse to be shipped off the grounds and would not have allowed the horse out of the gate if an attempt had been made.
at,glatt told jamgotchian that slender had placed a chrb investigator and a security guard in front of jkg stall to prevent jamgotchian from removing the horse.glatt also told him that the guard would not allow anyone into the stall.glatt said he had decided to cooperate with slender and would not remove jkg from the stall or deliver her to the van that jamgotchian had hired to retrieve the horse.
at,jamgotchian faxed a letter to the stewards stating that he had learned from glatt that jkg would not be allowed to leave del.he asked to make arrangements to have the horse removed within the hour.at,jamgotchian faxed a letter to the stewards again requesting permission to scratch jkg from the race and to remove her from del.he received no response to the faxes or to telephone messages.
when a horse that glatt trains is racing,his employees are told which race the horse is in and they take it upon themselves to prepare the horse.around,in the ordinary course of business,a groom employed by glatt removed jkg from her stall and took her to the receiving barn where the horses are identified,and then to the paddock to be prepared to race.
miller arranged for a commercial van company to pick up the horse.jamgotchian called glatt at and said he had arranged for a shipping company to pick up the horse.at,he sent a fax to the stewards stating that he had a shipping company waiting to pick up jkg and remove her from the del mar grounds,but no one had contacted him and authorized her to leave.he pleaded for someone to contact him so that he could get his horse immediately.
at,glatt saddled jkg in the paddock.at,jkg raced.miller saw jkg run the race.afterward,miller saw jkg get on the van,which took the horse to miller barn at san luis rey downs.running in the race injured jkg front foot and caused her to be lame.
the trial court denied slender motion for summary judgment on the grounds that he had no authority to take control and run the horse,and no immunity applied,because slender had acted outside the powers entrusted to his discretion.
additional proceedings 
on november,slender filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that jamgotchian failed to comply with the claim presentation requirement of the government claims act,et.jamgotchian filed an opposition to the motion for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that slender was an independent contractor,and the claim presentation requirements therefore did not apply.slender filed an amended motion for judgment on the pleadings adding an argument that jamgotchian had failed to allege exhaustion of administrative remedies.the trial court granted the amended motion for judgment on the pleadings and granted jamgotchian leave to amend the complaint to allege compliance with the available administrative remedy.jamgotchian filed a second amended complaint,which included allegations that he had exhausted his administrative remedies.
on may,jamgotchian filed a motion for summary adjudication on the issue of liability based on facts that the trial court found to be undisputed in ruling on slender motion for summary judgment.on june,slender filed a second motion for summary judgment on the ground that jamgotchian failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and failed to present a claim.
slender opposed jamgotchian motion for summary adjudication on the grounds that the trial court could not grant summary adjudication without ruling on slender motion for summary judgment based on affirmative defenses to liability and triable issues of fact existed as to whether slender intentionally interfered with jamgotchian use or possession of his horse.
jamgotchian opposed slender motion for summary judgment on the grounds that he exhausted his administrative remedies and slender was an independent contractor not subject to the government claims act.
the following additional evidence was submitted in connection with jamgotchian summary adjudication motion and slender second motion for summary judgment.
slender submitted his declaration stating in pertinent part that he never ordered glatt to race the horse and never threatened glatt with immediate discipline without a hearing,because he was aware that he did not have the legal authority to do so.when the stewards received the notification of glatt termination,they unanimously agreed not to grant a transfer of jkg.instead,glatt would remain as the official trainer of record for jkg and shared the legal obligation to race the horse.in the early afternoon,glatt told slender that jamgotchian intended to send a crew to remove jkg from the premises.slender had the impression that glatt was worried about a confrontation.to prevent a confrontation and ensure the orderly conduct of the race meeting,slender requested a chrb investigator stand watch outside jkg barn.however,he never instructed the investigator or anyone else to prevent jamgotchian from removing his horse from the race track.slender did not learn until after the race that jamgotchian claimed to have an agreement with the racing secretary for a conditional entry that allowed him to scratch his horse after the deadline had passed.he never threatened to fine or suspend jamgotchian.
after glatt termination,he consulted with his attorney,steve sobel.sobel called fermin,slender and others to intercede on glatt behalf between noon and slender submitted glatt declaration in opposition to jamgotchian motion for summary adjudication stating that glatt called jamgotchian in the morning on august,to tell him that the race they wanted was not going to go forward.jamgotchian wanted jkg scratched from the august race.glatt said he would have to get a veterinarian scratch,which jamgotchian did not want.jamgotchian said he would call the stewards and obtain a scratch.however,jamgotchian called glatt back and said that the stewards would not let him scratch jkg without a valid reason.glatt called slender to facilitate a compromise.jamgotchian was a new client for glatt who owned many horses and glatt goal was to foster a relationship with jamgotchian.he learned for the first time that jamgotchian had previously nominated jkg to run in a stakes race in washington.at the time that jamgotchian sought to scratch jkg,the horse had not been entered to race in the stakes race in washington.slender denied the request to scratch jkg,said glatt was obligated to run jkg and if he did not,he would be suspended for to days.glatt called jamgotchian,but they could not think of a solution.jamgotchian called back and engaged glatt and slender in a telephone conference call.slender remained firm in his decision.glatt,hammerle,and jamgotchian also had a telephone conference call.hammerle refused to intercede on jamgotchian behalf.robbins was intermittently on the call.robbins never agreed that a scratch of jkg was appropriate.when jamgotchian called glatt to terminate his services,he told glatt that he would have jkg shipped back to his care in a week.based on the threat of suspension,the directive of the stewards to race jkg and the advice of sobel,glatt had his staff prepare jkg for the august,race.he never personally removed jkg from her stall and never delivered jkg to slender at the receiving barn on august.glatt did not receive the written termination notice or any of jamgotchian faxes until after the race.
after a hearing on august,the trial court denied jamgotchian motion for summary adjudication.the court found there was no evidence that slender personally took jkg from her stable,prepared her for the race and delivered her to the racing barn,or that anyone did so under slender control and authority.the court found ample evidence to doubt the efficacy of glatt termination,and therefore,could not find that glatt was no longer jamgotchian agent when he delivered jkg to the racing barn.even if the termination were effective,there was no undisputed evidence from which to conclude that glatt was slender agent.the court also found that the posting of guards by slender with instructions to stop jamgotchian or jamgotchian agents from taking jkg from the inclosure was arguably wrong,assuming for purposes of argument that he did so.but it did not result in any actionable harm because a no attempt was made to remove jkg from the inclosure before the race,and b neither jamgotchian nor any employee was physically restrained from removing jkg by any of the posted guards.the trial court concluded that jamgotchian had failed to show that there was no substantial controversy as to the cause of action for trespass to chattel.
the trial court denied slender motion for summary judgment.the court found that jamgotchian had appealed the stewards decision and exhausted administrative remedies.moreover,slender was an independent contractor and not an employee to whom the claims presentation requirement attached.
the trial court addressed the immunity issue raised in the parties briefs while the court continues to hold that the statutes and rules do not authorize a steward to take physical possession of a race horse,the court is now prepared to find that slender did not take possession of jkg,and,in addition,is further disposed to find a that glatt was not acting as slender agent at any time,b that glatt actions are not imputable to slender on some theory of duress or compulsion,and c that slender,by posting guards at the stable,did not prevent jamgotchian from taking jkg out of the inclosure before the race.instead,on this record,the court funds that slender did no more than he was authorized to do a he denied jamgotchian request to declare jkg,and b he threatened both jamgotchian and glatt with fines and suspensions if jkg did not run in the seventh race.on its own motion,then,the court reconsiders the question of slender immunity under business and professions code section,subdivision b.the court put the issue on calendar for a hearing and allowed the parties to brief the issue of whether slender actions were within his delegated powers.
in response to the trial court request for briefing,glatt submitted a supplemental declaration stating that when he told slender that jamgotchian had fired him as jkg trainer,slender ordered and directed him to saddle and race jamgotchian horse.glatt also submitted sobel declaration.sobel declared that after he spoke to glatt,he spoke to slender on glatt behalf.he explained that glatt was caught in the middle of the dispute and jamgotchian had threatened to sue him if he saddled the horse for the race and the horse raced.sobel reiterated to slender that jamgotchian had fired glatt as his trainer.slender responded with words to the effect of tell mark to lead the horse over and we take care of him.sobel told glatt that slender had said to lead the horse over and he would be taken care of by the stewards.
on october,the trial court found that glatt,not slender,took possession of the horse,and therefore,slender could not be liable for trespass to chattels.the court granted the motion for summary judgment on this ground and expressly denied the motion on all other grounds.the court entered judgment in favor of slender on december.jamgotchian filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.in the trial court,once a moving defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue to meet that burden,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action merrill navegar,cal th,d.
ii.immunity 
slender contends he has immunity for his actions,because they were an exercise of his authority under the horse racing regulations.we disagree,because there is a disputed issue of fact as to whether slender actions were within his discretionary authority under the ccr.
immunity under the government claims act 
the government claims act restates a public employee traditional immunity for discretionary acts in government code section,which provides that e xcept as otherwise provided by statute,a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him,whether or not such discretion be abused.
because of the special needs of government and public service,the government claims act expressly allows public employees to engage in certain acts and omissions free of suit,even when they might otherwise be liable for causing injury or violating individual rights.among the statutory protections afforded is the immunity for discretionary acts,which leaves public offici
