we have carefully reviewed the appellee timely petition for rehearing en banc requesting that we reconsider our previous opinion dated june,published at,reversing the judgment of the district court and remanding the case.upon reconsideration of that opinion,we vacate our prior opinion and substitute the following revised opinion in its place.
the issue before the court is whether the district court erred when it refused to vacate a florida state court order enjoining appellant tampa sports authority the authority policy of conducting searches of all ticket holders seeking to attend tampa bay buccaneers the buccaneers games at the raymond james stadium in tampa,florida the stadium.we conclude that appellee gordon johnston consented to the searches.the district court thus erred in not reconsidering and vacating the preliminary injunction.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in september,the authority instituted a policy requiring brief searches of all persons attending buccaneers football games.johnston is a buccaneers season ticket subscriber who first became a season ticket holder in.the season ticket is,on its face,a revocable license for entry to the stadium to attend buccaneers games.
the stadium is operated by the authority,a florida public entity.the authority grants the buccaneers,a franchise of the national football league the nfl,use of the stadium pursuant to a stadium agreement the agreement.the agreement provides that the authority remains responsible for stadium security during buccaneers games,and obligates the authority to make proper rules and regulations for use of the stadium with regard to all stadium events,provided,however,that the content of such rules and regulations shall be reasonably consistent with the rules and regulations enacted for other nfl stadia 
in february,the nfl first implemented a policy requiring searches for super bowl xxvii and other special events.in august,the nfl commissioner expanded the policy to require searches of all patrons entering nfl stadiums.the nfl requires the policy to protect members of the public who attend nfl games.the nfl concluded that nfl stadiums are attractive terrorist targets based on the publicity that would be generated by an attack at an nfl game the search policy focuses on the detection of improvised explosive devices ied which might be carried on a person entering a stadium.these searches currently are conducted at all nfl events except at the stadium,where they have been enjoined.
on august,the buccaneers informed the authority of the searches as a condition for admission to nfl events.on september,the authority,upon the urging of representatives from the nfl and the buccaneers,approved a policy to conduct limited searches of all persons attending buccaneers football games.the authority does not require searches for patrons attending its other events at the stadium,including university of south florida football games.
the searches are conducted by outside screeners hired by the authority.the authority and the buccaneers share the expense of the screeners and the authority oversees how the searches are conducted 
consistent with the policy urged by the nfl,the searches at the stadium focus on the detection of ieds.at each admission gate,screeners ask people entering the stadium to hold their arms out to their side,palms up.screeners inspect the individual for wires,detonators or other telltale signs of an ied.screeners then run their hands lightly along the sides of the torso and down the spine.if the individual skin is exposed,screeners do not make contact with it.if the individual has large pockets,the screener may ask him to empty them for review of any items.female inspectors conduct searches on females,and male inspectors inspect males.anyone who refuses to be patted down is denied entry to the stadium.
johnston was aware of the policy before the first game of the season press releases announcing the initiation of the policy were published in the media,on the buccaneers website and in a direct communication to season ticket holders.stadium employees distributed notices about the policy to cars entering the stadium parking lot before games.announcements were made over loudspeakers outside of the stadium before games,advising those who approached the stadium that would be conducted at the entrances.multiple signs were placed along common walking routes,including those from parking areas to the stadium,announcing the policy.
johnston called the buccaneers office before the first game of the season to discuss the search policy.johnston objected to the policy,and claims that he was told that the buccaneers would not refund the cost of season tickets based solely on his objections.he stated later he would not have accepted a refund even if offered.having been advised of the policy,johnston nonetheless presented himself and his ticket at an entrance to the stadium on three occasions.on each occasion,a screener advised johnston that a search would be performed.johnston verbally objected to the but allowed it to be conducted so that he could attend the games.after attending the second game,johnston sued the authority in state court seeking to enjoin the searches.johnston attended a third game after filing suit,and,after offering his objection,he again submitted to a search.after the third game,the florida state court enjoined the searches,and johnston attended subsequent games without being subjected to the search.
ii.prior proceedings 
on october,johnston filed suit against the authority and henry saavedra in the circuit court for the thirteenth judicial circuit of florida.johnston challenged the constitutionality of the searches under the florida constitution.johnston sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the searches.on november,the state court found the searches unconstitutional under the florida constitution and entered a preliminary injunction halting the searches.
the authority appealed the ruling,and the preliminary injunction automatically was stayed under florida rule of appellate procedure b.johnston moved the thirteenth judicial circuit of florida to vacate the automatic stay.his motion was denied.johnston filed an emergency motion with the florida second district court of appeals to vacate the stay.on november,the second district court of appeals granted johnston motion and vacated the stay,thus reinstating the preliminary injunction halting the searches.
on november,johnston amended his complaint to add a claim pursuant to that the searches violated the fourth amendment to the united states constitution.on november,the authority removed the case to the united states district court for the middle district of florida.on december,the authority moved the district court to reconsider and vacate the injunction issued by the state court,pursuant to.e.the district court denied the motion,finding that johnston did not consent to the searches and that the searches violated the florida constitution and the fourth amendment to the united states constitution.this appeal followed.
iii.standard of review 
after removal,orders issued by the state court are considered orders of the district court.jackson am.sav.mortgage,cir.we review a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.cumulus media,clear channel commc ns,cir.if we determine the district court abused its discretion by misapprehending or misapplying the law,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and the district court legal conclusions de novo.id.at horton city of augustine,cir.
iv.discussion 
as the district court observed,this case is not about the wisdom of the policy,whether the average buccaneers fan supports or objects to the searches,or whether a judge believes the are wise.johnston tampa sports,d.the issue in this case is whether johnston has shown a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of his claim that the searches violate his rights under the constitutions of florida and the united states.
the district court analyzed whether to vacate the injunction under our standards for granting a preliminary injunction.a party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate that he has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits irreparable injury will be suffered absent an injunction the injury to the movant outweighs the injury the proposed injunction would cause to the opposing party and the proposed injunction would serve the public interest.klay united healthgroup,cir internal quotations omitted.the district court found that johnston had met his burden in showing a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his constitutional claims and that the preliminary injunction would serve the public interest.johnston,d at.we find that the district court abused its discretion by misapplying the consent exception to warrantless searches,and we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.
johnston asserts that the searches at issue are invalid under both the florida and united states constitutions.in evaluating johnston claim under the florida constitution,we are compelled to apply the facts of this case to florida constitutional law as interpreted by the florida supreme court,and,absent a contrary ruling by the florida supreme court,florida intermediate appellate courts.mcmahan toto,cir,cert.denied,nemesis veritas,toto,d pardo state,so d,the decisions of the district courts of appeal represent the law of florida unless and until they are overruled by this court.internal quotation marks omitted.
article i,section of the florida constitution and the fourth amendment to the united states constitution afford protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.const.amend.iv as the text of the florida constitution search and seizure provision explains,the florida constitution affords the same protections against unreasonable searches and seizures as the fourth amendment,and florida courts follow opinions of the united states supreme court in interpreting the florida constitution search and seizure protections.state peterson,so d,cert.denied,d this court is bound to follow the opinions of the united states supreme court concerning fourth amendment search and seizure issues.our analysis of johnston claims under the fourth amendment therefore applies equally to johnston claims under the florida constitution.
the united states supreme court has consistently held that under the fourth amendment a search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is per se unreasonable subject only to a few specifically established and exceptions.schneckloth bustamonte,d quoting katz united states,d accord united states santa,cir.it is equally well settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search that is conducted pursuant to consent.schneckloth,at.accord state iaccarino,so d.
whether consent is voluntary is a fact question determined according to the totality of the circumstances.schneckloth,at iaccarino,so d at united states blake,cir.consent is determined on a basis.blake,at united states garcia,cir.both the federal and florida courts have enumerated lists of factors to be considered in performing the analysis.we have previously identified the following factors to consider in determining voluntariness whether the person is in custody,the existence of coercion,the person awareness of his right to refuse consent,the person education and intelligence,and whether the person believes incriminating evidence will be found.blake,at quoting united states chemaly,cir.florida courts look for the existence of express or implied consent and consider the following implied consent factors whether the defendant was aware his conduct would subject him to search whether the search was supported by a vital interest whether the searching officer had apparent authority to search and arrest whether the defendant was advised of his right to refuse and whether refusal would result in a deprivation of a benefit or right.iaccarino,so d at.consent is not voluntary if the government conditions receipt of a right or a benefit on the relinquishment of a constitutional right.bourgeois peters,cir citing adams james,cir iaccarino,so d at.
for the purposes of our analysis of whether this warrantless search was unconstitutional under the united states and florida constitutions,we accept the district court conclusion that the search was performed by agents of the state.johnston,d at.the question then is whether the district court abused its discretion in misapplying the consent exception to the facts of this case.we hold that johnston voluntarily consented to the searches and thus has not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits 
johnston knew well in advance that he would be subjected to a search by the authority if he presented himself at an entrance to the stadium to be admitted to a buccaneers game.that is,he chose to submit voluntarily to the search on two occasions,stating only a verbal objection followed by his submission to the search process and his ultimate entry into the stadium to watch buccaneers football games.
the factors we enumerated in united states blake demonstrate the voluntariness of johnston consent.johnston was not in custody at the time of the search,rather,he presented himself willingly at the search point.the screeners did not coerce johnston,they merely performed the search to which johnston submitted.johnston was well aware of his right to refuse to submit to the search and did in fact express his objection to the searches to specific screeners and over the telephone to the buccaneers before the searches were implemented.at the search point,johnston pulled his shirt up apparently to show that he was not wearing an ied and asked not to be patted down.when screeners insisted on the before permitting johnston to enter,johnston elected to be patted down and thereby gain entrance to the stadium.johnston appears from the record to be a man of heightened intelligence and.the record shows he did not believe that the search would disclose incriminating evidence,as shown by his attempt to show screeners he was not carrying any suspicious devices under his shirt.
johnston also impliedly consented to the search under the factors for implied consent developed by florida courts.johnston was his insistence in entering the stadium would cause him to be subject to a search.the record also reflects that johnston was aware of his ability to refuse to be searched and leave the stadium.there is no evidence that the authority would have detained johnston if he refused,or that johnston otherwise believed the searches to be compulsory.
we also conclude the searches supported a vital interest.the nfl and the buccaneers instituted the policy specifically to guard against mass casualties at nfl games from a potential terrorist attack.we can not doubt the nfl interest in protecting its patrons.unlike the searches for drugs,bottles,and cans considered in iaccarino,so d at,the searches in this case supported an interest well beyond general law enforcement.the nfl quite clearly instituted the policy with the intent of preventing terrorist attacks and ensuring the safety of persons in the stadium.see id.at we agree that the interest in protecting the performers from projectiles is a vital interest that would justify a search for those items which could be used as projectiles.
the district court found that the consent exception did not apply in this case,in part,because of the unconstitutional condition doctrine developed by federal and florida courts.the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions prohibits terminating benefits,though not classified as entitlements,if the termination is based on motivations that other constitutional provisions proscribe.adams,at accord bourgeois,at this is a classic unconstitutional condition,in which the government conditions receipt of a benefit or privilege on the relinquishment of a constitutional right.iaccarino,so d at.the district court erred in its application of the unconstitutional condition doctrine because in this case the condition for entry was imposed by the nfl and the bucc
