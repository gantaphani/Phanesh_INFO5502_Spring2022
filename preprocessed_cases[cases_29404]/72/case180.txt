factual and procedural summary 
on march,lyons and roy were both guests at the westin maui hotel in hawaii.they met at the hotel pool,where they chatted for several hours.lyons claimed that roy made several references to her large breasts,and to how everybody loves to see them.and i f you are a good boy,maybe you will.when roy left the pool area to return to her room,lyons accompanied her.
after they both got off the elevator on the sixth floor,lyons asked roy to show him her breasts.according to lyons,roy said she was afraid of being observed in the hall.lyons took her by the wrist and led her to an alcove near the elevator,where he repeated his request,stating,y ou know,you been wanting to do this all day so let just move over here.roy declined because of concern that her husband might come by.according to lyons,he then walked roy to the door of her room and returned to the pool area.he denied any physical contact with roy,other than having held her wrist when outside the elevator.
roy had a different version of the events.according to her,lyons sexually attacked her in the alcove,shoved her against a vending machine,partially removed her clothes,exposed himself,and tried to force her to perform a sexual act.roy reported the alleged assault to hotel security and the local police,both of which investigated the matter.because of significant inconsistencies in roy story such as initially claiming the incident occurred at the swimming pool,the lack of any observable injuries to her,and hotel guests who saw roy flaunting her body while she was at the pool,the investigating police detective determined that the entire episode was nothing more than a scam on roy part to gain money.no criminal charges were filed.
in march of,roy sued lyons alleging causes of action for assault,battery,and false imprisonment and seeking damages for bodily injury and emotional distress.lyons tendered the defense of the action to his homeowners insurer,fire insurance.fire insurance denied coverage on the ground that the allegations in roy complaint did not meet the fundamental requirement for potential coverage under its policy because none of the damages were caused by an accident.
lyons initially retained his own defense counsel,but ultimately another insurer,to whom the defense had also been tendered,began to provide a defense under a reservation of rights.on the eve of trial,lyons,roy,and the other insurance carrier negotiated a settlement.as part of the settlement,roy and lyons agreed to entry of a stipulated judgment in the amount of,which provided in part that the settlement agreement did not constitute an admission by any of the parties of the truth of any of the released claims.
of the obligation under the settlement,lyons paid.the other insurance carrier paid.roy then sued fire insurance for the remainder as a judgment creditor pursuant to insurance code section,and fire insurance settled that case with an indemnity payment to roy of.
in october of,lyons filed the present action against fire insurance,alleging causes of action for breach of contract and tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.fire insurance moved for summary judgment on the ground that it owed no duty to defend or indemnify lyons because his alleged acts were not accidental,but rather were intentional and thus did not fall within the policy provisions.absent a duty to defend or indemnify,fire insurance maintained it could not have committed insurance bad faith.
fire insurance moved in the alternative for summary adjudication of the cause of action for tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the claim for damages.regarding the bad faith claim,fire insurance urged that it acted reasonably in denying coverage and that at all times there was a genuine dispute as to whether it owed lyons a duty to defend or indemnify.as to the punitive damages claim,fire insurance argued that lyons had not provided clear and convincing evidence that fire insurance had acted with the requisite malice,fraud,or oppression in responding to his claim.
lyons countered with his own motion for summary adjudication.he urged that fire insurance owed a duty to defend because the policy potentially covered roy cause of action for false imprisonment.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of fire insurance and denied the motion by lyons for summary adjudication.the court found,in pertinent part,that there was no possibility of coverage for the grabbing and pulling of roy wrist to take her to the alcove in the hallway of the hotel because grabbing a person wrist is not an accident.also,grabbing roy wrist was an intentional act,even if done under a mistaken belief by lyons that he had a right to do so,and thus the conduct is excluded from coverage.
