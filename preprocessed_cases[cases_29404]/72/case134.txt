in this diversity case governed by kansas tort law,sfx motor sports,sfx,appeals the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol.sfx argues that a reasonable jury could not have found sfx liable for wanton conduct based on its staging of an august motorcycle race in which arthur wagner,wagner,crashed and was seriously injured.wagner,arguing that the district court erred in reducing his damages award pursuant to kansas statutory cap on noneconomic damages in personal injury actions.exercising appellate jurisdiction under,we reverse the denial of sfx motion for jmol and dismiss wagner as moot.
factual and procedural background 
on august,wagner competed in the formula usa team challenge endurance race at the heartland park racetrack in topeka,kansas.sfx staged the race pursuant to its track rental agreement with heartland park raceway,llc,to which jayhawk racing properties,had assigned its rights to operate the track in order to participate in the august race,wagner had signed,the day before,two documents entitled release and waiver of liability,assumption of risk,indemnity and rights agreement.vol.at.the first release and waiver,for which,ks served as the d escription and location of scheduled event s,provided as follows

vol.at.the second release and waiver,indicating formula usa testing as the description and location of scheduled events,included identical provisions.id.at.
in addition to signing their releases and waivers on the day before the race,wagner and other racers participated in practice sessions on the heartland park track.during those practice sessions,two riders had to leave the track in the area of corner one rider had run out of fuel,and the other had a mechanical problem with his motorcycle.both motorcycles had to be pushed off the track.
during the race itself,on august,wagner was entering corner and leaning into the curve when the wheels of his motorcycle hit a rumble strip,or berm,on the outside edge of the track.wagner motorcycle left the track,wagner still between and feet across a grass and dirt runoff area before colliding with an unpadded portion of a moveable concrete barrier.the motorcycle burst into flames that engulfed wagner,who was thrown into the grass.
throughout the race,including at the time of wagner crash,the track turns were staffed by corner workers,who were to act as flaggers to inform racers to proceed with caution or to stop altogether in the event of an accident,and who also were to serve as emergency responders to aid downed racers.corner workers were provided colored flags,radios with which they were to communicate with the control tower and with other corner workers,and a fire extinguisher.in roughly meetings on the mornings of august and august,the corner workers had been instructed,at minimum,when to use the radio system and what color flags they should wave in the event of an accident.
corner was staffed by a married couple,randy and linda bodtke,whom sfx had hired through a temporary employment services agency.like other corner workers at the race,the bodtkes were positioned on the inside of their corner,behind a barrier that separated and protected them from the riders on the track.when wagner crashed on the outside of the track,therefore,the bodtkes and other corner workers had to wait for race traffic to clear,climb over the short wall separating them from the track,and cross the track in order to reach him.
although linda bodtke radioed the control tower and began waving her red and yellow flags when she saw the accident,the racers temporarily continued circling the track at race speed.after the last motorcycle cleared their area,randy bodtke and the worker at corner climbed over the barrier,crossed the track,and reached wagner.both carried their fire extinguishers to the crash scene.the worker from corner arrived first randy bodtke believed he arrived within a minute of the crash.both randy bodtke and the worker from corner sprayed their fire extinguishers on the grass around wagner,and one or the other may also have sprayed his fire extinguisher on wagner back.the corner workers had been instructed not to spray fire extinguishers in a crash victim face they had also been instructed not to touch or move a crash victim until emergency personnel arrived.
an ambulance and a fire suppression truck responded to the crash scene.however,both vehicles had to wait for a gate to be opened before they could drive onto the infield of the track.emergency personnel attended to wagner and placed him on a backboard,and at some point during this process,an unidentified individual called for the helicopter.roughly minutes after the crash,wagner arrived,by that helicopter,at the ku medical center.he was treated for multiple fractures and for serious burns over most of his lower extremities and one hand,and he was hospitalized for several weeks after the accident.
on august,wagner,who at the time resided in florida,filed a diversity lawsuit in federal district court for the district of kansas,pleading negligence and wanton conduct as alternative theories of recovery under kansas law.wagner named as defendants sfx heartland park raceway,sfx entertainment,clear channel communications,and jayhawk racing properties,following discovery,and based on the release and waiver forms that wagner had signed before the race,the district court granted sfx and heartland park partial summary judgment on wagner negligence claims.the court granted full summary judgment to the remaining defendants,because the record contained no evidence from which a jury might conclude that they owed any duty to wagner.the case thus went to trial solely against sfx and heartland park,and solely on a theory of wanton conduct under kansas law 
the parties consented to disposition of the case by the magistrate judge,and after a trial over which he presided,the jury returned a verdict in favor of heartland park and against sfx.the jury awarded wagner roughly million in compensatory damages.following entry of judgment in accordance with the jury verdict,sfx moved under.b for jmol based on a claim of insufficient evidence to support a jury finding of wanton conduct under rule a for a new trial,based on a claim of the court error in not instructing the jury on comparative fault principles or on the distinction between negligence and wanton conduct and under rule e for alteration or amendment of the judgment,based on kansas statutory cap of on noneconomic damages in a personal injury action.
the district court denied the motion for jmol and the motion for new trial,but granted in part the motion to alter or amend the judgment.the court held that because the parties had agreed that substantive issues in the case were to be governed by kansas law,the state mandatory cap on noneconomic damages in personal injury cases applied to the judgment against sfx.the court then ordered entry of an amended judgment that reduced wagner damages by just over a million dollars 
sfx timely appealed,arguing that the district court erred in not granting its motion for judgment as a matter of law not instructing the jury on comparative fault,and restricting sfx introduction of evidence on that subject not instructing the jury on the definition of simple negligence,and the distinction between simple negligence and wanton conduct and not granting a new trial.sfx also filed a motion asking that we certify to the kansas supreme court the question of whether,under kansas law,comparative fault principles apply within an action based solely on a claim of wanton conduct.
on,wagner argues that the district court erred in reducing his damages award based on kansas statutory cap on noneconomic damages in personal injury actions.he further argues that even if the cap does apply in this case,the district court erred in applying it to the portion of the award for loss of spousal support.

motion for judgment as a matter of.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court denial of a rule b motion for jmol,and we apply the same legal standard as did the district court.united mine workers of am.rag am.coal,cir.in a diversity case such as this one,the substantive law of the forum state governs the analysis of the underlying claims,including specification of the applicable standards of proof,but federal law controls the ultimate,procedural question whether jmol is appropriate.specialty beverages,pabst brewing,cir.
a party is entitled to jmol only if the court concludes that all of the evidence in the record reveals no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a claim under the controlling law.hysten burlington sante fe ry,cir citing reeves sanderson plumbing,d.drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,which in this case is wagner,we thus will reverse the district court denial of the motion for jmol if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the party opposing the motion.hardeman city of albuquerque,cir quotation omitted.it is not our province to weigh evidence,judge witness credibility,or challenge the factual conclusions of the jury.hysten,at quotation omitted.
wanton conduct under kansas law 
in kansas,wanton conduct is distinct from negligence and differs in kind.bowman doherty,citing kniffen hercules powder.unlike negligence,w anton conduct is established by the mental attitude of the wrongdoer rather than by particular negligent acts.robison state,d,citing friesen chicago,rock island pacific.that is,w anton conduct is distinguished from a mere lack of due care by the fact that the actor realized the imminence of injury to others from his acts and refrained from taking steps to prevent the injury.bowman,at.this reckless disregard or complete indifference rises substantially beyond mere negligence.id.because wantonness derives from the mental attitude of the wrongdoer,acts of omission as well as acts of commission can be wanton.gould taco bell.
to establish wanton conduct,a plaintiff must make a showing that the act was performed with a realization of the imminence of danger and that the act was performed with a reckless disregard of or complete indifference to the probable consequences of the act.reeves carlson,see also gould,at.thus,t he keys to a finding of wantonness are the knowledge of a dangerous condition and indifference to the consequences.reeves,at.the plaintiff need not prove any intent or willingness to injure.lanning ex rel lanning anderson,d,citing boaldin of,see also reeves,at.
the first prong of the the act was performed with a realization of the imminence of be established in two ways.first,the plaintiff may put on direct evidence of the defendant actual knowledge of a dangerous condition.lanning,at.second,the plaintiff may establish,through circumstantial evidence,the defendant reason to believe that his act might injure another,because that act was taken in disregard of a high and excessive degree of danger,either known to the defendant or apparent to a reasonable person in the defendant position.id.quotations and emphasis omitted.
as to the tort second prong,reckless disregard of or indifference to probable consequences,the kansas supreme court has explained that a token effort to prevent harmful consequences would not avoid liability under this prong,while definite acts which materially lessen the chances of those consequences would avoid liability.friesen,at.critical to our analysis of such precautions is whether they materially lessen the chances of the consequences of the particular dangerous condition that we analyze under the tort first prong.
in reeves carlson,for instance,the defendant injured the plaintiff when,while driving intoxicated,he ran a stop sign at an intersection and crashed through a wall of her house.at.the defendant argued that the plaintiff had not established that he was fully aware of and clearly understood that he was about to collide with the plaintiff home and that he was indifferent to the impending collision.id.emphasis in original.the court explained that the defendant fail ed to recognize that the wanton conduct at issue was not the collision,but his choice to drive under circumstances that would likely or probably result in a collision.id.in that case,t he precautions and care that the defendant claimed to have taken did little,if anything,to reduce that risk.id.emphasis added.
in assessing whether a plaintiff has established wanton conduct,then,we must take care to apply both prongs of the tort to the same alleged risk,whether that risk be described narrowly,the risk of the specific accident that occurred or broadly,the risk of any serious accident occurring because of the conduct at,the risk of any accident when the driver is intoxicated.see reeves,supra.in other words,if the first part of kansas inquiry asks whether the defendant had knowledge of a broadly described dangerous condition,the second part of that inquiry must ask whether the defendant recklessly disregarded or was indifferent to the same broadly described risk conversely,if the first part of the test targets the narrow,specific risk that caused the particular accident at issue and asks if the defendant was aware or should have been aware of that particular specific risk,then the second part of the analysis to be consistent must ask if the defendant was indifferent to that specific risk.in short,a plaintiff may not establish wanton conduct by satisfying the notice or knowledge element of the tort as to one,a broad generalized the second element of indifference of that risk to a differently defined,the specific risk that caused the accident at issue.
we need not decide in this case whether both the knowledge of the risk and the indifference to that risk should define risk in a generalized and broad manner or in a narrow,specific manner,and indeed courts seem to have used both approaches.compare robison state,d,and friesen chicago,rock island pacific,with reeves carlson.
but what we can and do conclude from our review of kansas law is that risk must be defined consistently for both elements of the tort of wantonness.as will be seen here,whether the risk is to be defined broadly,the risk of any accident in motorcycle races generally or narrowly,the specific risk that a motorcycle might leave the track at corner in this race a jmol should have been granted to sfx in this case so long as the risk is defined consistently for both elements of this test.
finally,w hether a defendant conduct constitutes wantonness necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.wolfgang,at applying kansas law and citing friesen,at.
