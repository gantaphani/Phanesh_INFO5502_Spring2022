morris communications morris,brought suit against pga tour,pga,alleging that pga violated section of the sherman act,codified at,by monopolizing the markets for the publication of compiled golf scores on the internet,and the sale,or syndication of those scores.in addition,morris alleged that pga further violated section of the sherman act by refusing to deal with morris.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of pga because it found,inter alia,that pga had a valid business justification for its actions.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
morris is a media company that publishes print and electronic newspapers.pga is the sponsor of a series of professional golf tournaments throughout north america known as the pga tour.in order to provide golf scores during its tournaments,pga has developed a scoring system rtss that allows pga to monitor the play around the entire golf course.rtss is an elaborate electronic relay scoring system that relies on computer technology and equipment as well as dozens of trained workers and volunteers.
rtss works as follows.during a pga golf tournament,volunteers known as walking scorers follow each group of golfers on the course and tabulate the scores of each player at the end of each hole played.the scores are then collected by other volunteers,known as hole reporters,located at each of the eighteen greens on the golf course,who relay the scoring information to a remote production truck staffed by pga personnel.the scores of all participating golfers are then processed at the remote production truck and transmitted to pga website,as golf scores,which are scores that are transmitted electronically nearly contemporaneously to their actual occurrence on the golf course.at the same time,the compiled scores are also transmitted to an media center where members of the media are able to access the scores.the same information is also transmitted to various electronic leaderboards located throughout the golf course.as their name suggests,the leaderboards typically show only the top ten or fifteen players scores.
the nature of a pga golf tournament makes it impossible for one person to physically follow all the players at once.first,the average golf course spans approximately acres and various golfers play numerous holes simultaneously.in addition,the pga does not allow its invitees to use cell phones and devices on the course because such devices might disrupt play.therefore,the only source of compiled golf scores for all tournament players is rtss.likewise,the only physical location at which to obtain compiled golf scores is the media center.
in order for media organizations to have access to the pga media center,they must obtain free press credentials from pga.to obtain these credentials,all media organizations must agree to follow pga terms and conditions,including pga service regulations olsr.the olsr require media organizations to delay publication on their internet websites of scoring information obtained by rtss until the earliest of thirty minutes after the actual occurrence of the shot or the time when such information has become legally available in the public domain,after the scores are posted on pga official website,in addition,the olsr prohibit credentialed media organizations from selling,or syndicating,compiled scoring information obtained in the media center to internet website publishers without first buying a license to do so from pga 
morris contends that,as a result of the olsr,pga is the only entity able to publish and sell golf scores.thus,morris continues,pga has an unfair advantage in the publication and syndication of the scores.pga counters that it adopted the olsr to preserve the value of its investment in creating and developing rtss and to promote the competitiveness of its own website.
based on the allegedly illegal olsr,morris filed suit against pga,asserting four antitrust claims monopolization of the internet markets,unlawful refusal to deal,monopoly leveraging,and attempted monopolization of the internet markets 
procedural history 
after extensive discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment on each claim.the district court granted pga motion for summary judgment,finding that pga had a valid business justification for its olsr because the olsr prevented morris from on pga investment in its costly rtss.accordingly,the district court found that pga had not violated the antitrust laws even if it operated a monopoly and refused to deal with morris 
subsequent to the granting of summary judgment in favor of pga,morris filed a rule motion for relief from judgment on the ground that,following the issuance of judgment in favor of pga,pga adopted new terms of service tos regarding in further violation of of the sherman act.the new tos prohibit anyone from using the information displayed on for a commercial purpose without first buying a license from pga.the district court denied the motion,finding that the new tos were beyond the scope of the instant lawsuit,which addressed only pga media credentialing regulations and the olsr.accordingly,the district court found that morris challenge to the new tos would be more aptly addressed in a separate lawsuit.
morris timely and separately appealed the adverse summary judgment and rule orders.this court consolidated the two appeals.
ii.standards of review 
this court reviews de novo whether the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of pga on all counts,applying the same standard that governed the district court.levinson reliance standard life ins,cir.
this court reviews whether the district court correctly denied morris rule motion for abuse of discretion.see bivens gardens office,barnett banks of,cir.
iii.analysis 
before discussing the antitrust issues in this case,it is important to note what this case is not about.contrary to the arguments of morris and its amici curiae,this case is not about copyright law the constitution,the first amendment or freedom of the press in news reporting.this case is a antitrust case involving a product and a defendant assertion of a valid business justification as its defense to anticompetitive actions,if any.also important to note is that this case is being decided based upon the facts presented,not a hypothetical situation,no matter how probable its actualization accordingly,the only real issue before us is whether pga restrictions and prohibitions regarding morris ability to sell compiled golf scores to third parties violates of the sherman act.we do not address morris right of access to and internal dissemination of compiled,as permitted by the pga 
monopolization 
section of the sherman act provides that e very person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,any part of the trade or commerce among the several states,shall be deemed guilty of a felony.the offense of monopoly under of the sherman act has two elements the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product,business acumen,or historic accident.united states grinnell,d.
the first element,monopoly power,is the power to control prices in or to exclude competition from the relevant market.united states du pont de nemours.the second element requires predatory or exclusionary acts or practices that have the effect of preventing or excluding competition within the relevant market.see united states microsoft.in order for a practice to be exclusionary,it must harm the competitive process and thereby harm consumers.id.h arm to one or more competitors will not suffice for a violation.see also consultants designers,butler serv.group,cir the relevant inquiry is not whether a company present attempt to exclude adversely impacts competition but rather whether its acquisition of the power to exclude competitors had a sufficiently adverse impact on competition to constitute a sherman act violation.
refusal to deal 
two theories exist upon which to predicate a unilateral refusal to deal claim the intent test and the essential facility test.communications,cir under the intent test,it is unlawful for a monopolist to maintain or extend its monopoly power by intentionally engaging in conduct that unnecessarily excludes competitors and impairs competition.see id.at see also eastman kodak photo materials.
under the essential facility test,a company that has exclusive control over a facility essential to effective competition may not deny potential competitors access to that facility on reasonable terms and conditions if to do so would create or maintain monopoly power in the relevant market.covad communications bellsouth,cir,cert.granted and judgment vacated on other grounds,d mci communications,cir see also verizon communications,law offices of curtis trinko,llp,d the indispensable requirement for invoking the doctrine is the unavailability of access to the essential facilities where access exists,the doctrine serves no purpose.the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the defendant controls an essential facility that can not be practically or economically duplicated.see covad communications,at.
in the absence of any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly,however,a company may deal or refuse to deal with whomever it pleases.aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d quoting united states colgate.even a company with monopoly power has no general duty to cooperate with its business rivals and may refuse to deal with them if valid business reasons exist for such refusal.see communications,at.
ordinarily,when determining whether a defendant has violated of the sherman act,we first determine the relevant market and then decide whether the defendant possessed monopoly power in that market.in this case,however,we do not pursue such an inquiry because we agree with the district court that even if pga possessed monopoly power in the relevant market,morris claims can not prevail because pga has a valid business justification for its actions.therefore,even if pga is monopolistic,and even if pga refused to deal with morris,it has not violated of the sherman act.
valid business justification as a defense 
the sherman act is the magna carta of free enterprise,but it does not give judges carte blanche to insist that a monopolist alter its way of doing business whenever some other approach might yield greater competition.verizon communications.at internal quotations omitted.to the contrary,section of the sherman act seeks merely to prevent unlawful monopolization and unlawful refusals to deal.id.
unlawful monopoly power requires anticompetitive conduct,which is conduct without a legitimate business purpose that makes sense only because it eliminates competition.indus.hartz mountain,cir see also lepage,cir discussing conwood,united states tobacco,cir,cert.denied,d.likewise,refusal to deal that is designed to protect or further the legitimate business purposes of a defendant does not violate the antitrust laws,even if that refusal injures competition.see aspen skiing,at.at see also nynex discon,d citing brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d,for the proposition that e ven an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not,without more,state a claim under the federal antitrust laws united states football league national football league,cir concluding that no liability existed where network actions were based on desire to obtain million in rights fees,not to exclude competitors.
once the defendant has met its burden to show its valid business justification,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the proffered business justification is pretextual.see anchor,rule,cir see also image technical,eastman kodak,cir.
in this case,pga met its business justification burden by showing that it seeks to prevent morris from on pga rtss technology.see cont l,gte sylvania,d stating that prevention of by competitors is a legitimate business purpose consultants designers,at concluding that defendant had a legitimate interest in protecting from opportunistic appropriation its investment in acquiring the information necessary to carry on its business.to achieve its business purpose,pga has refused to grant morris access to pga tournaments unless morris agrees not to sell the product of pga proprietary golf internet publishers.morris responds that it has a right to sell such product notwithstanding that rtss was developed and paid for,and is operated by,pga we disagree with morris.the compiled golf scores acquired through rtss are not a product that morris has a right to sell because they are a derivative product of rtss,which pga owns exclusively we agree with the district court that pga has a right to sell or license its product,championship golf,and its derivative product,compiled golf scores,on the internet in the same way the pga currently sells its rights to television broadcasting stations.morris communications pga tour,d.
if morris wishes to sell pga product,it must first purchase it from pga.see consultants designers,at explaining that plaintiff did not have the right to abrogate defendant property interest.section of the sherman act does not require pga to give its product freely to its competitors.see seagood trading jerrico,cir stating that it is not a function of the antitrust laws to equip plaintiffs with defendants competitive advantages.pga is willing to sell its product to its competitors,including morris,thereby allowing credentialed media organizations like morris to syndicate compiled golf scores after paying a licensing fee to pga.accordingly,we conclude from the record that pga has satisfied its burden to show a valid business justification.
business justification is not pretextual 
because pga has met its burden of showing that its asserted business justification is valid,the burden shifts to morris to allege facts that support an inference that the proffered justification is merely pretextual,thereby establishing genuine issues of material fact.anchor,at see also image technical,at.morris argues that pga only justification for its refusal to deal with morris on morris terms is economic and such sole motivation is not a valid business justification thus,pga justification is pretextual.see lepage,at d efendant assertion that it acted in furtherance of its economic interests does not constitute the type of business justification that is an acceptable defense to monopolization.
morris supports its argument with a series of cases which are fundamentally distinguishable from this case.in the cases upon which morris relies,the plaintiffs alleging antitrust violations had created with their own work and efforts,or purchased with their own money,their very own products that defendants prohibited them from selling.see,eastman kodak image technical,d plaintiffs invest substantially in parts inventory aspen skiing,at.at plaintiff developed and maintained its own competitive ski resort and ski packages lorain journal united states.injured competitor trying to sell its radio air time for advertisements int l news serv.associated press.plaintiff gathers in all parts of the world,by means of various instrumentalities of its own,by exchange with its members,and by other appropriate means,news and intelligence of current and recent events of interest to newspaper readers lepage,at plaintiff selling its own transparent tape microsoft,at injured competitors deterred from selling their own computers and browsers basketball ass motorola,cir analyzing issues and noting that plaintiff did not because it used its own efforts to conduct business anchor,at plaintiff manufactures and supplies anchors trans sport,starter sportswear,cir plaintiffs purchased product from defendants.
morris refers to this distinction as pga sweat of the brow defense and correctly states that it is not a defense in a copyright case.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d concluding that sweat of the brow is no defense in a copyright case.appellant br.at.this rule of copyright law is irrelevant,however,in this antitrust case.the sweat of the brow product,to which morris and the district court refer,is no different than,for example,the interconnection services in verizon communications.at,the job shoppers in consultants desi
