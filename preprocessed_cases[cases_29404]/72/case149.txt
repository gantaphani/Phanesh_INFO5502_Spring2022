litigation stemming from the enforcement of patent the patent returns to this court for the third time,having visited us on two prior occasions in appeals from two different suits against two other accused infringers.see wilson sporting goods hillerich bradsby,demarini sports,worth.in this case,wilson sporting goods company wilson appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the district of minnesota granting the motion of miken composites,miken for summary judgment of of claims and of the patent.miken composites,wilson sporting goods,wl,summary judgment opinion.because the district court claim construction was not erroneous,and because the district court correctly concluded that no reasonable jury could find that miken bats infringed the patent,either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents,we affirm.
background 
wilson is the current assignee of the patent,which relates to softball and baseball bats and more particularly relates to the use of structural members inside such bats to improve their impact response.patent.the patent begins with a description of the difficulties of designing aluminum bats with optimal tubular wall thickness in the prior art.according to the patent,making the aluminum wall of a bat thin enables a large amount of elastic deflection,which results in superior power transfer and thus better slugging capacity.however,if the wall is too thin,there is a risk of permanent plastic deformation,which lessens the power transfer to a ball and leaves the bat permanently dented.id.on the other hand,if the aluminum wall is too thick,the bat will be too stiff,and will respond with relatively little spring,resulting in lower power transfer.id.
the patent discloses an improved bat design including a tubular insert suspended within the impact portion of the tubular frame.id.
the preferred embodiment of the patent is illustrated in figure,above.in figure,the insert is identified as member and is described as having an outer diameter slightly less than the inner diameter of the tubular frame impact portion.id.the insert contacts the tubular frame only at the interference fits at the ends of the insert,such that a narrow,uniform gap exists between the insert and the inner wall of the impact portion of the frame.id.according to this embodiment of the invention,the insert is inserted into the tubular frame,the gap is filled with a lubricant,such as grease,and these components together yield a mechanical system with characteristics similar to a leaf spring.id.the suspension of the insert within the tubular frame adds snap to the rebound of the bat after coming into contact with a ball,and thus yields an improved transfer of power to the batted ball,and a heightened slugging capacity for the bat.id.
miken brought a declaratory judgment action against wilson seeking,inter alia,a declaration that several of its bat models,specifically the viper,hhd,velocite,ultra,ultra ii,ii,edge,and,did not infringe claims,or of the patent.wilson counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent.after the district court issued a claim construction order,miken composites,wilson sporting goods.july,wilson abandoned its allegations with respect to claim.miken then moved for summary judgment of as to asserted claims and of the patent and of invalidity with respect to claim only.the district court initially stayed all proceedings pending this court resolution of the appeal in the hillerich case,which involved the same claims of the patent.following the issuance of our decision in that case,the parties were permitted to submit supplemental briefs addressing the relevance of the hillerich opinion.
the asserted claims of the patent read as follows,with disputed provisions emphasized 
a bat,comprising 
a hollow tubular bat frame having a circular and 
an insert positioned within the frame,
the insert having a circular,the insert having first and second ends adjoining the tubular frame,the insert being separated from the tubular frame by a gap forming at least part of an annular shape along a central portion between said first and second ends,the frame elastically deflectable across the gap to operably engage the insert along a portion of the insert between the insert first and second ends.
a bat,comprising 
a hollow tubular bat frame having a handle portion and a 
impact portion having a circular with an inner and outer diameter 
at least one insert having a substantially circular with an 
outer diameter less than the inner diameter of the frame impact portion,the insert being held within the impact portion and 
the impact portion being inwardly elastically deflectable such to establish a 
tight interference fit between the insert and the impact portion.
the parties contentions regarding infringement revolved around two limitations.the first of these is the insert limitation found in both claim and claim.the second is the gap limitation expressly recited in claim as a gap forming at least part of an annular shape between the insert and the bat frame,such that the frame is elastically deflectable across the gap to operably engage the insert.although claim does not recite a gap in the terms used in claim,it does require that the impact portion be inwardly elastically deflectable such to establish a tight interference fit between the insert and the impact portion.the district court noted that,based on this language,the federal circuit has found the requirement that a gap exist between the impact portion and the insert to be implicit in claim.summary judgment opinion at citing hillerich,at.
miken conceded that the viper,hhd,and bats collectively,the bats contain inserts within the meaning of the claim language because they are composed of a structural member that is either hydraulically or manually pushed into a separately manufactured frame.id.at.miken argued,however,that the ultra,ultra ii,ii,edge,and bats collectively,the carbon bats do not contain any insert because they are manufactured differently,using a successive layering process described by the district court as follows 
an internal component is first fabricated by rolling alternate layers of preimpregnated carbon fiber tape,polypropylene shrink tape and nylon shrink tape over a mandrel,curing the component at an elevated temperature,removing the external layers of shrink tape and then dipping the component into a release agent.each internal component is comprised of two layers of carbon fiber reinforced and the placement and quantity of shrink tape layers vary slightly depending on the specific bat.dry fabrics are then tightly drawn over the internal component,and the entire assembly is infused with resin.
id.at internal citations omitted.thus,at bottom,the parties dispute centered around whether the internal component of the carbon bats constitutes an insert and whether a gap is present between the bat frame and insert,if any,in both the carbon and bats.
in due course,the district court granted miken motion for summary judgment of.id.at.the district court concluded that the carbon bats do not infringe claims or of the patent,literally or by equivalency,because they do not have an insert.id.at.moreover,the district court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that the bats literally infringe because they do not contain a gap for purposes of claim,or a space sufficient to allow contact upon elastic deflection,for purposes of claim.id.at.as for validity of claim,the district court rejected miken challenge.id.at.wilson timely appealed the district court noninfringement determinations.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

claim construction 
wilson disputes the district court claim constructions of the insert limitation of claims and and the gap limitation of claim.wilson further contends that the district court erred in applying its construction of the gap limitation to claim because the word gap does not appear in claim.
a.the insert limitation 
relying upon our prior discussion of the term insert in hillerich,the district court held that t he term insert does not possess a particular meaning in the field of art encompassed by the patent,and that g iven its ordinary and customary meaning,insert means something inserted or intended for insertion.summary judgment opinion at quoting hillerich,at.although not discussed by the district court in this case,we had also previously addressed the insert limitation in demarini.in that case,we accepted the ordinary and uncontested definition proffered by the of the patent as anything put or fit into something else.demarini,at.we also noted that the bat frame,which includes the impact portion and the handle,completely surrounds and is separate from the insert.id.
wilson contends that the insert limitation is purely structural,and that it does not matter whether an insert is placed into a frame or whether a frame is built around it.wilson argues that by holding that the carbon bats do not contain an insert within the meaning of the claims because the internal component is not inserted into anything,the district court committed the claim construction error of importing a process limitation into claims directed to a product.see hazani int l trade comm n,distinguishing between product and claims.
miken responds that construing the term insert to encompass any separate,internal,independently moveable structural element would impermissibly broaden the scope of the claims and would read out the insert limitation entirely.miken further argues that nystrom trex,limiting the term board to wood cut from a log,demonstrates that how a product is made can be dispositive evidence of of a product claim.
we are not persuaded by wilson arguments regarding the insert limitation.to the extent that these arguments are relevant to claim construction,we address them here to the extent they relate to the second step of the infringement analysis,however,we address them below.we note first that nothing in the claims or specification indicates,explicitly or implicitly,that the inventor used the term in a novel way or intended to impart a novel meaning to it.to the contrary,the claims and written description of the patent consistently use the term insert in the sense of its ordinary meaning as something inserted or intended for insertion.webster ii new college dictionary ed see also webster third new international dictionary unabridged defining insert as something that is inserted or is for insertion patent the insert is inserted into the tubular frame id.the insert is coated with the lubricant before being inserted into the tubular frame.had the patentee,who was responsible for drafting and prosecuting the patent,intended something different,it could have prevented this result through clearer drafting.hoganas ab dresser.moreover,the parties have presented no evidence to suggest that the term insert in the context of the patent has a particular meaning differing from the ordinary and customary meaning in the field of art encompassed by the patent.the term insert is a common term used to denote structure.to contend,however,as wilson does,that it does not matter whether an insert is placed into a frame or whether a frame is built around it ignores that ordinary and customary meaning,notwithstanding wilson attempts to categorize the term insert as purely structural.the issue would have been different if the claims contained the language argued in wilson briefs to wit,internal structural member,wilson br.at,or product,reply br.at,but they do not.it is the language of the claims not the argument that governs.
as for wilson contention that the district court impermissibly imported a process limitation into a product claim,we disagree.as we have discussed,the district court merely adopted an ordinary meaning of the term insert.summary judgment opinion at.that this ordinary meaning has functional attributes does not change the fact that the claim recites a structural component,albeit one possessed with certain understood characteristics.greenberg ethicon,noting that structural elements can be expressed in functional terms and citing examples such as filter,brake,clamp,screwdriver,and lock.miken further supports its argument by relying on nystrom.we agree that nystrom supports miken position but for a reason different from the one presented.in nystrom,we held that the b roadening of the ordinary meaning of a term in the absence of support in the intrinsic record indicating that such a broad meaning was intended violates the principles articulated in phillips awh,en banc.nystrom,at.based on phillips,a claim term should not be read to encompass a broader definition in the absence of something in the written description prosecution history to provide explicit or implicit notice to the,those of ordinary skill in the the inventor intended a disputed term to cover more than the ordinary and customary meaning revealed by the context of the intrinsic record.id.at.here,wilson has not identified any such notice in the intrinsic record of the patent.accordingly,and because we discern no claim construction error in the district court treatment of the insert limitation,we affirm this aspect of the judgment.
b.the gap limitation 
with respect to the language of claim requiring the impact portion being inwardly elastically deflectable such to establish a tight interference fit,the district court held the requirement that a gap exist between the impact portion and the insert to be implicit in claim.summary judgment opinion at citing hillerich,at.for both this limitation and the gap limitation of claim,the district court adopted the claim construction articulated in hillerich.see id.at,see also demarini,at declining to construe these limitations.
on appeal,wilson argues that the district court read an additional limitation into the claims by holding that the separations measured in the accused bats,which the district court characterized as irregular and sporadic,were not large enough or consistent enough to be considered a gap.wilson also contends that the district court claim construction ignored the real invention of the,a bat which yields a mechanical system with characteristics similar to a.wilson further argues that the district court erroneously read the gap limitation of claim into claim,in which the word gap does not appear.miken responds by defending the district court claim construction and by arguing that the inventor disclaimed discontinuous and variable spaces between the frame and insert during the prosecution of the patent.
these arguments are for the most part more germane to infringement,and thus we address them in the infringement discussion below.to the extent that they do relate to claim construction,they do not persuade us that the district court erred in adopting the claim construction of this court in hillerich.as we held in hillerich,a lthough gap does not appear in claim,the claim term a tight interference fit implies some sort of space between the frame and the insert.hillerich,at.however,claims and do not foreclose some contact between the insert and frame.id.at.we therefore define gap for the purposes of claims and of the patent as a separation,which may be localized,so that a of the bat in the impact region need not possess circular symmetry.id.at.specifically with respect to claim,in contrast to the insert of claim,the insert in this claim need not be perfectly circular.rather the claim requires only space between the frame and the insert to allow for contact when the impact portion is elastically deflected.id.furthermore,clai
