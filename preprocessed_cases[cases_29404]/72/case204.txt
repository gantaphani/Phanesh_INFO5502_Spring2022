carlos sued southwest key program,texas key program,and la esperanza home for boys collectively southwest key for damages arising from a knee injury he sustained during an impromptu game of tackle football.the trial court rendered judgment on the verdict against southwest key,and the court of appeals affirmed.generally alleged a negligence claim based on several theories,including negligent supervision,negligent instruction and organization of the game,and failure to provide protective equipment.however,we conclude that southwest key failure to provide protective equipment for use during the football game is the only alleged causal nexus underlying each of theories of negligence.because the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury finding that southwest key negligence proximately caused injury,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that take nothing.
southwest key owns and operates la esperanza home for boys in brownsville,texas.southwest key accepted placement of in the home through an agreement with the texas youth commission.in september,antonio gracia,a southwest key employee,took and some other residents to a local stadium to participate in various athletic activities.gracia supervised as some of the boys jogged on the track,while others played tag.at one point,several nonresident boys,who had been playing soccer on an adjacent field,approached gracia and the boys and proposed that they all play a game of football.gracia allowed his boys to play on the condition that tackling would take place only below the waist.participated in the football game,which continued for a few hours.on the last play,he was tackled and suffered a dislocated knee.
sued southwest key,alleging that it was negligent in allowing him to play tackle football without providing any protective gear or equipment.in the trial court,southwest key claimed that this case involved a sports injury and urged the court to adopt a heightened standard for recovery,requiring reckless or intentional conduct.the trial court rejected southwest key argument and submitted the case to the jury as one involving ordinary negligence.the jury found southwest key percent negligent and awarded in damages,plus interest and costs,and the trial court rendered judgment on the verdict.
on appeal,southwest key argued that the trial court erred in submitting an ordinary negligence question to the jury,again arguing that this is a case in which must prove that southwest key acted with reckless or intentional disregard for his safety in order to recover.alternatively,southwest key argued that the jury verdict was not supported by legally or factually sufficient evidence that its breach proximately caused injury.specifically,southwest key asserted that sole liability theory was based on southwest key failure to provide protective equipment during the game,but there was no evidence that this failure proximately caused injury.countered that he raised other theories of liability,including negligent supervision and negligent instruction and organization of the game.
the court of appeals determined that because neither southwest key nor its employee gracia participated in or sponsored the football game,it was not a case,and ordinary negligence was the appropriate standard.at.further,the court of appeals agreed that had asserted multiple negligence theories against southwest key.id.at.after concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury finding on negligent supervision,the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment.id.at.southwest key petitioned this court for review,contending that the court of appeals erred in determining that this is not a case,and thus that a higher standard of liability should be applied and even under an ordinary negligence framework,there is no evidence to support the jury finding that southwest key negligence proximately caused injury.
ii.analysis 
southwest key argues that we should apply a heightened standard of tort liability and urges us to adopt a uniform rule applicable in all cases in which a participant in a sporting or recreational event suffers an injury during play.southwest key primarily advocates an inherent risk standard,and alternatively suggests a reckless or intentional standard.contends that this is not a case,but rather a case of negligent supervision,and thus,ordinary negligence principles should apply.in response,southwest key argues that,even under the ordinary negligence standard urged by,there is no evidence that its negligence proximately caused injury.
liability standards 
although this court has not spoken on the issue of liability in the context of sports injuries,the lower courts of this state and the high courts of many other states have.three models of liability have emerged.a majority of courts have adopted a reckless or intentional standard in a variety of situations,requiring an injured plaintiff to prove that the conduct was either reckless or intentionally injurious and some courts have extended this standard to situations in which the defendant is a nonparticipant in the sporting event,as the court of appeals determined southwest key to be here.see morgan state,holding that,in assessing whether an owner or operator of an athletic facility has violated a duty of care toward voluntary participants injured on the premises,the applicable standard should include whether the conditions caused by the defendant negligence were unique and created a dangerous condition over and above the usual dangers inherent in the sport kline oid,ohio app d,applying the reckless or intentional standard when an injured indoor soccer game participant sued the owner of the facility in which the game was played as well as the organizer of the soccer league.however,a few states adhere to the traditional negligence standard,under which a defendant owes a duty of ordinary care.see estes tripson,app auckenthaler grundmeyer,lestina bend mut.ins.finally,there is the inherent risk standard,previously advocated by some members of this court,which states that both and nonparticipant defendants owe no duty to protect a participant from risks inherent in the sport or activity in which he has chosen to take part.phi delta theta moore,enoch,dissenting to improvident grant see also west sundown little league of stockton,th,d,applying the inherent risk standard in a suit by an injured little league player against local and national little league organization and coaches davis greer,gonzales,opinion on denial of application for writ of error arguing that the inherent risk standard is preferable to the reckless or intentional standard scott pac.mountain resort,a defendant simply does not have a duty to protect a sports participant from dangers which are an inherent and normal part of a sport.
we acknowledge the valid public policy reasons that have been articulated in support of each of the three approaches to liability in cases.see city of berkley,auckenthaler,at phi delta theta,at.however,because claim fails even under the negligence standard he was submitted to the jury in this is unnecessary to adopt any of the three approaches here.
theory of liability 
the court of appeals concluded that proceeded on multiple theories of negligence,including negligent supervision,negligent instruction and organization of the game,as well as failure to provide protective equipment.at.construing the pleadings liberally in favor,we acknowledge that did generally allege these various negligence theories.however,we conclude that only one alleged causal nexus underlies each of his southwest key,through its employee,gracia,allowed to play tackle football without providing protective equipment.our conclusion is well supported by the record.
