defendant facts 
at the premises where plaintiff was injured,defendant operated a fitness center at which members could utilize various exercise equipment and participate in aerobic exercise classes,among other activities,pursuant to the terms of a membership agreement between defendant and the member.according to defendant risk management analyst,each of defendant exercise facilities offered the following equipment,services,and amenities free weights conditioning machines and other specialized fitness equipment group exercises such as aerobics,dance classes,and yoga testing centers to record certain physical characteristics such as blood pressure and weight an optional introductory membership program that included three sessions with staff trainers and locker rooms.for additional fees,a member could obtain personal training and nutritional counseling.

plaintiff purchased a membership with defendant because she wanted to lose weight and believed that exercising using defendant exercise equipment would help her achieve that goal.plaintiff could not afford to purchase exercise equipment on her own and believed that using defendant equipment would be the most cost effective means of obtaining the exercise she wanted.
because plaintiff was familiar with exercise machines,which she described as simple to use,she did not need instruction,training,or assistance from defendant concerning the use of its exercise machines,and no such instruction,training,or assistance was provided to her by defendant.although all of defendant trainers were certified,defendant staff members that worked in the area where members used exercise equipment were not certified trainers.
