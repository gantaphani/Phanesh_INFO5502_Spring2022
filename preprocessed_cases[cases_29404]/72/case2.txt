professional soccer players sued major league soccer,llc mls,nine independent in mls,and the united states soccer federation,ussf,alleging violations of sherman act sections and,and clayton act section,id,and seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages the district court granted summary judgment for defendants on the section and clayton act counts.after a long trial on the section count,the jury returned a special verdict leading to judgment in favor of defendants.players now appeal the disposition of all three counts.we begin with a statement of the background facts.
background facts 
despite professional soccer popularity abroad,the sport has achieved only limited success in this country.several minor leagues have operated here four such leagues exist today,but before the formation of mls,only one other professional north american soccer league nasl had ever obtained division i,or,status.launched in,the nasl achieved some success before folding in mls attributes the nasl demise in part to wide disparities in the financial resources of the league independently owned teams and a lack of centralized control.
in,the ussf,the national governing body of soccer in the united states,et,was awarded the right to host the world cup soccer tournament in the by the federation internationale de football association fifa,soccer international governing body.in consideration for the coveted sponsorship rights,the ussf promised to establish a viable division i professional soccer league in the as soon as possible.
the ussf decided as early as to sanction only one division i professional league.the concern was that sanctioning rival leagues would dilute revenues,drive up costs,and thereby dim the prospects for division i soccer in the indeed,mls contends no other country has sanctioned more than one division i league within its borders,although arrangements in other countries could be variously described.
just before world cup usa play began,in early december,three organizations presented competing plans to develop a division i professional soccer league to the ussf national board of directors.the three competing organizers were league one america the american professional soccer league apsl,an existing division ii league and major league professional soccer mlps,the precursor to mls,headed by the ussf own president,alan rothenberg.
at its december,meeting the ussf board tentatively selected mlps as the exclusive division i professional soccer league in the,based upon its relatively strong capitalization,higher proposed spending,business plan and management.the board also reaffirmed its intention to sanction only one division i league.but in january,the ussf announced that it would consider sanctioning additional leagues which could meet rigorous new financial and operating standards beginning with the season.
in the wake of a successful world cup usa,mls was officially formed in february as a limited liability company llc under delaware law.the league is owned by a number of independent investors a mix of corporations,partnerships,and one individual and is governed by a management committee known as the board of governors.some of the investors are passive others are also team operators as explained below.
mls has,to say the least,a unique structure,even for a sports league.mls retains significant centralized control over both league and individual team operations.mls owns all of the teams that play in the league a total of prior to the start of,as well as all intellectual property rights,tickets,supplied equipment,and broadcast rights.mls sets the teams schedules negotiates all stadium leases and assumes all related liabilities pays the salaries of referees and other league personnel and supplies certain equipment.
at issue in this case is mls control over player employment.mls has the sole responsibility for negotiating and entering into agreements with,and for compensating,players.in a nutshell,mls recruits the players,negotiates their salaries,pays them from league funds,and,to a large extent,determines where each of them will play.for example,to balance talent among teams,it decides,with the input of team operators,where certain of the league marquee players will play.
however,mls has also relinquished some control over team operations to certain investors.mls contracts with these investors to operate nine of the league teams the league runs the other three.these investors are referred to as and are the in this action.each has the exclusive right and obligation to provide management services for a team within its home territory and is given some leeway in running the team and reaping the potential benefits therefrom.
specifically,the hire,at their own expense and discretion,local staff including the general managers and coaches of their respective teams,and are responsible for local office expenses,local promotional costs for home games,and the stadium rent the same portion as mls.in addition,they license local broadcast rights,sell home tickets,and conduct all local marketing on behalf of mls agreements regarding these matters do not require the prior approval of mls.and they control a majority of the seats on mls board,the very same body which runs the league operations.among other things,the board is responsible for hiring the commissioner and approving national television contracts and marketing decisions,league rules and policies including team player budgets,and sales of interests.
the also play a limited role in selecting players for their respective teams.while the operating agreements provide that the will not bid independently for players against mls,they may trade players with other mls teams and select players in the league draft.such transactions,however,must follow strict rules established by the league.most importantly,no team may exceed the maximum player budget established by the management committee.
in return for the services of the,mls pays each of them a management fee that corresponds in large part to the performance of their respective team.the management fee equals the sum of of local ticket receipts and concessions the first of local broadcast revenues,increasing annually by a percentage rate,plus a share declining to by of any amount above the base amount all revenues from overseas tours a share of the net revenues from the mls championship game and a share of revenues from other exhibition games.
the remaining revenues of the league are distributed in equal portions to all investors.thus,while the investors qua investors share equally in the league profits and losses,the individual team operators qua operators fare differently depending at least in part on the financial performance of their respective teams.it bears mentioning,however,that neither the league nor,apparently,any of its teams has yet made a profit.
although the league retains legal title to the teams,the may transfer their operating rights,within certain limits,and retain much of the value created by their individual efforts and investments.investors may transfer their ownership stakes and operating rights to other current investors without obtaining prior consent transfers to outside investors,however,require a majority vote of the board.for its part,mls may terminate any operating agreement on its own initiative if,by a vote of the board,an is determined to have failed to act in the best interests of the league.if so,it must still pay such fair market value for its operating rights and ownership interest.
the league began official play in.the following february of,eight named players sued mls,the ussf,and the under various antitrust theories.the injunctive class was certified in january of.fraser major league soccer,llc.in count i,the players claimed mls and its violated sherman act section by agreeing not to compete for player services.in count iii the players claimed mls monopolized or attempted to monopolize,or combined or conspired with the ussf to monopolize,the market for the services of division i professional soccer players in the,in violation of sherman act section,by preventing any other entity from being sanctioned as a division i professional soccer league in the united states or otherwise competing against mls.in count iv,the players claimed that the combination of assets of the in mls substantially lessened competition and tended to create monopoly in violation of clayton act section.
in february,before the close of discovery,mls and its moved for summary judgment on counts i and iv players,seeking to block mls from asserting a single entity defense on count on april,the district court granted mls summary judgment on both counts,holding that mls and its comprised a single entity and as such,could not conspire in violation of section.fraser major league soccer,llc,d.on the section claim,the court held that the creation of mls did not reduce competition in an existing market because when the company was formed there was no active market for division i professional soccer in the united states.id.at.
subsequently,at a june status conference on the remaining section claims,players indicated apparently for the first time that they intended to introduce evidence that mls prohibited all competition for players among the mls as part of their section claim as well.the court,however,prohibited players from introducing evidence on the operation of to the extent it provided the jury with useful background this version of players monopoly conduct argument precluded by its earlier section summary judgment decision.
a jury trial commenced in september on players remaining section claims.at the close of evidence,the court dismissed the section claims against the,and that ruling is not appealed now,leaving only mls and the ussf as defendants.the court then submitted a special verdict form to the jury.on december,the jury returned its verdict after answering only the first two questions.it found that players had failed to prove what they had alleged,namely,that the relevant geographic market is the united states and that the relevant product market is limited to division i professional soccer players.the court thereafter entered judgment dismissing count iii and denied players rule motions.players then filed this appeal.
ii.sherman act section 
some have urged that sports leagues in general be treated as single sports teams,after all,must collaborate to produce a product.chicago prof l sports.nba,cir nfl am.soccer league,d rehnquist,dissenting from the denial of certiorari.however,this approach has not been adopted in this circuit,sullivan nfl,cir,and we must work with the framework of existing circuit law.single entity status for ordinarily organized leagues has been rejected in several other circuits as well 
even so,the district court concluded that under copperweld independence tube,d,mls and its were uniquely integrated and did comprise a single entity.copperweld established that a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary are not subject to attack under section for agreements between them.they are treated for section purposes as a single economic actor.but what the supreme court has never decided is how far copperweld applies to more complex entities and arrangements that involve a high degree of corporate and economic integration but less than that existing in copperweld itself.
while mls defends the district court single entity ruling,players say that this view is form over substance and the substance is simply a conspiracy among de facto team owners to fix player salaries,which they claim to be a per se violation of the antitrust laws.we disagree completely with this latter characterization.we also find that the case for applying single entity status to mls and its has not been established but that in this case the jury verdict makes a remand on the section claim unnecessary.
if ordinary investors decided to set up a company that would own and manage all of the teams in a league,it is hard to see why this arrangement would fall outside copperweld safe harbor.certainly the potential for competition within the firm is not enough after all,a railroad could in theory provide alternative routes between the same cities and a grocery could locate competing branches of its chain quite near one another yet no law requires competition within a company.it is common practice,but hardly essential,that the teams in a sports league have independent.
further,mls is manifestly more than an arrangement for individual by which they can cap player salaries.in many ways,mls does resemble an ordinary company it owns substantial assets teams,player contracts,stadium rights,intellectual property critical to the performance of the league a substantial portion of generated revenues belongs to it and is to be shared conventionally with both and passive investors.and the fact that mls was structured with the aim of achieving results that might not otherwise be possible does not automatically condemn it.
focusing on the role as stockholders,the district court stressed that both sides of the supposed conspiracy were parts of the same corporate entity and it noted that unlike mls,nfl football clubs do not exist as part of an overarching corporate structure.fraser,d at.and,as copperweld itself shows,its protection is not lost merely because there are separate legal,the because one posits arrangements between them and mls that could not be made by existing competitors without violating the antitrust laws.
nevertheless,it is hard to treat the corporate integration as conclusive.the challenge here is primarily to the role as team managers,not as ordinary stockholders,and to restrictions imposed on them in that role preventing competition for player services.that a stockholder may be insulated by copperweld when making ordinary governance decisions does not mean automatic protection when the stockholder is also an entrepreneur separately contracting with the company above all,there are functional differences between this case and copperweld that are significant for antitrust policy.
first,there is a diversity of entrepreneurial interests that goes well beyond the ordinary company.mls and its have separate contractual relationships giving the rights that take them part way along the path to ordinary sports team owners they do some independent hiring and make investments in their own teams they retain a large portion of the revenues from the activities of their teams and each has limited sale rights in its own team that relate to specific assets and not just shares in the common enterprise.one might well ask why the formal difference in corporate structure should warrant treating mls differently than the national football league or other traditionally structured sports leagues.
this contrasts with copperweld observation that the parent and its wholly owned subsidiary in that case shared a complete unity of interests.at.the phrase is not and,in addition,it could be taken to explain copperweld result without being an outer limit of the defense.chicago prof l sports,at.still,the existence of distinct entrepreneurial interests possessed by separate legal entities distinguishes copperweld it further indicates that certain functions have already been disaggregated and assigned to different entities and it makes the potential for actual competition closer to feasible realization.
second,in this case the analogy to a single entity is weakened,and the resemblance to a collaborative venture strengthened,by the fact that the are not mere servants of mls effectively,they control it,having the majority of votes on the managing board.the problem is especially serious where,as here,the stockholders are themselves potential competitors with mls and with each other.here,it is mls that has two roles one as an entrepreneur with its own assets and revenues the other arguably as a nominally vertical device for producing horizontal coordination,limiting competition among.
from the standpoint of antitrust policy,this prospect of horizontal coordination among the through a common entity is a distinct concern.whatever efficiencies may be thought likely where a single entrepreneur makes decisions for a corporate entity or set of connected entities,the presumption is may in some contexts be separate entrepreneurial interests can collaborate the fixing of above market prices by sellers is the paradigm this does not make mls a mere front for price fixing,but it does distinguish copperweld by introducing a further danger and a further argument for testing it under section rule of reason.
to sum up,the present case is not copperweld but presents a more doubtful situation mls and its comprise a hybrid arrangement,somewhere between a single company with or without wholly owned subsidiaries and a cooperative arrangement between existing competitors.and,of course,there is not one kind of hybrid but a range of possibilities imagine the with their separate entrepreneurial interests but without their control of mls.the question is what legal approach to take.
the law at this point could develop along either or both of two different lines.one would expand upon copperweld to develop functional tests or criteria for shielding or refusing to shield such hybrids from section scrutiny for arrangements.this would be a complex task and add a new layer of analysis but where the analysis shielded the arrangement it would serve to cut off similarly difficult,intrusive scrutiny of such activities under extremely generalized rule of reason standards it would also prevent claims,clearly inappropriate in our view,under per se rules or precedents dealing with arrangements between existing independent competitors.
the other course is to reshape section rule of reason toward a body of more flexible rules for interdependent enterprises.sports leagues are a primary example but so are common franchising arrangements and joint ventures that perform specific services for competitors,a common purchasing entity,see northwest wholesale stationers,pac.stationery and printing,d.certainly the trend of section law has been to soften per se rules and to recognize the need for accommodation among interdependent enterprises 
the same choice of approach presents itself in franchise cases.there,too,we have a close but not complete integration of separate entities under separate entrepreneurial control.traditionally,vertically imposed arrangements restricting competition among franchisees have been tested and often upheld under the rule of reason,am.motor inns holiday inns,cir see also glickman,franchising xii hovenkamp,antitrust law.yet since copperweld,several district court decisions have avoided the section inquiry by deeming franchiser and franchisee part of a single entity 
once one goes beyond the classic single enterprise,including copperweld situations,it is difficult to find an easy stopping point or even decide on the proper functional criteria for hybrid cases.to the extent the criteria reflect judgments that a particular practice in context is defensible,assessment under section is more straightforward and draws on developed law.indeed,the best arguments for upholding mls it is a new and risky venture,constrained in some perhaps great measure by foreign and domestic competition for players,that unquestionably creates a new enterprise without combining existing little to do with its structure.
in all events,we conclude that the single entity problem need not be answered definitively in this case.the case for expanding copperweld is debatable and,more so,the case for applying the single entity label to mls.but even if we assume that section applies,it is clear to us that the venture can not be condemned by per se rules and presents at best a debatable case under the rule of reason.more significantly,as structured by plaintiffs themselves,this case would have been lost at trial based on the jury rejection of plaintiffs own market definition.
the rejection of the per se rule is straightforward.although players portray mls as a sham for horizontal price fixing,the extent of real economic integration is obvious.further,mls and its investors did not compete previously the arrangement was formed as a risky venture against a background of prior failure,united states jerrold elecs,aff,d and the outcome has been to add new opportunities for division i soccer league in the united to raise salaries for soccer players here above existing levels.
the possibility that a less integrated and restrictive salary regime might make some individual salaries even higher is hardly conclusive.without the restrictions,mls might not exist or,if it did,might have larger initial losses and a shorter life.this would hardly enhance competition.thus,the effects of the mls arrangement are simply too uncertain to warrant application of the per se rule.ncaa bd.of regents,at.as in any other se case,players would have to show that mls exercised significant market power in a properly defined market,that the practices in question adversely affected competition in that market and that on balance the adverse effects on competition outweighed the competitive benefits.see augusta news hudson news,cir.
here,the jury said that neither the united states nor division i delimited the relevant that imply that mls faced significant competition for player services both from outside the united states and from i teams.that inference at a minimum creates uncertainty as to whether the jury could have found market power under section.however,the peculiar assemblage of evidence,including materials suggesting that it expected to exercise some control over player salaries see part iii below,makes it impossible to rule out abstractly the possibility of a jury finding of mls market power in a broader market.
mls has urged that the jury verdict rejecting the united i market urged by plaintiffs should be preclusive.the argument purportedly rests on the doctrine of collateral estoppel.we agree with the plaintiffs that collateral estoppel goes no further than to preclude them at a new trial from urging the market already rejected by the jury.restatement second of judgments.in theory,there may be a broader market which plaintiffs might show without contradicting the jury findings in which unrestricted salary competition between the mls might result in somewhat higher player salaries.in that event,assuming that the single entity defense failed,a basis for liability might exist.
however,we have been given no reason to think that any other market would have been alleged and made the subject of proof if the section claim had gone to trial along with the section claims.in their complaint,the plaintiffs main theory under count i was that mls operated as a or group boycott conspiracy for which no market power needed to be shown.a relevant market was nevertheless alleged in count i,apparently because the plaintiffs recognized that a purpose might be urged and a rule of reason balancing might be required.that relevant market was described by count i,as in the section and section counts,as competition for division i soccer players in the united states.see plaintiffs first amended complaint.
proof of such a market was the consistent theme of plaintiffs section trial evidence.to be sure,had the section claim been put to trial,the plaintiffs could have sought to amend their complaint to allege a different market,but there is no obvious reason to think that they would have done so.the united i theory alleged in the complaint was the most favorable for each of their claims and the easiest to define and the focus on a single market theory would have allowed the plaintiffs to focus their proof on a single market definition.plaintiffs did have some incentive to allege a broader market under sections and but that incentive existed when they filed their complaint as well.
even if the players had sought to amend their complaint after summary judgment,we have great doubt whether such an amendment would have been permitted.see hilton int l of,cir.the district court granted summary judgment in april than three years after the initial complaint was filed,more than one year after discovery was largely complete,and barely five months before beginning of trial.at that point in the proceedings,adding a new market theory would have substantially altered the contours of the requiring new discovery and expert analyses based on the new alleged market 
we thus have every reason to think that if the section claim had not been dismissed on summary judgment it would have been presented at trial with the same market analysis alleged in the complaint.it follows that had the district court allowed the section claim,it too would have been defeated by the jury finding that the market alleged in the complaint had not been proved.accordingly,any error in dismissing the claim based on a single entity theory was harmless so long as the jury verdict stands,a matter we address in the next section.the outcome,as the plaintiffs shaped their own case,would have been the same.liberty mut.ins.metro.life ins,cir.
iii.sherman act section 
at trial,players alleged three possible violations of section that mls monopolized the market for division i professional soccer in the that it attempted to monopolize that market and that it conspired with the ussf to monopolize the same market.the jury found that players had failed to establish the relevant market as alleged it reached no other issue in the case.the court thereafter entered judgment for the defendants on all three section claims.
monopolization and attempted monopolization claims.at the outset,players contend that the district court erred by refusing to allow them,in their monopolization and attempted monopolization claims,to argue that elimination of competition for players was an anticompetitive means of monopolization.the district court did so on the ground that this argument would simply resurrect the section claim that had already been rejected by its single entity ruling section remained available to attack the exclusivity arrangement between mls and the ussf,which was the gravamen of the complaint section count.players respond that the same conduct may constitute an element of both antitrust claims.
to show monopolization,players had to prove that mls had engaged in an act that helped create or maintain its alleged monopoly.iii areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law ed.in section cases,the wrongful act is usually one designed to exclude competitors from the market,predatory price,exclusive dealing.see aspen skiing aspen highlands skiing,d.if mls and its are viewed as a single competitor,then the league centralized hiring structure hardly constitutes an exclusionary act,even if it results in wages for players.see kartell blue shield of,cir.after all,suppressing player salaries ought to spur,rather than impair,competition from rival leagues.
however,if the are viewed instead more as individual potential issue that we unlike the district court have not is not difficult to see how an agreement among them not to mirror image of players section create a monopsony and eliminate competition among them.see iii areeda hovenkamp,supra,at.such an act would arguably exclude competition for purposes of section,even if it did not harm individual competitors.anyway,exclusion is only a gloss on the statutory term monopolize and merger to monopoly,benign as to the merged competitors,is a feasible section claim,see golden grain macaroni ftc,cir,even if it is more often challenged under clayton act section,which requires much less.
nonetheless,the jury findings remain as an obstacle.attempt and monopolization both require a showing that a market has been or may well be subject to monopoly power,spectrum sports,mcquillan,d the only market alleged by the players was rejected by the jury and this dooms the players section claims regardless of which exclusive arrangement with the ussf or the agreement not to compete for alleged to satisfy the exclusionary act element of the cause of action.this assumes,however,that the jury verdict stands.
not surprisingly,players next shift their focus to the jury verdict.they say the jury market findings were tainted by several trial errors.we review the jury instructions de novo,ponce ashford presbyterian cmty,cir,and the court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion unless as is occasionally true an issue of abstract law is presented,united states sposito,cir.
first,players say the court instructions to the jury on how to define the relevant market were inaccurate and misleading.players claim the instructions left the jury unable to weigh the significance of evidence showing that some mls players had employment opportunities in other leagues.for example,mls offered testimony that its players had played in different foreign leagues,prior to or after playing for mls plaintiffs countered that the opportunities were more limited and less attractive than mls claimed.
specifically,plaintiffs complain that the district court refused to give two requested instructions first,that the jury in defining the relevant market should consider whether any effective competition significantly restrains mls ability to control wages for its players and second,that the jury should include in the relevant market only those leagues which are sufficiently attractive and practically available to a large enough number of mls players to prevent mls from having the power to pay wages below competitive market levels.
the first problem is that the plaintiffs did not preserve these two requests by making,as.requires,a objection stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.plaintiffs did not repeat these two requests in the same words instead they objected after the charge that the instructions had overemphasized the concept of substitutability at the expense of other factors that have been identified in the case law,which plaintiffs brief in this court says includes the ability of other leagues to constrain the power of mls to depress plaintiffs wages.
unfortunately,plaintiffs counsel did not spell out the last quoted objection at the conference.to refer only to other factors obviously does not tell the judge just what previously requested instruction has been omitted or identify the factors claimed to be insufficiently stressed.davis rennie,cir.accordingly,the failure to give the two instructions in question is reviewed only for plain error especially in a civil case this is a very hard test to meet because over and above plain error,it requires a showing both of prejudice and a miscarriage of justice or something of this magnitude.see id.at.
as it happens,the district court gave standard instructions on market definition which,to a considerable extent,tracked the aba model jury instructions in civil antitrust cases.aba sample jury instructions in civil antitrust cases,at to.it defined monopoly power as the power to pay lower than competitive wages for the services being acquired without having the sellers of those to another league or team for employment and it explained that the geographic market was the geographic area to which players can turn,as a practical matter,for alternate opportunities for employment as professional soccer players.accord united states philadelphia bank,d tampa nashville coal,d.
the district court could permissibly have enlarged on the issue,explaining for example that a foreign league would be more likely part of the market as the number of players who could turn to it increased.but how much to elaborate is largely the discretion of the district court,interstate litho brown,cir,cert.denied,d,and in some respects,the players more detailed formulation could itself be misleading mls could be constrained so long as enough individual players had an alternative foreign league even if an individual foreign league would by itself attract or be available to only a small number of players 
next,players claim the court erred in permitting alan rothenberg,one of the founders of mls and former president of the ussf,to testify about a legal opinion received by the ussf while shielding the opinion from discovery or questioning.on direct and then on,rothenberg disclosed without detail that the ussf board had obtained a legal opinion that it was lawful to grant exclusive division i certification to a single league.at trial,the players sought to discover the opinion or have all references to it struck.the court denied both requests,finding that rothenberg had not waived the privilege by making his brief references.
it is true,as mls asserts,that the statement was first adduced on direct examination by plaintiffs,and its repetition on cross added nothing new.on the other hand,plaintiffs did not ask the witness whether a legal opinion had been sought or about its contents.the witness,himself a lawyer,more or less volunteered this information.possibly,the district judge felt that the disclosure,even if not directly invited,was legitimate because otherwise the had been asked whether antitrust concerns had been raised by the ussf have been forced to leave the impression that they had been raised but not seriously addressed or resolved.
we think that if defense counsel had adduced this disclosure in the first instance it would be unfair to allow the legal opinion to be used affirmatively without allowing plaintiffs to examine it or,at the very least,requiring a severe limiting instruction which plaintiffs did not request.the case law is mixed as to whether there is a waiver of the privilege where there is a very limited disclosure as to the ultimate opinion without a disclosure of contents and the answer may depend upon context but on our facts,it is fairly arguable that the plaintiffs opened the door to the response and,if so,could not use their own conduct to force the waiver.
so viewed,the district court decision is tested under an abuse of discretion standard,and we are unwilling to say that the decision here was an abuse.whatever discomfort we there is assuaged by our grave doubt that rothenberg disclosure of the opinion as to lawfulness could have had any effect on a jury verdict that plaintiffs had failed to prove the relevant market they alleged.plaintiffs make a stab at showing prejudice by equating the failure to prove the relevant market with lawfulness but although this might be plausible in the abstract,the notion that the jury decided an essentially factual issue,as to which there was a mass of conflicting evidence,on the basis of a brief reference to a legal opinion seems to us highly remote.
next,players say the court erred in excluding two pieces of documentary evidence that supported their claims of market definition and market power.the first is a september correspondence between clark hunt,a prospective mls,and mark abbott,an executive working on the formation of mls,regarding assumptions made in a financial model disseminated by the league organizers.hunt later became an in the league through a firm he helped form,which was a defendant below abbott became a senior league officer.
in his letter,hunt urged that the team player salary budget be reduced by,with the bulk of the reduction coming from the bottom players on each team whose only alternative is to play in one of the other professional leagues or one of the lower division foreign leagues.hunt also suggested that salary growth should also be limited to five percent a year,reasoning that u ntil there is significant competition for mls players,the rate of salary growth should be relatively easy to contain.in response,abbott cautioned that a reduction of in player salaries per team would impact the quality of players we are able to attract.at the same time,he agreed that,for modeling purposes the player salaries should be held to a increase per year.
the court excluded the correspondence,finding it irrelevant since it was not made by someone who matters to the case and the transcript then reveals a colloquy in which the parties argue about the issue with the judge.plaintiffs main basis for urging admission of the hunt letter was that it tended to show hunt own intent to monopolize,the suggestion being that this view should also be attributed to the firm that hunt formed apparently later which became an and defendant in the case.on this appeal,plaintiffs switch grounds and urge that the hunt letter and abbott reply as well were evidence of plaintiffs proposed market definition.
whether the evidence should have been admitted to show intent on the attempt to monopolize claim is a nice issue but irrelevant here since the jury resolved the case on market definition grounds.plaintiffs present claim that the evidence should have been admitted to bolster their market theory and show the existence of monopoly power founders because it was never offered for that purpose.see united states josleyn,cir.further,although no hearsay objection was made,an interesting question remains whether hunt statement as a prospective investor is properly admissible for either purpose as an admission of the defendant firm that hunt later helped form.d.
as to abbott letter,it appears from the transcript that the court was prepared to consider admitting the letter without the hunt document but plaintiffs counsel understandably demurred.abbott statements are quite tame the first suggests a lack of market power as to quality players and the second was for modeling purposes.plaintiffs further abbott was adopting on behalf of mls whatever was said in the hunt a stretch that the language of the letter does not support.
further,any error was harmless.players were allowed to introduce numerous other documents,authored by mls itself,expressing virtually the same opinions.for example,players were allowed to introduce a november offering memorandum,in which mls admits that it does not view the division i and division ii or indoor soccer leagues as significant competition.and at trial,players economic expert,roger noll,relied on these documents to support his testimony and conclusions.the excluded correspondence was thus redundant and could hardly have changed the outcome.
the next piece of evidence is a march internal memorandum written by two employees of the investment firm donaldson,lufkin jenrette dlj.mls promoters had approached dlj to act as its financial advisor.in the memo,the dlj employees conclude that mls has favorable prospects for success,noting,inter alia,that the league will be able to operate with a strict salary cap,and that there is a plentiful supply of good american players that have limited professional opportunities to play elsewhere.
the court excluded the memo,first,on hearsay grounds,since it was unclear whether an agency relationship existed at the time the memo was drafted and whether its contents were within the scope of the agency.d d and second,on relevance grounds,since the views were not attributable to mls.on appeal,plaintiffs simply do not respond to the claim that at the time the statement was made,dlj was an independent contractor and not an agent of mls.see merrick farmers ins.group,cir.
in all events,the other documents discussed above which were introduced into evidence contained virtually identical statements penned by mls itself attesting to mls early view that competition in the market was limited.and the dlj memo,while helpful to players cause,was hardly dispositive it addressed only the opportunities of american soccer players and said nothing about the of mls players who have foreign or dual citizenship and yet are part of plaintiffs class.by contrast,mls own statements which were introduced were more helpful to plaintiffs.
next,players claim the court erred in permitting a defense witness,neil farnsworth,of a seattle division ii professional soccer team,to testify that he was competing with mls for two specific players,while refusing to identify the players by name on confidentiality grounds.
at trial,farnsworth testified that 
we compete with mls for players every day.we have a situation right now where i have one player that is being courted by mls.he rejected one offer by mls now to stay with us.
we also have a player from mls that has played in mls for probably four years that has contacted us for next season expressing an interest to play for us and then play indoor in addition to playing for us,instead of playing for mls.
on by players counsel,farnsworth revealed certain details about the player from his own team,including his salary,but he refused to identify either that player or his mls recruit by name,claiming he wanted to keep the information confidential.players objections were denied the district court ruled that the players privacy was at stake,and therefore,that their names were properly excludable under.the court also refused players request to instruct the jury to ignore the testimony.
players claim the district court infringed their right to farnsworth and to test the truth of his assertions.to be sure,the court has the authority to protect witnesses against that does little to impair their credibility but that may damage their reputation,invade their privacy,and assault their personality.rule would permit the protection of even total strangers to the action.wright graham,federal practice and procedure citation omitted see.a.but this power is limited to situations in which the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
although much discretion resides in the trial judge in striking this balance,gasperini ctr.for humanities,cir,the denial of the names certainly limited plaintiffs ability to farnsworth and it is unclear to us just what substantial privacy interest was at stake if anything,the players would want to shield their names from mls,but the league knew whom it was courting from farnsworth team and the possible defector presumably would in due course use farnsworth overtures in bargaining with mls.
nonetheless,even without the names,players were able to test farnsworth testimony and other current and former players and soccer to player movement between leagues.for example,ivan gazidas,mls vice president of operations and player relations,testified at length concerning the competition mls faced to attract the talents of several named players from other leagues.farnsworth anecdotal testimony,while somewhat helpful to mls,was by no means the most powerful evidence adduced at trial to demonstrate competition.accordingly,we find the error was harmless.
finally,players claim the court erred in admitting in evidence a chart summarizing the testimony of two defense witnesses and later permitting the jury to take the chart with them into the jury room for deliberations.the summary chart listed professional soccer leagues of different divisions from countries at trial,the two witnesses testified that mls players had experience in each of the leagues and marked the chart accordingly.both sides used demonstratives at trial which were admitted into evidence while players complain generally about the use of the demonstratives,this summary chart is the only item they single out on appeal.
in admitting the summaries,the district court reasoned that the demonstratives would help the jury to think about a complex case.at the same time,it recognized the risks involved,see air safety roman catholic archbishop,cir,and emphasized in its instructions to the jury that summaries do not present any independent evidence.it further cautioned them that the summaries are admitted for your convenience and not to substitute for the full testimony of the witnesses.
it is hard to imagine an issue on which a trial judge enjoys more discretion than as to whether summary exhibits will be helpful.nothing precludes their use with respect to oral testimony here the issues involved in the case and the testimony were complicated and the jury was properly cautioned as to the limited role of summaries.although the court admitted the charts as evidence,its instruction made clear that they were merely aids and that the testimony controlled.we find no abuse of discretion and need not concern ourselves with whether,as mls claims,the objection was somehow waived.
conspiracy to monopolize.in their third and final section claim,players allege that mls conspired with the ussf to prevent any other entity from being sanctioned as a division i professional soccer league in the united states or otherwise competing against mls.the court decided that players were required to prove the existence of their relevant market on the conspiracy to monopolize claim it directed the jury to end its inquiry on all section claims if it found players had failed to prove the existence of their market.
at trial and now on appeal,players say claims of combination or conspiracy to monopolize do not require proof of a relevant market.for these purposes plaintiffs are not distinguishing between the concept of a relevant market and the concepts of monopoly or market power they are arguing that the prospect that the alleged conspiracy if successful would achieve monopsony power in a real economic market was irrelevant to their claim.instead,they say they were required to prove only the existence of the conspiracy an overt act in furtherance of it and specific intent to monopolize,salco motors,cir.
conspiracy to monopolize claims are not often the subject of much attention,since almost any such claim could be proved more easily under section ban on conspiracies in restraint of trade.iiia areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law.however,a majority of courts that have touched the issue have said,in general terms and often without analysis,that proof of a relevant market,and hence,market power,is not required in a conspiracy to monopolize claim,salco,at see iiia areeda hovenkamp,supra,at collecting cases aba sample jury instructions in civil antitrust cases,supra,at.
on the other side,there are also a number of decisions that say that a relevant market is necessary that is also the view of the more persuasive commentary,including the most respected of the antitrust treatises.iiia areeda hovenkamp,supra,at accord comment,the relevant market concept in conspiracy to monopolize cases under section of the sherman act,chi.although we lean toward this view as a general matter,a black or white rule is not inevitable there may in principle be some cases in which one could argue that a conspiracy claim should be provable without a showing that the alleged market is a real economic market.this case is not among them.
here the conspiratorial agreement is a garden variety exclusive dealing arrangement limited to three years.such agreements are not inherently unlawful they are judged primarily by considering,in addition to competitive or efficiency justifications,any actual or threatened adverse effects on competition.tampa,at.healthcare,healthsource,cir.predicted effects turn,obviously,on the establishment of a market in which the exclusive dealing arrangement may affect prices or competitors.absent threatened effects,there is normally no basis for condemning an exclusive dealing arrangement.
all implemented exclusive dealing contracts involve both a nominal conspiracy the agreement and acts in furtherance whatever dealings take place.to tell a jury that it may condemn such proof of any threatened effect on the create not only confusion for the jury but invite an end run around the threatened effects required by the case law for exclusive dealing under both section and the attempt and monopolization requirements of section.iiia areeda hovenkamp,supra,at.
the point is summed up neatly in the treatise 
where the agreements involved would also be held to offend without the necessity of proving power,the failure to require it for the conspiracy offense is understandable.however,in those instances where market power is a prerequisite to holding an agreement to be an unreasonable restraint of joint venture,for would make no sense to hold the same agreement offensive to without proof of power.to require power under before condemning a particular agreement is necessarily to say that the arrangement is socially desirable,or at least not harmful,in the absence of power.that policy conclusion can not sensibly be avoided or negated by the simple trick of calling the agreement a conspiracy to monopolize.
iiia areeda hovenkamp,supra,at emphasis added.
where parties agree to achieve an admittedly unlawful result,such as a murder or burglary,there is case law to the effect that the prosecutor need not show that the plan was feasible and that impossibility at least in some situations is not a defense.lafave scott,substantive criminal law b developments in the conspiracy,harv.this is presumably the source of the antitrust case law relied on by plaintiffs.but the rationale of this classic view is that the conspiracy should be punished because the demonstrated intent to break the law shows that the conspirators are dangerous
