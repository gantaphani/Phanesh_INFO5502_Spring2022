quinnipiac university appeals pursuant to a from a permanent injunction ordered on july,by the united states district court for the district of connecticut stefan underhill,judge,after a bench trial at which quinnipiac was found to have violated title ix of the education amendments of title ix by failing to afford equal participation opportunities in varsity sports to female students.see biediger quinnipiac,d.quinnipiac argues that the injunction,which prohibits any such future discrimination,should be vacated because it is based on a title ix ruling infected by errors in counting the varsity athletic participation opportunities afforded quinnipiac female students in the school year.specifically,quinnipiac faults the district court for excluding from its count of the total athletic participation opportunities afforded female students roster positions on the women indoor and outdoor track and field teams,held by members of quinnipiac women team who were required to join the track teams even though they were unable to compete in because they were injured or and all roster positions on quinnipiac nascent women competitive cheerleading team,based on a finding that the team did not afford the athletic participation opportunities of a varsity sport.quinnipiac further contends that,even if these roster positions should not count as varsity athletic participation opportunities for women,the district court erred in concluding that the resulting disparity between the percentage of all participation opportunities in varsity sports afforded female students and the percentage of enrolled female undergraduates established a title ix violation warranting the challenged injunctive relief.
we identify no merit in these arguments,and we affirm the challenged injunction substantially for the reasons stated by the district court in its comprehensive and well reasoned opinion.
background 
quinnipiac decision to eliminate women volleyball prompts this title ix action 
this lawsuit has its origins in quinnipiac march announcement that in the academic year,it would eliminate its varsity sports teams for women volleyball,men golf,and men outdoor track and field,while simultaneously creating a new varsity sports team for women competitive cheerleading.plaintiffs,five quinnipiac women volleyball players and their coach,robin sparks,filed this action in april,charging the university with violating title ix by denying women equal varsity athletic participation opportunities,and seeking an injunction that,among other things,prevented quinnipiac from eliminating its women volleyball team.after a hearing,the district court preliminarily enjoined quinnipiac from withdrawing support from its volleyball team,finding that quinnipiac systematically and artificially increased women teams rosters and decreased men teams rosters to achieve the appearance of title ix compliance.see biediger quinnipiac,d.the district court subsequently certified a plaintiff class of all present and future female quinnipiac students who had been or would be harmed by the alleged title ix discrimination and sought injunctive relief.see biediger quinnipiac,cv sru,wl.may.in june,the district court conducted a bench trial on plaintiffs claim of disproportionate allocation of athletic participation opportunities and,finding in their favor,granted permanent injunctive relief 
statutory and regulatory background 
to discuss the district court challenged ruling further,we must briefly review certain controlling law and regulations.
title ix provides,in relevant part,that n o person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.although the statutory language makes no mention of athletics programs,the former department of health,education and welfare hew and its successor agency,the department of education doe,have interpreted title ix to require recipients of federal financial assistance operating or sponsoring interscholastic,intercollegiate,club or intramural athletics to provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes.c.
section c provides a list of factors relevant to determining whether equal athletic opportunities are available 
whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes the provision of equipment and supplies scheduling of games and practice time travel and per diem allowance opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors provision of locker rooms,practice and competitive facilities provision of medical and training facilities and services provision of housing and dining facilities and services publicity.
id.title ix claims of sex discrimination in athletics fall into two categories based on the c factors to which the claims are addressed effective accommodation claims focus on c,and equal treatment claims focus on c.see mccormick ex rel.mccormick sch.dist.of mamaroneck,cir accord parker franklin cnty.cmty.sch,cir.at issue in this appeal is plaintiffs effective accommodation claim.
in,hew published in the federal register a policy interpretation of c,which states that a school compliance with the effective accommodation requirement will be assessed in any one of the following ways 
whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments or 
where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes,whether the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of the members of that sex or 
where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes and the institution can not show a continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above,whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.
policy interpretation.the policy interpretation thus affords a school three safe harbors in defending against an effective accommodation claim under c.
in,the doe office of civil rights ocr,which is responsible for enforcement of title ix,see a,clarified that the analysis for determining whether a university affords substantially proportionate participation opportunities to athletes of both sexes under the first prong of the test the prong relied on by quinnipiac in defending against plaintiffs title ix effective accommodation claim begins with a determination of the number of participation opportunities afforded to male and female athletes in the intercollegiate athletic program.ocr,doe,clarification of intercollegiate athletics policy guidance the three part test,at,clarification ocr explained that,a s a general rule,all athletes who are listed on a team squad or eligibility list and are on the team as of the team first competitive event are counted as participants.id.at.further,an athlete who participates in more than one sport will be counted as a participant in each sport in which he or she participates.id.it is not necessary for an athlete to meet minimum criteria of playing time or athletic ability to count as a participant.as ocr explained,athletes who practice but may not compete nevertheless receive numerous benefits and services,such as training and practice time,coaching,tutoring services,locker room facilities,and equipment,as well as important benefits derived from being a member of an intercollegiate athletic team.id.thus,it is necessary to count all athletes who receive such benefits when determining the number of athletic opportunities provided to men and women.id.in a letter accompanying the clarification,however,ocr sounded a note of caution for an athlete to be counted,he or she must be afforded a participation opportunity that is real,not illusory,in that it offers the same benefits as would be provided to other bona fide athletes.see letter from norma cant√∫,assistant sec y for civil rights,ocr,doe,to colleagues,at,ocr letter.
in a letter,ocr explained that a genuine athletic participation opportunity must take place in the context of a sport.letter from stephanie monroe,assistant sec y for civil rights,ocr,doe,to colleagues,at,ocr letter.if a school is a member of a recognized intercollegiate athletic organization,such as the national collegiate athletic association ncaa,that subjects the activity at issue to its organizational requirements,ocr will presume that the activity is a sport and that participation can be counted under title ix.id.at.but if that presumption does not apply or has been rebutted,ocr will determine whether the activity qualifies as a sport by reference to several factors relating to program structure and administration and team preparation and competition.id.at.
eight years earlier,in,ocr had issued two letters stating that cheerleading,whether of the sideline or competitive variety,was presumptively not a sport,and that team members could not be counted as athletes under title ix.see letter from mary frances,coordinator for title ix athletics,ocr,doe,to david stead,exec.state high sch.league,at,april ocr letter accord letter from mary frances,coordinator for title ix athletics,ocr,doe,to david stead,exec.state high sch.league,at may,may ocr letter.while the letters indicated ocr willingness to review particular cheerleading programs on a basis,the parties stipulated in the district court that,since,ocr has never recognized an intercollegiate varsity cheerleading program to be a sport for title ix purposes.see biediger quinnipiac,d at.nor has quinnipiac ever sought ocr recognition of its competitive cheerleading program as a sports activity.see id.at.
once the numbers of real athletic participation opportunities afforded men and women have been determined in light of these principles,the next step of title ix analysis considers whether the numbers are substantially proportionate to each sex enrollment.see clarification at.ocr has not construed substantial proportionality to require exact proportionality.rather,substantial proportionality is determined on a basis in light of the institution specific circumstances and the size of its athletic program.id.as a baseline,ocr will consider substantial proportionality achieved if the number of additional participants necessary required for exact proportionality would not be sufficient to sustain a viable team.id.
ocr affords schools considerable flexibility and choice in deciding how to provide substantially proportionate athletic opportunities to students of both sexes,including by eliminating teams,placing caps on its rosters,ocr letter at,or e xpanding athletic opportunities through new sports,ocr letter at.
c.the district court ruling 
at trial,quinnipiac maintained that it offered athletic participation opportunities to male and female undergraduates substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments.in support,it pointed to evidence showing that,of the students enrolled in quinnipiac undergraduate programs in the academic year,were female and were male.varsity rosters for the first day of team competitions in listed varsity athletes,of whom were female and were male.thus,quinnipiac maintained that women represented of the total student body and of all varsity athletes,while men represented of the student body and of all varsity athletes.see biediger quinnipiac,d at.
plaintiffs challenged quinnipiac count of its varsity athletes,arguing that the university manipulated its team rosters to produce artificially undersized men teams and artificially oversize women teams counting the same women membership on,indoor track,and outdoor track teams as three distinct athletic participation opportunities was unwarranted because quinnipiac indoor and outdoor track teams did not afford athletes genuine and distinct benefits and women who participated on the competitive cheerleading team should not be counted at all because the activity had not yet achieved the status of an intercollegiate varsity sport.see id.at.
after trial,the district court issued a detailed memorandum of decision in favor of plaintiffs.therein,the district court rejected plaintiffs contention that,in setting roster targets for each of its teams,quinnipiac had manipulated the rosters so as to undercount male participants and overcount female participants,or to set artificially high targets for women teams that denied women participants genuine athletic opportunities.see id.at.at the same time,the district court identified concerns about how quinnipiac counted athletes participating on its women,indoor track,and outdoor track teams,stating that it recall ed roster manipulations similar to those identified in its preliminary injunction opinion.id.at.nevertheless,in counting the genuine athletic participation opportunities,the district court declined to discount the athlete rosters for either track team by based on the number of positions held on each team by runners.instead,it discounted the number of genuine participation opportunities in women indoor track by five,for a total of,and in women outdoor track by six,for a total of,because the numbers represented runners required to participate in track despite being injured and.see id.at.the district court also decided that none of the roster positions assigned to women competitive cheerleading should be counted because the activity did not yet afford genuine athletic participation opportunities in a varsity sport.see id.at.
expanding quinnipiac reported roster positions for male athletes by one to reflect an additional participant on the men ice hockey team revealed at trial,see id.at,the district court counted a total of varsity athletic participation opportunities,see id.at.of these,it found that or were assigned to women and or were assigned to men.see id.the district court observed that in strictly numerical terms,a disparity between quinnipiac women varsity athletic participation and their representation in the undergraduate population reflected only a borderline case of disproportionate athletic opportunities for women.id.nevertheless,the district court concluded that the disparity was significant enough to support judgment in favor of plaintiffs because the disparity was caused by quinnipiac own actions and not by natural fluctuations in enrollment and it was reasonable to expect quinnipiac to close the gap because the roster positions needed for that purpose would be enough to field a viable women athletic team,and such a team already existed in the form of the women volleyball team.see id.at.
accordingly,the district court entered a declaratory judgment finding quinnipiac to have violated title ix and its implementing regulations by discriminating against women in failing to provide equal athletic participation opportunities to female students,and it permanently enjoined quinnipiac from continuing to discriminate in this manner.the district court ordered quinnipiac to submit a plan for complying with the injunction,which plan was to provide for continuation of the women volleyball team during the athletic season.see id.at.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
quinnipiac argument and the standard of review 
quinnipiac challenges the district court award of permanent injunctive relief by attacking the finding of title ix sex discrimination on which the relief is premised.although the finding of sex discrimination is incorporated in a declaratory judgment that is not yet final and,therefore,not itself appealable,we nevertheless have jurisdiction to review the finding because it is inextricably intertwined with the challenged injunctive relief over which we do have interlocutory appellate jurisdiction pursuant to a.lamar adver.of penn,llc town of orchard park,cir.
quinnipiac contends that the district court finding of sex discrimination is infected by three errors the exclusion of positions on the women indoor and outdoor track teams from its count of varsity athletic participation opportunities,the exclusion of all competitive cheerleading positions from its count of varsity athletic participation opportunities,and the determination that an identified disparity between women representation in quinnipiac student body and on its varsity sports teams sufficed to show that women were not afforded substantially proportionate varsity athletic participation opportunities.
we review the award of permanent injunctive relief for abuse of discretion,see city of new york mickalis pawn shop,llc,cir,but where,as here,appellant does not challenge the scope of such relief but its basis in law and fact,we review the district court factual findings only for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo,see city of new york golden feather smoke shop,cir accord bessemer trust,branin,cir noting strong presumption in favor of trial court findings of fact,which appellate court will not upset absent definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed internal quotation marks omitted see also.a providing that findings of fact made by district court in nonjury trial must not be set aside by reviewing court unless clearly erroneous.
deference to agency interpretation of title ix implementing regulations 
in addressing quinnipiac arguments,we note at the outset that no party challenges the district court reliance on agency policy statements and letters interpreting c.this court has already ruled that the policy interpretation of c is entitled to a particularly high degree of judicial deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d,because congress explicitly delegated to the administering agency the task of prescribing standards for athletic programs under title ix.mccormick ex rel.mccormick sch.dist.of mamaroneck,at internal quotation marks omitted we here conclude that the clarification,the accompanying ocr letter,and the and ocr letters are likewise entitled to substantial deference under auer robbins,d,because they reflect reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguities in its own regulation,and there is no reason to think that the agency interpretations do not reflect its fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.mullins city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted see mansourian regents of of,cir collecting cases deferring to policy interpretation and clarification.indeed,even if the agency interpretations of c reflected in the clarification and subsequent letters were not entitled to auer deference,they would be entitled to substantial deference under united states mead,d,because their logical consistency with the agency earlier policy interpretation amplifies their power to persuade.christopher smithkline beecham,d,quoting mead,at according agency interpretation of own regulation deference proportional to its persuasiveness under mead,where interpretation not entitled to controlling deference under auer.
in contrast to the parties,amicus curiae eagle forum education legal defense fund argues that continued judicial deference to the agency policy interpretation of c,see mccormick ex rel.mccormick sch.dist.of mamaroneck,at,is unwarranted after alexander sandoval,d holding private cause of action for disparate impact unavailable under,which prohibits discrimination on the ground of race,color,or national origin,because the test imposes a disparate impact standard for liability exceeding the statutory prohibition of intentional discrimination.assuming that we would consider an amicus argument not joined in by any party,see united states ionia mgmt,cir noting appellate court not obligated to consider arguments presented only by amicus,and assuming further that a challenge to our mccormick precedent would not require en banc review,see shipping of india jaldhi overseas pte,cir recognizing that panel bound by prior decisions until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court internal quotation marks omitted,we would not be persuaded in any event.the argument rests on a mistaken assumption that plaintiffs claim disparate impact.in fact,their complaint is disparate treatment.it is useful to clarify this point.
title ix has been construed to prohibit the intentional exclusion of students from collegiate athletics programs on the basis of sex.see a a.a school decision to provide students with athletic participation opportunities through separate sports programs for each sex thus necessarily raises a disparate treatment rather than disparate impact claim in that the school decides which athletic opportunities are available to particular students on the basis of sex.a ricci destefano,d holding that city engaged in disparate treatment on basis of race in discarding results of firefighter promotional exam because higher scoring candidates were white,despite city proffered objective to avoid disparate impact of test on black candidates.the critical question in this case is thus not whether quinnipiac disparate treatment of varsity athletes was based on their sex,but whether the treatment constituted unlawful discrimination under title ix.
as ocr has interpreted a,not every decision to maintain separate sports programs for male and female students constitutes proscribed discrimination.see b.a choice to allocate specific athletic opportunities on the basis of sex will not violate title ix provided that,in general,the participation opportunities afforded the two sexes are equal.id.c.plaintiffs here alleged that quinnipiac did not treat men and women equally in allocating athletic participation opportunities because the opportunities afforded women were not substantially proportionate to women undergraduate enrollment,and did not fully and effectively accommodate women athletic interests and abilities.see cohen brown,st cir.the test did not reduce plaintiffs burden to prove these elements of their disparate treatment claim.rather,it afforded quinnipiac three distinct opportunities to demonstrate that its treatment of athletes was not unlawful.see boucher syracuse,cir recognizing test to provide school with three safe harbor defenses,each independently sufficient to defeat claim of unlawful disparate treatment in accommodating athletic interests of both male and female students ricci destefano,at the question is not whether that conduct was discriminatory but whether the city had a lawful justification for its action.
here,quinnipiac elected to defend against plaintiffs discrimination claim only by reference to the first safe harbor created by the test,arguing that its athletics program provided substantially proportionate athletic participation opportunities to women.for reasons we discuss infra at,the district court reasonably found to the contrary,thus simultaneously rejecting quinnipiac defense and finding for plaintiffs on the first element of their disparate treatment claim.to the extent that plaintiffs further offered evidence that quinnipiac disproportionate provision of athletic participation opportunities failed fully and effectively to accommodate the athletic interests and abilities of its female undergraduates insofar as it eliminated the women volleyball team,quinnipiac did not dispute the point nor did it attempt to argue that the school has a history of expanding women athletic participation opportunities.
in sum,as a matter of quinnipiac litigation strategy,resolution of this case effectively turned on whether quinnipiac sex based treatment of varsity athletes provided its female students with genuine athletic participation opportunities substantially proportionate to their enrollment.because the district court found that it did not,plaintiffs carried their burden to prove unlawful disparate treatment.in these circumstances,amicus curiae challenge to the judicial deference accorded the agency policy interpretation generally,or its articulated test specifically,is unpersuasive.
athletic participation opportunities for women runners discounting the reported numbers for indoor and outdoor track 
during the academic year,the roster for quinnipiac women team listed athletes the roster for its women indoor track team listed athletes and the roster for its women outdoor track team listed athletes.quinnipiac faults the district court for concluding that this represented rather than genuine athletic participation opportunities for women runners.we identify no error of law or fact in the district court carefully reasoned resolution of this issue.
before the district court,plaintiffs argued that quinnipiac should not be allowed to count as athletic participation opportunities the,indoor track,and outdoor track roster positions held by the same women.as the district court recognized,the issue admitted no easy resolution.the clarification plainly states that an athlete who participates in more than one sport will be counted as a participant in each sport in which she participates.clarification at.but the trial evidence reflected circumstances not addressed in the clarification quinnipiac women runners were not afforded a choice as to whether to participate in more than one sport they were required to do so.specifically,their participation on the team was conditioned on their membership on the indoor and outdoor track teams.see biediger quinnipiac,d at.no other quinnipiac athletes were required to join multiple sports teams.see id.notably,male runners were not required to join men indoor and outdoor track teams,as quinnipiac had no such teams in.see id.indeed,male runners were prohibited from representing quinnipiac as individual entrants in indoor and outdoor track events.see id.at.as the district court recognized,these circumstances raise questions as to whether simultaneous participation on the women,indoor track,and outdoor track teams at quinnipiac represented three genuine athletic opportunities,or whether runners mandated participation on the indoor and outdoor track teams was simply a form of alternative training for the runners,one that allowed quinnipiac to inflate the rosters of its women indoor and outdoor track teams.
in this respect,the district court carefully reviewed evidence that we only summarize quinnipiac had a highly competitive women team,which,by the school year,had won the last five new england conference championships,see id.at runners mandated participation on the indoor and outdoor track teams afforded these runners more training time albeit for a different type of running during the than ncaa rules would otherwise have allowed,see id.at quinnipiac expanded its indoor and outdoor track teams rosters to accommodate mandated participation by runners,see id.at despite the resulting large rosters,quinnipiac indoor and outdoor track teams participated in only the minimum number of track and field tournaments required by the ncaa and were never competitive for team awards as no quinnipiac athletes entered field events,see id.at and quinnipiac offered scholarship money only to those members of the indoor and outdoor track teams who also ran,see id.at.the totality of these circumstances suggested that the positions on quinnipiac indoor and outdoor track team rosters were not reflective of genuine participation opportunities in these sports,but were inflated to afford mandated training for the members of the women team.
while identifying such a concern,the district court nevertheless proceeded cautiously in drawing conclusions as to any title ix violation.notably,it decided that the evidence did not justify discounting all of the runners participation on the women indoor and outdoor track teams.id.at emphasis added.such a ruling would have reduced by the number of athletic participation opportunities that quinnipiac claimed to afford female students.in explaining its decision,the district court observed that of the women runners had competed for quinnipiac in four or more indoor track meets,accounting for of the team races.see id.at.meanwhile,of the women runners had competed for quinnipiac in three or more outdoor track meets,accounting for of the team races.see id.finding that this reflected a substantial contribution by runners to quinnipiac indoor and outdoor track teams,the district court concluded that the school title ix calculation should account for it,regardless of whether runners participation in indoor and outdoor track was mandated.id.thus,it rejected plaintiffs argument that these runners should not also be viewed as having been afforded further athletic participation opportunities as members of the indoor and outdoor track teams.
at the same time,however,the district court persuasively explained why a smaller number of runners,required to join quinnipiac track teams but participating in no competitions or in one case,only one competition could not be viewed as having been afforded multiple genuine athletic participation opportunities.specifically,five positions on the indoor track team and six positions on the outdoor track team were held by runners who did not and effectively could not avail themselves of distinct participation opportunities on the track teams because they were injured or.see id.at.not only did these injured or runners not compete in indoor or outdoor track events,they received no benefits from membership on these teams beyond those that they were already receiving as injured or members of the team during that sport.see id.at thus,the district court concluded that for injured and runners,the athletic participation opportunities afforded by mandated membership on the indoor and outdoor track teams were truly illusory.id.at.
what was not illusory,however,was quinnipiac ability to pad its rosters with female athletes who had no hope of competing or otherwise participating meaningfully during the indoor and outdoor track seasons.id.as the district court aptly observed,it would be unacceptable for quinnipiac to pump up its women track team rosters by requiring every injured field hockey,soccer,and volleyball player to join these teams even though they would never actually compete in the indoor and outdoor track seasons and,for that matter,would never want to enter a race.id.but,the district court found,that is essentially what quinnipiac is doing with its injured runners.id.thus,the district court discounted quinnipiac claimed athletic participation opportunities in indoor track by five,and its claimed athletic participation opportunities in outdoor track by six.see id.at.we conclude that this reduction in the total number of athletic participation opportunities for women runners in,indoor track,and outdoor track from quinnipiac claimed to an actual is fully supported by the record evidence and by the applicable law.
in challenging this action,quinnipiac complains that it was denied due process by lack of notice that the question of whether injured and runners were afforded genuine athletic participation opportunities in indoor and outdoor track was at issue.we are not convinced.as quinnipiac concedes,it certainly had notice that plaintiffs were challenging quinnipiac practice of counting runners who were listed as members of the indoor and outdoor track teams as each having been afforded three distinct athletic participation opportunities.we consider this sufficient to have alerted quinnipiac that the practice was at issue and that quinnipiac should prepare to defend it,both generally and specifically as applied to runners who were incapable of competing in any indoor or outdoor track events.the fact that quinnipiac had notice of the issue in dispute and the opportunity to defend its challenged actions distinguishes this case from doubleday,curtis,cir,in which this court invoked due process to reverse the dismissal of a plaintiff claim on the basis of an affirmative defense not pleaded or raised by the defendant in a bench trial,as well as from green town of blooming grove,cir,in which this court reversed a judgment entered after trial on a pendant state claim that was not pleaded by plaintiff with its federal claim,and that defendant had not been afforded an opportunity to defend against.
quinnipiac further complains that it was not given notice that the district court would draw a negative inference about the genuineness of the indoor and outdoor track participation opportunities afforded female runners from the fact that the runners were required to join the track team.a factfinder ability to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence is well established,see,diesel props.greystone bus.credit ii llc,cir recognizing court obligation as trier of fact to determine which of the witnesses it finds credible,which of the permissible competing inferences it will draw,and whether the party having the burden of proof has persuaded it as factfinder that the requisite facts are proven internal quotation marks omitted,and quinnipiac points us to no precedent holding that a factfinder must notify parties in advance of the particular inferences it is inclined to draw from record evidence.indeed,we here reject that argument.quinnipiac is entitled to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the inference drawn by the district court,but in the absence of a sufficiency concern,if quinnipiac failed to appreciate the possible adverse significance of a mandate that runners join the school indoor and outdoor track teams,the fault was its own,not the district court.
insofar as quinnipiac questions the sufficiency of the trial evidence to establish a track participation requirement,the argument borders on the frivolous.when carolyn martin,who coached all quinnipiac running teams,was asked at her deposition about women runners also running track,she stated,i require them to.martin dep.at.further,the thrust of coach martin testimony was that women runners indoor and outdoor track participation was a given.this was sufficient to permit the district court to find that quinnipiac required runners to join the indoor and outdoor track teams.indeed,the conclusion was reinforced by evidence that each of quinnipiac runners was listed on the indoor and outdoor track team rosters,including those runners who were injured or.insofar as quinnipiac points to its expert testimony that runners almost always compete on the track teams,to undermine the district court mandate finding,expert report of samuel seemes at,we note that a factfinder is not required to accept expert opinion,see pope cnty.of albany,wl,at cir.in any event,the record shows that the district court carefully reviewed the totality of the evidence and concluded therefrom that runners who were required to join and who actually competed on the indoor and outdoor track teams did obtain additional genuine athletic participation opportunities.it found only that the same conclusion did not obtain for runners subjected to the same mandate even though they could not,and did not,participate in track competitions because they were injured or.in such circumstances,women runners received no more athletic benefits from mandated membership on quinnipiac indoor and outdoor track teams than they were already receiving as members of the team.
accordingly,we identify no error in the district court decision to discount quinnipiac reported athletic participation opportunities for women on its,indoor track,and outdoor track teams from to.
athletic participation opportunities for women in competitive cheerleading the determination that the activity does not yet qualify as a sport 
competitive cheerleading,which quinnipiac decided to create as a new women varsity sport team for,is a late outgrowth of traditional sideline cheerleading.whereas sideline cheerleaders generally strive to entertain audiences or solicit crowd reaction at sport or school functions,a competitive cheerleading team seeks to pit its skills against other teams for the purpose of winning.see biediger quinnipiac,d at.thus,to distinguish the two activities,competitive cheerleaders 
do not attempt to elicit crowd response generally do not use,megaphones,signs,or other props associated with sideline cheerleading teams wear uniforms consisting of shorts and jerseys,much like what women volleyball players don and emphasize the more gymnastic elements of sideline cheerleading,such as aerial maneuvers,floor tumbling,and balancing exercises,to the exclusion of those activities intended to rally the watching audience.
id.observing that competitive cheerleading is an athletic endeavor that might be described as group floor gymnastics internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court nevertheless concluded that the roster positions that quinnipiac assigned competitive cheerleading for could not be counted under title ix because the activity did not yet afford the participation opportunities of a varsity sport.see id.at.
preliminary to reaching this conclusion,the district court observed that competitive cheerleading is not yet recognized as a sport,or even an emerging sport,by the ncaa action that would have triggered a presumption in favor of counting its participants under title ix.see id.at citing ocr letter.nor has doe recognized competitive cheerleading as a sport to the contrary,in two letters in,ocr indicated competitive cheerleading is presumptively not a sport,while leaving open the possibility for a different conclusion with respect to a particular cheerleading program.see april ocr letter at may ocr letter at.there is,however,no record evidence of any competitive cheerleading program being recognized by doe as a sport.see biediger quinnipiac,d at.
mindful of these circumstances,the district court proceeded carefully to review the structure,administration,team preparation,and competition of quinnipiac competitive cheerleading program to determine whether it nevertheless qualified as a sport whose athletic participation opportunities should be counted for purposes of title ix.see ocr letter at listing factors relevant to identifying activity as sport.again,we only briefly summarize the district court detailed findings,which find ample support in the record evidence.the district court found that in terms of the team operating budget,benefits,services,and coaching staff,competitive cheerleading was generally structured and administered by quinnipiac athletics department in a manner consistent with the school other varsity teams.see biediger quinnipiac,d at.the district court noted two minor exceptions to this conclusion quinnipiac did not afford its competitive cheerleading team locker space and because the ncaa did not recognize competitive cheerleading as a sport,the team did not receive ncaa catastrophic injury insurance and had to obtain it from a separate provider.id.at see id.at.with respect to factors relating to the team preparation and competition,the district court found that the competitive cheerleading team practice time,regimen,and venue were consistent with other varsity sports.see id.at.further,as with other varsity sports,the length of the competitive cheerleading season and the minimum number of competitions in which a team would participate were by a governing athletic organization,the recently formed national competitive stunt and tumbling association,of which quinnipiac was a founding member.see id.at.finally,the purpose of the team to compete athletically at the intercollegiate varsity level was akin to that of other varsity sports.see id.at.
at the same time,however,the district court identified a number of circumstances that sufficiently distinguished quinnipiac competitive cheerleading program from traditional varsity sports as to compel the decision that,for the season,the program could not be counted as a varsity sport for purposes of title ix.id.first,quinnipiac did not and,in,could not conduct any recruitment for its competitive cheerleading team,in marked contrast not only to the school other varsity sports teams but also to a typical ncaa division i sports program.see id.at.the district court explained the significance of this circumstance although the women on the quinnipiac competitive cheer team were athletically able,they would have been all the more talented had coach powers been able to seek out the best competitive cheerleaders around the country,as any other varsity coach would have been able to do.id.at.
more important,no uniform set of rules applied to competitive cheerleading competition throughout the season.indeed,in the ten competitions in which the quinnipiac team participated during the regular season,it was judged according to five different scoring systems.see id.at.further,in these competitions,quinnipiac did not face only varsity intercollegiate competitive cheerleading teams.rather,it was challenged by a motley assortment of competitors,id.at,including collegiate club opponents who did not receive varsity benefits,collegiate sideline cheerleading teams,and opponents unaffiliated with a particular academic institution,some of whom may still have been age,see id.at.as the district court observed,application of a uniform set of rules for competition and the restriction of competition to contests against other varsity opponents are the touchstones of a varsity sports program.id.at.those features ensure that play is fair in each game,that teams performances can be compared across a season,and that teams can be distinguished in terms of quality.id.at.
the concerns raised by these irregularities in season competition were only aggravated by aspects of play.notably,competitive cheerleading offered no progressive playoff system leading to a championship game.see id.at.rather,it provided an open invitational,which neither excluded any team on the basis of its regular season performance nor ranked or seeded participating teams on that basis.see id.instead,all entrants competed in a single championship round in which the team with the highest score won.see id.that round,moreover,was subject to a new rule of competition that had not applied to quinnipiac in any of its regular season competitions a mandatory second spirit segment in which a team was judged by the intensity of the response it elicited from the crowd and the number of the sponsoring brand props that it employed,features that quinnipiac coach confirmed were more characteristic of sideline rather than competitive cheerleading.see id.at.viewing the totality of these circumstances,the district court concluded that the competitive cheerleading team competition did not conform to expectations for a varsity sport.
most other varsity sports would have used some system to separate teams and competitors in terms of quality,and would have ranked,seeded,or excluded teams on the basis of their performances during the regular season.moreover,any other varsity sport would not have imposed new rules of competition in the that teams did not follow during the regular season.
based on these findings,as well as those pertaining to regular season play,the district court concluded that quinnipiac competitive cheerleading team did not compete in circumstances indicative of varsity sports.thus,it ruled that quinnipiac roster positions for competitive cheerleading could not be counted for title ix purposes because the activity did not yet afford women genuine participation opportunities in a varsity sport.see id.at.
in challenging this conclusion,quinnipiac questions the weight the district court assigned the various factors it identified as supporting or undermining recognition of competitive cheerleading as a genuine varsity sport.quinnipiac argues that this court should decide the question de novo.we generally accord considerable discretion to a factfinder in deciding what weight to assign competing evidence pointing toward different conclusions.see diesel props.greystone bus.credit ii llc,at where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.quoting anderson bessemer city,d.but the point merits little discussion here because,even assuming that de novo review were warranted,we conclude for the same reasons stated in detail by the district court and summarized in this opinion that,although there are facts on both sides of the argument,in the end,the balance tips decidedly against finding competitive cheerleading presently to be a sport whose participation opportunities should be counted for purposes of title ix.like the district court,we acknowledge record evidence showing that competitive cheerleading can be physically challenging,requiring competitors to possess strength,agility,and grace.biediger quinnipiac,d at.similarly,we do not foreclose the possibility that the activity,with better organization and defined rules,might some day warrant recognition as a varsity sport.but,like the district court,we conclude that the record evidence shows that that time has not yet arrived.id.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court was correct not to count the roster positions assigned to competitive cheerleading in determining the number of genuine varsity athletic participation opportunities that quinnipiac afforded female students.
finding a title ix violation based on a disparity 
having reduced quinnipiac claimed athletic participation opportunities for women by representing competitive cheerleaders and runners required to join the indoor and outdoor track teams but unable to compete on those teams because of their injuries or status the district court correctly found that the school had a total of varsity athletic participation opportunities,of which,or,were assigned to women.see id.at.because enrollment data established that of quinnipiac undergraduate population were women,this indicated a disparity in the athletic opportunities that quinnipiac afforded women.see id.the district court concluded that this disparity was sufficient to support a finding that quinnipiac had failed to afford female students varsity athletic participation opportunities substantially proportionate to their enrollment.see id.at.
quinnipiac argues that a disparity is too small to support such a finding.in any event,it submits that the district court erred in holding quinnipiac responsible for the disparity in light of fluctuations in enrollment and quinnipiac good faith reliance on the district court statement at the time of the preliminary injunction decision that it would likely count all women members of the,indoor track,outdoor track,and competitive cheerleading teams as athletic participants for purposes of title ix.further,quinnipiac contends that the district court erroneously accorded dispositive weight to the fact that the number of additional female roster spots needed to achieve exact proportionality would have been sufficient for quinnipiac to field an additional varsity team.
quinnipiac arguments fail to persuade.first,its emphasis on the relatively small percentage of disparity is unwarranted.the district court itself recognized that in strictly numerical terms,a disparity presents a borderline case of disproportionate athletic opportunities.id.at.but as the clarification makes clear,substantial proportionality is not determined by any statistical test.see clarification at see also equity in athletics,doe,cir doe has not specified a magic number at which substantial proportionality is achieved.while a district court outside this circuit reports finding no case in which a disparity of two percentage points or less has been held to manifest a lack of substantial proportionality,see equity in athletics,doe,d,aff,cir,we do not pursue the issue because the disparity in this case is greater than,and we do not,in any event,understand the clarification to create a statistical safe harbor at this or any other percentage.instead,the clarification instructs that substantial proportionality is properly determined on a basis after a careful assessment of the school specific circumstances,including the causes of the disparity and the reasonableness of requiring the school to add additional athletic opportunities to eliminate the disparity.clarification at see also amicus br.of the district court challenged ruling was based on precisely this analysis.
specifically,the district court pointed to record evidence showing that the identified disparity was almost entirely attributable to quinnipiac own careful control of its athletic rosters.see biediger quinnipiac,d at.although quinnipiac claims that,but for a increase in female enrollment in beyond its control,the disparity would have been only,the difference is not one that undermines the district court conclusion that quinnipiac voluntary actions largely caused the disparity.
while quinnipiac professes to have relied on the district court observation at the time of the prelimina
