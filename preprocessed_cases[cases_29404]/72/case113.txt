we are called upon to balance the right of publicity of former professional football players against electronic arts ea first amendment right to use their likenesses in its madden nfl series of video games.we previously held ea unauthorized use of a former college football player likeness in the ncaa football series of video games was not,as a matter of law,protected by the first amendment.see keller arts in re ncaa student athlete name likeness licensing litig,cir.in keller,we rejected several of the first amendment defenses ea raises here on materially indistinguishable grounds.ea advances one additional argument in this appeal its use of former players likenesses is protected under the first amendment as incidental use.we disagree.we hold ea use of the former players likenesses is not incidental,because it is central to ea main commercial purpose to create a realistic virtual simulation of football games involving current and former nfl teams.
background 
ea is a developer and publisher of video games,including madden nfl,which ea publishes annually.madden nfl allows users to play virtual football games between national football league nfl teams by controlling virtual players,or avatars.ea graphic artists and programmers create the avatars,as well as virtual stadiums,coaches,referees,fans and other audio and visual elements that allow users to experience a realistic simulation of an nfl game.users control the movements of the avatars and the outcome of the game through the users inputs to the game system.
each annual version of madden nfl includes all current players for all nfl teams,along with accurate player names,team logos,colors and uniforms.ea has paid national football players the licensing arm of the national football league players association annual licensing fees in the millions of dollars to use current players likenesses.
from through,madden nfl also included certain particularly successful or popular historic teams.ea did not obtain a license to use the likenesses of the former players on these historic teams.although the players on the historic teams are not identified by name or photograph,each is described by his position,years in the nfl,height,weight,skin tone and relative skill level in different aspects of the sport for example,madden nfl includes as a historic team the los angeles rams that played in that year super bowl.vince ferragamo,a plaintiff in this action,was a quarterback on the rams.he is caucasian and was listed in the rams media guide as a,pound nfl player.madden nfl depicts an avatar who is a quarterback for the rams and has identical physical characteristics.madden nfl also includes the los angeles rams,for which ferragamo was again a quarterback.the rams media guide lists ferragamo as a year old,pound nfl player.madden nfl depicts an avatar on the rams with identical physical characteristics.
the plaintiffs alleged that madden nfl similarly includes,without authorization,accurate likenesses of plaintiffs michael davis and billy joe dupree,as well as roughly other former nfl players who appear on more than historic teams in various editions of madden nfl.the plaintiffs asserted claims for right of publicity under california civil code and california common law,conversion,trespass to chattels and unjust enrichment on behalf of themselves and all former nfl players depicted in madden nfl.ea moved to strike the complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp under california statute,california code of civil procedure.the district court denied the motion.we have jurisdiction over ea appeal pursuant to.we affirm.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the denial of a motion to strike under california statute.see keller,at.
iii.discussion 
anti slapp motion 
california statute is designed to allow courts to promptly expose and dismiss meritless and harassing claims seeking to chill protected expression.mindys cosmetics,dakar,cir quoting bosley med,kremer,cir.under the statute,a party may file a motion to strike a cause of action against it if the complaint aris es from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue.id.alteration in original quoting b.to defeat a motion to strike,a plaintiff must establish that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.b.
the plaintiffs concede that their suit arises from an act by ea in furtherance of its right of free speech under the first amendment.indeed,v ideo games are entitled to the full protections of the first amendment,because l ike the protected books,plays,and movies that preceded them,video games communicate ideas and even social messages.keller,at quoting brown entm t merchs.ass n,d.
the district court denied ea motion,however,concluding that the plaintiffs established a reasonable probability they will prevail on their claims.reasonable probability requires only a minimum level of legal sufficiency and triability.mindys cosmetics,at quoting linder thrifty oil,cal th,d,cal.a plaintiff must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim,id.at,based on the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,b.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.mindys cosmetics,at quoting wilson parker,covert chidester,cal th,d,cal.t he required probability that the plaintiffs will prevail need not be high.hilton hallmark cards,cir.
ea does not challenge the plaintiffs ability to state or support any substantive element of their claims.instead,ea argues it is not reasonably probable the plaintiffs will prevail,because their claims are barred by five affirmative defenses under the first amendment the transformative use defense,the public interest defense,the public affairs exemption of california civil code d,the rogers test and the incidental use defense.although the statute places on the plaintiff the burden of substantiating its claims,a defendant that advances an affirmative defense to such claims properly bears the burden of proof on the defense.peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp,th,d.ea has the burden of establishing the transformative use defense as a matter of law.see keller,at.on its other affirmative defenses,ea has the burden of establishing a probability of prevailing.premier med.mgmt,cal.ins.guarantee ass n,th,d.for the reasons set forth below,ea has not shown a probability of prevailing on its incidental use defense,and its other defenses are effectively precluded by our decision in keller because ea has not met its burden as to any of its affirmative defenses,the district court properly denied ea motion to strike.
transformative use 
ea contends the plaintiffs claims are barred by the transformative use defense formulated by the california supreme court in comedy iii productions,gary saderup,cal th,d,cal.the defense is a balancing test between the first amendment and the right of publicity based on whether the work in question adds significant creative elements so as to be transformed into something more than a mere celebrity likeness or imitation.keller,at quoting comedy iii,d,at.
in keller,we rejected ea transformative use defense.we held the use of college athletes likenesses in the ncaa football video game series was not,as a matter of law,transformative use.see id.at.we relied primarily on no doubt activision publishing,th,d,in which the california court of appeal rejected a video game maker transformative use defense because its video game contained literal recreations of members of the band no doubt doing the same activity by which the band achieved and maintains its fame.in no doubt,the court of appeal held,that the avatars appear in the context of a videogame that contains many other creative elements does not transform the avatars into anything other than exact depictions of no doubt me
