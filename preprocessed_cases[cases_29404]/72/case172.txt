plaintiff carl kindrich iii was injured while disembarking from a boat after participating in casting his late father ashes into the ocean.he sued defendants long beach yacht club,the owner of the boat and the dock,and charles fuller,the boat skipper,alleging they had been negligent in their use and maintenance of both the boat and the because they failed either to have someone on the dock to assist in tying off the boat when it returned,or to ensure that the portable steps,previously used in boarding the boat,would be available for his use when he attempted to disembark.carl wife,barbara,and son,michael,also sued.barbara claimed loss of consortium,and michael claimed emotional distress suffered as an aural percipient witness to his father injury.because all three plaintiffs have the same last name,we will refer to them by their first names to avoid confusion and not out of disrespect.
the trial court granted summary judgment to defendants,reasoning the doctrine of primary assumption of risk applied to carl decision to jump off the boat onto the dock.all plaintiffs appeal,contending the court improperly concluded that the act of jumping onto the dock was an activity subject to the complete defense of primary assumption of risk.we agree that the court analysis was incorrect.carl was not engaged in the type of sporting event where the doctrine of primary assumption of risk should be applied.at most carl may have assumed risks,categorized as secondary assumption of risk,which are subsumed in contributory negligence.whether he was contributorily negligent and,if so,how his negligence compares with that of the defendants,if any,are questions of fact to be resolved by the trier of fact.
defendants also contend summary judgment was properly granted because they were not negligent.but this is another question of fact and not subject to summary judgment.defendants additional issues,whether barbara suffered damages and whether michael awareness of his father accident qualifies him as a bystander entitled to recover on a theory of negligent infliction of emotional distress,also raise questions of fact.
we therefore reverse the summary judgment.
facts and procedural history 
the complaint alleges that plaintiffs and some of their relatives and friends gathered at the yacht club to participate in a burial at sea of the ashes of carl late father.the yacht club arranged for the attendees to be taken to the burial site on a boat it owned and maintained and assigned fuller to pilot that boat.the yacht club provided portable stairs on the dock to assist the attendees in boarding.plaintiffs contend that,when the boat returned to the dock,the portable steps were no longer in place.according to the complaint,fuller told carl to tie off the boat there was no one on the dock waiting to do so.as carl started to jump from the side of the boat onto the dock,the boat and dock moved relative to each other causing carl to fall and injure himself.
plaintiffs allege causes of action for carl personal injury,barbara loss of consortium,and emotional distress suffered by michael when he witnessed his father accident.
defendants moved for summary judgment.they argued that carl claim failed as a matter of law because he assumed any risk of injury from his voluntary decision to jump onto the dock from the boat and they did not breach any duty of care they might have owed him and had no actual or constructive notice that the portable stairs may not have been in place when the boat returned to the dock.they also asserted that barbara claim failed as a matter of law,both because it was derivative of carl claim and because her discovery responses revealed no loss of consortium damages.finally,defendants maintained michael claim failed as a matter of law because it was derivative of carl and because michael was not actually aware of his father injury until after it had occurred.
these are the relevant undisputed facts offered in support of the motion carl father,a member of the yacht club before he died,had expressed the wish to be buried at sea.the yacht club agreed to assist with such a burial and permitted the kindrich family to use one of its boats,without charge,for the ceremony.the yacht club also agreed to let fuller,one of its longstanding members and a good friend of carl father,pilot the boat for the ceremony.
carl,barbara,and michael,along with other family members,used portable steps located on the dock to board the boat for the ceremony.after the ceremony was over,carl and michael were up on the bridge with fuller,who piloted the boat back to the dock.according to carl testimony,a fter the burial,we were bringing the boat in and not too far from the dock,fuller looked to me and says we have to tie up the boat,and someone else will have to help.and michael and i were the only two on the bridge and so michael said that he would help when fuller turned the boat into the dock and we had gotten up to the dock and we were getting ready to get off the boat,mike,my son,jumped to the dock.we did see the steps.the steps were there.and then after mike jumped off,i jumped off,also 
carl stated that at the moment he jumped off the boat,it was hit by the wake from another boat,causing it to go up as he stepped off the boat and when he came down onto the deck,he broke his leg.the boat used for the burial ceremony does not require more than two people to tie it up when it reaches the person to operate the boat and one person on the dock to tie the lines.
plaintiffs opposed the summary judgment,arguing this was not a proper case for applying the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk,and the case could not be summarily adjudicated on the basis that defendants acted with reasonable care as a matter of law.plaintiffs argued there were numerous factual disputes relating to whether defendants satisfied the duty of care they owed to the passengers on their boat,and those issues must ultimately be resolved by a jury.
at the hearing,the court explained its initial thinking in favor of granting the summary judgment we have some conflicts in the facts as to whether he jumped,or stepped,or lowered himself,or whatever,but that does matter.what did happen was he was pushed.he was ordered.he voluntarily undertook an activity that was inherently dangerous namely,disembarking from a moving boat obviously onto the dock and he hurt himself.i believe that without really much hesitation that primary assumption of the risk applies and the motions should be granted for summary judgment.
although plaintiffs counsel attempted to persuade the court that fuller directed carl to assist in tying up the boat,and thus his decision to jump from the boat should not be regarded as voluntary,the court did not agree.carl assumed the risk of something in this recreational activity going wrong.it did go wrong.the precise wrong is irrelevant.one way or the other he voluntarily disembarked the boat with the idea of going onto the dock,and this was an unsafe thing to do.
the formal order granting the motion cited two bases.first,the court found that even if the portable steps were actually missing when the vessel arrived back at dock after the burial at sea,d efendants had no notice,constructive or actual,of their absence the court additionally finds that d efendants are entitled to summary adjudication on their fourth affirmative defense because when p laintiff made the deliberate and conscious decision to jump from the vessel to the dock,he,with full knowledge thereof,knowingly and voluntarily assumed the risk of sustaining injury.see meintsma united states cir see also deroche commodore cruise line,th,d it is settled that there is no duty to warn of a danger that is as obvious to the injured party as to the defendant.
the order granted summary judgment against barbara and michael as well,concluding barbara claim for loss of consortium was derivative as a matter of law and that any distinct claim for emotional distress was precluded by the fact she did not actually witness carl injury.as to michael claim,the court concluded that a bystander recovery for the extreme emotional distress was dependent upon a determination the injury he witnessed was negligently inflicted.since carl negligence claim failed,michael did as well.
discussion 
primary secondary assumption of risk 
even were we to conclude that carl decision to jump off the boat was a voluntary one,and that therefore he assumed a risk inherent in doing so,this is not enough to provide a complete defense.because voluntary assumption of risk as a complete defense in a negligence action was abandoned in li yellow cab cal d,only the absence of duty owed a plaintiff under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk would provide such a defense.but that doctrine does not come into play except when plaintiff and defendant are engaged in certain types of activities,such as an active sport.that was not the case here plaintiff was merely the passenger on a boat.under li,he may have been contributorily negligent but this would only go to reduce the amount of damages to which he is entitled.
before li,contributory negligence and voluntary assumption of risk were distinct and complete defenses in an action for negligence.under certain circumstances,the last clear chance doctrine provided relief from the harshness of the rules.li changed all that.it adopted the doctrine of comparative negligence and held that t he doctrine of last clear chance is abolished,and the defense of assumption of risk is also abolished to the extent that it is merely a variant of the former doctrine of contributory negligence both of these are to be subsumed under the general process of assessing liability in proportion to negligence.li yellow cab,supra,cal d at,
li recognized that there are at least two distinct forms of assumption of risk.as for assumption of risk,we have recognized in this state that this defense overlaps that of contributory negligence to some extent and in fact is made up of at least two distinct defenses.to simplify greatly,it has been observed that in one kind of situation,to wit,where a plaintiff unreasonably undertakes to encounter a specific known risk imposed by a defendant negligence,plaintiff conduct,although he may encounter that risk in a prudent manner,is in reality a form of contributory negligence other kinds of situations within the doctrine of assumption of risk are those,for example,where plaintiff is held to agree to relieve defendant of an obligation of reasonable conduct toward him.such a situation would not involve contributory negligence,but rather a reduction of defendant duty of care.citations.we think it clear that the adoption of a system of comparative negligence should entail the merger of the defense of assumption of risk into the general scheme of assessment of liability in proportion to fault in those particular cases in which the form of assumption of risk involved is no more than a variant of contributory negligence.citation.li yellow cab,supra,cal d at.
so,to the extent that a plaintiff unreasonably undertakes to encounter a specific known risk imposed by a defendant negligence,he or she is subject to the defense of comparative negligence but not to an absolute defense.knight jewett cal th,d.this type of comparative negligence has been referred to as secondary assumption of risk.id.at,d.assumption of risk that is based upon the absence of a defendant duty of care is called primary assumption of risk.ibid.first,in primary assumption of risk the defendant owes no duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular risk of plaintiff who has suffered such harm is not entitled to recover from the defendant,whether the plaintiff conduct in undertaking the activity was reasonable or unreasonable.second,in secondary assumption of risk instances in which the defendant has breached the duty of care owed to the defendant is not entitled to be entirely relieved of liability for an injury proximately caused by such breach,simply because the plaintiff conduct in encountering the risk of such an injury was reasonable rather than unreasonable.id.at,d.
primary assumption of risk,where plaintiff is held to agree to relieve defendant of an obligation of reasonable conduct toward him knight jewett,supra,cal th at,d,remains as a complete defense.that defense was not fully developed until our supreme court decided knight jewett.there,knight sued jewett for negligence and assault and battery after she was injured when jewett knocked her over and stepped on her finger during a touch football game.in affirming summary judgment for the defendant,the court held that under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk,the defendant did not owe the plaintiff a duty.it conclude d that a participant in an active sport breaches a legal duty of care to other,engages in conduct that properly may subject him or her to financial if the participant intentionally injures another player or engages in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
knight shifted the focus of assumption of risk from a plaintiff subjective knowledge and awareness of the risk to the nature of the activity in question.knight jewett,supra,cal th at,d.in cases involving primary assumption of risk where,by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties relationship to the activity,the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk of harm that caused the doctrine continues to operate as a complete bar to the plaintiff recovery.id.at,d.knight justified maintaining the defense in a sports setting because there conditions or conduct that otherwise might be viewed as dangerous often are an integral part of the sport itself id.at,d,and imposing liability might well alter fundamentally the nature of the sport by deterring participants from vigorously engaging in activity that falls close to,but on the permissible side of,a prescribed rule.id.at,d.the focus of the questions should consider the nature of the activity and the relationship of the parties to the activity.id.at,d.
there are situations other than active sports where under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk a plaintiff is held to agree to relieve a defendant of an obligation of reasonable conduct toward him or her.for example,knight stated,in addition to the sports setting,the primary assumption of risk doctrine also comes into play in the category of cases often described as involving the firefighter rule.citation.in its most classic form,the firefighter rule involves the question whether a person who negligently has started a fire is liable for an injury sustained by a firefighter who is summoned to fight the fire the rule provides that the person who started the fire is not liable under such circumstances.citation.although a number of theories have been cited to support this conclusion,the most persuasive explanation is that the party who negligently started the fire had no legal duty to protect the firefighter from the very danger that the firefighter is employed to confront.citations.because the defendant in such a case owes no duty to protect the firefighter from such risks,the firefighter has no cause of action even if the risk created by the fire was so great that a trier of fact could find it was unreasonable for the firefighter to choose to encounter the risk.knight jewett,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
other examples of primary assumption of risk are the veterinarian rule,priebe nelson cal th,fn,d,or where plaintiff is hired to undertake a particular dangerous job,farnam state of california th,d herrle estate of marshall th,d.but for purposes of this case,we need only consider whether carl injuries occurred while he was engaged in an active sport,which relieved defendants of a duty of care.
there are more than published cases defining what is and what is not an active sport qualifying for application of the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.since the decision in knight,which involved a recreational game of touch football,our state supreme court and appellate courts have examined the applicability of the primary assumption of the risk defense in a wide variety of cases involving sports and recreational activities.in ford gouin cal th,d,the companion case to k
