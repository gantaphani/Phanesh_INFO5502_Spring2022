the mother of katie janeway,a developmentally disabled year old,signed an application form releasing the city of santa barbara and its employees hereafter the city or defendants from liability for any negligent act related to katie participation in the city summer camp for developmentally disabled children.katie drowned while attending the camp,and her parents plaintiffs,real parties in interest in the present proceedings commenced this suit.the court of appeal below held unanimously that the agreement embodied in the application form was effective and enforceable insofar as it concerned defendants liability for future ordinary negligence,but concluded,by a vote,that a release of liability for future gross negligence generally is unenforceable,and that the agreement in this case did not release such liability.
in granting review,we limited the issue to be briefed and argued to the second a release of liability relating to recreational activities generally is effective as to gross negligence as explained below,we answer that question in the negative,and affirm the judgment rendered by the court of appeal.we conclude,consistent with dicta in california cases and with the vast majority of cases and other authority,that an agreement made in the context of sports or recreational programs or services,purporting to release liability for future gross negligence,generally is unenforceable as a matter of public policy.applying that general rule in the case now before us,we hold that the agreement,to the extent it purports to release liability for future gross negligence,violates public policy and is unenforceable.
the relevant facts were properly set forth by the court of appeal below,and we adopt that recitation with minor supplementation and stylistic changes.
the city has provided extensive summer recreational facilities and activities for children,including a camp for children with developmental disabilities adventure camp.katie janeway,who suffered from cerebral palsy,epilepsy,and other similar developmental disabilities,participated in adventure camp in,and.
adventure camp was conducted from noon until on weekdays for approximately three weeks in july and august.camp activities included swimming,arts and crafts,group games,sports,and field trips.in,as in prior years,swimming activities were held on two of five camp days each week in a city swimming pool.
in,the application form for adventure camp included a release of all claims against the city and its employees from liability,including liability based upon negligence,arising from camp activities katie mother,maureen janeway,signed the release.she had signed similar releases covering katie participation in the camp in prior years.
maureen janeway disclosed katie developmental disabilities and medical problems to the city,specifically informing the city that katie was prone to epileptic seizures,often occurring in water,and that katie needed supervision while swimming.in addition,the city was aware that katie had suffered seizures while attending adventure camp events in.she had a seizure when sitting on the pool deck and another seizure at the skating rink.paramedics were called after her seizure on the pool deck.nevertheless,maureen janeway indicated that katie was a good swimmer,and she never sought to prevent or restrict katie participation in the swimming portion of adventure camp.
based upon the information provided by maureen janeway and katie history of seizures,the city took special precautions during the adventure camp swimming activities in.the city assigned veronica malong to act as a counselor.malong responsibility was to keep katie under close observation during the camp swimming sessions.previously,malong,a college student,had worked for one year as a special education aide at the middle school attended by katie.malong had observed katie experience seizures at the school,and she received instruction from the school nurse regarding the handling of those seizures.malong also attended training sessions conducted by the city concerning how to respond to seizures and other first aid matters.
katie participated in the first swimming day at the adventure camp without incident.on the second swimming day she drowned.
approximately one hour before drowning,while waiting to enter the locker room at the pool,katie suffered a mild seizure that lasted a few seconds.malong observed the seizure and sent another counselor to report the incident to a supervisor.according to the pleadings,the supervisor stated that the report never was received.malong watched katie for approximately minutes following the mild seizure.then,receiving no word from her supervisor,malong concluded that the seizure had run its course and that it was safe for katie to swim.
malong sat on the side of the pool near the lifeguard,watching the deep end of the pool.in addition to the adventure camp participants,there were as many as other children in the pool area.malong watched katie jump off a diving board and swim back to the edge of the pool.at malong insistence,katie got out of the pool and rested for a few minutes.malong then asked katie whether she wished to dive again,and katie said she did.katie dove into the water,bobbed to the surface,and began to swim toward the edge of the pool.as katie did so,malong momentarily turned her attention away from katie.when malong looked back no more than seconds later,katie had disappeared from her sight.after malong and others looked for katie somewhere between two and five minutes,an air horn blew and the pool was evacuated.lifeguards pulled katie from the bottom of the pool,and she died the next day.
katie parents,terral and maureen janeway,filed a wrongful death action alleging the accident was caused by the negligence of the city and malong.relying upon the release,defendants moved unsuccessfully for summary judgment and summary adjudication.defendants then sought relief in the court of appeal,filing a petition for writ of mandate.code civ,subd.m.as noted earlier,the appellate court denied the petition,holding the agreement was effective and enforceable insofar as it concerned defendants liability for future ordinary negligence,but concluding a release of liability for future gross negligence generally is unenforceable,and the agreement in this case did not validly release such liability.as observed above,we address only the second holding.
we begin by defining the terms that underlie the issue presented.ordinary negligence an unintentional of a failure to exercise the degree of care in a given situation that a reasonable person under similar circumstances would employ to protect others from harm.see,donnelly southern pacific cal d,donnelly.
gross negligence long has been defined in california and other jurisdictions as either a want of even scant care or an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct.eastburn regional fire protection authority cal th,d,eastburn,and cases cited accord,colich sons pacific bell d.colich kearl board of medical quality assurance d.see also,prosser keeton,the law of torts ed,pp.prosser and keeton d negligence.
as observed in gardner downtown porsche audi d.gardner,t raditionally the law has looked carefully and with some skepticism at those who attempt to contract away their legal liability for the commission of torts.courts and commentators have observed that such releases pose a conflict between contract and tort law.on the one hand is the freedom of individuals to agree to limit their future liability balanced against that are public policies underlying our tort system as a general matter,we seek to maintain or reinforce a reasonable standard of care in community life and require the community at provide appropriate recompense to injured parties 
the traditional skepticism concerning agreements designed to release liability for future torts,reflected in gardner,supra,d,and many other cases,long has been expressed in civil code section hereafter cited as section,which unchanged since its adoption in provides all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt any one from responsibility for his or her own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.
in tunkl regents of university of california cal d,tunkl,we applied section in the context of a release required by a nonprofit research hospital as a condition of providing medical treatment.in that case,the plaintiff had signed a contract releasing the operators of the regents of the university of california from any and all liability for negligent acts or omissions of its employees so long as the hospital used due care in selecting those employees,at.thereafter,the plaintiff sued for ordinary negligence based on the treatment received from two of the hospital doctors.
turning to section,justice tobriner unanimous opinion for the court noted that past decisions had differed concerning the reach of that statute tunkl,supra,cal d,but that those decisions agreed in one significant respect they consistently held that an agreement exculpatory provision may stand only if it does not involve and impair the public interest,at.exploring the meaning and characteristics of the concept of public interest as illuminated by the prior cases,at,we read those precedents as recognizing a general rule that an exculpatory clause which affects the public interest can not stand,at,italics added.
tunkl next addressed the factors or characteristics that underlie the concept of public interest in the context of an agreement releasing liability for future ordinary negligence.tunkl,supra,cal d.in passages widely quoted and followed or adopted as a guide by numerous decisions addressing the enforceability of such agreements we wrote the social forces that have led to such characterization are volatile and dynamic.no definition of the concept of public interest can be contained within the four corners of a formula.the concept,always the subject of great debate,has ranged over the whole course of the common law rather than attempt to prescribe its nature,we can only designate the situations in which it has been applied.we can determine whether the instant contract does or does not manifest the characteristics which have been held to stamp a contract as one affected with a public interest.tunkl,supra,cal d at.
we found in the prior cases a rough outline of the type of transaction in which exculpatory provisions will be held invalid,explaining t he attempted but invalid exemption involves a transaction which exhibits some or all of the following characteristics.it concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation.the party seeking exculpation is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public,which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public.the party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it,or at least for any member coming within certain established standards.as a result of the essential nature of the service,in the economic setting of the transaction,the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks his services.in exercising a superior bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation,and makes no provision whereby a purchaser may pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence.finally,as a result of the transaction,the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller,subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.tunkl,supra,cal d,fns.omitted.
we continued our analysis in tunkl by stressing that considerations of public policy did not bar all contracts releasing future liability for negligence and by drawing a distinction between such permissible releases and those that implicate at least some of the circumstances described above.tunkl,supra,cal d.we commented that when certain of these characteristics are present,the transaction is such that the releasing party does not really acquiesce voluntarily in the contractual shifting of the risk,and further that when the service is one which each member of the public,presently or potentially,may find essential to him,the releasor faces,despite his economic inability to do so,the prospect of a compulsory assumption of the risk of another negligence,at.applying the public interest characteristics articulated above to the facts of the transaction then before us in tunkl,we concluded that the release exhibited not only some of those characteristics,but all of them,and that the contract of exculpation for negligence committed by the hospital employee doctors affect ing the public interest was invalid,at.
in subsequent decisions,california courts have invalidated releases of liability for future ordinary negligence under the analysis set forth in tunkl,supra,cal d,when,guided by tunkl public interest discussion,the court determines that a particular release concerns a service that transcends a purely private agreement and affects the public interest,henrioulle marin ventures,cal d,release of liability for negligence by residential landlord gavin ymca of metropolitan los angeles th,d release of liability for negligence by provider of child care services pelletier alameda yacht harbor d.release of liability for negligence by provider of harbor boat berth gardner,supra,d.release of liability for negligence by auto repair shop vilner crocker national bank d.release of liability for negligence relating to banking services akin business title d.release of liability for negligence by escrow company see also health net of california,department of health services th,d health net exculpatory clause related to managed health care for beneficiaries see generally witkin,summary of cal.law ed,contracts,pp.witkin.other jurisdictions have held similar releases in various analogous contexts to be unenforceable under a analysis.see,vodopest macgregor,vodopest invalidating,under washington law,a release related to medical research wagenblast,supra,invalidating,under washington law,releases related to interscholastic public high school activities,including athletic teams and cheerleading.
as the parties observe,no published california case has upheld,or voided,an agreement purporting to release liability for future gross negligence.some decisions have stated,in dictum,that such a release is unenforceable.farnham superior court th,d exemptions from all liability for gross negligence have been consistently invalidated health net,supra,th,d liability for future gross negligence can not be released.others carefully have specified that liability for ordinary or simple negligence generally may be released that is,so long as doing so is consistent with tunkl,supra,cal d,thereby implicitly differentiating gross negligence from the class of conduct as to which liability generally may be released indeed,for more than three decades,witkin has asserted that california law categorically bars the prior release of liability for future gross negligence the present view is that a contract exempting from liability for ordinary negligence is valid where no public interest is involved but there can be no exemption from liability for intentional wrong or gross negligence witkin,supra,contracts,italics added see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed,contracts,same witkin,summary of cal.law ed,contracts,essentially identical witkin,summary of cal.law ed,contracts,the contracts restatement declares that a person can contract to exempt himself from liability for ordinary negligence,but not for gross negligence.as defendants observe,however,witkin does not cite any relevant california decision in support of that proposition.
on the other hand,as defendants and their amici curiae also observe,a number of cases have upheld agreements insofar as they release liability for future ordinary negligence in the context of sports and recreation programs,on the basis that such agreements do not concern necessary services,and hence do not transcend the realm of purely private matters and implicate the public interest under tunkl,supra,cal d.our lower courts have upheld releases of liability concerning ordinary negligence related to gymnasiums and fitness clubs auto and motorcycle racing events ski resorts and ski equipment bicycle races skydiving or flying in ultra light aircraft and various other recreational activities and programs such as horseback riding,rafting,hypnotism,and scuba diving most,but not all,other jurisdictions have held similarly in light of these decisions,some more recent appellate decisions have concluded categorically that private agreements made in the recreational sports context releasing liability for future ordinary negligence do not implicate the public interest and therefore are not void as against public policy,benedek,supra,th at,d.
in the absence of an authoritative discussion in any california opinion concerning the enforceability of an agreement releasing liability for future gross negligence,we consider the law of other jurisdictions.we find that the vast majority of decisions state or hold that such agreements generally are void on the ground that public policy precludes enforcement of a release that would shelter aggravated misconduct.see,xu gay,xu zavras capeway rovers motorcycle club,zavras wolf ford,new light wells fargo alarm,new light wheelock sport kites,i,wheelock applying hawaii law boyce west,boyce sommer federal signal,buckner varner,wade watson,applying law shelby mutual insurance city of grand rapids.
the text writers reflect this majority rule.for example,in champion,fundamentals of sports law,the author observes i t is universally held that a release will not bar a claim for gross negligence.that is true even though the same exculpatory clause would bar an action for simple negligence,italics added see also.leading treatises are in accord indeed,some of them state categorically that any attempt to release liability for future gross negligence is void as against public policy yet other treatise writers and law review authors have offered similar,albeit slightly moderated characterizations of the law reflecting the circumstance that there are at least a handful of cases from a few jurisdictions that,without discussing the general rule or authorities set forth above,enforce contracts releasing liability for future gross negligence in the context of agreements signed by motor vehicle racing participants 
the reasoning of the foregoing decisions holding that liability for future gross negligence never can,or generally can not,be released,is based upon a public policy analysis that is different from the public interest factors considered under tunkl,supra,cal d.tunkl public interest analysis focuses upon the overall special emphasis upon the importance of the underlying service or program,and the relative bargaining relationship of the order to determine whether an agreement releasing future liability for ordinary negligence is unenforceable.by contrast,the cases cited and alluded to above,declining to enforce an agreement to release liability for future gross negligence,focus instead upon the degree or extent of the misconduct at issue,as well as the public policy to discourage or at least not facilitate aggravated wrongs.prosser keeton,supra.those cases hold,in essence,that an agreement that would remove a party obligation to adhere to even a minimal standard of care,thereby sheltering aggravated misconduct,is unenforceable as against public policy,new light,supra,zavras,supra,wheelock,supra.
defendants and their supporting amici curiae argue that we should not be guided by these cases and authorities,for three reasons.they assert that enforcement of agreements releasing liability for future gross negligence is mandated by section,and a contrary rule would violate both that statute and the holding in tunkl,supra,cal d,many decisions supporting the proposition that future gross negligence can not be released are distinguishable and hence inapt and considerations of public policy,properly understood,mandate not the majority voiding releases of liability for future gross the opposite,that is,a rule enforcing releases of liability for future gross negligence.
defendants and some of their supporting amici curiae observe that section,which as noted ante,at part,bars enforcement of agreements releasing one from responsibility for his or her own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,does not list gross negligence as one of the types of liability that may not be released.they contrast section language with section of the civil code also enacted in,which specifies that common carriers may not enforce releases of liability for future gross negligence.defendants and their amici curiae argue that section thus represents an implied legislative determination to allow releases of liability for gross negligence,as long as the release does not affect the public interest under the principles of tunkl,supra,cal d,and they assert section precludes courts from voiding releases on any public policy basis not set forth in that statute.
in this respect we agree with the court of appeal below,which observed that section has not been interpreted to authorize any and all releases that are not expressly invalidated.as the lower court also noted,tunkl itself went beyond the language of civil code section to invalidate releases of liability for negligence under certain circumstances to be more explicit our unanimous decision in tunkl,supra,cal d,did precisely what defendants and their supporting amici curiae assert is precluded by section decision found a release of liability for future ordinary negligence void on public policy grounds other than those set forth in section.indeed,tunkl sets forth a categorical rule any exculpatory clause even one releasing liability for future ordinary negligence is unenforceable if it relates to a transaction that adequately exhibits at least some of the six characteristics set forth in that case,and thereby affects the public interest.we could not accept the statutory argument advanced by defendants and their supporting amici curiae,without at the same time fundamentally undermining and effectively overruling we decline any implied invitation to do so accordingly,we reject defendants argument that,by enacting section more than years ago,our legislature established a policy generally allowing releases of liability for future gross negligence,and hence a policy precluding this court from adopting,on public policy grounds,the clearly.
we also reject the similar argument,advanced by defendants and their amici curiae,that we may not recognize or employ,as a basis for invalidating a release,any public policy rationale different from that set out in our decision in tunkl,supra,cal d.
as we have observed ante,in part,the decisions and other authority holding agreements releasing liability for future gross negligence to be unenforceable are based,not on tunkl public interest,analysis,but instead upon a separate and different public policy rationale focusing upon the degree or extent of the misconduct at issue,in order to discourage or at least not facilitate aggravated wrongs.defendants and their amici curiae,however,assert that if a particular agreement releasing liability for negligence is,as the court of appeal found in the present case,enforceable under the tunkl public interest analysis an issue that,as observed ante,fn,we do not address,then,also pursuant to tunkl,such an agreement can and should be enforced for all negligence that is,ordinary and gross negligence.justice baxter,in his dissenting opinion in this matter,post,embraces the same view.
we did not address in tunkl whether an agreement purporting to release liability for future gross negligence could be enforced we considered only the circumstances in which a release of liability for the type of negligence at issue in that ordinary be unenforceable.our recognition in tunkl that the concept of public interest is dynamic,not static our refusal to rigidly prescribe its nature and our explication of only a rough outline of the type of transaction as to which a release of liability for ordinary negligence would be unenforceable tunkl,supra,cal d at,all belie the suggestion that we now should read tunkl as implicitly foreclosing a different public policy analysis in the context of an agreement purporting to release liability for future gross negligence.certainly,nothing in tunkl is inconsistent with the majority rule described above.nor can tunkl reasonably be read to stand for the proposition that,assuming tunkl public interest factors do not preclude enforcement of an agreement releasing liability for future ordinary negligence,this same agreement also should,or even may,be construed and enforced to release liability for future gross negligence.
defendants contend that many decisions supporting the proposition that liability for future gross negligence can not be released arise in jurisdictions that define this form of negligence not as california does as either a failure to exercise even slight care,or an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of ante,at pt,but instead define that term as conduct tantamount to wanton,reckless,or willful misconduct even if some decisions arguably are distinguishable on that basis,however,significant other authority is not so readily distinguishable.
for example,the state of washington,which views gross negligence consistently with the california definition,has long held void and unenforceable any attempted release of liability for a negligent act that falls greatly below the standard established by law for the protection of others.vodopest,supra,italics added.the same approach appears to apply in massachusetts,which also long has viewed gross negligence consistent with the california definition.see zavras,supra,fn.noting general rule that liability for ordinary negligence may be released,but that liability for gross as the absence of slight diligence,or want of even scant care may not see also sharon city of newton,fn.sharon citing zavras with approval.similarly,nebraska,which also long has viewed gross negligence consistently with the california definition,has refused to permit the release of liability for such future conduct.new light,supra,defendant barred from insulating itself for damages caused by its own gross negligence,defined as failure to employ even slight care in the performance of its duty.in other words,it appears that these washington in particular,for many enforced what is effectively the same rule that defendants and their amici curiae assert should be rejected as unwarranted and unworkable in california.
ultimately,defendants and their amici curiae argue that rejection of the majority rule described above,and adoption of the opposite rule proposed by them,is mandated by public policy,as they perceive it.they stress the asserted uncertainty of the gross negligence standard and argue that unless providers of recreational services and related programs can be assured that agreements purporting to release liability for future gross negligence will be enforced,subsequent suits against recreational service,public,or not be readily resolvable in favor of defendants on summary judgment,with the result that unwarranted liability will be threatened or imposed,and service providers will react by greatly restricting,or simply declining to afford,such services or programs in california.
we do not agree that adoption of the foregoing majority rule in the setting of the definition of gross negligence employed in this state failure to exercise even slight care,or an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct would prove unworkable,or that application of such a standard would frustrate the proper termination of suits on summary judgment or foster untoward liability.as the parties acknowledge,the same definition long has been employed in cases applying numerous california statutes that confer limited immunity for negligence while expressly exempting immunity for gross negligence despite the concerns of defendants and their amici curiae,in light of the experience under these statutes it does not appear that the application of a gross negligence standard,as defined in california,has a tendency to impair the summary judgment process or confuse juries and lead to judgments erroneously imposing liability.to the contrary these statutes reflect the sound legislative judgment that,under a gross negligence standard,meritless suits will typically be disposed of by summary judgment that when a case goes to trial the jury,instructed on this standard,will be less likely to confuse injury with fault and that verdicts reflecting such confusion will be more readily reversed,whether by the trial or appellate court,than under an ordinary negligence standard.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d,conc.opn.of werdegar.in this respect,we emphasize the importance of maintaining a distinction between ordinary and gross negligence,and of granting summary judgment on the basis of that distinction in appropriate circumstances.see decker city of imperial beach d.generally it is a triable issue of fact whether there has been such a lack of care as to constitute gross negligence but not always see also,eastburn,supra,cal th,d,trial court properly precluded amendment of a complaint to allege gross negligence devito state of california d.summarily concluding that a complaint alleges no facts showing an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of care.
as defendants observe,some cases and other authorities assert,albeit without citing any empirical evidence,that upholding agreements releasing liability for future negligence is necessary in order to ensure the continued availability of sports recreation and related programs,hohe,supra,d.ymca,supra,th,d.defendants and their amici curiae embrace this broad premise and argue by analogy that the same principle applies with respect to agreements releasing liability for future gross negligence.
defendants assert that unless recreation service providers dependably can enforce agreements to release liability for both future ordinary negligence and future gross negligence,the inevitable result will be more,and that quoting allabach,supra,th,d ultimately,many popular and lawful recreational activities are destined for extinction.
the various amici curiae in support of defendants echo and amplify these predictions.for example,amici curiae nascar and the california speedway association assert that limiting agreements releasing liability for future ordinary negligence,while not permitting the release of liability for future gross negligence,ultimately will deprive the public of the opportunity to participate and recreate in many cherished pastimes,including being spectators at nascar and similar motor vehicle racing events.likewise,amici curiae bally total fitness corporation and hour fitness usa,claim the appellate decision below,enforcing the release as to negligence but not as to gross negligence,wreaks havoc on recreational providers,leading them to a precipice from which there will be no return.similarly,the brief of the international health,racquet,and sportsclub association and california clubs of distinction twice declares that the effect of enforcing a release as to negligence but not as to gross negligence can not be overstated and suggests that unless releases of liability for future gross negligence are enforced,there will be far reaching and devastating consequences,rendering commercial health and racquet clubs a thing of the past.amici curiae sierra club,league of california cities,and california state association of counties make similar,albeit slightly less strident,assertions.
we are sensitive to the policy arguments advanced by defendants and their amici curiae that caution against rules triggering wholesale elimination of beneficial recreational programs and we are especially sensitive to the concerns relating to the continued availability of programs such as the one here at issue,serving the recreational needs of developmentally disabled children.but we find no support for such broad predictions in the present setting.
although,as noted,some cases and authorities assert that upholding releases of liability for ordinary negligence may help ensure the continuation of sports recreation and related programs see ante,at fn,we do not discern in those cases any discussion of an asserted corresponding need to recognize and enforce agreements releasing liability for future gross negligence and indeed we find little supporting that position even in the law review literature upon which defendants rely we also find it significant that,as observed ante,part,the states of washington,massachusetts,and nebraska all effectively bar release of liability for gross negligence,as that term is defined in california.we would expect that if,based upon the experience of these sister states,there existed substantial evidence supporting the ominous forecasts of defendants and their amici curiae concerning the future of recreational services in california under the same system,defendants and their amici curiae would highlight that information.and yet,no such information has been provided to us.
indeed,if the premise of defendants and their amici curiae were is,if failing to enforce agreements releasing liability for future gross negligence would imperil the very existence of sports and recreational at least would expect to see some analogous evidence in the experience of those states that prohibit even agreements releasing liability for future ordinary negligence.ordinary negligence,after all,occurs much more commonly than gross negligence,and hence judicial decisions holding unenforceable any release of liability for ordinary negligence would,under the theory of defendants and their amici curiae,pose a much greater threat to the continued availability of recreational sports programs than would a rule holding unenforceable releases of liability for gross negligence generally.and yet,as explained below,in numerous contexts concerning recreational sports and related programs,courts categorically have voided agreements releasing liability for future ordinary negligence without so far as we can discern triggering in any substantial degree the dramatically negative effects predicted by defendants and their amici curiae.
many thousands of contracts that have been entered into,releasing liability for future ordinary negligence in the context of recreational sports and related programs,are unenforceable in most states.this is so because,although courts in california and a few other states have enforced agreements,signed by parents,releasing liability for future ordinary negligence committed against minor children in recreational and related settings,that position apparently represents a minority view.a clear majority of courts have held that a parent may not release a minor prospective claim for negligence.hawkins ex rel.hawkins peart utah,voiding agreement signed on behalf of minor releasing liability for future negligence concerning horseback riding,and cases and other authorities cited.
in addition,we observe that vermont has voided agreements releasing liability for future ordinary negligence in the context of recreational skiing and racing connecticut has acted similarly concerning snow tubing and horseback riding lessons west virginia has voided a release of liability for ordinary negligence executed by a university student who was injured while playing club rugby and washington has voided agreements releasing public school districts from liability for future ordinary negligence related to interscholastic athletics virginia long has categorically and broadly voided all preinjury releases,even in the recreational sports context perhaps most significantly,the new york legislature,for three decades,has barred enforcement of agreements between operators of gymnasium s and places of amusement or recreation,or similar establishment s,and their paying members or customers,purporting to release liability for future negligence by the operator.see oblig.law.pursuant to this statute,new york courts have found releases to be void and unenforceable in the context of suits for personal injuries caused by ordinary negligence related to automobile racing at commercial racetracks skiing and ski lessons at resorts horseback riding organized and operated by a business firm or riding stable business recreational parachuting or skydiving lessons flag football played in a league run by a corporation tennis played at a country club at which the plaintiff was a member and riding a mechanical bull in a bar 
we brought the cases from these six states connecticut,utah,vermont,virginia,washington,and west virginia and the new york statute to the parties attention and solicited supplemental briefing concerning defendants policy argument that enforcing releases of liability for future ordinary negligence,but not for future gross negligence,would lead to the demise or substantially diminished availability of recreational services and programs.thereafter,pursuant to a request by defendants,we allowed additional supplemental briefing.the ensuing briefing,however,disclosed no empirical study suggesting that holdings such as those described above,precluding the release of liability for future ordinary negligence or for that matter,similar holdings under tunkl,supra,cal d,have triggered the predicted elimination or even widespread substantial reduction of the affected services or programs.indeed,defendants forthrightly concede in their supplemental briefs that they found no empirical support for such assertions.
defendants,caution,however,against any attempt to assess the societal effects of judicial holdings quoting choper,consequences of supreme court decisions upholding individual constitutional rights,and they suggest that because of legal,economic,social and other differences between the seven jurisdictions discussed above and california,the experiences of those states probably are not predictive of what might occur in california if we were to decline to enforce releases of liability for future gross negligence.nevertheless,and seemingly in conflict with their own admonition about attempting to assess the societal effects of judicial holdings,defendants speculate that the rules employed in the seven jurisdictions described above,declining to enforce releases of liability for future ordinary negligence,may have led or may lead to the diminished availability or even the demise of recreational services and programs in those states.furthermore,defendants suggest that,even without empirical evidence of any negative effects in those states,but in light of some law review articles generally predicting such effects if releases of liability for future ordinary negligence are not enforced see ante,at fn,we should assume such effects have occurred and will occur in those jurisdictions,and that such effects also would occur in california,were we to adopt a rule posing even a comparatively lesser threat to the continued availability of recreational sports and sports is,a rule generally enforcing releases of liability for future ordinary negligence,but generally declining to enforce releases of liability for future gross negligence.
we find defendants arguments unpersuasive.of course legal,economic,social,and other differences can make interjurisdictional comparisons inexact.but that does not mean we should ignore what might be gleaned from the legal laboratory that is the product of our federal system,under which states may,and do,undertake different solutions to common problems the circumstance that neither defendants nor their supporting amici curiae have found from the experience of our sister states any substantial empirical evidence supporting their dire predictions is,we believe,both relevant and telling.
indeed,it appears that the experience of our sister states has not borne out the predictions of defendants and their supporting amici curiae.in virginia and new york,for,as noted above,agreements to release future liability for ordinary negligence causing personal injury long have been categorically barred by case law or generally precluded by statute,as construed by case providers have been subjected to the potential of liability substantially greater than that facing their counterparts in california and most other jurisdictions,which as observed ante,at part generally uphold such releases.and yet,our research suggests that the predicted demise of recreational opportunities apparently has not come to pass in virginia or new york.
for example,amicus curiae nascar brief predicts the downfall of spectator auto racing unless agreements releasing liability for future gross negligence regularly are enforced.according to nascar official web site,however,of the major speedways located in the united states and mexico,two are,and long have been,located in virginia,and one is,and long has been,located in new york in other words,despite virginia and new york strict no release of liability for ordinary negligence rules,which subject nascar to greater potential liability than the mere no release of liability for gross negligence rule at issue in the present case,racing appears not to have disappeared in those states.
likewise,amicus curiae bally total fitness corporation prediction of calamity in the health club industry if releases of liability for future gross negligence are not enforced appears difficult to reconcile with the prevalence of that corporation business in those two states.bally official web site discloses that it operates seven clubs in virginia,and in new york amici curiae international health,racquet,and sportsclub association and california clubs of distinction similarly assert that commercial recreational services are in danger of extinction if releases of liability for future gross negligence are not enforced.according to the united states economic census,which reports on,among other things,each state fitness and recreational sports centers including health,fitness,swimming,racquet,and handball clubs,as well as and rinks,in there were more than such business locations in virginia,and more than in new york again,despite the strict virginia and new york rules,which subject recreational service providers to far greater potential liability than the mere no release of liability for gross negligence rule at issue in the present case,it does not appear that commercial and organized recreational clubs have become a thing of the past in those states 
nor are we aware of any empirical evidence to suggest,as defendants postulate,that a holding declining to enforce an agreement purporting to release liability for future gross negligence would jeopardize programs,such as the one here at issue,that provide recreational opportunities for developmentally disabled indeed,initial research casts doubt upon such predictions 
we reject the arguments of defendants and their amici curiae that considerations of public policy mandate the adoption of a rule under which agreements releasing liability for future gross negligence always,or even generally,would be enforced.
as traynor observed in donnelly,supra,cal d,the distinction between ordinary and gross negligence reflects a rule of policy that harsher legal consequences should flow when negligence is aggravated instead of merely ordinary,at,accord,colich,supra,d.
for the reasons discussed is,adherence to the public policy to discourage,or at least not facilitate,aggravated wrongs prosser keeton,supra,and consistent with donnelly,supra,cal d,and the court of appeal below,as well as the vast majority of other jurisdictions,we conclude that public policy generally precludes enforcement of an agreement that would remove an obligation to adhere to even a minimal standard of care applying that general rule here,we hold that an agreement purporting to release liability for future gross negligence committed against a developmentally disabled child who participates in a recreational camp designed for the needs of such children violates public policy and is unenforceable 
the legislature,which already has enacted numerous statutes designed to protect from unfair liability various participants in and sponsors of socially useful enterprises see ante,at fn,is of course free to enact additional legislation limiting,as necessary,the liability of specific recreational service providers if those who provide such programs or other recreational sports services believe the viability of their particular industry rests upon the ability to secure valid releases of liability for future gross is,exoneration for the providers failure to employ even slight care,or for an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of proper forum in which to present that policy argument,and to seek that broad protection,is the legislature.
defendants and some of their supporting amici curiae assert that by declining to enforce the release at issue in this case against a possible claim for gross negligence,we would be recognizing a legal distinction between ordinary negligence and more aggravated misconduct,and thus in essence recognizing,in these circumstances,the possibility of a cause of action for gross negligence they assert we may not properly do either.as explained,we reject defendants objections.
defendants claim our courts may not distinguish ordinary from gross negligence absent express legislative authorization.in support of this proposition,they cite the legislature repeal of statutes recognizing and defining slight,ordinary,and gross negligence.see walther southern pacific cal.amicus curiae nascar echoes this view,asserting that,with respect to gross negligence and other grades of misconduct such as recklessness and willful misconduct,california courts have uniformly agreed that none of those classifications,in the absence of specific statutory creation,are to be treated differently from ordinary negligence and that there is no legal distinction between the concepts of ordinary negligence,gross negligence,and recklessness in the absence of a statute.
this assertion inaccurately characterizes the law.for despite the absence of any statutory authorization for the long have adhered to the common law rule that a contract may be reformed due to mutual mistake based upon ordinary negligence,but not when the mistake is based upon gross negligence.hess ford motor cal th,d,see also van meter bent construction cal d,allowing reformation upon a showing of gross negligence.
similarly,prior to abandonment of the common law doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of comparative fault in li yellow cab cal d,li and despite the absence of any statutory authorization for making the by a tortfeasor long was recognized by california courts in order to ameliorate the harsh effects to a plaintiff of the contributory negligence bar.see,witkin,summary of cal.law ed,torts,and cases cited.now,in the context,the common law doctrine of assumption of risk continues to disprove the thesis that absent statutory authority,the courts are precluded from drawing legal distinctions between ordinary negligence and more aggravated categories of misconduct.the doctrine involves conduct by a defendant who,because of the setting and the relationship of the parties,owes no legal duty to protect a plaintiff against ordinary negligence.knight jewett cal th,d,knight.in the context of active sports coparticipants,for example,this means that a defendant generally has no duty to eliminate,or protect a plaintiff against,risks inherent in a is,against ordinary careless conduct considered to be part of the sport,at,d.and yet,knight holds,such a defendant nevertheless may be liable for conduct so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity,at,d,italics added.
as shown,pursuant to our common law case law and the doctrine,and despite the absence of statutory authorization,california case law clearly distinguishes between the concepts of ordinary negligence and other,aggravated forms of misconduct such as gross negligence and recklessness.
defendants and various supporting amici curiae also assert that california does not recognize any cause of action for gross negligence unless such an action is directly,or at least implicitly,authorized by one of the numerous statutes that employ gross negligence as the applicable standard.see,statutes cited ante,at fn.defendants and their amici curiae rely upon continental ins.american protection industries d.continental.
we do not view our an agreement purporting to release liability for future gross negligence committed against a developmentally disabled child who participates in a recreational camp designed for the needs of such children violates public policy and is recognizing a cause of action for gross negligence in any event,as explained below,the decision in continental does not assist defendants.
continental,supra,d,did not concern a release of future tort liability,but instead a liquidated damages provision of a contract for burglar alarm services.the provision limited damages for negligence to,at,fn,and the plaintiff,an insurer,sought unsuccessfully to avoid that clause by amending its complaint to allege not ordinary negligence,but gross negligence.in affirming the trial court order refusing to recognize the plaintiff cause of action,the appellate court noted that numerous california decisions had discussed and applied the doctrine of gross negligence in the context of various statutory provisions establishing that specific level of negligence as the operative standard in particular situations,at,fn.the appellate court in continental also quoted prosser and keeton comments concerning the difficulty of drawing satisfactory lines of demarcation relating to degrees of negligence,and the ensuing elimination of the distinction between ordinary and gross negligence in most situations,at,fn,quoting prosser keeton,supra,italics added.the court then observed that after the decision in li,supra,cal d,which as noted abandoned the common law doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of comparative fault,the need for categorization of misconduct into degrees has been radically diminished.continental,supra,d at,italics added.from this,the court in continental jumped to the broad conclusion that any attempt to categorize gross negligence separately from ordinary negligence is unnecessary,italics added and it determined that the trial court properly had declined to allow the plaintiff to amend its complaint to allege gross negligence.ibid.subsequently,two decisions have,in offhand dicta,cited continental as standing for the general proposition that california does not recognize a distinct cause of action for gross negligence independent of a statutory basis.saenz,supra,d,fn.
we need not address here the question whether the court in continental reached the correct decision in the context of the liquidated damages provision before it we conclude,however,that the decision in continental is distinguishable in the context of the release at issue in the present case.it is true that,after li,in the context of comparative fault analysis,there typically is no need to distinguish gross negligence from ordinary negligence,because we now permit fact finders to compare the respective fault of the parties,regardless of the degree of negligence of each.sorensen allred d.allowing comparison of negligent and willful and wanton reckless conduct.it also is generally true that,with the advent of comparative fault,the need to categorize misconduct into degrees has been diminished.continental,supra,d.but as acknowledged by the court in continental,li adoption of comparative fault obviated the need for the distinction only in most in all.accord,bielski schulze,observing that the adoption of comparative fault,and the abrogation of gross negligence as a general matter,nevertheless may require that the law continue to recognize gross negligence in the context of anticipatory releases and exculpatory clauses.
again,reference to knight,supra,cal th,d,is illustrative.as noted above,in the context of primary assumption of risk that is,liability of active sports coparticipants for injuries arising from the normal conduct of the sport,the absence of a duty to protect against ordinary negligence does not absolve a defendant from liability based upon reckless conduct.similarly,in the present situation,it can not be said that a legal distinction between ordinary negligence and gross negligence is unnecessary indeed,a theory of gross negligence,if supported by evidence showing the existence of a triable issue,is the only theory that is potentially open to plaintiffs and real parties in interest 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.
i agree with the majority that the contractual release of liability at issue in this case is unenforceable as to gross negligence,but i reach that conclusion for reasons that differ from the majority.the majority relies largely on decisions from other jurisdictions to support a conclusion that releases for gross negligence are inherently and generally against public policy and unenforceable,but that conclusion can not be reconciled with civil code sections and,as i will explain.in my view,a contractual release of liability for gross negligence,like a contractual release of liability for ordinary negligence,must be examined in its specific context to determine whether it is against public policy.in performing that contextual public policy analysis,i rely on the factors that this court identified in tunkl regents of university of california cal d,tunkl.
the city of santa barbara the city runs a summer camp,called adventure camp,for children with developmental disabilities.katie janeway,who suffered from epilepsy,mild cerebral palsy,and other disabilities,started going to the camp in,and she returned every summer until her death in at the age of.the city application form for the camp required the child parents to release the city and its employees from all liability for any loss or damage on account of injury whether caused by any negligent act or omission of the releasees or otherwise.katie mother signed the year application form containing the release provision.
katie mother told the city employees that katie had seizures and needed supervision while swimming.the city assigned camp counselor veronica malong,a college student,to supervise katie during swimming activities.about an hour before she drowned,katie had a mild seizure.malong waited until katie appeared to be fully recovered before allowing her to swim.there were about children in and around the large,swimming pool,which was staffed with five lifeguards.katie wanted to use the diving board.that area of the pool was roped off so only one child would be in the water at a time.katie dove once without problem.after a rest,katie dove a second time.malong saw her come to the surface and begin swimming toward the side of the pool.malong then looked away for no more than seconds,and when she looked back she could not see katie.malong immediately walked to the deep end of the pool to look for katie and asked another counselor who was swimming toward the diving board if he had seen katie.malong then got into the pool and swam to the shallow end and then back to the middle of the pool,searching for katie.the lifeguard assigned to watch the diving area finally saw katie on the bottom of the pool,where she had been for about five minutes.she was taken to a hospital and died the next day.
katie parents sued the city and malong for wrongful death,alleging negligence.defendants moved for summary judgment,relying on the contractual release in the application form.the trial court denied the motion,and defendants petitioned the court of appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that ruling.denying the petition,the court of appeal concluded that under tunkl,supra,cal d,the release was valid and enforceable as to any claim for ordinary negligence,but it also concluded,over the dissent of one justice,that the release was unenforceable as to a claim for gross negligence.
this court granted review on a single issue,the enforceability of the release as to a claim for gross negligence.
civil code section,which has remained unchanged since its enactment in as part of the original civil code,prohibits contractual releases of liability for fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent.also unchanged since its enactment in is civil code section,which provides a common carrier can not be exonerated,by any agreement made in anticipation thereof,from liability for the gross negligence,fraud,or willful wrong of himself or his servants.italics added.the wording of civil code section shows that in the legislature was well aware of gross negligence as a distinct category of wrong and that it chose to bar any agreement releasing a common carrier from liability for gross negligence.at the very same time,however,the legislature omitted gross negligence from civil code section list of wrongful conduct that could never be the subject of a contractual release of liability.
only one inference may be drawn the legislature made a conscious decision that releases for gross releases for fraud,for willful injury to person or property,and for intentional or negligent violation of statutory not inherently against the public interest and therefore are not generally and categorically unenforceable.in holding that contractual releases of liability for future gross negligence are generally unenforceable,ante,d at,at,the majority rejects the legislature contrary decision,effectively rewrites civil code section to insert what the legislature deliberately omitted a general prohibition on contractual releases of liability for future gross negligence,and in so doing usurps the legislature authority.i do not join in that holding.
of course,the legislature decision,as embodied in the text of civil code sections and,that contractual releases for future gross negligence are not inherently against the public interest and therefore are not generally unenforceable,does not mean that such releases are always consistent with the public interest and therefore enforceable.instead,the validity of a contractual release for future gross negligence must be determined by examining the context in which it incurs.civil code section identifies one context in which releases for future gross negligence are against the public interest and thus the party seeking exoneration is a common carrier.civil code section does not preclude courts from determining that releases for gross negligence are against the public interest and invalid in other situations as well.
to determine whether the release at issue here is against the public interest and invalid as applied to gross negligence,i find guidance in this court decision in tunkl,supra,cal d.there,this court adopted an analysis to be used in determining whether a contractual release of future negligence claims is against the public interest and therefore unenforceable.we identified six factors or characteristics that constitute the public interest and thus provide a rough outline of that type of transaction in which exculpatory provisions will be held invalid.id.at.for an exculpatory provision to be held invalid,the transaction to which it relates need only exhibit some of those characteristics.id.at.although this court has never addressed the issue,it seems logical that,because gross negligence is a more aggravated form of misconduct than ordinary negligence,the public interest in deterring gross negligence is greater than the public interest in deterring ordinary negligence.accordingly,to invalidate a release as to future gross negligence,the public interest showing under the tunkl analysis need not be as strong or as complete as it would need to be to invalidate a release as to future ordinary negligence.
under tunkl,the first characteristic is that the release concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.child day care facilities are subject to public regulation under the california child day care facilities act health,et.although adventure camp is exempt from regulation as a child day care facility because it is operated for less than weeks in a period during a time when local public schools are not in session,subd.g,the city can not deny that through the camp program it does indeed provide child care services in the course of providing social and recreational activities for young children who are unaccompanied by their parents accordingly,i conclude that at least insofar as it provides child care services,the city adventure camp is engaged in a type of business that is suitable for public regulation.
the second characteristic under tunkl is that the party seeking exculpation here,the city is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public,which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.affording opportunities for developmentally disabled children to participate in ordinary recreational activities with other children is a service of great public importance.the legislature has declared that developmental disabilities present social,medical,economic,and legal problems of extreme importance that have an important impact on whole communities welf,italics added,that t he state of california accepts a responsibility for persons with developmental disabilities ibid,and that those persons have rights both to social interaction and participation in community activities and to physical exercise and recreational opportunities,subds.f,g.moreover,as i have explained,the city program includes child care services,and child care itself has vital public importance.gavin ymca of metropolitan los angeles th,d.thus,i conclude that,through its recreational program for developmentally disabled children,the city provides services that are of great public importance.
in modern urban society,where both parents often hold employment,many parents lack the time and resources to personally supply a full range of recreational and social opportunities for their children and instead rely on recreational camps and similar organized programs.this is particularly true for parents of children with developmental disabilities,because of the particular skills and adaptations required in dealing with those disabilities.thus,recreational programs like adventure camp that are designed for developmentally disabled children are a practical necessity for parents seeking to provide a full range of ordinary recreational and social opportunities for those children.i conclude that through adventure camp the city provides services that are a practical necessity for many parents of developmentally disabled children.
the third tunkl factor is whether t he party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it,or at least for any member coming within certain established standards.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted,italics added.here,although the city adventure camp was limited to participants at a time,the city made it available to any child between the ages of seven and with a qualifying developmental disability.this circumstance is present.
the fourth tunkl factor is whether the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks those services.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.this factor is satisfied.adventure camp was limited to children at a time,and those spots were always taken.although the city allowed parents to choose which activities their children would participate in during camp sessions,the city alone determined the conditions for admission to adventure camp.nothing in the record suggests that any parent ever bargained,or could have bargained,with the city concerning the terms of admission to the program.
the fifth tunkl factor is whether the party seeking exculpation used a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation and did not offer the other party an option to pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.here,it is undisputed that the city terms of participation,including the release,were offered to parents on a basis,with no opportunity to obtain protection against gross negligence for an additional fee.
the sixth tunkl factor is whether as a result of the transaction,the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller,subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.here,as a result of the transaction in which katie parents enrolled her in the city adventure camp,katie was placed under the care and supervision of the city employees,subject to a significant risk of serious injury if they acted with gross negligence.
i conclude that each of the tunkl factors is satisfied,at least to some extent,and that the characteristics of the particular transaction make the city contractual release against public policy and unenforceable as to liability for injury caused by gross negligence 
the city adventure camp provides recreational and social activities to children with developmental disabilities.because of the strong public interest in providing children with disabilities with opportunities for ordinary recreational activities and social interactions,it is essential that providers of those opportunities be held to at least a minimal standard of care.applying a slight variation of the analysis that this court adopted in tunkl,supra,cal d,i conclude that releases for gross negligence are not enforceable in this particular context.on this basis,i join the majority in affirming the court of appeal judgment.
in this matter we must determine whether a release of future liability for negligence utilized by a public entity in connection with a publicly funded and publicly operated summer recreational program for developmentally disabled youth is enforceable under civil code section section,the statute defining the lawful parameters of releases in california.i conclude the legislature has spoken a full release of negligence liability,as was expressly agreed to by the parties below,is generally valid and enforceable under section.
the majority,in contrast,concludes that all releases of future liability for gross negligence,whether express or implied,are generally unenforceable in california as contrary to the public policy of this state,and that the specific release of future negligence liability utilized by the city in this case,to the extent it implicitly encompasses gross negligence,violates public policy and is unenforceable,ante,d at,at.the majority does not find section of much consequence in this matter,a position it must take because its conclusions and holding are based on policy determinations not discernable from the controlling statutory language.
i can not join in the majority sweeping holding.as this court long ago observed,t he determination of public policy of states resides,first,with the people as expressed in their constitution and,second,with the representatives of the state legislature jensen traders general ins.cal d.u nless it is entirely plain that a contract is violative of sound public policy,a court will never so declare.the power of the courts to declare a contract void for being in contravention of sound public policy is a very delicate and undefined power,and should be exercised only in cases free from doubt.ibid.
the legislature,not this court,is in the best position to consider the public interests and determine whether good cause exists to amend section to uncategorically restrict releases of future tort liability to the extent they impliedly encompass a release of gross negligence liability.as regards the release utilized in connection with the public recreational services program for developmentally disabled youth directly in issue,although i acknowledge the general concern that grossly negligent misconduct not go unpunished,the public interests at stake here are far more complex than that one consideration alone.whether it is in the public interest to restrict the means by which municipalities providing socially beneficial services to the public seek to manage their exposure to the specter of expanding tort liability in connection with the delivery of those services is a matter properly determined by the legislature.i therefore respectfully dissent.
section section provides that contracts having for their object,either directly or indirectly,the exemption of a party from responsibility for his own fraud,willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,are against the policy of the law.put otherwise,one can not lawfully contract away responsibility and future liability for his or her own acts of fraud,willful torts,or transgressions of statutory law.section,unchanged for years and long understood to govern contractual releases of liability,neither declares nor prohibits releases of future liability for any type of negligence as being against the policy of the law in california.
the legislature knows how to specifically proscribe the release of future liability for gross negligence when it wants to.it did so when it enacted civil code section,which specifically prohibits common carriers from releasing future liability for gross negligence.in contrast,as justice kennard explains,the legislature made a conscious decision that releases for gross releases for fraud,for willful injury to person or property,and for intentional or negligent violation of statutory not inherently against the public interest and therefore are not generally and categorically unenforceable.in holding that contractual releases of liability for future gross negligence are generally unenforceable,ante,d at,at,the majority rejects the legislature contrary decision,effectively rewrites civil code section to insert what the legislature deliberately omitted a general prohibition on contractual releases of liability for future gross negligence,and in so doing usurps the legislature authority.conc.dis.opn.of kennard,ante,d at,at.
there is one caveat to the express limitations placed on releases in section.in tunkl regents of university of california cal d,tunkl,this court construed section as further precluding enforcement of exculpatory contractual provisions purporting to release a party from future liability for negligence if the transaction or subject matter of the contract in question affects the public interest.id.at.we emphasized at the outset in tunkl that no public policy opposes private,voluntary transactions in which one party,for a consideration,agrees to shoulder a risk which the law would otherwise have placed upon the other party.id.at,italics added.but we went on to explain that where the subject matter of a contract affects the public interest,the relative bargaining positions of the parties are not the same as in a private,voluntary transaction.with regard to that category of transactions,the releasing party does not really acquiesce voluntarily in the contractual shifting of the risk,nor can we be reasonably certain that he receives an adequate consideration for the transfer.since the service is one which each member of the public,presently or potentially,may find essential to him,he faces,despite his economic inability to do so,the prospect of a compulsory assumption of the risk of another negligence.ibid.
observing that the social forces that characterize the public interest are volatile and dynamic,and that n o definition of the concept of public interest can be contained within the four corners of a formula tunkl,supra,cal d at,we set forth a nonexclusive test in tunkl for determining when a contractual transaction affects the public interest.id.at.if some or all of the factors are present,enforcement of an exculpatory clause purporting to release liability for future negligence is prohibited as against the public interest.ibid.the six tunkl factors are the transaction concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation,fn.omitted the party seeking exculpation performs a service of great importance to the public,which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public id.at,fns.omitted the service is offered to the public at large ibid.in the economic setting of the transaction,the party seeking exculpation has a decisive bargaining advantage because the service is essential id.at,the person obtaining the service is required to sign a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation id.at,fn.omitted and the person obtaining the service bears the risk of the other party carelessness id.at.
the facts of tunkl serve to illustrate the purpose and proper application of the rule announced therein.hugo tunkl sought admission to the university of california los angeles medical center,a hospital operated and maintained by the regents of the university of california that held itself out to the public as an institution that performs medical services for qualified members of the public.tunkl,supra,cal d at.the contract he was required to sign in order to gain admission to the facility included a form releasing the regents of the university of california,and the hospital from any and all liability for the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its employees,if the hospital has used due care in selecting its employees.id.at.we observed that the services of the hospital to those members of the public who are in special need of the particular skill of its staff and facilities constitute a practical and crucial necessity was hardly open to question.id.at.we also cited health and safety code sections directly subjecting the facility to public regulation.ibid.we then explained,in insisting that the patient accept the provision of waiver in the contract,the hospital certainly exercises a decisive advantage in bargaining.the patient is in no position to reject the proffered agreement,to bargain with the hospital,or in lieu of agreement to find another hospital.the admission room of a hospital contains no bargaining table where,as in a private business transaction,the parties can debate the terms of their contract.as a result,we can not but conclude that the instant agreement manifested the characteristics of the adhesion contract.finally,when the patient signed the contract,he completely placed himself in the control of the hospital he subjected himself to the risk of its carelessness.id.at.
in consideration of the facts in tunkl,we had little difficulty concluding that the contractual terms under which tunkl was admitted to the hospital affected the public interest and rendered the release of negligence liability unenforceable.t he patient sought the services which the hospital offered to a selective portion of the public the patient,as the price of admission and as a result of his inferior bargaining position,accepted a clause in a contract of adhesion waiving the hospital negligence the patient thereby subjected himself to control of the hospital and the possible infliction of the negligence which he had thus been compelled to waive.the hospital,under such circumstances,occupied a status different than a mere private party its contract with the patient affected the public interest.tunkl,supra,cal d at.
in the case now before us,katie janeway,a old developmentally disabled child,tragically drowned in a and operated swimming pool while participating in a summer recreational activities program for developmentally disabled children while under the supervision of a trained counselor functioning as a city employee.the tragedy is punctuated by the fact that the loss of this child occurred under circumstances where everyone concerned was plainly striving to ensure that katie might simply enjoy a normal summer day camp experience notwithstanding her developmental disabilities.
a completed application for enrollment in the adventure camp program required the execution of a form releasing the city and its employees from all liability for any loss,damage,or claim therefore on account of injury whether caused by any negligent act or omission of the releasees or otherwise.maureen janeway,katie mother,signed the release on the minor behalf.in doing so,she agreed to assume full responsibility for and risk of bodily injury and death arising from katie participation in the program,and further expressly agree d that the release and waiver,indemnity agreement and assumption of risk are intended to be as broad and inclusive as permitted by california law.she had signed similar releases covering katie participation in the adventure camp program in three prior years.
the express proscriptions of section are not implicated are not alleging any fraud,willful injury,or violation of a statute by the city or its employees.the complaint simply alleges wrongful death on a theory of negligence is not specifically alleged.defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of the release,the city arguing that adventure camp,unlike the hospital in tunkl,was an elective summer recreational program for disabled children,enrollment in which did not affect the public interest,and that accordingly the release of future negligence liability resulting from injury or death of a camp participant was fully enforceable under civil code section as interpreted by tunkl.the trial court denied summary judgment and the city petitioned for a writ of mandate.the court of appeal correctly understood the principal issue to be whether the contractual agreement through which katie was accepted into the adventure camp program is of a nature that affects the public interest within the meaning of tunkl.if not,then the release signed by the minor mother on her behalf is fully enforceable under section,as construed in tunkl,and serves to release the city from future liability for negligence.
based on analysis of the tunkl factors,the court of appeal concluded that the release is valid and enforceable as a matter of law to the extent it releases the city and its employees from liability for acts of ordinary negligence in the operation of the city recreational program for disabled children.undisputed evidence establishes that the circumstances under which the release was executed by the janeways did not have the characteristics of a contract of adhesion or pertain to an essential activity that was a matter of practical necessity to them.therefore,although offering opportunities to disabled children is clearly beneficial to the public,the public interest,as that term is used in tunkl,would not be served by invalidating the release as to ordinary negligence.
although the court of appeal referred to the enforceable release of ordinary negligence in the passage quoted above,it can be observed that no distinction is drawn between ordinary and gross negligence in either the allegations of plaintiffs complaint the express wording of the city release of negligence liability here in issue or this court analysis in tunkl by which we concluded section must be interpreted as invalidating only contractual releases of future negligence liability that affect the public interest.the court of appeal nonetheless found the distinction pivotal to the second part of its analysis.over the dissent of one justice,the court of appeal went on to carve out an exception for gross negligence,concluding that the release does not exculpate the city or its employees from liability for conduct constituting gross negligence public policy and the legitimate objective of the release dictate that we limit the scope of the release to ordinary negligence by the city,and exclude the more extreme and aggravated conduct that constitutes gross negligence.
we granted review solely to consider the correctness of this specific aspect of the court of appeal holding,for it was without precedent in california.as the majority acknowledge,until this case,no published california case has upheld,or voided,an agreement purporting to release liability for future gross negligence,ante,d at,at.
the majority embraces this holding of first impression by the divided court of appeal.it goes much further.the majority does not limit its holding to the question posed on the facts of the case directly before a full release of future liability for negligence utilized by a public entity in connection with a publicly funded and publicly operated summer recreational program for developmentally disabled youth is enforceable under section as construed in tunkl.it concludes instead that all releases of future liability for gross negligence,whether express or implied,are generally unenforceable in california as contrary to the public policy of this state,and specifically holds that the broad release of future negligence liability utilized by the city in this case,to the extent it implicitly encompasses gross negligence,violates public policy and is unenforceable,d at,at.the majority conclusions and holding are not limited to releases of future negligence liability made in the specific context of sports or recreational activities.they rest on a broader policy general concern that aggravated wrongs or grossly negligent misconduct not go presumably apply to implied as well as express releases of liability for gross negligence here the release is silent as to gross negligence,and to public and private transactions alike,regardless of whether they affect the public interest within the meaning of tunkl interpretation of section.
unlike the majority,i conclude the city release of liability for any negligent act or omission leading to injury or death in connection with the operation of its recreational adventure camp program for developmentally disabled youth is valid and fully enforceable under section as interpreted in tunkl.
california courts have uniformly held that tunkl does not invalidate releases of future liability for negligent infliction of injuries in the context of sports and recreational activities on the reasoning that,although beneficial,such activities are generally not services essential to the public and thus do not affect the public interest.see,lund bally aerobic plus,th,d release of liability in connection with health membership randas ymca of metropolitan los angeles th,d randas release of liability in connection with ymca swimming program okura united states cycling federation d.release of liability in connection with bicycle race.accordingly,to require a party to sign an exculpatory release as a condition of participation lacks the compulsion typically found in a contract of adhesion and would not impair the public interest or violate public policy.see ymca of metropolitan los angeles superior court th,d allan snow summit,th,d.
as the court of appeal below observed,releases have been enforced not only for high risk sports activities,but for less risky recreation,and in particular,where the recreational activity was directed at or included participation by children.see,platzer mammoth mountain ski area th,d parents release of liability on behalf of old child participating in skiing school hohe san diego unified sch.dist.hohe d.hohe parents and teenager release of liability in connection with her participation in school hypnosis demonstration.swimming and diving are two of the recreational activities offered to developmentally disabled children through adventure camp,when authorized by the child parents or legal guardian.katie was swimming and diving in the city pool with the express knowledge and written consent of her mother when her fatal accident occurred.
our decision in tunkl directs courts in this state to determine the validity of releases of future negligence liability on a basis,with emphasis on whether the type of service being offered is essential to the public,and whether a disparity of bargaining power compels the party obtaining the service to sign the release as a contract of adhesion.tunkl,supra,cal d at,see also ymca of metropolitan los angeles superior court,supra,th at,d.
the first tunkl factor is whether the release in question concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.child day care facilities are subject to public regulation under the california child day care facilities act.see health,et adventure camp,however,is exempt from regulation as a child day care facility because it is operated for less than weeks in a period during a time when local public schools are not in session,subd.g.nor is the program subject to regulation under the lanterman developmental disabilities services act.welf,et unlike the facts of tunkl,which involved a public hospital subject to direct public regulation under the health safety code,plaintiffs here identify no other statute or regulation to support a finding that the first tunkl factor applies.
the second tunkl factor is that the party seeking exculpation here,the city is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public,which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.in its briefing before this court,the city does not question that its various recreational services programs confer an important benefit on the public and that it is important that people with all kinds of disabilities have an equal opportunity to participate in these recreational services and programs.but the city points out that the program here in question was designed to offer the same kinds of recreational services to developmentally disabled children as the city offered to nondevelopmentally disabled children.as the city explains,it was not designed to did not or any other special service for children with special needs.as already observed,courts in this state have uniformly held that tunkl does not invalidate releases of negligence liability for injuries arising from sports and recreational activities on the reasoning that,although beneficial,such activities are generally not services essential to the public and thus do not affect the public interest.ante,d at,at.indeed,no reported california case until this one has made an exception for an implied release of gross negligence in any context,whether involving sports or recreational activities or otherwise.
nor do plaintiffs point to any california decision or statute declaring that recreational activities for the developmentally disabled are essential or a matter of practical necessity within the meaning of the second tunkl factor.the adventure camp program was offered for only three weeks in the summer of,and then only for a period of hours per week.there has been no showing that adventure camp was the only program of its kind available to accommodate the recreational needs of developmentally disabled children in the santa barbara vicinity,and indeed,as the city points out,katie,either with the assistance of her parents or other adults trained to attend to her special needs,could have gone swimming in this and operated public swimming pool even without enrolling in the camp program.
the third tunkl factor is whether t he party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it,or at least for any member coming within certain established standards.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.here,although the city adventure camp program was technically available to any child between the ages of seven and with a qualifying developmental disability,as a practical matter enrollment was limited to participants at a time.
the fourth tunkl factor is whether the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks those services.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.although the city determined the basic conditions for enrollment in the camp program,it allowed parents to exclude activities in which they did not want their children participating during the camp sessions.the record further reflects that katie parents were offered the opportunity to require her to wear a flotation device at all times while swimming in the pool during camp.they felt she was a strong swimmer and declined.the city also indicates evidence was presented below showing katie participated in numerous recreational activities outside of adventure camp,including physical education at school,special olympics volleyball and basketball,horseback riding,and water sports such as swimming,diving,tubing and water skiing.
the fifth tunkl factor is whether the party seeking exculpation used a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation and did not offer the other party an option to pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.here,the city has conceded that the adventure camp release was a standard form release utilized for various recreational programs,and was indeed offered on a basis.but according to the city,the activities to which the release applied were negotiable,and katie parents could have also modified her activities while in the pool to minimize any risks.the janeways had the option of customizing katie camp experience by substituting other activities for pool time.they could have restricted or prohibited her swimming altogether,or given special instructions for that activity,or checked the box on the form requiring that she use a flotation device at all times,and they also had the option of sending katie to camp along with a personal aide of their own choosing,or to attend camp along with katie and supervise her themselves.
the sixth and final tunkl factor is whether as a result of the transaction,the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller,subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.as the city explains,a lthough katie was admittedly placed under the control of the city when she participated in adventure camp,as has been shown,plaintiffs had many options for avoiding any risk of carelessness by the city and could have retained full control over katie by attending adventure camp with her.
in sum,adventure camp provides elective and nonessential recreational opportunities for developmentally disabled youth on a basis in a summer day camp setting.moreover,unlike the release in tunkl,which the patient had to sign on a basis in order to be admitted into the hospital for critical medical treatment,here the application and release required to be completed for enrollment of a child in the elective recreational program have none of the usual attributes of a contract of adhesion.the janeways ultimately retained control over whether katie would swim in the pool as one of her camp activities,and whether she would be required to wear a flotation device at all times if she did so.they authorized her to swim and to dive,and opted not to require her to wear a flotation device when in the pool participating in those activities.the city,on its part,chose to assign a trained counselor specifically to keep close watch over katie while she was swimming or diving in the pool.
although the importance of integrating developmentally disabled children into mainstream society through programs like adventure camp can not be overstated,elective participation in this particular recreational camp program did not affect the public interest within the meaning of our analysis and holding in tunkl.nothing else in section,the controlling statutory provision,proscribes the full release of negligence liability utilized by the city in this case.as a general matter,in the absence of fraud,overreaching or excusable neglect,a duly executed release of liability is a lawful express assumption of the risk.madison superior court d,fn.hulsey elsinore parachute center d.in its most basic sense,assumption of risk means that the plaintiff,in advance,has given his express consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him,and to take his chances of injury from a known risk arising from what the defendant is to do or leave undone.fn.omitted.the result is that the defendant is relieved of legal duty to the plaintiff and being under no duty,he can not be charged with negligence.prosser keaton,torts ed,italics in original.citation.madison superior court,supra,d at.the janeways,like countless parents of children participating in recreational activities posing some level of inherent risk,were asked to give up their right to sue for negligence.there is no evidence establishing that the release in this case,which expressly covered any negligent act or omission,fell outside their reasonable expectations,or was unduly oppressive or unconscionable.
i would therefore hold the release valid and fully enforceable under section and tunkl,and stop there.like justice kennard,i conclude the majority inappropriately relies on decisions from other jurisdictions in support of its broad holding that public policy generally precludes enforcement of releases of future liability for gross negligence,ante,d at,at.that broader question should not be reached on the facts of this case,which does not involve a contractual release of negligence liability affecting the public interest within the meaning of tunkl,and which does not involve a release of liability otherwise falling under the express proscriptions of section.given that controlling statute,which,even as construed in tunkl,does not expressly prohibit the release of future liability for negligence in the context in which it was utilized here,the broader question considered by the majority is one more appropriately addressed to the legislature rather than decided by this court.
there are competing public policies at play here.one such policy,relied on by the majority to the exclusion of all others,is the general concern that grossly negligent misconduct not go unpunished.but enforcement of broad releases of negligence liability utilized by cities or other public agencies in the youth recreational services setting may further the public interest by enabling municipalities to deliver affordable recreational services to children with developmental disabilities under the same terms as they provide such services to other children.as several courts have observed,t he public as a whole receives the benefit of such waivers so that groups such as boy and girl scouts,little league,and associations are able to continue without the risks and sometimes overwhelming costs of litigation.thousands of children benefit from the availability of recreational and sports activities.those options are steadily of decreasing financial and tax support for other than the bare essentials of an education.every learning experience involves risk no public policy forbids the shifting of that burden.randas,supra,th at,d,quoting hohe,supra,d at.
the legislature,unlike this court,has the resources and is in the best position to balance the interests of the public at large and all persons specifically interested in the availability of publicly funded recreational services programs for disabled youth.the paramount concern here is to ensure that the law of releases of liability,as applied to this case,preserves and advances the public best interests.it goes without saying that a fundamental concern in the public interest is the continued viability of such socially beneficial programs in these fiscally strapped times.the city attorney of santa barbara,as a party to the case,and the league of california cities and the california state association of counties,as amici curiae,suggest that the unavailability to public entities of releases of negligence liability such as was utilized in this case could stand to compromise the availability of publicly funded and publicly administered recreational services programs such as this one.whether it will ultimately serve the public interest to restrict the means by which municipalities providing socially beneficial services to the public seek to limit their exposure to expanding tort liability in connection with such programs is a matter properly determined by the legislature.the answer,for example,may turn on whether insurance or the ability to will remain available and cost effective in the face of a change in the law restricting the scope of releases available to public entities offering programs such as this one.unlike the majority,i believe the public interests at stake here are far more complex than the general concern that grossly negligent misconduct not go unpunished.the legislature,not this court,is in the best position to sort them out and determine whether good cause exists to enact the formidable revision of the law of releases which the majority adopts by judicial fiat today.
i conclude section and tunkl together control this case and dictate that the release in question be found valid and enforceable.any further change in the law of releases of tort liability generally,or the law pertaining to releases of negligence liability by public entities in connection with recreational services programs specifically,should come from the legislature.
subsequent to hearing oral argument,we directed the parties to brief the first issue decided by the court of the release in this case is enforceable as to any form of negligence.after consideration of the briefing,however,we decline to address that issue.
the lanterman developmental disabilities services act welf,et defines developmental disability as a disability that originates before an individual attains age years,continues,or can be expected to continue,indefinitely,and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual.as defined by the director of developmental services,in consultation with the superintendent of public instruction,this term shall include mental retardation,cerebral palsy,epilepsy,and autism.this term shall also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation,but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature,subd.a.

we observed o bviously no public policy opposes private,voluntary transactions in which one party,for a consideration,agrees to shoulder a risk which the law would otherwise have placed upon the other party tunkl,supra,cal d.
in this regard we also observed the public policy of this state has been,in substance,to posit the risk of negligence upon the actor in instances in which this policy has been abandoned,it has generally been to allow or require that the risk shift to another party better or equally able to bear it,not to shift the risk to the weak bargainer.tunkl,supra,cal d at.
commenting further on the concept of public interest,we emphasized the public concern with respect to some types of otherwise private agreements we must note,finally,that the integrated and specialized society of today,structured upon mutual dependency,can not rigidly narrow the concept of the public interest.from the observance of simple standards of due care in the driving of a car to the performance of the high standards of hospital practice,the individual citizen must be completely dependent upon the responsibility of others.the fabric of this pattern is so closely woven that the snarling of a single thread affects the whole.we can not lightly accept a sought immunity from careless failure to provide the hospital service upon which many must depend.even if the hospital doors are open only to those in a specialized category,the hospital can not claim isolated immunity in the interdependent community of our time.it,too,is part of the social fabric,and prearranged exculpation from its negligence must partly rend the pattern and necessarily affect the public interest.tunkl,supra,cal d.

in this regard,the analysis proposed in justice kennard concurring and dissenting opinion,post,appears problematic and internally inconsistent.that opinion argues,post,in part ii,that because section does not list gross negligence as a matter that may not be released,a rule embracing the clear majority approach and generally invalidating releases of liability for gross negligence usurps the legislature authority.justice baxter dissenting opinion,post,embraces this view as well.but as noted above,tunkl itself sets forth a similarly categorical rule pursuant to tunkl,no exculpatory clause even one releasing liability for future ordinary negligence that relates to a transaction adequately exhibiting at least some of the six characteristics set forth in that case,and that thereby affects the public interest,tunkl,supra,cal d,is enforceable.accordingly,if the statutory construction analysis employed by justice kennard concurring and dissenting opinion were consistently applied,tunkl itself would be viewed as a usurpation of legislative authority.and yet neither of the separate opinions in this case adopts that view.indeed,justice kennard concurring and dissenting opinion,post,in part iii,far from questioning tunkl,embraces and extends it in a novel manner.

the court of appeal below similarly rejected the view that gross negligence lacks clear limits,observing the law is filled with difficult distinctions,yet our juries have managed to fulfill their role in making factual determinations based on them.there is no reason to believe that a jury will be unable to distinguish between ordinary and gross negligence,or that instructing the jury would be more difficult than instructing the jury in a variety of other circumstances where lines between liability and nonliability must be drawn with some acumen.see pratt western pac.d.consider ing jury instruction under statute preventing common carrier from releasing liability for gross negligence.
