appellants daniel and kathleen sheehan sued respondent san francisco,for violation of article,section of the california constitution privacy initiative,based on the team implementation of a patdown policy mandated by the national football league nfl.they challenge the dismissal of their cause following the sustaining of the demurrer without leave to amend.we conclude that the sheehans can not demonstrate that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances,and accordingly affirm the judgment.
in the fall of,in response to an inspection policy promulgated by the nfl the instituted a patdown inspection of all ticket holders attending the home games at monster park as a condition for entry to the games.the patdowns were conducted by private screeners who,according to the nfl mandate,were instructed to physically inspect by touching,patting,or lightly rubbing all ticket holders entering the stadium.the specific practice consisted of screeners running their hands around ticket holders backs and down the sides of their bodies and their legs.officers of the san francisco police department stood nearby during these inspections.the sheehans are season ticket holders and were subject to patdowns throughout the season before each game at monster park.
in december,the sheehans filed suit against the alleging that the breached their privacy rights,in violation of the privacy initiative.they sought declaratory and injunctive relief,requesting that the court find the patdown policy in violation of the privacy initiative,and enjoin the from continuing the patdown policy at home games.
the demurred,arguing that the pleaded facts did not constitute a cause of action under the privacy initiative.at the hearing the trial court questioned whether the relief sought by the sheehans was ripe,since the season was over.the sheehans stipulated that they did buy the season tickets and subsequently amended their complaint to include this detail.additionally,both parties stipulated that the demurrer would apply to the amended complaint.
following submission of supplemental briefing addressing the significance of the sheehans season ticket purchase relative to their privacy initiative cause of action,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and dismissed the action with prejudice.
ii.discussion 
we undertake an independent review of an order sustaining a demurrer to determine if,as a matter of law,the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.we accept as true the factual allegations of the pleading but not any conclusions of fact or law contained in it.moore conliffe cal th,d.we may also take judicial notice of facts subject to judicial notice.ibid.we will uphold the trial court ruling if any ground for the demurrer is well taken.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.
the sheehans urge us to reverse the judgment because the trial court misapplied the relevant law,excluding pertinent factors from its decision.we disagree.the trial court correctly ruled that the sheehans privacy initiative claim fails because they can not show any reasonable expectation of privacy under the pertinent circumstances.
hill and its progeny 
the privacy initiative provides an inalienable right in attaining and preserving one privacy.cal,art.i,hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d,hill.in seeking to define the rights inherent in the privacy initiative,our supreme court has confirmed that it protects individuals from nongovernmental entities that may intrude on an individual privacy.hill,supra,at,d.the hill court elaborated that a plaintiff asserting a privacy initiative claim must establish three essential elements a legally protected privacy interest a reasonable expectation of privacy and conduct on the part of the defendant constituting a serious invasion of privacy.id.at,d.the presence or absence of a legally recognized privacy interest is a question of law for the court to decide.id.at,d.the reasonable expectation of privacy and no serious invasion elements may also be adjudicated as a matter of law where the material facts are not in dispute.ibid.
in a later plurality opinion,the supreme court attempted to clarify that the elements articulated in hill are threshold elements intended to screen out claims that do not qualify as a significant intrusion on a privacy interest guaranteed by the privacy initiative.loder city of glendale cal th,d.in other words,these threshold elements permit courts to weed out claims that involve so insignificant or de minimis an intrusion on a constitutionally protected privacy interest as not even to require an explanation or justification by the defendant,fn.omitted 
a defendant may defeat a privacy initiative claim by negating one or more of the hill criteria or by demonstrating that the invasion of privacy is justified by a countervailing interest.hill,supra,cal th at,d.the hill court explained that privacy interests must be specifically identified and carefully compared with competing or countervailing privacy and nonprivacy interests in a balancing test.id.at,d.an invasion of privacy may be excused if it serves an important and legitimate function of a public or private entity.id.at,d.in countering a competing interest,a plaintiff may show that there are protective measures,safeguards,and alternatives that the defendant can utilize which would reduce the privacy interference.ibid.
the sheehans maintain that their complaint alleges facts amounting to a genuine and significant invasion of a protected privacy interest.they accuse the trial court of inappropriately balancing and weighing their privacy expectation against the severity of the invasion,without any evidence,or consideration,of the justification for the conduct.as we explain,rather than engaging in a flawed weighing process,the trial court properly screened out their privacy claim.additionally,we note that recently,and without any reference to loder,the supreme court reiterated that the hill factors may be assessed as a matter of law on undisputed material facts and the balancing of competing interests only comes into play when the plaintiff has established the factors constituting an invasion of a privacy interest.pioneer electronics usa,superior court cal th,d.we turn now to analysis of the first two elements of a privacy initiative claim.
legally protected privacy interest 
the sheehans assert that the private screeners patdown inspections at monster park before games breached their legally protected privacy interest.they claim that the inspections are intrusive and degrading to their bodies.the counter that the sheehans have not pled a legally protected privacy interest because their allegations have little to do with the kind of intimate and personal decisions typically recognized as an actionable invasion of autonomy privacy.
there are two types of legally protected privacy interests informational privacy and autonomy privacy.hill,supra,cal th at,d.autonomy privacy safeguards interests in making intimate personal decisions or conducting personal activities without observation,intrusion,or interference.ibid.
here,the trial court correctly ruled that the sheehans have a legally protected privacy interest in their bodies being free of unwanted patdown inspections by private security screeners.such patdowns inherently invade one autonomy.nonetheless,an actionable privacy initiative claim requires more.
reasonable expectation of privacy 
advance notice and voluntary consent 
the sheehans argue that it is premature to resolve,at the pleading stage,whether they enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances.this question,they contend,involves a mixed question of law and fact.however,to reiterate,where the facts are undisputed,we may decide the issues as a matter of law.hill,supra,cal th at,d.
we concur with the trial court decision that the sheehans have no reasonable expectation of privacy because,by attending the season games,they had advance notice of the patdown policy and thereafter impliedly consented to the patdowns by voluntarily purchasing the season tickets.in assessing whether one has a reasonable expectation of privacy,we are mindful that this is an objective entitlement founded on broadly based and widely accepted community norms.hill,supra,cal th at,d.thus,customs and physical settings of certain activities may impact an individual reasonable expectation of privacy.id.at,d.moreover,a plaintiff expectation of privacy may be diminished by advance notice of a potential invasion of a privacy interest and by subsequent voluntary consent to the privacy invasion.further,i f voluntary consent is present,a defendant conduct will rarely be deemed highly offensive to a reasonable person so as to justify tort liability.id.at,d.
in this case the sheehans were subject to the patdowns by private screeners when they attended games in the season.because the season had ended by the time the demurrer was heard,a standing issue developed.without objection,the sheehans amended their complaint,affirming that they had bought tickets for the upcoming season.thus,there is no question that they had full notice of the patdown policy and the requirement of consenting to a patdown prior to entering the stadium for a game.with notice and knowledge of this prospective intrusion,they nevertheless made the decision to purchase the season tickets.by voluntarily for the next season under these circumstances,rather than opting to avoid the intrusion by not attending the games at monster park,the sheehans impliedly consented to the patdowns.on these undisputed facts we determine,as a matter of law,that the sheehans have no reasonable expectation of privacy.furthermore,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not allowing leave to amend because there is no reasonable possibility that the sheehans could amend their complaint to state sufficient facts to establish this element 
citing,among other authority,kraslawsky upper deck th,d,the sheehans insist nonetheless that advance notice and implied consent only diminish the reasonable expectation of privacy but do not vitiate this prima facie element.however,case law is to the contrary.
tbg ins.services superior court th,d is instructive.there,the reviewing court held that an employee had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the computer installed at his home which the employee had used for his own benefit.in reaching this conclusion the court focused on the employee advance notice of the company computer monitoring policy and his agreement,pursuant to that policy,to use the computer only for business purposes.ibid.
even more helpful is heller norcal mutual ins.cal th,d.the heller plaintiff prosecuted a medical malpractice action against one treating physician and then sued another physician,not a party to the first action,for invasion of privacy and other relief.apparently the defendant in the second action had disclosed confidential medical information to the malpractice insurer.our supreme court held that by placing her physical condition at issue in the medical malpractice litigation,the plaintiff expectation of privacy was substantially lowered.id.at,d.under these circumstances,and as a matter of law,her privacy claim failed because she could not plead facts supporting a conclusion that any expectation of privacy regarding her medical condition would be reasonable.ibid.heller is directly on point because the plaintiff privacy claim was defeated as a matter of law on demurrer based on her implied consent to the offending activity.
it also bears noting that the johnston ii court,although resolving a fourth amendment challenge to the nfl patdown policy,not a privacy initiative claim,specifically took issue with the district court finding that the plaintiff did not voluntarily consent to the patdown searches t he court concludes that johnston voluntarily consented to searches each time he presented himself at a stadium entrance to attend a game.the record is replete with evidence of the advance notice johnston was given of the searches including preseason notice,pregame notice,and notice at the search point itself.it was clear error for the district court to find that johnston did not consent to the searches which were conducted.johnston ii,supra,at wl.
unconstitutional conditions doctrine 
the sheehans further insist that the patdown policy invokes an unconstitutional condition for entry into the games and is thus illegal.not so.
the unconstitutional conditions doctrine was developed to prevent state actors from conditioning the grant of governmental benefits on the giving up a constitutionally protected right.perry sindermann,d.this doctrine does not apply to private entities.wilkinson times mirror d.hence where,as here,the organization restricts entry to games on its terms,it is not subject to the unconstitutional conditions doctrine the organization is a private entity and is not offering any government benefit to its patrons 
moreover,as hill makes clear,our assessment of the relative strength and significance of privacy norms can differ where the offending action is conducted by a private as opposed to public party.hill,supra,cal th at,d.for example,the pervasive presence of coercive government power more gravely imperils the freedom of citizens than action by the private sector.ibid.the inspections in this case were not conducted pursuant to the police power of the state with authority to arrest rather,they were conducted by private screeners,on behalf of a private entity.so,too,individuals generally have greater choice and alternatives in dealing with private actors than in dealing with the government.ibid.thus,rather than submit to the patdown the sheehans had the choice of walking away,no questions asked.
iii.disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.
the majority reasons that appellants daniel and kathleen sheehan sheehans have impliedly consented to the patdown searches by respondent san francisco,because they purchased season tickets with knowledge of the search policy,ante,at.on this basis alone,the majority holds that the sheehans have relinquished all reasonable expectations of any constitutional right to be free from such searches and that,as a matter of law,they can allege no facts that could demonstrate otherwise.id.at.i disagree with both conclusions.
failure to grant leave to amend 
the court below sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,concluding the sheehans can not allege that they did not consent to the policy,and their consent is fatal to their complaint.in my view this was a clear abuse of discretion.
as stated in mcdonald superior court d,a ruling sustaining a general demurrer without leave to amend will only be upheld if the complaint alleges facts which do not entitle plaintiff to relief on any legal theory.citation.unless the complaint shows on its face that it is incapable of amendment,denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion,irrespective of whether leave to amend is requested or not.liberality in permitting amendment is the rule,not only where a complaint is defective as to form but also where it is deficient in substance,if a fair prior opportunity to correct the substantive defect has not been given.citation.
here,the sheehans were never given the opportunity to amend their complaint nor even to importune the court to allow an amendment moreover,on this record,leave to amend is clearly warranted.
the amended complaint does not allege that the sheehans will attend the games only that they have paid the cost of admission.the record also indicates that the sheehans intended to seek a preliminary injunction in august,before the opening of the new season,after completing discovery.indeed,they requested the case be given preferential treatment because t he interests of justice require that important pretrial motions be heard before the nfl football season resumes in august.
at least one reasonable inference from this record is that the sheehans would decide whether to attend the season games after they had sought a preliminary injunction before the next season began,in which case no consent can be inferred from the purchase of the tickets.sheehans might also have alleged,as has been pointed out by the sheehans,that the
