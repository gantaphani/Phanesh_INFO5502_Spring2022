introduction 
the applicant for workers compensation was a professional basketball player who was not employed by a california team,has never resided in california,has played one professional game in california out of games played during the season,and has suffered no specific injury in california.she seeks a workers compensation award in california against her former team and its insurer for a disability based on a cumulative injury.we hold that california does not have a sufficient interest in this matter to apply its workers compensation law and to retain jurisdiction over the case.we also hold that we have jurisdiction to review the order in this case even though the decision of the workers compensation appeals board board was not a final decision or order.

discussion 
matter reviewable 
a petition for a writ of review generally may be sought only from a final order,decision,or award of the board,maranian workers comp.appeals bd.th,hanna,cal.law of employee injuries and workers compensation ed,hanna.certain threshold issues,however,are reviewable by way of a writ of review before there is a final order in the case.examples of such issues include whether the injuries arose out of and in the course of employment,the territorial jurisdiction of the board,the existence of an employment relationship,and the applicability of the statute of limitations.see safeway stores,workers comp.appeals bd.d,fn.these threshold issues potentially are dispositive of the case.review of such issues may resolve the case without the time,effort,and expense of fully litigating a case.as the court stated in safeway stores,workers comp.appeals,supra,at pages,w here the employer or carrier asserts in good faith and with reasonable cause that it has no statutory liability at all,and the board has decided that issue on review after a bifurcated hearing,prompt judicial review,whatever the court decides,may avoid the necessity of further litigation.the fact that an order is reviewable does not mean that the appellate court must grant the petition for review and if an employer files a petition without reasonable basis he will be liable for attorney fees for services of the applicant attorney in connection therewith.thus,protection exists against abuse of the appellate process in such cases.review of a threshold,dispositive issue generally is accepted.see hanna,supra,at,to.this is an appropriate case for issuing a writ of review.
denial of relief 
the issue in this case is which state workers compensation law applies,not which state has personal jurisdiction.larson workers compensation law ed,larson.the issue may be characterized as a conflicts issue,which arises when there are contacts in multiple states.id.at.but here,we must decide if california law may be invoked at all.thus,the question of jurisdiction ordinarily precedes the conflict of laws question,for only after the workers compensation commissioner determines that he has authority to entertain the action does he proceed to the choice of whether to award benefits under our workers compensation act or,rather,to defer to the earlier grant of benefits under the laws of another state cleveland printing ink,see jaiguay vasquez,as contrasted with torts,the issue is whether this state has a sufficient interest in having an injured employee receive an award of workers compensation benefits under the laws of this state or to the workers compensation law of another state.thus,the wcj determination that p laying in even one professional basketball game in california is sufficient to establish jurisdiction mischaracterizes the issue,which is not one of personal jurisdiction but rather one of whether one or more state compensation laws apply and whether in this case california may provide a forum for the claim.
general principles 
as we discuss,whether california workers compensation law governs depends on the application of the due process clause of the united states constitution if an employer or the insurer are subject to workers compensation law of a state that does not have a sufficient connection to the matter they are deprived of due process.also,the determination may depend on the application of the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution that is,if the workers compensation law of another state exclusively should apply and california does not have a sufficient contact with the matter,california must,under the full faith and credit clause,accede to the other state to provide a forum.see note,state of injury may apply own law in workmen compensation cases colum.the court,at least in the areas of workmen compensation,has impliedly accepted the position that the full faith and credit requirements do not go much further,if at all,than those of due process.
in bradford electric light clapper clapper,a worker resided in vermont,and was employed by a vermont company.vermont provided that its workers compensation law was an exclusive remedy and applied if the injury occurred outside of vermont.the worker who was sent to new hampshire to repair a facility maintained by the employer was killed while carrying out that task.new hampshire law gave an employee a choice between a workers compensation proceeding and a civil proceeding.the worker administratrix filed a civil action in new hampshire and obtained a recovery.the united states supreme court held that under the full faith and credit clause,the worker actually his successor because he was killed could not maintain a civil action in the state of injury.the court noted that the worker residence,place where the employment contract was entered,and place of the employment relationship were all in vermont,as was the employer principle place of business.the worker was in new hampshire only temporarily for a task.invoking the full faith and credit clause,the court,based on the relative contacts,required new hampshire to apply vermont law.under clapper,it appeared that the place of the injury as a single factor was insufficient to permit coverage by a state when the employee presence in the state was temporary.alaska packers industrial acc.com,alaska packers and pacific employers ins.industrial acc.com.of california,pacific employers,however,mark ed a break with the clapper philosophy.crider zurich ins,see franchise tax bd.of california hyatt,approach quickly proved unsatisfactory.
in alaska packers,supra,the court held that the workers compensation law of the state of employment,rather than the law of the state where the injury occurred,could be applied,but focused on whether the state had a legitimate interest in the injury and its consequences,rather than the rigid conceptualism applied in the past.larson,supra,fn.in pacific employers,supra,the court held that the place of injury can be the factor that justifies the invocation of the law of the state where the injury occurs.in carroll lanza,the court held that the state of the place of injury need not apply the law of the place of employment,even if the latter state prohibited proceedings in the state where the injury occurred.the court in cardillo liberty mutual insurance also confirmed that the existence of a legitimate interest in the injury and its consequences is the controlling constitutional test.larson,supra.the court in cardillo liberty mutual insurance,supra,at page said that the determination depends upon some substantial connection between the district of columbia and the particular relationship and as so applied,the statute of the district of columbia fully satisfies any constitutional questions of due process or full faith and credit.
as stated by an authority,the cases make clear that the test is not whether the interest of the forum state is relatively greater,but only whether it is legitimate and substantial in itself.larson,supra,fn.omitted.thus,the forum state does not weigh interests as is done in a traditional consideration.rather,it determines whether to grant relief under its own workers compensation law or to deny relief altogether.the forum state can grant relief if it has some substantial interest in the matter.id.at.none of the supreme court cases suggests that a forum state must apply its law.the supreme court authority has treated the determination of whether a forum state should apply its workers compensation law or decline to hear the matter in deference to the laws of other states as an issue of constitutional law.
california law is consistent with united states supreme court authority.the labor code provides,the division of workers compensation,including the administrative director,and the appeals board have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out of injuries suffered outside the territorial limits of this state in those cases where the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time of the injury and the contract of hire was made in this state.see larson workers compensation law,supra,b.
in travelers ins.workmen.bd.cal d,disapproved on another ground in levesque workmen.bd.cal d,a california resident was injured while working in utah and sought to avail himself of california workers compensation law,after having obtained benefits under utah workers compensation law.the california supreme court held that his acceptance of a telephonic offer of employment while in california,resulted in the contract being made in this state.id.at.the court explained why this state had a legitimate interest in the worker injury and its consequences by employing a governmental interest analysis.it said,california has rejected the traditional mechanical solutions to problems and adopted foreign law only when it is appropriate in light of the significant interests in the particular case.the significance of elements varies directly with the nature of the forum interest in a given case.thus,california maintains a stronger interest in applying its own law to an issue involving the right of an injured californian to benefits under california compulsory workers compensation act than to an issue involving torts or contracts in which the parties rights and liabilities are not governed by a protective legislative scheme that imposes obligations on the basis of a statutorily defined status.its interest devolves both from the possibility of economic burden upon the state resulting from of the workman during the period of incapacitation,as well as from the contingency that the family of the workman might require relief in the absence of compensation.the california statute,fashioned by the legislature in its knowledge of the needs of its constituency,structures the appropriate measures to avoid these possibilities.even if the employee may be able to obtain benefits under another state compensation laws,california retains its interest in insuring the maximum application of this protection afforded by the california legislature.id.at,fns.omitted.
california courts have long focused on the contacts of the employment relationship with california in determining which state workers compensation law applies.in alaska packers indus.acc.com.cal d,the applicant,a nonresident alien,entered into a contract in san francisco with the alaska packers association to perform work in alaska.the contract provided that alaska workers compensation law would apply.id.at.the applicant was treated twice in alaska for an injury suffered there during his employment,but filed no compensation claim in that territory.he did,however,file a workers compensation claim in california upon his return.the court held that the creation of the employment relationship in california,which came about when he signed the contract in san francisco,was a sufficient contact with california to warrant the application of california workers compensation law.id.at.
in pacific industrial acc.com.cal d,the applicant was an employee of a chemical company based in massachusetts,where he worked and resided.id.at.he was sent by his company to oakland,california,to resolve a problem with a chemical compound,was injured there,and received medical treatment there.the california supreme court held that california governmental policy called for covering the medical expenses of an injured worker and that this sufficed for the application of california law.id.at.the united states supreme court held in the same case that a state workers compensation law could be invoked if the injury occurred in that state.pacific,supra,at.
