procedural history 
in december,plaintiffs daniel and kathleen sheehan filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against the.it alleged the following 
plaintiffs are longtime season ticket holders.beginning in the fall of,the instituted a patdown inspection of all ticket holders attending the home games.plaintiffs and all other ticket holders were subjected to a search by event staff screeners before they were allowed to enter the stadium.on each such occasion,after being herded through barricades,plaintiffs were forced to stand rigid,with arms spread wide.the screeners then ran their hands around the plaintiffs backs and down the sides of their bodies and their legs.members of the san francisco police department stood a few feet away from the screeners and observed the searches taking place.the implemented the patdown policy pursuant to a policy the nfl promulgated in august,by which stadium screeners are supposed to conduct physical searches by touching,patting,or lightly rubbing all ticket holders entering every nfl stadium for each nfl game that year.plaintiffs object to being forced to undergo these suspicionless searches as a condition of retaining their season tickets.
the complaint alleged that the patdown searches violated plaintiffs state constitutional right to privacy.cal,art.i.it sought a declaration that the searches were unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting any further such searches.
the demurred to the complaint,arguing that it did not state a cause of action.at the hearing,the trial court questioned whether the relief sought was ripe because the season was over.plaintiffs stated they had bought the season tickets and subsequently,in march,amended their complaint to include this fact.the amended complaint also alleged that plaintiffs believed the intended to continue conducting patdown searches of all persons entering or reentering the stadium during the next season.both parties stipulated that the demurrer would apply to the amended complaint.ultimately,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action with prejudice.plaintiffs appealed.
the court of appeal affirmed.it conclude d that the sheehans can not demonstrate that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances it explained that rather than submit to the the sheehans had the choice of walking away,no questions asked.justice rivera dissented.she disagree d that the purchase of future tickets with knowledge of the search acquiescence in a search to gain entry to the a conclusion as a matter of law that the sheehans have relinquished their reasonable expectation to be free from unjustified,intrusive searches.she would have reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for further factual development.
we granted plaintiffs petition for review,which raised the question whether the court of appeal properly found they validly consented to the search policy.
ii.discussion 
california constitution,article i,section,provides,all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty,acquiring,possessing,and protecting property,and pursuing and obtaining safety,happiness,and privacy.italics added.the phrase and privacy was added to the constitution by a voter initiative adopted in.hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d,hill the privacy initiative.
in this case,plaintiffs allege that the patdown policy violates their state constitutional right to privacy.the case comes before us after the superior court dismissed the case on demurrer.this means that the have not yet even filed an answer,given any explanation or justification for the alleged search policy,or asserted any defenses.the only record we have,and all we have to go by in deciding this case,is the complaint.in this procedural posture,we must assume that all of the facts alleged in the complaint are true.evans city of berkeley,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,we may affirm the sustaining of a demurrer only if the complaint fails to state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.fox ethicon,cal th,d.the court of appeal held that plaintiffs validly consented to the search policy.it may ultimately be right,but the meager record before us does not establish valid consent as a matter of law.in particular,the have not demonstrated that the allegations of the complaint fail to state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.further factual development is necessary.
in hill,supra,cal th,d,a case involving a challenge to the drug testing policies of the national collegiate athletic association ncaa,we considered the showing a person must make to state a violation of california constitutional right to privacy.that decision made clear that the right of privacy protects the individual reasonable expectation of privacy against a serious invasion.pioneer electronics usa,superior court cal th,d,citing hill,supra,at,d.as we recently summarized hill holding,the party claiming a violation of the constitutional right of privacy established in article i,section of the california constitution must establish a legally protected privacy interest,a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances,and a serious invasion of the privacy interest.international federation of professional and technical engineers,local,superior court cal th,d,citing hill,supra,at,d.a defendant may prevail in a state constitutional privacy case by negating any of the three elements just discussed or by pleading and proving,as an affirmative defense,that the invasion of privacy is justified because it substantively furthers one or more countervailing interests.hill,supra,at,d.
hill further explained that,c onfronted with a defense based on countervailing interests,the plaintiff may undertake the burden of demonstrating the availability and use of protective measures,safeguards,and alternatives to the defendant conduct that would minimize the intrusion on privacy interests.hill,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,t he particular context,the specific kind of privacy interest involved and the nature and seriousness of the invasion and any countervailing interests,remains the critical factor in the analysis.id.at,d.
subsequent opinions have explained that the three elements set forth in hill properly must be viewed simply as threshold elements that may be utilized to screen out claims that do not involve a significant intrusion on a privacy interest protected by the state constitutional privacy provision.these elements do not eliminate the necessity for weighing and balancing the justification for the conduct in question against the intrusion on privacy resulting from the conduct in any case that raises a genuine,nontrivial invasion of a protected privacy interest hill was the first case in which our court addressed the question whether the state constitutional privacy clause applies to private as well as to governmental entities.having concluded that the privacy clause applies to private entities and also that the legal concept of privacy potentially has a very broad sweep,the court in hill determined that it was appropriate to articulate several threshold elements that may permit courts to weed out claims that involve so insignificant or de minimis an intrusion on a constitutionally protected privacy interest as not even to require an explanation or justification by the defendant.hill can not properly be read,however,to have adopted a sweeping new rule under which a challenge to conduct that significantly affects a privacy interest protected by the state constitution may be rejected without any consideration of either the legitimacy or strength of the defendant justification for the conduct.loder city of glendale cal th,d,fn.omitted lead opn.of george,quoted in american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d,plur.opn.of george.
hill provides the analytical framework for assessing plaintiffs claim.pioneer electronics usa,superior court,supra,cal th at,d.we have applied the hill analysis in various factual contexts since it was decided,but this is the first time we have done so regarding security measures adopted at a private entertainment venue.
the first element plaintiffs must establish is a legally protected privacy interest.hill explained that such interests are generally of two classes interests in precluding the dissemination or misuse of sensitive and confidential information informational privacy and interests in making intimate personal decisions or conducting personal activities without observation,intrusion,or interference autonomy privacy.hill,supra,cal th at,d.we described the first of these classes,informational privacy,as the principal focus or core value of the constitutional privacy right.id.at,d.that interest is not implicated here.plaintiffs allege the were conducting patdown searches,not collecting personal information.the second class of privacy interests,autonomy privacy,is implicated.people certainly have,in general,a right not to have others pat them down.at this stage,plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged this element.similarly,because the issue is not within the scope of review,we may assume for present purposes that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the third element,a serious invasion of the privacy interest.
the issue here involves the second element,the one the courts below found lacking.plaintiffs must establish a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances.a reasonable expectation of privacy is an objective entitlement founded on broadly based and widely accepted community norms.hill,supra,cal th at,d.c ustoms,practices,and physical settings surrounding particular activities may create or inhibit reasonable expectations of privacy.id.at,d.a plaintiff expectation of privacy in a specific context must be objectively reasonable under the circumstances,especially in light of the competing social interests involved.id.at,d.
the factual record of this consists solely of the not establish what the competing social interests are.presumably,the nfl,and ultimately the,adopted the policy to enhance spectator safety,but the record does not establish this or explain why the nfl believed the policy was appropriate.as evidenced by the circumstance that the pursuit of safety,like the pursuit of privacy,is a state constitutional right,the competing social interest of enhancing safety is substantial.those who provide private entertainment venues,including the at nfl football games,have a substantial interest in protecting the safety of their patrons.but when the security measures substantially threaten a privacy right,courts review the policy for reasonableness under the circumstances.here,we can not do so because the record does not establish the circumstances of,or the reasons for,the patdown policy.the have not yet given any justification for its policy.
we have explained that,in order to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy,the plaintiff must have conducted himself or herself in a manner consistent with an actual expectation of privacy,he or she must not have manifested by his or her conduct a voluntary consent to the invasive actions of defendant.if voluntary consent is present,a defendant conduct will rarely be deemed highly offensive to a reasonable person so as to justify tort liability.hill,supra,cal th at,d.but the validity of the consent theory depends on the totality of the circumstances,which this record does not establish.for example,in mcmorris alioto cir,where the court upheld the use of courthouse magnetometers on a consent theory,the issue arose on summary judgment after factual development,not on demurrer with no factual development.
the eleventh circuit court of appeals recently upheld on a consent theory an nfl patdown search policy that is similar but slightly different from the one alleged here.johnston tampa sports authority cir.johnston did not consider california constitutional privacy right,but it involved the tampa sports authority,a public entity.id.at.the search at issue was performed by state agents,and thus the restrictions of the fourth amendment to the united states constitution applied.johnston,supra,at.hill held that the california privacy right applies against private entities,but it also stated that t he privacy protected by the privacy initiative is no broader in the area of search and seizure than the privacy protected by the fourth amendment hill,supra,cal th at,fn,d.however,johnston reached its conclusion on a full factual record,a record lacking here.the search policy described in johnston is also different from the one alleged here.in johnston,the search encompassed only limited searches johnston,supra,at here,plaintiffs allege that the screeners ran their hands around the plaintiffs backs and down the sides of their bodies and their legs.
moreover,although consent is an important factor in determining whether california constitutional privacy right is being infringed,hill does not stand for the proposition that a person who chooses to attend an entertainment event consents to any security measures the promoters may choose to impose no matter how intrusive or unnecessary.hill concluded that,a lthough diminished by the athletic setting and the exercise of informed consent,plaintiffs privacy interests are not thereby rendered de minimis.hill,supra,cal th at,d.we held that the ncaa use of a particularly intrusive monitored urination procedure justifies further inquiry,even under conditions of decreased expectations of privacy.ibid.thus,a person can be deemed to consent only to intrusions that are reasonable under the circumstances.
one relevant circumstance for the court to consider in determining the search policy reasonableness is that the nfl and the are private entities.although we held in hill that the state constitutional right of privacy creates a right of action against private as well as government entities hill,supra,cal th at,d,we also explained that j udicial assessment of the relative strength and importance of privacy norms and countervailing interests may differ in cases of private,as opposed to government,action.id.at,d.two reasons for the difference might apply here.first,the pervasive presence of coercive government power in basic areas of human life typically poses greater dangers to the freedoms of the citizenry than actions by private persons.ibid.second,an individual generally has greater choice and alternatives in dealing with private actors than when dealing with the government.citation.initially,individuals usually have a range of choice among landlords,employers,vendors and others with whom they deal v arying degrees of competition in the marketplace may broaden or narrow the range.id.at,d.
we further explained that t hese generalized differences between public and private action may affect privacy rights differently in different contexts.if,for example,a plaintiff claiming a violation of the state constitutional right to privacy was able to choose freely among competing public or private entities in obtaining access to some opportunity,commodity,or service,his or her privacy interest may weigh less in the balance.in contrast,if a public or private entity controls access to a vitally necessary item,it may have a correspondently greater impact on the privacy rights of those with whom it deals.hill,supra,cal th at,d.
another factor to consider is the exis
