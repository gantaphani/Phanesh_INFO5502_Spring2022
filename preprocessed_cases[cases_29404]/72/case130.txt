in august,butts through his company,defendant telluride properties,defendant albert roer,and defendant polly lynchee formed a new company,defendant telluride properties,llc the three principals entered into a agreement requiring each principal to sell his or her interest in the business to the remaining principals in the event of his or her death.the agreement was financed by insurance policies on the lives of each of the three principals.on september,butts contacted wcli agent sharon evanson by phone to complete an application for a three million dollar life insurance policy the butts application.evanson read the questions on the application and transcribed butts responses.
the fifth question of the butts application question asked if butts e ngaged in auto,motorcycle or boat racing,parachuting,skin or scuba diving,skydiving,or hang gliding or other hazardous avocation or hobby.butts answered the question in the negative.the butts application contained a declaration that all statements and answers were full,complete,and true to the best of butts knowledge and belief.butts did not at any point during the call mention he participated in.involves flying by helicopter to the top of a backcountry mountain and skiing down the mountain,usually with the escort of guides.
alex chu,a senior life insurance reporter at first financial underwriting services,first financial,conducted a telephonic interview with butts on october.first financial is an independent,company that,at the request of its insurance company clients,gathers information about the lifestyles and finances of life insurance applicants,typically through telephone interviews.chu asked butts what he did for recreation and exercise in his spare time,to which butts answered he skied and golfed.chu also asked butts if he engaged in any hazardous activities.butts stated he was involved only in scuba diving and private aviation as a pilot.butts did not seek any clarification of this question or voice concerns or confusion as to the meaning of hazardous activities.during chu tenure at first financial,applicants had identified in response to the hazardous activity question.

in october,mark youngquist,an underwriter for wcli,underwrote a three million dollar policy the butts policy insuring butts life.in so doing,youngquist reviewed the butts application,butts medical records,the first financial report,and a questionnaire completed by butts regarding his aviation activities.youngquist,who worked as an underwriter since for other insurance companies,had worked for wcli for less than a month when he approved the butts application.the wcli underwriting manual,published by reinsurer swiss re,does not rate resort skiing as an activity to be factored into the underwriting process,however,is a rated activity requiring the insured to pay a higher premium.youngquist never referred to this rating table during the process of underwriting the butts policy.
based on the information before him,youngquist believed butts engaged only in resort skiing.youngquist made no inquiry into the nature of the skiing activity mentioned in the first financial report.youngquist determined the butts policy should be issued on a standard,rating on november,wcli issued the butts policy,which expressly incorporated the butts application.
on january,butts traveled to british columbia with a group of friends for a week of.the group hired operator helicopter skiing llp.on january,butts was with his friends when an avalanche broke above them.the avalanche caught butts,and swept him into some trees.within minutes,butts was found dead.he suffered a broken neck as a result of the avalanche.
during her deposition,butts testified he took approximately ten to fifteen trips with and additional trips to canada with another operator.butts took trips to british columbia with every year for at least six consecutive years prior to his application.each year,butts had signed a release of liability,waiver of claims,assumption of risk and indemnity agreement,each of which included the following language 
i am aware that wilderness skiing involves risks,dangers and hazards in addition to those normally associated with downhill skiing.avalanches occur frequently in the alpine terrain used for wilderness skiing and may be caused by natural forces or by skiers.i acknowledge and accept that the o perators and their staff may fail to predict whether the alpine terrain is safe for skiing or whether an avalanche may occur.the alpine terrain used for wilderness skiing is uncontrolled,unmarked,not inspected and involves many risks,dangers and hazards in addition to that of avalanche.

after receiving notification of butts death,wcli initiated an investigation.wcli received evidence indicating butts had previously participated in trips.in march,wcli chief underwriter,steven hetherington,composed an opinion as to the impact of on the risk assumptions for the butts policy.hetherington determined that had butts disclosed his activities,the butts policy would have been rated in the amount of an extra per of coverage.marilyn reed,wcli vice president of underwriting,adopted hetherington underwriting opinion.
according to wcli underwriters,had butts disclosed his avocation,his annual premium would have almost tripled,rising from to.wcli independent agent,stuart bachman,contacted other life insurance companies to determine if they applied an additional rating for.every carrier bachman contacted indicated would result in an additional rating of at least per dollars of coverage.
wcli contestable claims committee met on july,to discuss and evaluate the butts policy claim.the committee considered whether a reasonable objective person interpretation of question would have led such a person to disclose a avocation such as that of butts.the committee did not consider whether butts was an expert skier,whether he believed was hazardous,or if he had previously without incident because it felt such information was irrelevant to its decision.the committee voted unanimously to deny payment under the butts policy based upon butts failure to disclose he regularly engaged in.
procedural history 
wcli filed its complaint in the district court seeking rescission of the butts policy pursuant to colorado law,and a declaration that the butts policy was void ab initio and wcli was thus not liable to defendants thereunder.in their answer,defendants asserted state law counterclaims for breach of contract,bad faith,and violation of the colorado consumer protection act.to.the district court dismissed defendants consumer protection act counterclaim with prejudice.
both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted wcli motion for summary judgment,concluding butts had made a false statement of fact or concealed a fact in his application for insurance because a reasonable person would have understood was a hazardous activity for purposes of question,butts knew was a hazardous activity and knowingly concealed the fact he engaged in it,the concealment materially affected the risk assumed by wcli,wcli was ignorant of the false statement of fact or concealment of fact and was not chargeable with knowledge of the fact,and wcli relied on butts false statement in issuing the butts policy.
on appeal,defendants contend the district court erred in granting summary judgment to wcli on its rescission claim because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether there was a false statement or concealed fact in the butts application,butts knowingly made the false statement or concealed the facts,and wcli was chargeable with the knowledge butts.defendants also appeal the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to their bad faith claim.
iii.discussion 
motion to strike 
in its motion to strike,wcli contends this court should not consider certain arguments and evidence raised by defendants for the first time on appeal.specifically,in their reply brief,defendants for the first time offer statistical evidence regarding auto accident fatalities and discuss the colorado ski safety act requirement that ski resort lift tickets warn of the risk of resort skiing as support for their argument that reasonable minds could differ on whether is a hazardous activity.defendants ask the court to take judicial notice of the accident statistics.in addition,defendants argue the colorado ski safety act cite was properly included in their reply brief in order to rebut an argument raised in wcli answer brief.
whether an appellate court will for the first time take judicial notice of a judicially notable fact rests largely in its own discretion.mills denver tramway,cir.defendants offer no explanation for why they did not seek to introduce the auto accident fatality statistics before the district court.in addition,consideration of this evidence for the first time in defendants reply brief denies wcli the opportunity to contest or rebut the evidence.stump gates,cir.we therefore decline to take judicial notice of the auto accident fatality statistics and grant wcli motion to strike these statistics.see am.stores comm r of internal revenue,cir judicial notice is not a talisman by which gaps in a litigant evidentiary presentation may be repaired on appeal.quotation omitted.
as to the introduction of colorado statutory requirement that ski resort lift tickets warn of the risk of resort skiing,defendants maintain this evidence was properly introduced for the first time in their reply brief in response to an argument in wcli answer brief.specifically,it rebuts wcli contention that the requirement that individuals sign a release before engaging in supports the proposition a reasonable person would view as hazardous.while wcli precise argument regarding the release requirement was raised before the district court,the evidence defendants now seek to introduce to rebut the argument was never brought to the attention of the district court.this court has stated i n reviewing a grant of summary judgment,our inquiry is limited to the summary judgment record before the district court when the motion was decided.feichko denver rio grande,cir.in addition,as discussed above,this court is reluctant to consider evidence raised only in a reply brief,leaving the opposing party no opportunity to challenge its validity or relevance.see am.stores,at.we therefore grant wcli motion to strike this evidence.
rescission of the life insurance policy 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonprevailing party.mullin travelers indem.of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute over any material fact,and a party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.id.quotation omitted.under colorado law,to avoid a life insurance policy due to misrepresentations in the application,an insurer must prove 
the applicant made a false statement of fact or concealed a fact in his application for insurance the applicant knowingly made the false statement or knowingly concealed the fact the false statement of fact or the concealed fact materially affected either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer the insurer was ignorant of the false statement of fact or concealment of fact and is not chargeable with knowledge of the fact the insurer relied,to its detriment,on the false statement of fact or concealment of fact in issuing the policy.
hollinger mut.benefit life ins,footnote omitted.defendants contend the district court erred in concluding no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the first,second,and fourth elements of the hollinger standard.
i.the first and second hollinger elements 
the first element,the applicant made a false statement,is encompassed in the second element,the applicant knowingly made a false statement.id.because there is significant overlap in the parties arguments regarding the first and second elements,we consider the two elements together.wade olinger life insurance holds that in determining whether an applicant knowingly made a false statement,a court must look beyond the applicant mere knowledge she engaged in the activity which was allegedly required to be disclosed by the insurance question.namely,to protect innocent insurance applicants,an applicant must be reasonably chargeable with knowledge that the facts omitted or misrepresented were within the scope of questions asked on the application.id.the court further explained that in the context of answering an insurance application question which calls for a value judgment,a particular misrepresentation must be such that a r easonable person would,under the circumstances,have understood that the question calls for disclosure of specific information.id.the court elaborated on this standard in hollinger,a companion case to wade.hollinger,at.in hollinger,the court explained the standard applied in wade was whether a reasonable person,with the applicant physical or mental characteristics,under all the circumstances,would understand that the question calls for disclosure of specific information.id.
question asked butts if he e ngaged in auto,motorcycle or boat racing,parachuting,skin or scuba diving,skydiving,or hang gliding or other hazardous avocation or hobby.wcli contends butts negative response to question was unreasonable in light of his yearly vacations.defendants argue reasonable minds could differ as to whether constitutes a hazardous activity,and thus the question should have been submitted to the jury.defendants further contend because butts believed was not a hazardous activity,his response to question could not have constituted a misrepresentation.
this court must thus decide whether a reasonable person in butts position would know constituted a hazardous activity for purposes of the insurance policy.we agree with the district court that reasonable purchas
