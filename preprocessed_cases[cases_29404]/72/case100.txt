background 
factual background 
hok sport is a subsidiary of hellmuth,obata kassabaum,the largest architectural firm in the united states.hok sport has designed stadiums for major league baseball and thirty national football league franchises,as well as soccer,minor league baseball,and collegiate stadiums.
krause is the president and chief executive officer of kum go,kum go,a chain of convenience stores located throughout the midwest.krause owns approximately of fc des moines,which owns the menace.the menace is a minor league soccer club located in urbandale,iowa,a suburb of des moines,iowa.krause,as the owner of the menace,wanted a new soccer stadium built in urbandale to increase the market value and prestige of the menace.upon completion of the stadium,the city of urbandale would have owned the stadium and received a nominal rent payment.calcio,a entity owned by krause,would have operated the stadium as a business.under this arrangement,the menace,as a tenant of the stadium,would have paid rent to calcio.
on november,krause created tsf,a nonprofit corporation.according to tsf articles of incorporation,tsf was to be operated exclusively for the benefit of the city of urbandale,iowa by constructing and maintaining a stadium.tsf raised funds to build the stadium from both public and private sources,including a million donation from krause that was contingent upon construction of the stadium.
krause was tsf president,sole officer,and only member of its board of directors.under krause supervision,tsf filed articles of incorporation with the secretary of state and drafted bylaws.krause,however,did not always treat tsf and the menace as separate entities.for example,tsf lacked a bank account from november,until march,and in the interim,tsf deposits were credited to the menace bank account.tsf was incorporated without any capital despite accounting entries showing tsf owed to the menace for services rendered before tsf was incorporated.krause requested employees of the menace and kum go work as volunteers for tsf.these volunteers provided accounting and other services to tsf.the only person ever to be a employee of tsf was sharon krause,krause wife.tsf never held a board meeting.
on september,the menace sent out a request for proposals for architectural services rfp.the menace selected and contracted with hok sport as the architect for the stadium.the rfp indicated the stadium initial seating capacity would be between and and the estimated cost of construction would be between and million.the location for the new stadium was street and aurora avenue in urbandale.the rfp set the completion date as the spring of however,krause later moved the completion date to the spring of.to accommodate this construction schedule,hok sport treated the project as a project,in which subsequent design phases may be started even though a previous one had not yet been completed.
on november and,hok sport mailed letter agreements to tsf regarding the performance of architectural services for the stadium.on december,krause,on behalf of tsf,signed the letter agreement dated november.the letter agreement provided hok sport would provide architectural services for the stadium,including planning analysis,programming,conceptual design,and cost estimates.the letter agreement contained a future services clause,which provided 
it is anticipated that upon conclusion of the conceptual design services the project will be defined with sufficient detail and parameters to proceed with basic design services from schematic design through construction administration as identified in the american institute of architects aia b agreements.this letter agreement will act as a letter of intent to the effect that hok sport will be retained by the owner to continue providing design services for this project through completion of construction.the professional services fees payable to hok sport and its consultants shall range from of a construction cost to of a construction cost.
pursuant to the future services clause,in february,hok sport mailed a contract based on aia cm to tsf.tsf never signed or agreed to the proffered contract.
hok sport started programming and conceptual design work for the stadium in november.generally,the programming and conceptual design work includes some design work,site planning,and drawings with limited detail.on december,hok sport submitted a invoice to the menace for services rendered before december.on january,the menace paid hok sport the.hok sport completed the programming and conceptual design work in late january or early february.on april,hok sport submitted a second invoice for services rendered through january.
hok sport also simultaneously performed schematic design work.by march,hok sport had generally completed the preliminary schematic design work,and,on april,hok sport billed tsf for the work.shortly thereafter,tsf paid to hok sport for both the second invoice for the programming and conceptual design work and the schematic design work.before writing the check,tsf had in its newly opened bank account.to cover the balance of the check,krause ordered kum go to deposit in tsf bank account.
hok sport completed the design development phase on june.design development includes designing the mechanical,electrical,and structural systems in greater detail.in the phase,weitz company weitz,the construction manager,developed cost estimates and schedules,as well as reviewed plans and specifications.on july,based on hok sport design development plans,weitz submitted a cost estimate of for the stadium.the estimate exceeded the construction budget,which then was between approximately and million.in response,krause ordered hok sport to delay the design and construction work and to begin value engineering,that is,cutting features to reduce the cost of the project.accordingly,hok sport stopped work.the construction documents were approximately complete when hok sport stopped work.
on april,the city of urbandale decided not to move forward with the stadium.as a result,krause presented the stadium project to other cities in iowa,including des moines,west des moines,waukee,grimes,carlisle,altoona,and johnston.during presentations to these cities,krause represented he was acting on behalf of tsf and used materials prepared by hok sport.hok sport submitted an invoice to the menace for for services rendered through july.tsf never paid the invoice because the cost estimate exceeded the project budget.
procedural background 
hok sport filed a complaint,bringing four causes of action breach of contract against tsf and the menace unjust enrichment against tsf and the menace quantum meruit against tsf and the menace and civil fraud against tsf,the menace,and krause.hok sport also sought to hold krause personally liable by disregarding tsf and the menace corporate form.tsf brought counterclaims against hok sport for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.
the menace filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing the menace was not a proper party to the dispute.the district court denied the menace motion.the dispute proceeded to trial.at the conclusion of the evidence,hok sport and the defendants filed motions for judgment as a matter of law however,the menace never argued it was not a proper party to the dispute.the district court denied the motions.the jury returned a verdict,finding hok sport had not proven its breach of contract claim against tsf and the menace hok sport had proven its breach of implied contract and unjust enrichment claims against tsf and the menace hok sport had not proven its fraudulent misrepresentation claim against tsf,the menace,and krause hok sport had proven krause should be held personally liable for the damages award against tsf,but hok sport had not proven krause should be held personally liable for the damages award against the menace.the jury also found tsf had not proven either its breach of contract counterclaim or its negligent misrepresentation counterclaim.the jury awarded hok sport in damages.the district court entered judgment in accordance with the verdict.
this appeal followed.the defendants argue the jury instructions misstated the applicable law by instructing iowa code did not preempt rights,including the alter ego doctrine and the remedy of piercing the corporate veil the veil of a nonprofit corporation could be pierced because it was undercapitalized and the veil of a nonprofit corporation could be pierced because it failed to follow corporate formalities.the defendants also argue insufficient evidence supports disregarding tsf corporate form and a new trial is warranted.the menace further contends it is not a proper party.the defendants appealed neither the amount of damages nor the district court judgment on the defendants counterclaims.

under iowa law,an entity corporate form can be disregarded either by applying the alter ego doctrine or by piercing the corporate veil.see team,teamco,iowa en banc.typically,a corporate entity and its owners are separate and distinct.this arrangement encourages investment by limiting the owners exposure to the amount invested.see briggs transp.starr sales,iowa.nonetheless,w here equity requires us to examine the purposes of a corporation,we are not bound by forms,fiction,or technical rules,we want the truth.benson richardson,iowa.disregarding the entity corporate form under either the alter ego doctrine or the remedy of piercing the corporate veil is an extraordinary measure that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances,see in re ballstaedt,iowa grand lodge of iowa of the indep.order of odd fellows osceola lodge,iowa,and the party seeking to do so bears the burden of proof,see mac.chambers iowa tae kwon do,iowa en banc.
to further the public convenience,cure wrongs,protect against fraud,and advance the ends of justice,the alter ego doctrine disregards an entity corporate form if the entity is merely an instrumentality or device set up to ensure the avoidance of the legal obligations.benson,at citing kline kline,per curiam.a corporate entity is the alter ego of a person if the person influences and governs the entity a unity of interest and ownership exists such that the corporate entity and the person can not be separated and giving legal effect to the fictional separation between the corporate entity and the person would sanction a fraud or promote injustice.frank mccleary cattle sewell,cited with approval in odd fellows,at accord benson,at.the alter ego doctrine applies to nonprofit corporations to the same extent it applies to corporations,odd fellows,at.
piercing the corporate veil is a equitable remedy whereby an entity corporate form is disregarded to prevent an injustice.see id.at see also united states bestfoods,d.under iowa law,disregarding an entity corporate form by piercing the corporate veil is appropriate if the corporation is a mere shell,serving no legitimate business purpose,and used primarily as an intermediary to perpetuate fraud or promote injustice.in re ballstaedt,at quoting mac.chambers,at quoting briggs,at.m ere identity of ownership and corporate management is not alone sufficient to permit a piercing of the corporate veil.team,at.
an abuse of the corporate privilege may justify piercing the corporate veil as to persons who actively participate in the conduct of corporate affairs and have provided inadequate capitalization.briggs,at.the corporate form can be disregarded if the corporation is undercapitalized,without separate books,its finances are not kept separate from individual finances,individual obligations are paid by the corporation,the corporation is used to promote fraud or illegality,corporate formalities are not followed,or the corporation is merely a sham.lakota girl scout council,havey,cir,cited with approval by mac chambers,at.a party seeking to pierce the corporate veil need not prove all six factors,but it must prove at least one of the factors.see fazio brotman,iowa.for example,fraud is a sufficient,but not necessary,condition for piercing the corporate veil.see adam mount pleasant bank trust,iowa fraud is not a prerequisite for piercing the corporate veil.state ex rel.miller internal energy mgmt,iowa f raud constitutes a sufficient basis for piercing the corporate veil.see also team,at.for the same equitable reasons,courts apply the remedy of piercing the corporate veil to both and nonprofit corporations.see william meade fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of corporations.
krause argues the alter ego doctrine and the remedy of piercing the corporate veil are inapplicable to nonprofit corporations because iowa code is the exclusive means to impose personal liability on the directors of nonprofit corporations.unless the language of a statute directly negates the common law,the statute must be interpreted in conformity with the common law.rieff evans,iowa en banc.if,however,the statute has preempted rights,the common law must recede.id.at.s tatutes will not be construed as taking away common law rights existing at the time of enactment unless that result is imperatively required by the language of the statute.collins king,iowa accord bestfoods,at.stating to abrogate a principle,the statute must speak directly to the question addressed by the common law quoting united states texas,d.
section had three parts.first,it extended the rule that stockholders generally are not liable for a corporation debts,see hampson weare,iowa,iowa,to the directors,officers,employees,and members of nonprofit corporations.second,it exculpated the directors,officers,members,and other volunteers of nonprofit corporations of personal liability,based solely on their status with the nonprofit corporation,for torts committed by the nonprofit corporation.estate of countryman farmers coop.ass n,iowa en banc concluding iowa code,an analogous statute governing the personal liability of members and managers of limited liability companies,exculpated members and managers for company torts solely by reason of being a member or manager of an llc quoting iowa code third,it held the directors,officers,employees,members,and other volunteers of nonprofit corporations personally liable to the same extent the directors of corporations typically are held personally liable.see iowa code id.
the language of section does not indicate the iowa legislature intended to preempt rights.cookies food,lakes warehouse,iowa concluding a director owed the corporation the additional duties of good faith,honesty,and fairness,although iowa code only provided transactions involving the corporation and director were not void or voidable assuming either complete disclosure and ratification or a fair and reasonable transaction.the preface to section is insufficiently precise to negate rights.the defendants interpretation of section is not imperatively required by the statutory language forecasting the iowa supreme court opinion,we hold section preempted neither the alter ego doctrine nor the remedy of piercing the corporate veil.
undercapitalization 
the defendants argue the district court erred by instructing the jury that tsf corporate form could be disregarded if tsf were undercapitalized.the defendants assert nonprofit corporations can not be adequately capitalized because the iowa nonprofit corporation act prohibited the investment of equity capital in nonprofit corporations.see generally iowa code a nonprofit corporation shall not have or issue shares of stock.in support,the defendants cited macaluso jenkins,d,for the proposition p laintiffs,who consented to contract with a nonprofit corporation,knowingly assumed the risk that the nonprofit corporation was thinly capitalized.id.in macaluso,the appellate court of illinois,second division,affirmed the jury verdict and trial court decision to pierce the veil of a nonprofit corporation as to the person who exercised ownership control over,made most or all of the decisions,was the sole representative for,and intended to profit from the nonprofit corporation.id.at.the appellate court also affirmed the trial court decision to dismiss the case against a clerical volunteer of the nonprofit corporation.id.at.in doing so,the appellate court noted,in dicta,nonprofit corporations had no duty to be capitalized under illinois law and the plaintiffs had assumed the risk of nonpayment by dealing with a thinly capitalized nonprofit corporation.id.we disagree with the dicta in macaluso.
in the context of a corporation,the iowa supreme court stated 
if a corporation is organized and carries on business without substantial capital in such a way that the corporation is likely to have no sufficient assets available to meet its debts,it is inequitable that shareholders should set up such a flimsy organization to escape personal liability.the attempt to do corporate business without providing any sufficient basis of financial responsibility to creditors is an abuse of the separate entity and will be ineffectual to exempt the shareholders from corporate debts.it is coming to be recognized as the policy of the law that shareholders should in good faith put at the risk of the business unencumbered capital reasonably adequate for its prospective liabilities.if capital is illusory or trifling compared with the business to be done and the risks of loss,this is a ground for denying the separate entity privilege.
briggs,at quoting henry ballantine,ballantine on corporations,ed.
the reasoning of the iowa supreme court in briggs transportation can logically be extended to nonprofit corporations.a corporation may be undercapitalized due to either an insufficient contribution of equity capital or an insufficient amount of capital available to satisfy the corporation liabilities.see mac chambers,at see also fletcher cyclopedia of the law of corporations inadequate capitalization generally means capitalization very small in relation to the nature of the business of the corporation and the risks attendant to such businesses.although a nonprofit corporation can not be financed with equity capital,nonprofit corporations typically receive donations and have other sources of funding,such as earned income.see heather gottry,profit or perish social service organizations social entrepreneurship,geo.on poverty pol y.donations,a form of capital,are to a nonprofit corporation what equity capital is to a corporation.
a nonprofit corporation veil may be pierced only if it is undercapitalized in the context of the business that it conducts.many nonprofit corporations begin operating with very little capital,yet are not necessarily undercapitalized,if the nonprofit corporation assumes only small liabilities and the nature of its business is not particularly risky.united states mcgough,cir noting nonprofit corporations are often thinly capitalized.alternatively,if a nonprofit corporation engages in commercial transactions and operates as a sophisticated business entity in an area of commerce typically frequented by businesses,the nonprofit corporation may need to be capitalized to approximately the same extent that a corporation should be capitalized.see medlock medlock,holding a nonprofit corporation is subject to the equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil and explaining many of the legal changes now applicable to nonprofits reflect logical extensions of settled law to the altered reality of nonprofits.such extensions are based on a fundamental jurisprudential tenet similar factual situations dictate similar legal treatment.quoting evelyn alicia lewis,when entrepreneurs of commercial nonprofits divorce is it anybody business a perspective on individual property rights in nonprofits.we hold,anticipating the result under iowa law,the veil of a nonprofit corporation may be pierced on grounds the nonprofit corporation was undercapitalized if the nonprofit corporation has operated in a fashion similar to a business without being sufficiently capitalized.to hold otherwise would be to focus myopically on the entities involved in the transaction rather than the actual substance of the transaction,see benson,at,and would encourage the unscrupulous to take advantage of others by shifting liabilities and risks to nonprofit corporations.
failure to follow corporate formalities 
the defendants argue the district court erred by instructing the jury that tsf corporate form could be disregarded if tsf failed to follow corporate formalities the iowa limited liability company act of,iowa code,limits the extent of the personal liability of members of limited liability companies to the personal liability of shareholders of corporations,except that the failure to hold meetings or the failure to observe formalities pertaining to the calling or conduct of meetings shall not be considered a factor tending to establish that the members have personal liability for any debt,obligation,or liability of the limited liability company.iowa code.compared to the factors that support piercing the veil of a corporation,section eliminated the failure to hold meetings as a factor that could support piercing the veil of a limited liability company.see estate of countryman,at.the elimination of the failure to hold meetings factor for limited liability companies is rational because the managers or members of limited liability companies may exercise corporate power without making decisions by voting at formal meetings.see iowa code,see also steven bahls,application of corporate common law doctrines to limited liability companies,iowa code,requiring a majority vote of the limited liability company members only to dissolve and wind up,to sell or pledge all or substantially all of the assets,or to merge,and,unless agreed otherwise,a unanimous vote to amend the articles of organization or operating agreement.in contrast,a corporation board of directors exercise corporate power by voting on decisions at formal meetings.see id.because,in contrast to a corporation,a limited liability company can be managed without holding formal meetings,the failure to hold meetings is not an extraordinary occurrence that supports disregarding its corporate form.
this distinction is important,because the questio
