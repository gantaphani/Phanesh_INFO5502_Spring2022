several female former employees of the new mexico scorpions,a minor league hockey team,filed suit against the team and various of its managers,alleging that they engaged in sexual harassment and other conduct proscribed by title vii and state law.after a trial,a jury found for defendants on all counts.in this appeal,plaintiffs direct us to no fewer than thirty rulings they argue were mistaken and require reversal.we find one such argument meritorious.after the district court decision,and during the pendency of this appeal,the supreme court issued burlington northern santa fe railway company white,d,setting forth a new rubric for analyzing title vii retaliation cases.in white,the court held that an employee subjected to employer conduct,whether inside or outside the workplace,that well might dissuade an objectively reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination suffers a sufficiently adverse action to state a claim under title vii.because a reasonable jury could find that the employer in this case took such an action against one of the plaintiffs before us,rosann williams,we reverse and remand her retaliation claim for trial.on all remaining scores,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in a complaint,employees who handled ticketing,box office,and office manager duties,among others,for the a pattern of hostile,activity implicating their rights under title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et,and state law.they directed their suit against the team owner,sports,sports its president william douglas frank patrick dunn,a retired player who served as the team general manager and tyler boucher,another retired player who served as assistant to the president after six months of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted in part and denied in part,
most pertinent among the district court rulings for our purposes is the disposition of williams claim for unlawful retaliation under title vii.williams began this suit alleging various retaliatory acts.underlying them all is the fact that,sometime in early,williams complained to her supervisors,and later to government officials,about discrimination at her workplace.specifically,months prior to her termination,williams voiced discomfort over boucher and the players repeated use of profanity when addressing her to dunn and frank.upon her supervisors alleged failure to remedy the problem,williams took her grievance to the human rights division of the new mexico department of labor nmdol in january.in march of the same year,williams filed an official complaint with the human rights division charging sports with gender discrimination and sexual harassment.
shortly after her filing,williams testified that she and frank had two discussions that frank explained that there were rumors circulating about williams being intimately involved with the team coach and some players,as well as certain season ticket holders and that he suggested that williams resign,offering her a severance package if she did so.williams refused to resign and asked for a written explanation why she was being fired.frank allegedly responded that she did not need a piece of paper to know that she was fired and to g et the expletive out of his office.williams last day of work was march.
williams contends that,after firing her,frank then told her not to fight him on this,and that if she did fight him,all the rumors about her sexual activities would be made public,whether or not they were true.he also threatened,i will ruin your marriage you have kids and you have a husband to worry about.id.williams alleges that sports proceeded to carry out frank threats by opposing her application for unemployment benefits with the nmdol.specifically,sports submitted a written statement asserting it had fired williams for cause because of williams supposed failure to heed warnings or correct behavior regarding,among other incidents,repeated instances of sexual misconduct w ith peers and subordinates amounting to sexual harassment drinking and alcohol and theft of company property,proprietary information.the company filing represented that sports could support these allegations through the testimony of junior employees,peers,and superiors.as it happens,however,the company never provided any such evidence to the nmdol,and williams alleges that these allegations were false and retaliatory in design.
because of sports opposition to her application,the nmdol scheduled and held a hearing on williams unemployment benefits application.at that hearing,though apparently not on the record,sports counsel,john phillips,allegedly asked williams,what do you want to just shut up and go away.after williams expressed her belief that sports could not give her back what it has taken away,phillips purportedly proposed a quid pro quo if you will drop your human rights discrimination claim,i wo fight you on your unemployment.id.williams declined the offer,and in spite of the hearing and sports opposition,the nmdol ultimately determined williams was entitled to unemployment benefits.
throughout its proceedings,the district court treated sports termination of williams as a functionally separate claim of retaliation from frank threats and sports opposition to her unemployment benefits application williams did not contest this procedure before the district court and does not do so before us.with respect to the first alleged act of.williams district court proceeded to grant summary judgment to sports on the ground that,in its view,williams had failed to adduce evidence of a causal link between her firing and her protected title vii right to pursue claims of gender discrimination.while raising many other arguments for reversal,williams chose not to appeal this decision.the remaining acts of alleged frank threats and sports opposition to her unemployment benefits to trial along with a variety of other causes of action and forms the crux of this appeal.
at trial,plaintiffs testified to sexually charged comments and behavior by a number of the defendants and other scorpions team members and employees.they also presented evidence seeking to establish that their work environment caused them to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder.in contrast,defendants offered evidence seeking to portray the office as rowdy and informal,emphasizing the plaintiffs own use of foul language.defendants also elicited testimony from the plaintiffs regarding other potential causes,besides their work environment,that might have induced plaintiffs claimed emotional distress.
at the close of plaintiffs case in chief,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law on williams remaining retaliation claim and various other counts.the district court granted the motion with respect to williams retaliation claim,and in doing so reasoned that 
my review of the case law leads me to conclude that one of the requirements of a retaliation claim based on the opposition to unemployment benefits is that the plaintiff benefits,at the very least,have to have been delayed,suspended,or not paid and in this case,that did happen.therefore,with respect to the unemployment benefits,i find and conclude that plaintiff williams suffered no delay or cessation in the benefits and,therefore,did not suffer an adverse employment action with respect to the opposition for unemployment.
plaintiffs counsel orally responded to the court ruling by representing that williams unemployment benefits had been suspended,to which the district court replied that it was open to reconsidering its ruling,inviting williams counsel to bring the evidence in the transcript establishing this to its attention,adding that,if i wrong on that,you can ask me to reconsider the retaliation claim.williams counsel took the district court up on this offer,asking it to reconsider its ruling and pointing the district court to four pages of williams testimony purporting to show that she had testified as to an interruption in her benefits.the district court found,however,that none of this testimony established any cessation,suspension,or diminution of williams benefits and denied the motion to reconsider.
ultimately,after the completion of days of testimony during which witnesses testified,the jury returned a verdict for defendants on all counts submitted to it.
williams appeal of the disposition of the remaining aspects of her title vii retaliation from frank threats and sports opposition to her application for unemployment the most legally significant issue before us and so we turn to it first.in reviewing a district court grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,we take as our starting point that 
s uch a judgment is warranted only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the party opposing the motion.we do not weigh the evidence,pass on the credibility of the witnesses,or substitute our conclusions for those of the jury.however,we must enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis with respect to a claim or defense under the controlling law.we must view the evidence and any inferences to be drawn therefrom most favorably to the party.

in conducting our review,we are mindful of and must apply the same legal principles as the district court.in a case for retaliation under title vii,a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by demonstrating that she engaged in protected opposition to discrimination she suffered an adverse action that a reasonable employee would have found material and there is a causal nexus between her opposition and the employer adverse action.antonio sygma network,cir if a plaintiff is unable to make out a prima facie case,judgment as a matter of law is appropriate.see aquilino of,cir reversing district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law where court held plaintiff did not suffer from an adverse employment action.before us,the first element of the prima facie case is not in dispute and so we focus our attention on the latter two elements.
the nature of the second element recently was the subject of supreme court review in burlington northern santa fe railway company white,d,a decision issued during the pendency of this appeal and regarding which we requested supplemental briefing from the parties before white,some circuits held that a claim for retaliation lies only when the employer effects an adverse action within the workplace.white.at discussing white burlington santa fe ry,cir.that is,the employee needed not only to suffer a materially adverse action,but the consequence of that action had to come in the employment context itself,in the form of a termination,demotion,or the like.by contrast,other circuits allowed claims to proceed when the employer adverse action had consequences befalling the plaintiff outside the employment environment.id.at citing,inter alia,rochon gonzales.seeking to resolve this circuit split,the court in white sided with the latter school of thought,recognizing that a n employer can effectively retaliate against an employee for exercising his or her protected rights by taking actions not directly related to his or her employment or by causing him or her harm outside the workplace.id.at.
the court went further,however,and elucidated the nature of the retaliatory conduct needed to state a claim.the court began by cautioning that title vii protects individuals not from all retaliation but only from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.id.at.in turn,the court explained that for an injury or harm to be actionable,it must also rise to a requisite level of seriousness.id.at.to qualify under this standard,a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.internal quotations omitted.requiring this level of adversity,the court instructed,is necessary to separate significant from trivial harms and inconveniences.id.
in her briefs to this court,williams contends she satisfies this standard in at least two separate ways.first,she argues that,contrary to the district court holding,her employment benefits were suspended for a period of time.second,she submits that,even if her benefits were never suspended,sports threats and its presentation of false accusations to the nmdol after her termination were such that a jury could find them sufficient to deter a reasonable employee from bringing a retaliation claim.we analyze her arguments in turn.
we do not question that proof suggesting williams unemployment benefits were denied or suspended,even for a period of time,would suffice to state a claim for relief in appropriate cases indeed,in white itself the plaintiff claim for retaliation rested,in part,on a suspension without pay,and the court readily acknowledged that the plaintiff suffered a cognizable harm when she and her family had to live without an income for days.white.at.as the court put it,m any reasonable employees would find a month without a paycheck to be a serious hardship.id.unfortunately for williams,however,the record in this case does not support her contention that her unemployment benefits were ever interrupted.
williams points us to one and only one portion of trial testimony in aid of her argument otherwise i had started getting the unemployment benefits,and then i got a letter,and they told me that i would receive them anymore until after hearing,but to go ahead and keep certifying.while this testimony indicates that williams received a letter,presumably from the nmdol,announcing its intention to suspend payments pending a hearing,as the district court found when confronted with this same snippet of testimony at directed verdict,see supra at,it can bear no more weight than that.williams has pointed neither the district court nor us to any testimony or evidence that her benefits were actually suspended for any period of time,a failing we can not overlook and one which she easily could have avoided simply by testifying,if she was able to do so,that her benefits were,in fact,suspended.neither can her testimony give rise to an inference along these lines except by resort to impermissible speculation.we do not know,for example,when williams received the letter,how close it was to the hearing date,or whether a practically sufficient gap of time existed for administrators to effect a discontinuation of her benefits.and,significantly on this score,elsewhere in her testimony,williams had this exchange with counsel though she fails to direct us to it in her briefs again,my question is,the fact that your employer challenged your right to unemployment benefits did have any impact on the amount of benefits you got no.no.on this record,as developed by williams after exhaustive discovery and lengthy trial proceedings,we simply can not disagree with the district court assessment at trial that she failed to create an issue for the jury.see truck ins.exchange magnetek,cir affirming the district court grant of summary judgment,in light of the evidence presented,because j ury verdicts may not be based on speculation.
this,however,begins rather than ends our inquiry.separate and apart from whether her benefits were actually suspended,williams contends that,under white formulation,she need not show any such tangible economic or psychological harm.instead,she argues that frank threats and sports conduct,consistent with that threat,in opposing her unemployment benefits claim,would have dissuaded a reasonable person from availing herself of title vii remedies.and this,she submits,is sufficient to satisfy white materially adverse action requirement.sports responds that,even under white,a title vii plaintiff must produce evidence of actual harm whether monetary or otherwise to make out a retaliation claim.we are thus confronted with the question what sort of adverse action is needed to establish a claim for retaliation and thus,at bottom,how best to interpret white direction.
we approach this interpretive question by acknowledging the supreme court focus in white on making actionable only conduct by an employer that causes injury or harm.white.at.the court expressly stated that n o one doubts that the term discriminate against as used in the statute refers to distinctions or differences in treatment that injure protected individuals.id.at see also id.at the provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do,their conduct.
the court proceeded to explain,however,that the standard for judging harm must be objective,id.at,and should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances,id.at internal quotation omitted.the court added that such an objective standard has the virtue of being judicially administrable.it avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff unusual subjective feelings.we have emphasized the need for objective standards in other title vii contexts,and those same concerns animate our decision here.id.at.indeed,the court proceeded to point to its prior decisions in pennsylvania state police suders,d,and harris forklift systems,d,as similar cases in which the court looked to objective standards to determine employer liability.harris,in particular,we think affords a helpful analogy for assessing the parties competing contentions about the nature of white adverse action requirement.see white.at.
in harris,the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment created by her boss repeated insults and sexual innuendo.at.the district court ruled that,even though the plaintiff was offended by her boss comments and that a reasonable woman likewise would have been offended,the plaintiff was nevertheless not entitled to relief because the environment was not so severe as to be expected to seriously affect her psychological neither did the district court believe that she was subjectively so offended that she suffered injury.id.at.internal quotation omitted.ultimately,the supreme court rejected this as the appropriate test for hostile work environment claims,explaining that a plaintiff must prove only that the employer conduct was so severe or pervasive that an objectively reasonable person would find it abusive or hostile,and that the victim herself perceived the environment to be abusive.id.at.this standard,according to the court,takes the middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury.id.the court further explained that title vii comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown,and that a 
discriminatorily abusive work environment,even one that does not seriously affect employees psychological,can and often will detract from employees job performance,discourage employees from remaining on the job,or keep them from advancing in their careers.moreover,even without regard to these tangible effects,the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race,gender,religion,or national origin offends title vii broad rule of workplace equality.
id.at.in rejecting the district court requirement that plaintiff prove a psychological or economic injury,the court held that s uch an inquiry may needlessly focus the factfinder attention on concrete psychological harm,an element title vii does not require.certainly title vii bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person psychological,but the statute is not limited to such conduct.id.
the court reference to harris suggests the appropriateness of following an analogous middle path in the retaliation arena.the plaintiff in white argued that any conduct by an employer in retaliation for a protected activity was actionable the employer argued that only those actions which affected the terms and conditions of employment were actionable.while rejecting the employer position.at,the court in white also rejected the plaintiff position that an employee was protected from all retaliation under title vii,id.at,offering instead a path between these extremes focused on whether the employer conduct well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination,id.at internal quotation omitted.
all of this is by way of saying that we do not read white as requiring,as defendants would have it,that williams must prove some tangible,subjective psychological or monetary injury.such a requirement would make no sense of white emphasis on the need for an objective test,its concern for judicial administrability,and its invocation of harris.critically,neither would sports more rigorous test fully honor title vii purpose of prohibiting employer actions that not only impose tangible harms but also those that are likely to deter victims of discrimination from complaining to the eeoc,the courts,and their employers.id.at emphasis added internal quotation omitted.to warrant trial,therefore,we hold that a plaintiff need only show that a jury could conclude that a reasonable employee in williams shoes would have found the defendant conduct sufficiently adverse that he or she well might have been dissuaded by such conduct from making or supporting a charge of discrimination 
applying this standard,and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to williams,she has adduced sufficient evidence to warrant trial.upon her discharge,frank allegedly warned williams not to fight him,and that if she did so,rumors about her sexual conduct would be made public without regard to their veracity that he would seek to ruin her marriage and that she should consider the repercussions of her actions on her family.sports then arguably proceeded to make good on these threats,opposing williams unemployment benefits in a submission alleging that the firm had fired williams for sexual misconduct amounting to sexual harassment,an apparent falsity given frank candid admission at trial that he did not fire williams for such behavior.sports did all this,moreover,in what the jury could find was an effort to impose yet another plainly adverse repercussion on williams and her loss of income associated with unemployment benefits.the company then allegedly solicited nothing short of a quid pro to drop its opposition to williams unemployment benefits if williams dropped her discrimination starkly posing williams with the choice whether to seek vindication of her title vii rights or risk a former employer intentional efforts to damage her reputation and stymie her receipt of income.
we do not doubt that a reasonable employee could well find such a combination of threats and actions taken with the design of imposing both economic and psychological harm sufficient to dissuade him or her from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.indeed,we have found lesser conduct to suffice under similar legal standards in sum,sports misses the mark in its argument because material tangible economic or psychological damage is certainly sufficient but not necessary to satisfy white requisites in the circumstances here present,the unlawful choice sports put to williams by its threats and actions is sufficient to seed her claim 
defendants suggest that judgment as a matter of law should be entered on the alternate ground that williams failed to produce evidence of a causal connection between her protected activity and the challenge to her unemployment benefits.we are unable to agree.
a causal connection is established where the plaintiff presents evidence of circumstances that justify an inference of retaliatory motive,such as protected conduct closely followed by adverse action.mackenzie city and county of denver,cir internal quotations omitted.williams filed her discrimination charge before she was fired on march.sports written statement opposing her unemployment benefits was dated april,although it does not appear to have been received by the nmdol until may.this temporal nexus is sufficient to infer that sports opposition to her claim was caused by williams filing her discrimination charge.see metzler fed.home loan bank of topeka,cir holding evidence that termination occurred no more than six weeks after employer knew employee intended to engage in protected activity was very closely connected in time and thus sufficient to establish causation internal quotation omitted.equally important,during the nmdol hearing on her entitlement to benefits,phillips allegedly said to williams,if you will drop your human rights claim,i wo fight you on your unemployment.a reasonable jury could quite reasonably infer from this a direct causal link between sports decision to impede williams benefits application and her decision to pursue discrimination charges with the nmdol human rights division.
sports responds that there is no evidence that sports knew about williams discrimination charge before it filed its written statement opposing her benefits.appellee answer br.at.but williams produced evidence at trial that,sometime in april,one of williams former,chancy wilson,called williams to tell her that sports was making allegations against williams and,later,that sports attorney,phillips,had been in the office interviewing at least two other employees about williams discrimination charge,see also.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to williams,as we are obliged to do,this is enough evidence from which a jury could infer that sports knew about her discrimination charge when it opposed her benefits.
having concluded that williams has made a prima facie case of retaliation,two questions remain under the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting defendants might show a legitimate reason for their adverse actions against williams and,if so,whether williams can demonstrate that defendants proffered reasons were pretext for retaliation.see young dillon,cir.at the completion of williams case in chief,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to sports on her retaliation claim because,in its view,she failed to prove a prima facie case.as a result,sports had no occasion to present evidence or develop argument that reasons fueled its threats and opposition to williams unemployment benefits.the briefing on appeal similarly focuses on whether williams has established a prima facie case of retaliation.but even assuming without deciding that sports could meet its burden of establishing some legitimate reasons for its conduct,we nonetheless remand the matter for trial because williams has produced sufficient evidence of pretext to warrant it.
our precedent instructs that to show pretext,williams must show that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that sports threatened her and opposed her unemployment benefits on account of her decision to invoke her title vii privileges rather than in furtherance of some legitimate business interest the relevant falsity inquiry is whether the employer stated reasons were held in good faith at the time the adverse action was taken,even if they later prove to be untrue,or whether plaintiff can show that the employer explanation was so weak,implausible,inconsistent or incoherent that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that it was not an honestly held belief but rather was subterfuge for retaliation.id.at.of course,the nature and quantum of plaintiff proof is key,for the supreme court has also explained that evidence about the falsity of an employer proffered legitimate business explanation will not always be adequate to sustain liability.id.internal quotation and citation omitted.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to williams,there is no question that a jury could find that sports stated reasons for opposing williams unemployment williams was terminated for cause because of,among other things,sexual pretextual.in support of its summary judgment motion,sports argued that williams termination was the result of her insubordination,omitting any mention of her alleged sexual misconduct.see.at trial,frank testified that he did not actually fire williams,and that her employment did not cease on account of any sexual misconduct.see.as the who terminated williams,frank testimony that she was not terminated,and that any alleged sexual misconduct did not precipitate williams discharge,strongly suggests that sports contrary statements to the nmdol were post hoc fabrication s or otherwise did not actually motivate sports opposition to her unemployment benefits.plotke white,cir internal quotation omitted.neither can these contradictions be readily explained as simple mistakes.nearly seven months after sports submitted its opposition to the nmdol,sports again employed the same justifications of its decision to terminate that williams had engaged in sexual the eeoc in its response to her charges of discrimination.finally,the quid pro quo allegedly proposed by phillips on behalf of sports also leads to a ready inference that sports opposed williams receipt of unemployment benefits because she filed a discrimination claim and sought to oppose her benefits in the hope of dissuading her from pursuing a discrimination claim.
presented with these seemingly inconsistent and contradictory explanations undergirding sports opposition to williams unemployment benefits claim,we conclude that a jury could reasonably find that sports stated reasons for opposing william unemployment benefits were false and that it is dissembling to cover up a retaliatory purpose.reeves sanderson plumbing,d 
beyond williams retaliation argument,plaintiffs collectively submit that a great many of the district court jury instructions were in error and merit a new trial.in assessing their challenge on this score,we are obliged to review the instructions as a whole and we will reverse only when we have substantial doubt whether the instructions,considered as a whole,properly guided the jury in its deliberations and when a deficient jury instruction is prejudicial.mcinnis,at internal quotation omitted.
further,when a party does not object to an instruction before the district court the case here with respect to several instructions,we can review the district court decision to administer the instruction only for plain error.d johnson ex rel.estate of cano holmes,cir.under that standard,we will affirm unless the instructions were patently,plainly erroneous and prejudicial.johnson,at internal quotations omitted accord abuan level commc ns,cir we may only reverse for plain error in an exceptional circumstance,where the error was patently erroneous and prejudicial and where fundamental injustice would otherwise occur.
plaintiffs submit that instructions,and,to which they did object before the district court,obscured the jury ability to consider the totality of the circumstances by stating that evidence offered to prove an abusive workplace does not necessarily prove a hostile work environment.but instruction simply states that c rude language alone does not necessarily amount to sexual harassment.emphases added.the instruction thus implies that such crude language can constitute sexual harassment.and what instruction left implicit,instruction made explicit,clearly informing the jury that,weighing whether a title vii violation occurred,it could consider the totality of the facts about the plaintiffs workplace environment,including acts which are not necessarily sexual in nature 
in connection with the claims for sexually hostile work environment,it is not necessary that the acts at issue have clear sexual overtones rather,any harassment or abuse directed at an employee that would not occur but for her gender may constitute sexual harassment or a hostile work environment if it is so severe and pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the employee work performance and altering the conditions of her employment,causing her to sustain damages.
instruction likewise correctly informed the jury that w hether a work environment is hostile or abusive based on gender can only be determined by looking at the totality of all the circumstances.thus,looking at the instructions as a whole,we can not say the jury was misled.
plaintiffs next challenge instructions through as being ludicrously slanted and inaccurately describing williams discrimination claim.plaintiffs offer no e
