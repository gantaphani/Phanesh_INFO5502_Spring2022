by an order separately filed,we consolidate the appeals from two related actions heard in the superior courts of alameda and san francisco counties.in part i of this decision,we consider plaintiffs appeal from a judgment entered in the alameda action,following the granting of a motion for summary judgment in favor of defendants major league baseball,major league baseball properties,and the phoenix communications group,hereafter collectively baseball.resolution of this appeal requires,in part,a reconciliation of the interests protected by plaintiffs common law and statutory rights of publicity and the constitutional right to free expression.we affirm the trial court decision permitting baseball use of plaintiffs names,images and likenesses,and the trial court determination that the two causes of action for declaratory relief were not supported by sufficient evidentiary facts and did not present an actual controversy between the parties 
in part ii,unpublished portion of this decision,we consider the appeal of plaintiff albert gionfriddo from the trial court judgment and the order granting baseball motion for attorney fees in the san francisco action.gionfriddo contends that baseball did not qualify as the prevailing party in this case because he dismissed this action for reasons unrelated to the merits of his case,before the merits of the case were finally decided,and with baseball cooperation.we conclude baseball prevailed because it realized its objectives in contesting the san francisco action and,therefore,we affirm.
appeal no.the alameda actiona.factual and procedural background 
the material facts underlying the summary judgment motion are not in dispute.plaintiffs were four professional baseball players,who played in the major leagues for different periods between and.plaintiffs were paid for their performances during each of these seasons.
defendant major league baseball is an unincorporated association whose members include the major league baseball clubs clubs.the clubs acted collectively to create the office of the commissioner which,in turn,produced and distributed media guides to the press at and world series games.
defendant major league baseball properties,mlbp,is a limited agent for each of the clubs for certain purposes involving the use of the clubs trademarks.mlbp licenses the use of each club right to the images of its current and former players.mlbp produces certain print and video publications including and world series programs of its own.it also owns and controls the official web site of major league baseball found at.among other things,this site provides historical information about major league baseball including rosters,box scores,game summaries,lists of award winners,and video clips of historic moments from past games.
defendant the phoenix communications group,phoenix,was authorized by mlbp to produce and distribute audiovisual programs containing game performances and related activities.for years between and,phoenix produced certain television shows including this week in baseball,pennant chase,and major league baseball magazine,containing footage of earlier games.it also satisfied video footage requests made by third parties.
it is undisputed that plaintiffs brought great skill to the game of baseball and participated in memorable moments from baseball past.coscarart,camilli and crosetti appeared in games,and all four of them appeared in one or more world series plaintiffs games were played before thousands of spectators and plaintiffs knew their performances were being covered by the media.their photographs and statistics and accounts of their play were widely disseminated to the public.plaintiffs understood the important role this media publicity held in promoting interest in professional baseball.
by virtue of their accomplishments and team associations,baseball has included plaintiffs names and statistics with other former players in assorted game and world series programs,or on its baseball web sites and.in some instances,plaintiffs names have appeared within lists of team members or award winners such as the recipients of the most valuable player award.in other instances,the references to plaintiffs have occurred in written accounts or video depictions of their play.some plaintiffs have had still photographs from their playing days and footage of their performances included within video histories of major league baseball produced distributed by defendants phoenix and mlbp.
plaintiffs filed this action,contending that these uses by baseball were unauthorized and violated their rights of publicity.plaintiffs pled the case originally as a putative class action on behalf of other retired players,alleging that baseball had violated their statutory and common law right of publicity by using their names,voices,signatures,photographs likenesses without their consent and without compensation.their initial complaint was limited to persons who had played part of their major league careers prior to,because that year the standard player contract was revised to add the following language.c the player agrees that his picture may be taken for still photographs,motion pictures or television at such times as the club may designate and agrees that all rights in such pictures shall belong to the club and may be used by the club for publicity purposes in any manner it desires.the complaint sought damages for the unauthorized uses,along with an injunction against such uses in the future,and a declaration that all members of the class were entitled to exploit commercially their own images in the uniforms in which they played.
later,plaintiffs moved unsuccessfully for class certification.the trial court denied their motion and this court affirmed that ruling in a separate appeal entitled block major league baseball th,d.after class action status was eliminated from the case,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in which they asserted their individual claims against baseball.at that time,gionfriddo and crosetti expanded their claims to include uses by baseball of their images.
in due course,baseball moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication.the trial court granted summary judgment,finding that the challenged uses of plaintiffs names,images and likenesses were all in connection with a news,public affairs,or sports account within the meaning of civil code section,subdivision d,and as such did not constitute a use for which consent was required under subdivision a of that section constituted publication of matters in the public interest,and as such were protected from civil liability by the first amendment of the united states constitution and were legally permissible under the doctrine of.
as to gionfriddo,the court also determined that the uses by baseball of his name and images were permissible under paragraph c of the uniform players contract.the court concluded that the causes of action for declaratory relief were not supported by sufficient evidentiary facts and did not present an actual controversy between the parties.the court ruled that gerda camilli could not state a claim for damages under former section,subdivision f,based on her concession that there had been no uses of her husband images after she had registered with the secretary of state in march under that section.lastly,the court found the remaining causes of action for unfair competition,unjust enrichment and injunctive relief failed because they were derivative of plaintiffs right of publicity claims

discussion 
in california the right of publicity is both a common law right and a statutory right.comedy iii productions,gary saderup,cal th,d,comedy iii.the common law right of publicity has been recognized in this state since.melvin reid,see also miller,commercial appropriation of an individual name,photograph or likeness a new remedy for californians pacific.in,the legislature enacted section,which authorized recovery of damages by any living person whose name,photograph,or likeness was used for commercial purposes without his or her consent.eight years later,in lugosi universal pictures cal d,our supreme court reaffirmed the common law right,which the statute was said to complement.id.at fn.however the supreme court held that,because the common law right of publicity derived from the right of privacy,it did not survive the death of the person whose identity was exploited and was not descendible to heirs or assignees.id.at.in,the legislature enacted a second statutory right of publicity that was freely transferable to the assignees or passed to the heirs of deceased persons,subds.b d.
plaintiffs common law right of publicity cause of action 
the common law right of publicity derives from the fourth category of invasion of privacy identified by dean prosser,described as appropriation of a plaintiff name or likeness for the defendant advantage.comedy iii,supra,cal th at fn,d,citing prosser,privacy cal.historically,courts were reluctant to permit celebrities to rely on this privacy right,since their fame seemed inconsistent with the injury to solitude or personal feelings implicitly required rest d unfair competition,appropriation of the commercial value of a person identity the right of publicity.in haelan laboratories topps chewing gum cir,certiorari denied,a court,for the first time,recognized a distinction between the personal right to be left alone and the economic right to exploit one own fame.california recognizes the right to profit from the commercial value of one identity as an aspect of the right of publicity.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d,dora frontline video,th,d dora.
plaintiffs allege that baseball appropriated their names and likenesses.the elements of this tort,at common law,are the defendant use of the plaintiff identity the appropriation of plaintiff name or likeness to defendant advantage,commercially or otherwise lack of consent and resulting injury.citations.eastwood superior court d.even if each of these elements is established,however,the common law right does not provide relief for every publication of a person name or likeness.the first amendment requires that the right to be protected from unauthorized publicity be balanced against the public interest in the dissemination of news and information consistent with the democratic processes under the constitutional guaranties of freedom of speech and of the press.citations.gill hearst publishing cal d,and see comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d,downing abercrombie fitch cir,downing hoffman capital,cir,hoffman.
we believe this balancing process begins by identifying and weighing the factors properly taken into account.at a minimum,a court must first consider the nature of the precise information conveyed and the context of the communication to determine the public interest in the expression.the public interest must then be weighed against the plaintiffs economic interests in cases of this sort and the plaintiffs noneconomic interests if the publicity right relied on is rooted in privacy.
the precise information conveyed by baseball in this case consists of factual data concerning the players,their performance statistics,and verbal descriptions and video depictions of their play.this information may fairly be characterized as mere bits of baseball history names of players included on and world series rosters descriptions of memorable performances from former games included within and world series game programs created for the benefit of the media and the enjoyment of the fans photographs and video clips taken of plaintiffs when they were playing the game themselves,and made available to the public through web sites,home videos,and other programs presenting historic events from long ago.in short,they are fragments from baseball mosaic.
it is manifest that as news occurs,or as a baseball season unfolds,the first amendment will protect mere recitations of the players accomplishments.the freedom of the press is constitutionally guaranteed,and the publication of daily news is an acceptable and necessary function in the life of the community.citations.carlisle fawcett publications,d.certainly,the accomplishments of those who have achieved a marked reputation or notoriety by appearing before the public such as actors and actresses,professional athletes,public officers,may legitimately be mentioned and discussed in print or on radio and television.id.at.entertainment features receive the same constitutional protection as factual news reports.zacchini broadcasting,d guglielmi productions cal d,conc.opn.of bird.moreover,the public interest is not limited to current events the public is also entitled to be informed and entertained about our history.dora,supra,th at,d.
major league baseball is followed by millions of people across this country on a daily basis.likewise,baseball fans have an abiding interest in the history of the game.the public has an enduring fascination in the records set by former players and in memorable moments from previous games.statistics are kept on every aspect of the game imaginable.those statistics and the records set throughout baseball history are the standards by which the public measures the performance of today players.the records and statistics remain of interest to the public because they provide context that allows fans to better appreciate or deprecate today performances.thus,the history of professional baseball is integral to the full understanding and enjoyment of the current game and its players.
in the uses challenged,baseball is simply making historical facts available to the public through game programs,web sites and video clips.the recitation and discussion of factual data concerning the athletic performance of these plaintiffs commands a substantial public interest,and,therefore,is a form of expression due substantial constitutional protection.carlisle fawcett publications,supra,d at.rosemont enterprises,random house,misc d.
plaintiffs contend that the challenged uses are presented in a commercial context,and thereby constitute commercial speech,entitled to a reduced level of constitutional protection,without regard to the precise information conveyed.they argue these uses help baseball owners make a profit,and that their achievements are being exploited to promote the product of baseball with any historical value being a coincidence or merely incidental.profit,alone,does not render expression commercial,however.the first amendment is not limited to those who publish without charge an expressive activity does not lose its constitutional protection because it is undertaken for profit.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d,quoting guglielmi spelling goldberg productions,supra,cal d at,accord,montana san jose mercury news,th,fn,d see also joseph burstyn,wilson.maheu cbs,d.
plaintiffs rely on two recent ninth circuit court of appeals cases to argue that only media business es are subject to first amendment free protections.this argument is meritless.in hoffman,supra,at page,the ninth circuit held that magazine could publish a digitally altered photograph of the actor,dustin hoffman,as tootsie,in a new designer dress to illustrate an article entitled grand illusions.in downing,supra,at pages,the same circuit held that defendant publication of a photograph of plaintiffs in an advertising circular devoted to surfing was actionable.while it is true that the defendants in each case were in different businesses and that only the media business publication prevailed,these facts were not determinative.in hoffman,the court went to great lengths to explain that the actor likeness was not published as an advertisement.hoffman,supra,at.it was precisely on that basis that the court in downing distinguished the earlier hoffman decision.downing,supra,at,fn.it was not the business of the messenger,but the commercial nature of the message that distinguished the two decisions 
the uses challenged in this case are not commercial speech.the term commercial speech has a special meaning in the context of the first amendment.t he core notion of commercial speech is that it does no more than propose a commercial transaction.hoffman,supra,at,quoting bolger youngs drug products,d.here,the disputed uses were included as minor historical references to plaintiffs within game programs and web sites and in videos documenting baseball past,rather than in advertisements selling a product.as such,they are readily distinct from uses that do no more than propose a commercial transaction.
general motors cir relied on by plaintiffs,demonstrates the difference between baseball message and a commercial advertisement.in,the plaintiff sued the defendant for using his former name,lew alcindor,in a commercial broadcast during the ncaa national collegiate athletic association men basketball tournament.initially,the commercial asked,who holds the record for being voted the most outstanding player of this tournament the plaintiff name and the three years he received the award were then printed on the screen.the commercial then informed the viewer that the oldsmobile eighty eight had made the consumer digest best buy list three years in a row.in addition to suing for false endorsement,the plaintiff alleged violations of his common law and statutory rights to publicity.id.at.in its reversal of the trial court grant of summary judgment for the defendant,the ninth circuit court of appeals reinstated the plaintiff right of publicity claims against the defendant due to the unconsented use of his sports statistics in an advertisement.while lew alcindor basketball record may be said to be newsworthy,its use is not automatically privileged.the defendant used the information in the context of an automobile advertisement,not in a news or sports account.id.at,italics added.
here,plaintiffs never contend that their statistics and depictions appeared in the context of an advertisement.rather,they state that the information was used to increase interest in baseball,with the belief that this would increase attendance at games.one might question whether the statistics are provided to stimulate interest or simply to respond to the interest already present.whichever is true,however,the case demonstrates baseball uses are not advertisements,nor speech where the primary message is buy.mccarthy,the rights of publicity and privacy ed,to.
thus,there is significant public interest in the information conveyed by the challenged uses,and baseball is not exploiting that interest by inserting the data in an advertisement.even if baseball did use the information in such an advertisement,we question whether this would be determinative.a review of the cases finding that commercial speech violates the right of publicity strongly suggests that advertisements are actionable when the plaintiff identity is used,without consent,to promote an unrelated product.see,newcombe adolf coors cir,use of pitcher image in printed beer advertisement,supra,at use of basketball star former name in television car commercial waits,cir,use of imitation of singer voice in radio commercial white samsung electronics america,cir,use of hostess identity in print advertisements for electronic products midler ford motor cir,use in television commercial of soundalike rendition of song recorded by singer reilly rapperswill,incorporation of news broadcast concerning energy crisis into promotional film advertising defendant insulation flores mosler safe company,incorporation of an entire newspaper article about a fire that had mentioned the plaintiff by name into advertisement by safe manufacturer.
a celebrity likeness may be used,however,to advertise a related product.courts have consistently held that the news media may use celebrity photographs from current or prior publications as advertisements for the periodical itself,illustrating the quality and content of the periodical without the person written consent.citation montana san jose mercury news,supra,th at,d see also rest d unfair competition,supra,pp,use for purposes of,trade.if a video documentary contains an unconsented,though protected,use of a person likeness,there is little question that an advertisement for the documentary,containing a clip of that use would be permissible.see dora,supra,th at,d see also cardtoons major league baseball players,supra,at cardtoons trading cards are not commercial do not merely advertise another unrelated product.italics added.thus,even if baseball used depictions of players playing the game or recited statistics or historical facts about the game to advertise the game and promote attendance,the commercial speech cases relied on by plaintiffs would be inapposite the owner of a product is entitled to show that product to entice customers to buy it.
in addition,this is not a situation where baseball affixed plaintiffs names or images to merchandise such as,lithographic prints,baseball souvenirs or other tangible products in order to market them to the public.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d.although plaintiffs alleged such activities in their pleadings,they were unable to present any evidence to the trial court of such uses by baseball.
the uses at issue are entitled to receive the full constitutional protection accorded to noncommercial speech.given the significant public interest in this sport,plaintiffs can only prevail if they demonstrate a substantial competing interest.they have not.
the right to exploit commercially one celebrity is primarily an economic right.comedy iii,supra,cal th at,d.the challenged uses involve statements of historical fact,descriptions of these facts or video depictions of them.plaintiffs never suggest how baseball actions impair their economic interests.it appears equally likely that plaintiffs marketability is enhanced by baseball conduct challenged here.balancing plaintiffs negligible economic interests against the public enduring fascination with baseball past,we conclude that the public interest favoring the free dissemination of information regarding baseball history far outweighs any proprietary interests at stake.therefore,the trial court was correct to grant summary adjudication on this cause of action code civ,subd.o.
plaintiffs statutory rights under section 
subdivision a of section states in part any person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner,on or in products,merchandise,or goods,without such person prior consent,shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof.subdivision d of section states for purposes of this section,a use of a name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness in connection with any news,public affairs,or sports broadcast or account,shall not constitute a use for which consent is required under subdivision a.
here,the trial court found,among other grounds,that the complained of uses of plaintiffs names,images and likenesses were all in connection with a news,public affairs,or sports account within the meaning of section,subdivision d,and as such did not constitute uses for which consent is required under subdivision a.we agree that these uses come within the public affairs exemption to consent provided in subdivision d.
