federal subsistence board fsb or board administers the federal subsistence program at the heart of title viii of the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca.in,the fsb granted residents of chistochina,a rural community in southcentral alaska,a customary and traditional use determination c t determination for moose throughout game management unit gmu.the c t determination permits chistochina residents to harvest moose in gmu under federal subsistence hunting regulations,which are more permissive than state hunting regulations.
the state of alaska alaska challenged the c t determination in district court,contending that the fsb granted the determination in violation of the administrative procedure act apa,a.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fsb,the chairman of the fsb,the secretary of the interior,the secretary of the department of agriculture together,federal defendants,and tribal council,chistochina governing body,and larry sinyon,a chistochina subsistence hunter intervenors.after a careful review of the record,we find no reason to set aside the fsb c t determination.because we may not substitute our own judgment for that of the fsb,see arrington daniels,cir citing citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d,we affirm.
congress enacted anilca to further two ends.the first is 
to preserve unrivaled scenic and geological values associated with natural landscapes to provide for the maintenance of sound populations of,and habitat for,wildlife species of inestimable value to the citizens of alaska and the nation to preserve in their natural state extensive unaltered arctic tundra,boreal forest,and coastal rainforest ecosystems to protect the resources related to subsistence needs to protect and preserve historic and archeological sites,rivers,and lands,and to preserve wilderness resource values and related recreational opportunities and to maintain opportunities for scientific research and undisturbed ecosystems.
b.the second,in order though not in priority,is to provide the opportunity for rural residents engaged in a subsistence way of life to continue to do so.id.c.
in title viii of anilca,congress sought to protect the subsistence way of life in the face of alaska growing population and the resultant pressure on fish and wildlife populations,and created a subsistence management and use program.id.the program grants a priority to subsistence use of resources,providing the taking on public lands of fish and wildlife for nonwasteful subsistence uses shall be accorded priority over the taking on such lands of fish and wildlife for other purposes.id.congress authorized the secretary of the interior and the secretary of agriculture together,the secretaries to promulgate regulations in furtherance of anilca directives id.
the regulations establish a federal subsistence management program for all federal lands in alaska.the secretaries created and charged the fsb with the responsibility for administering the subsistence taking and uses of fish and wildlife on public lands.id.a.in the course of its administration,the fsb d etermine s which rural alaska areas or communities have customary and traditional subsistence uses of specific fish and wildlife populations.id.d iii.to assist in these c t determinations,the fsb establishes regional advisory councils racs,which oversee subsistence resource regions and receive input from rural communities regarding subsistence uses in their regions.id.a.the racs may evaluate c t determination proposals,id.c xi,and recommend to the fsb that it grant or deny a particular c t determination,id.c viii.see also a.
the fsb codifies c t determinations at.those communities with c t determinations for particular fish stock or wildlife populations may take them within the gmu or portion of a gmu,for which they have a c t determination pursuant to the federal subsistence hunting regulations found at.
ii.facts and procedural history 
chistochina is a rural community located in gmu,a subunit of gmu,that borders gmus and.according to the census,the community boasts residents in households.gmu,the primary gmu at issue in this case,covers approximately square miles federal public lands,including the tetlin national wildlife refuge and the.elias national park and preserve,comprise percent of gmu.state lands occupy approximately forty percent of the land.less than one percent of the land is privately owned.
in,the tribal council,chistochina governing body,submitted a c t determination proposal to the fsb.at the time of the proposal,there existed c t determinations for moose within three areas of gmu 
a south of a line from noyes mountain,southeast of the confluence of tatschunda creek to nabesna river.
b east of the nabesna river and nabesna glacier,south of the winter trail from pickerel lake to the canadian border.
c remainder 
a.chistochina was included in the c t determination for moose within area a but not areas b and id.in the proposal,the tribal council asked the fsb to grant chistochina a c t determination for moose within areas b and c on the ground that chistochina residents customarily and traditionally hunted moose throughout unit.in support of this claim,the council represented that chistochina residents had taken moose in a ll areas east of the nabesna river and south of the river trail.this includes,but is not limited to rivers,lakes,and creeks in the chisana area and in the white river area.
the office of subsistence management osm prepared an analysis of the proposal,which it forwarded to the southcentral rac and the eastern interior rac after reviewing the proposal and hearing testimony,both racs recommended granting a c t determination for moose to chistochina members throughout gmu.the fsb,during a public hearing,considered the proposal along with the osm analysis,the recommendations of the racs,and a positive recommendation from the interagency staff committee of the osm staff committee.a representative from the alaska department of fish and game was the only party to express any reservations.he asked the fsb to limit the c t determination,averring that the chistochina residents had only shown use of moose in portions of areas b and c and not throughout areas b and c.the fsb approved the proposal as submitted,granting chistochina residents a c t determination for moose in areas b and c of gmu.
alaska requested reconsideration pursuant to b,contending that historical and cultural data showed that chistochina members harvested moose only in square miles of gmu.alaska proposed granting chistochina a c t determination for moose in the following area that portion of gmu that includes the drainage of the nabesna river upstream from the mouth of lick creek,and the area south of and including the pickerel lake winter trail from lick creek to the chisana river.the proposed area occupies area a,the eastern third of area b,and a small portion of area c bordering the nabesna road,nabesna river,and pickerel lake.
the fsb denied the request for reconsideration,and alaska filed the instant action,contending that in granting the c t determination,the fsb violated the apa the tribal council and sinyon intervened shortly thereafter.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants.alaska timely appeals.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review de novo the district court determination on summary judgment that the fsb complied with anilca and its implementing regulations.see or.natural desert ass bureau of land,cir.we must hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.

iv.discussion 
a.the fsb with respect to chistochina subsistence use of moose in gmu was supported by substantial evidence.
while alaska argues vociferously that the fsb fact finding was not supported by substantial evidence,the disagreements between the parties are ultimately legal,and not factual,in nature.alaska concedes that the record supports a finding that chistochina residents took moose for subsistence use in that portion of gmu that includes the drainage of the nabesna river upstream from the mouth of lick creek,and the area south of and including the pickerel lake winter trail from lick creek to the chisana river.this area includes all of area a,more than a third of area b,and a small portion of area c and covers approximately square miles of gmu 
when making the relevant c t determination,the fsb did not find that chistochina residents took moose throughout all square miles of gmu.rather,it found that chistochina residents took moose in each of the three areas within gmu finding no factual dispute between the parties,we hold that the fsb fact finding was supported by substantial evidence.
b.the fsb properly considered specific moose populations.
alaska further contends that the fsb c t determination was arbitrary and capricious because the fsb failed to consider a relevant factor,namely specific moose populations within gmu.the federal defendants contend that the fsb needed only to consider chistochina residents subsistence use of the moose species because population is synonymous with species.
federal defendants contend that their interpretation of population is due deference under chevron natural res.def.council,d an official,legally binding interpretation is entitled to chevron deference.miranda alvarado gonzales,cir t he precedential value of an agency action is the essential factor in determining whether chevron deference is appropriate.we afford deference to official agency interpretations without the force of law.tablada thomas,cir citing united states mead,d affording skidmore deference to a bureau of prisons program statement,which formalized the agency official interpretation of a statute.
federal defendants have not interpreted population as synonymous with species in any regulation or in any official agency interpretation of the regulation.rather,this interpretation appears to be purely a litigation position,developed during the course of the present case.as such,we owe the interpretation no deference.united states trident seafoods,cir no deference is owed when an agency has not formulated an official interpretation of its regulation,but is merely advancing a litigation position.we do not afford chevron or skidmore deference to litigation positions unmoored from any official agency interpretation because congress has delegated to the administrative official and not to appellate counsel the responsibility for elaborating and enforcing statutory commands.bowen georgetown,d quoting inv.inst.camp,d.
when making a c t determination,the fsb must determine which fish stocks and wildlife populations have been customarily and traditionally used for subsistence.a.additionally,the regulations provide that the c t determination shall identify the specific community or area use of specific fish stocks and wildlife populations.id.
population and species,as used in a,are not synonymous.the regulations define fish and wildlife,as opposed to fish stocks and wildlife populations,broadly as any member of the animal kingdom.id.the regulations also frequently refer to fish and wildlife without the limiting nouns stock and population.see,id.a you may not use fish or wildlife or their parts,taken pursuant to the regulations in this part,unless provided for in this part.in one definition,the regulations even use the two terms in conjunction conservation of healthy populations of fish and wildlife means the maintenance of fish and wildlife resources in a condition that minimizes the likelihood of irreversible or adverse effects upon such populations and species.id.
the addition of the terms stock and population in a denotes a group smaller than a species.specifically,the regulation directs the fsb to identify a community use of specific fish stocks and wildlife populations.id.emphasis added.in order for the fsb to have considered the relevant factors when making the c t determination,the fsb must have considered chistochina subsistence use of specific moose populations,and not chistochina use of moose in general.
although we disagree with federal defendants interpretation of population,we conclude that,in this case,the fsb properly considered specific moose populations by considering chistochina historical and traditional taking of moose for subsistence use within gmu,areas b and under a,c t determinations should identify the specific community or area use of specific fish stocks and wildlife populations.the c t determinations for moose in gmu identified three specific moose populations,those in the three areas within gmu 
a south of a line from noyes mountain,southeast of the confluence of tatschunda creek to nabesna river.
b east of the nabesna river and nabesna glacier,south of the winter trail from pickerel lake to the canadian border.
c remainder.
id.a.thus,for all c t determinations for moose within gmu prior to,the fsb considered the moose populations within these three specific areas because the fsb considered whether chistochina took moose for subsistence use in each of these three areas when making the instant c t determination,the fsb properly considered specific moose populations as directed by id.a.
c.the fsb decision to add chistochina to the c t determination areas for moose within gmu was not arbitrary and capricious.
alaska further contends that the fsb decision to grant chistochina residents a c t determination for moose throughout gmu was arbitrary and capricious because the facts only support historical moose harvesting in square miles of gmu rather than simply adding chistochina residents to areas b and c in the c t determinations for moose in gmu,alaska argues that the fsb should have delineated a new area,one that corresponds more closely to the approximately square miles in which chistochina residents have traditionally taken moose.
federal defendants first contend that the fsb properly extended chistochina c t determination for moose to the whole of gmu because the board,in its discretion,may grant a c t determination for a species in any area as long as the community requesting the determination can demonstrate subsistence use of that species anywhere.in other words,federal defendants contend that neither anilca nor its implementing regulations require the fsb to limit c t determinations to the area in which a community has demonstrated subsistence use 
we find no merit to this argument.the regulations clearly tie c t determinations to the specific locations in which wildlife populations have been taken.federal defendants contend that the definitions of subsistence use in anilca and customary and traditional use in the regulations do not tie such uses to geography.anilca provides 
t he term subsistence uses means the customary and traditional uses by rural alaska residents of wild,renewable resources for direct personal or family consumption as food,shelter,fuel,clothing,tools,or transportation for the makin
