nike filed this suit,alleging that two of already athletic shoes violated nike air force trademark.already denied the allegations and filed a counterclaim challenging the validity of nike air force trademark.while the suit was pending,nike issued a covenant not to sue,promising not to raise any trademark or unfair competition claims against already or any affiliated entity based on already existing footwear designs,or any future already designs that constituted a colorable imitation of already current products.nike then moved to dismiss its claims with prejudice,and to dismiss already counterclaim without prejudice on the ground that the covenant had extinguished the case or controversy.already opposed dismissal of its counterclaim,contending that nike had not established that its covenant had mooted the case.in support,already presented an affidavit from its president,stating that already planned to introduce new versions of its lines into the market affidavits from three potential investors,asserting that they would not consider investing in already until nike trademark was invalidated and an affidavit from an already executive,stating that nike had intimidated retailers into refusing to carry already shoes.the district court dismissed already counterclaim,concluding that there was no longer a justiciable controversy.the second circuit affirmed.it explained that the covenant was broadly drafted that the court could not conceive of a shoe that would infringe nike trademark yet not fall within the covenant and that already had not asserted any intent to market such a shoe.
held this case is moot.
a a case becomes moot and therefore no longer a case or controversy for article iii purposes when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.murphy hunt.a defendant can not,however,automatically moot a case simply by ending its unlawful conduct once sued.city of mesquite aladdin castle.instead,a defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services toc.
b nike has the burden to show that it could not reasonably be expected to resume its enforcement efforts against already.the voluntary cessation doctrine was not disavowed in deakins monaghan.there,the court employed precisely the analysis the test requires,finding a case moot because the challenged action pursuing a claim in court could not be resumed in this or any subsequent action and because it was entirely speculative that any similar claim would arise in the future,at.
c application of the voluntary cessation doctrine shows that this case is moot.
the breadth of the covenant suffices to meet the burden imposed by the doctrine.the covenant is unconditional and irrevocable.it prohibits nike from filing suit or making any claim or demand protects both already and already distributors and customers and covers not just current or previous designs,but also colorable imitations.once nike demonstrated that the covenant encompasses all of already allegedly unlawful conduct,it became incumbent on already to indicate that it engages in or has sufficiently concrete plans to engage in activities that would arguably infringe nike trademark yet not be covered by the covenant.but already failed to do so in the courts below or in this court.the case is thus moot because the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to recur.cardinal chemical morton int l,and altvater freeman,distinguished.
already alternative theories of article iii injuries do not save the case from mootness,because none of those injuries suffices to support article iii standing in the first place.already argues that as long as nike is free to assert its trademark,investors will hesitate to invest in already.but once it is absolutely clear that challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to recur,friends of the earth,supra,at,the fact that some individuals may base decisions on conjectural or hypothetical speculation does not give rise to the sort of concrete and actual injury necessary to establish article iii standing,lujan defenders of wildlife.already worries about its retailers,but even if a plaintiff may bring an invalidity claim based on a reasonable expectation that a trademark holder will take action against the plaintiff retailers,the covenant here extends protection to already distributors and customers.already also complains that nike decision to sue in the first place has led already to fear another suit.but,since nike has met its burden to demonstrate that there is no reasonable risk of such a suit,this concern is unfounded.already falls back on the sweeping argument that,as one of nike competitors,it inherently has standing because no covenant can eradicate the effects of a registered but invalid trademark.the logical conclusion of this theory seems to be that a market participant is injured for article iii purposes whenever a competitor benefits from something allegedly unlawful,a trademark or the awarding of a contract but this court has never accepted such a boundless theory of standing.
already policy objection that dismissing this case allows nike to bully small innovators does not support adoption of this broad theory.granting covenants not to sue may be a risky strategy for a trademark holder.and while accepting already theory may benefit the small competitor in this case,it also lowers the gates for larger companies with more resources,who may challenge the intellectual property portfolios of more humble rivals simply because they are competitors in the same market.this would further encourage parties to employ litigation as a weapon against their competitors rather than as a last resort for settling disputes.
d no purpose would be served by remanding the case.already has had every opportunity and incentive to submit evidence in the proceedings below.it has refused,at every stage of the proceedings,to suggest that it has any plans to design a shoe that violates the air force trademark yet falls outside the covenant.and while the courts below did not expressly invoke the voluntary cessation standard,their analysis addressed the same questions this court addresses here under that standard.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
the question is whether a covenant not to enforce a trademark against a competitor existing products and any future colorable imitations moots the competitor action to have the trademark declared invalid.
respondent nike designs,manufactures,and sells athletic footwear,including a line of shoes known as air force.petitioner already also designs and markets athletic footwear,including shoe lines known as sugars and soulja boys.nike,alleging that the soulja boys infringed and diluted the air force trademark,demanded that already cease and desist its sale of those shoes.when already refused,nike filed suit in federal court alleging that the soulja boys as well as the sugars infringed and diluted its air force trademark.already denied these allegations and filed a counterclaim contending that the air force trademark is invalid.
in march,eight months after nike filed its complaint,and four months after already counterclaimed,nike issued a covenant not to sue.its preamble stated that already actions no longer infringe or dilute the nike mark at a level sufficient to warrant the substantial time and expense of continued litigation.app.the covenant promised that nike would not raise against already or any affiliated entity any trademark or unfair competition claim based on any of already existing footwear designs,or any future already designs that constituted a colorable imitation of already current products,at.
after issuing this covenant,nike moved to dismiss its claims with prejudice,and to dismiss already invalidity counterclaim without prejudice on the ground that the covenant had extinguished the case or controversy.already opposed dismissal of its counterclaim,arguing that nike had not established that its voluntary cessation had mooted the case.in support,already presented an affidavit from its president,stating that already had plans to introduce new versions of its shoe lines into the market affidavits from three potential investors,asserting that they would not consider investing in already until nike trademark was invalidated and an affidavit from one of already executives,stating that nike had intimidated retailers into refusing to carry already shoes.
the district court dismissed already counterclaim,stating that because already sought to invoke the court declaratory judgment jurisdiction,it bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over its counterclaim.civ.sdny,app.to pet.for cert.the court read the covenant broad ly,concluding that any of already future products that arguably infringed the nike mark would be colorable imitations of already current footwear and therefore protected by the covenant,at.finding no evidence that already sought to develop any shoes not covered by the covenant,the court held there was no longer a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.at quoting medimmune,genentech,internal quotation marks omitted.
the second circuit affirmed.it held that in determining whether a covenant not to sue eliminates a justiciable case or controversy,courts should look to the totality of the circumstances,including the language of the covenant,whether the covenant covers future,as well as past,activity and products,and evidence of intention on the part of the party asserting jurisdiction to engage in conduct not covered by the covenant,footnote omitted.noting that the covenant covers both past sales and future sales of both existing products and colorable imitations,the second circuit found it hard to conceive of a shoe that would infringe the air force trademark yet not fall within the covenant,at.given that already ha d not asserted any intention to market any such shoe,the court concluded that already could not show any continuing injury,and that therefore no justiciable controversy remained.ibid.we granted certiorari.
article iii of the constitution grants the judicial branch authority to adjudicate cases and controversies.in our system of government,courts have no business deciding legal disputes or expounding on law in the absence of such a case or controversy.daimlerchrysler cuno.that limitation requires those who invoke the power of a federal court to demonstrate standing a personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.allen wright.we have repeatedly held that an actual controversy must exist not only at the time the complaint is filed,but through all stages of the litigation.alvarez smith,internal quotation marks omitted arizonans for official english arizona,to qualify as a case fit for adjudication,an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed quoting preiser newkirk.
a case becomes moot and therefore no longer a case or controversy for purposes of article iii when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.murphy hunt,per curiam some internal quotation marks omitted.no matter how vehemently the parties continue to dispute the lawfulness of the conduct that precipitated the lawsuit,the case is moot if the dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the plaintiffs particular legal rights.alvarez,supra,at.
we have recognized,however,that a defendant can not automatically moot a case simply by ending its unlawful conduct once sued.city of mesquite aladdin castle.otherwise,a defendant could engage in unlawful conduct,stop when sued to have the case declared moot,then pick up where he left off,repeating this cycle until he achieves all his unlawful ends.given this concern,our cases have explained that a defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services toc.
at the outset of this litigation,both parties had standing to pursue their competing claims in court.nike had standing to sue because already activity was allegedly infringing its rights under trademark law.already had standing to file its counterclaim because nike was allegedly pressing an invalid trademark to halt already legitimate business activity.see medimmune,supra,at a genuine threat of enforcement of intellectual property rights that inhibits commercial activity may support standing.but then nike dismissed its claims with prejudice and issued its covenant,calling into question the existence of any continuing case or controversy.
under our precedents,it was nike burden to show that it could not reasonably be expected to resume its enforcement efforts against already.friends of the earth,supra,at.nike makes a halfhearted effort to avoid this test.relying on deakins monaghan,it argues that when a defendant makes a judicially enforceable commitment to avoid the conduct that forms the basis for an article iii controversy,there is no reason to apply a special rule premised on the defendant unfettered ability to return to its old ways.brief for respondent.
nike reliance on deakins is misplaced.in deakins,the court did not disavow the voluntary cessation doctrine the court employed precisely the analysis required by that test.it found the case was moot because the challenged action pursuing a claim in court could not be resumed in this or any subsequent action and because it was entirely speculative that any similar claim would arise in the future,at,internal quotation marks omitted.it distinguished that situation from one in which a defendant is free to return to his old ways.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.that is the question the voluntary cessation doctrine poses could the allegedly wrongful behavior reasonably be expected to recur nike can not avoid its formidable burden by assuming the answer to that question.friends of the earth,supra,at.
having determined that the voluntary cessation doctrine applies,we begin our analysis with the terms of the covenant 
nike unconditionally and irrevocably covenants to refrain from making any claim s or demand s against already or any of its related business entities including distributors and employees of such entities and all customers on account of any possible cause of action based on or involving trademark infringement,unfair competition,or dilution,under state or federal law relating to the nike mark based on the appearance of any of already current previous footwear product designs,and any colorable imitations thereof,regardless of whether that footwear is produced or otherwise used in commerce before or after the effective date of this covenant.app.emphasis added.
the breadth of this covenant suffices to meet the burden imposed by the voluntary cessation test.the covenant is unconditional and irrevocable.beyond simply prohibiting nike from filing suit,it prohibits nike from making any claim or any demand.it reaches beyond already to protect already distributors and customers.and it covers not just current or previous designs,but any colorable imitations.
in addition,nike originally argued that the sugars and soulja boys infringed its trademark in other words,nike believed those shoes were colorable imitations of the air force.see trademark act of lanham act,stat,as amended.nike covenant now allows already to produce all of its existing footwear designs including the sugar and soulja boy and any colorable imitation of those designs.we agree with the court of appeals that it is hard to imagine a scenario that would potentially infringe nike trademark and yet not fall under the covenant.at.nike,having taken the position in court that there is no prospect of such a shoe,would be hard pressed to assert the contrary down the road.see new hampshire maine,w here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding,and succeeds in maintaining that position,he may not thereafter,simply because his interests have changed,assume a contrary position,especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him quoting davis wakelee.if such a shoe exists,the parties have not pointed to it,there is no evidence that already has dreamt of it,and we can not conceive of it.it sits,as far as we can tell,on a shelf between dorothy ruby slippers and perseus winged sandals.
given nike demonstration that the covenant encompasses all of its allegedly unlawful conduct,it was incumbent on already to indicate that it engages in or has sufficiently concrete plans to engage in activities not covered by the covenant.after all,information about already business activities and plans is uniquely within its possession.the case is moot if the court,considering the covenant language and the plaintiff anticipated future activities,is satisfied that it is absolutely clear that the allegedly unlawful activity can not reasonably be expected to recur.
but when given the opportunity before the district court,already did not assert any intent to design or market a shoe that would expose it to any prospect of infringement liability.see app.to pet.for cert.finding that there was no indication of any such intent,at,noting the absence of record evidence that already intends to make any arguably infringing shoe that is not unambiguously covered by the covenant the only affidavit it submitted to the district court on that question was from its president,saying little more than that already currently has plans to introduce new shoe lines and make modifications to existing shoe lines.it never stated that these shoes would arguably infringe nike trademark yet fall outside the scope of the covenant.nor did it do so on appeal to the second circuit.and again,it failed to do so here,even when counsel for already was asked at oral argument whether his client had any intention to design or market a shoe that would even arguably fall outside the covenant.tr.of oral arg.given the covenant broad language,and given that already has asserted no concrete plans to engage in conduct not covered by the covenant,we can conclude the case is moot because the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to recur.
the authorities on which already relies are not on point.in cardinal chemical morton int l,we affirmed the unremarkable proposition that a court decision to rely on one of two possible alternative grounds noninfringement rather than invalidity did not strip it of power to decide the second question,particularly when its decree was subject to review by this court.in essence,when a court has jurisdiction to review a case,and decides the issue on two independent grounds,the first half of its opinion does not moot the second half,or vice versa.here the issue is whether the district court had jurisdiction to consider the claim in the first place.
this case is also unlike altvater freeman.there,patent holders brought suit against licensees for specific performance of a license.the licensees counterclaimed,seeking a declaratory judgment that the patents were invalid.the court of appeals,after finding that the license was no longer in force and the devices at issue did not infringe,dismissed the licensees counterclaim as moot.we reversed,finding the controversy still live because the licensees continued to manufactur e and sell additional articles claimed to fall under the patents,and the patent holders continued to demand royalties for those products,at.here of course the whole point is that already is free to sell its shoes without any fear of a trademark claim.
already argues,however,that there are alternative theories of article iii injuries that save the case from mootness.first,it argues that so long as nike remains free to assert its trademark,investors will be apprehensive about investing in already.second,it argues that given nike decision to sue in the first place,nike trademarks will now hang over already operations like a damoclean sword.finally,and relatedly,already argues that,as one of nike competitors,it inherently has standing to challenge nike intellectual property.
the problem for already is that none of these injuries suffices to support article iii standing.although the voluntary cessation standard requires the defendant to show that the challenged behavior can not reasonably be expected to recur,we have never held that the doctrine by imposing this burden on the defendant allows the plaintiff to rely on theories of article iii injury that would fail to establish standing in the first place.
we begin with already argument that nike trademark registration gives false color to state and federal trademark claims which expose already business to substantial and unpredictable risks,deterring investors.brief for petitioner.to demonstrate this,already presented affidavits from potential investors stating that nike lawsuit dissuaded them from investing in already or prompted them to withdraw prior investments,and that they would consider investing in already only if nike trademark were struck down.app.to pet.for cert.already argues that like the plaintiffs in village of euclid ambler realty,who had standing to challenge an ordinance because it reduced their property value already should have standing to challenge the trademark because its mere existence hampers its ability to attract capital.
but once it is absolutely clear that challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to recur,friends of the earth,at,the fact that some individuals may base decisions on conjectural or hypothetical speculation does not give rise to the sort of concrete and actual injury necessary to establish article iii standing,lujan defenders of wildlife,internal quotation marks omitted.in euclid,we reasoned that,assuming the merits of plaintiff claim,the ordinance,in effect,constitutes a present invasion of plaintiff property rights.at.here there is no such present invasion in fact there is a covenant promising no invasion.in addition,unlike the plaintiffs in euclid,already does not claim that nike air force infringes any of its property rights.
already has also pointed to an affidavit from a vice president stating that nike has suggested to already retailers that they refrain from carrying already shoes,lest nike cancel its account or take other actions against the retailer,delay shipment of the retailer nike order or lose the retailer nike order.app.even if a plaintiff may bring an invalidity claim based on a reasonable expectation that a trademark holder will take action against the plaintiff retailers,the covenant here extends protection to already distributors and customers.and even if nike were engaging in harassment or unfair trade practices,already has not explained how invalidating nike trademark would do anything to stop it.
already also complains that it can no longer just blithely go about its shoe business as if there were no risk of being sued again.reply brief.as counsel told us at oral argument once bitten,twice shy.tr.of oral arg.but we have never held that a plaintiff has standing to pursue declaratory relief merely on the basis of being once bitten.quite the opposite.see,los angeles lyons,holding there is no justiciable controversy where plaintiff had once been subjected to a chokehold.given our conclusion that nike has met its burden of demonstrating there is no reasonable risk that already will be sued
