facts and proceedings below 
a.the regulatory.the americans with disabilities act 
title iii of the ada prohibits discrimination against any individual on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.a.discrimination includes a failure to remove architectural barriers or where removal of a barrier is not readily achievable,a failure to make such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations available through alternative methods.b a iv,v.the ada further requires that newly constructed facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.a.the ada directs the attorney general to issue regulations that include standards applicable to facilities covered by title iii and to provide appropriate technical assistance manuals to individuals or entities with rights or duties under title iii.b,c.congress instructed the attorney general to issue regulations within one year of the enactment of the ada.b.
the process by which the attorney general promulgates his regulations has an unusual twist.congress mandated that the attorney general regulations be consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements issued by the architectural and transportation barriers compliance board,c,commonly referred to as the access board.the access board is an independent federal agency comprised of individuals and representatives from twelve federal agencies,including the doj.a.the board is directed to establish minimum guidelines and requirements for the standards issued under title iii of the ada,b b,and to develop advisory information for,and provide appropriate technical assistance to,individuals or entities with rights or duties under regulations prescribed under title iii,b.in sum,the board establishes minimum guidelines for title iii,but the doj promulgates its own regulations,which must be consistent not necessarily identical board guidelines.congress instructed the board to issue its guidelines within nine months of the enactment of the ada.a.
the access board guidelines and doj standards 
in january,six months after the enactment of the ada,the access board published its first proposed ada accessibility guidelines,known as the adaag.initially,the provision discussing assembly areas provided 
placement of wheelchair locations.wheelchair areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan and shall be dispersed throughout the seating area.they shall be located to provide lines of sight comparable to those for all viewing areas.
at.in commentary on its proposed rules,the access board noted that the lines of sight requirement 
appears to be adequate for theaters and concert halls,but may not suffice in sports areas or race tracks where the audience frequently stands throughout a large portion of the game or event.in alterations of existing sports arenas,accessible spaces are frequently provided at the lower part of a seating tier projecting out above a lower seating tier or are built out over existing seats at the top of a tier providing a great differential in height.these solutions can work in newly constructed sports arenas as well,if sight lines relative to standing patrons are considered at the time of initial design.the board seeks comments on whether the full lines of sight over standing spectators in sports arenas and other similar assembly areas should be required.
one month later,in february,the doj published its own notice of proposed rulemaking.with respect to the standards for new construction and alterations,the proposed rules stated that the standards would be published as appendix a,and that appendix a would be the adaag proposed by the access board in its january notice of proposed rulemaking,together with any amendments made by the access board during its rulemaking process.at.the department proposes to adopt these guidelines as the accessibility standard applicable under this rule.at.the doj requested that any comments on the access board notice of proposed rulemaking be sent to the access board.at.
in july,the access board published its final adaag.section was modified to read,wheelchair areas shall be an integral part of any fixed seating plan and shall be provided so as to provide people with physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.at italics omitted.the board addressed the problem of lines of sight over standing spectators in sports arenas and other similar assembly areas and noted that m any commenters also recommended that lines of sight should be provided over standing spectators.at.to this,the access board simply stated that the issue of lines of sight over standing spectators will be addressed in guidelines for recreational facilities,guidelines the access board,evidently,had not proposed.
the very same day that the access board finalized its guidelines,the doj issued its final title iii regulations.as the doj had previously announced,it adopt ed the adaag as the accessibility standard applicable under this rule.at.the doj incorporated the in appendix see app.a.the commentary accompanying the regulations stated that the doj put the public on notice,through the proposed rule,of its intention to adopt the proposed adaag,with any changes made by the board,as the accessibility standards.at.the doj further indicated that comments on the department proposed rule have been addressed adequately in the final adaag.largely in response to comments,the board made numerous changes from its proposal.id.the doj did not expressly address lines of sight.
the doj technical assistance manual 
title iii new construction provisions,including,became effective in january.that same year,pursuant to title iii directive to provide technical assistance to covered entities,the doj published a technical assistance manual tam.see a,c c.the tam was silent on.the published supplement to the tam,however,provided an interpretation for that was more aggressive than the access board commentary 
in addition to requiring companion seating and dispersion of wheelchair locations,adaag requires that wheelchair locations provide people with disabilities lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.thus,in assembly areas where spectators can be expected to stand during the event or show being viewed,the wheelchair locations must provide lines of sight over spectators who stand.this can be accomplished in many ways,including placing wheelchair locations at the front of a seating section,or by providing sufficient additional elevation for wheelchair locations placed at the rear of seating sections to allow those spectators to see over the spectators who stand in front of them.
the access board subsequent guidelines 
in,the access board repeated its intent to address the issue of lines of sight over standing spectators in the guidelines for recreational facilities which will be proposed at a future date.it requested comments on the design issues associated with providing integrated and dispersed accessible seating locations with a clear line of sight over standing spectators in arenas,stadiums or other sports facilities.id.the access board also noted that during the initial notice and comment procedures a n overwhelming majority of responses favored including a provision requiring lines of sight over standing spectators in sports arenas and other similar assembly areas.id.
in november,the access board finally proposed amendments to its guidelines to address the standing spectators problem.these were adopted in july.guideline now distinguishes between lines of sight over seated spectators and lines of sight over standing spectators.at.guideline reads where standing spectators are provided lines of sight over the heads of spectators standing in the first row in front of their seats,spectators seated in wheelchair spaces shall be afforded lines of sight over the heads of standing spectators in the first row in front of wheelchair spaces.at.the doj has not adopted the access board guidelines.instead,the doj current regulation of lines of sight requirements remains pt,app.a,as interpreted by tam supp.
b.the proceedings 
on october,miller filed his district court complaint,alleging,among other things,that speedway violated title iii of the ada,et.on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted judgment for speedway.the court acknowledged that the doj current position on adaag is reasonable and was consistent with title iii of the ada and that w ere the c ourt to write on a clean slate,the c ourt would be tempted to hold that requires lines of sight over standing spectators.miller,d at.it found,however,that the doj had bound itself to the access board commentary implying that the access board guidelines and,consequently,the doj standards did not address the question of lines of sight over standing spectators.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that the doj current in the supplement to the facilities must provide lines of sight over standing spectators was a fundamental modification of its previous interpretation and had to be adopted through rulemaking.d at quoting paralyzed veterans of america.it thus rejected the circuit interpretation in paralyzed veterans and agreed with the third circuit opinion in caruso music entertainment centre,cir.miller,d at.miller appeals 
ii.analysis 
we begin our analysis by stating what is not at issue in this case.this case does not involve whether the doj has reasonably interpreted the ada within the meaning of chevron,nrdc,d.no party to the litigation challenges the substantive validity of,and sensibly,no party has argued that the doj has exceeded its authority under the ada.nor is subject to serious challenge as arbitrary and capricious.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d.although this is a private suit by miller against the speedway for violating the ada,the parties all concede that the attorney general regulations would clearly pass muster if challenged under the ada.see indep.living.at doj reasonably could have concluded that lines of sight over standing spectators are necessary the ada provides ample legal authority to support such a requirement.see also paralyzed veterans,at a ppellants do not contend that the department interpretation of the regulation is unfaithful to the governing statute.
a.the tam as the doj interpretation of its own regulation 
what is challenged here is whether the provision in the attorney general supplement to the tam is a valid construction of.while chevron addresses what kind of deference we must afford an agency in the interpretation of the statute it has been charged with enforcing,see at,here we are dealing with the leeway we must grant an agency in the interpretation of its own regulations.we must give an agency interpretation of its own regulations controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bowles seminole rock sand.in other words,we must defer to the agency interpretation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the agency intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.thomas jefferson shalala,d quoting gardebring jenkins,d.we have explained that w hen the meaning of regulatory language is ambiguous,the agency interpretation controls so long as it is reasonable,that is,so long as the interpretation sensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.or.paralyzed veterans of am.regal cinemas,cir quoting martin occupational safety health review comm n,d.
furthermore,we have previously held that the tam itself is entitled to substantial deference.the guidance provided in the technical assistance manual is an interpretation of the doj regulation and,as such,is entitled to significant weight as to the meaning of the regulation.disabled rights action comm.las vegas events,cir citations omitted.where t he doj interpretation in the tam is entirely consistent with the regulation,it is due deference.botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.accordingly,t he justice department interpretation of its own regulations,such as the technical assistance manual,must also be given substantial deference and will be disregarded only if plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bay area addiction research city of antioch,cir quoting thomas jefferson,at.
the language of requiring lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public is ambiguous.indeed,both the third and the circuits,although they ultimately reach opposite conclusions on the merits,agree that the plain language of the regulation is ambiguous and subject to differing interpretations.see caruso,at in the end it seems that both interpretations of the lines of sight language are plausible.paralyzed veterans,at the phrase is ambiguous.we agree that the phrase lines of sight in is subject to several interpretations.
one possible interpretation is that the phrase means that wheelchair patrons must have a view without physical obstructions.see lara cinemark usa,cir.we have already held that this reading is too narrow to be compelled by the language of,and the attorney general is entitled to read the provision more broadly.regal cinemas,at.
a more plausible interpretation of the phrase is that it means that wheelchair areas are to be dispersed throughout a facility,such that wheelchair users have a variety of horizontal viewing angles from which to choose.see caruso,at.this ensures that wheelchair patrons at a football game are not all stuck,for example,behind the goalposts.this interpretation is supported by the fact that also requires a choice of admission prices to account for the difference between an end zone and a seat.
alternatively,the phrase can be read to require more than horizontal dispersal it could be read to require vertical dispersal as well,so that patrons have a choice of example,between the orchestra and the obtain a different viewing angle.under this reading,the phrase lines of sight would refer to the angle of sight between the viewer and the stage,screen,or playing field.the latter definition of lines of sight would encompass both the notion of a horizontal line of sight and a vertical line of sight.
finally,yet another interpretation does not merely involve the horizontal or vertical dispersal of the wheelchai
