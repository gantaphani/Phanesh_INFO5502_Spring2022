plaintiff appeals from the judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained defendant demurrer to causes of action for violations of civil code section et the shine the light law or stl and business and professions code section et the unfair competition law or ucl we agree with the trial court that plaintiff lacks standing to pursue causes of action under either statute,and thus we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
i.the present action 
the stl is a disclosure statute designed to shine the light on businesses practices by requiring them to establish procedures by which customers can obtain information about those practices.miller hearst communications,wl,quotingboorstein men journal llc wl.the stl requires businesses that share customers personal information with third parties for direct marketing to disclose,upon a customer request,the names and addresses of third parties who have received personal information and the categories of personal information revealed,subd.a.the stl also requires businesses to make their contact information available to customers in one of three statutorily prescribed ways,and it provides that businesses need not make the disclosures required by section,subdivision a,if they instead give customers the opportunity to opt in or opt out of the disclosure of their personal information,subds.b,c.finally,the stl provides for damages,civil penalties,injunctions,and attorney fees.
plaintiff david boorstein filed the present action on december,and filed the operative first amended complaint,asserting violations of the stl and the ucl,on september.plaintiff alleges that in or about,he subscribed to,a website owned and operated by defendant cbs interactive,cbs,to compete in fantasy football,baseball,and basketball.when he did so,he provided personal information to cbs,including his name,email address,date of birth,and zip code.plaintiff alleges that cbs shares users personal information,including that of the type he provided to cbs,with third parties for direct marketing purposes,and thus is required to comply with the stl.cbs willfully violated the stl by failing to provide a link on its home page titled your privacy rights failing to provide a link on its home page to a separate web page titled your privacy rights failing to provide on the first page of the link from its home page a description of its customer s rights under the act,including the right to request information about its information sharing practices or the right to opt out of information sharing altogether and failing to provide on the first page of the link from its home page the designated mailing address,email address,telephone number,or facsimile number for customer requests.as a result,plaintiff alleges,he is deprived of information that he was statutorily entitled to under the act,including notice of his right to request shine the light disclosures and contact information to make such requests deprived of a meaningful opportunity to exercise his right to inquire about and receive a detailed response explaining cbs interactive information sharing practices,by identifying what categories of information are disclosed and to whom deprived of a meaningful opportunity to exercise his right to make informed decisions about his privacy and personal information and deprived of a meaningful opportunity to exercise his right to monitor and control the disclosure and use of his personal information.
plaintiff purported to bring the present action for himself and a class of similarly situated individuals defined as all california residents who have provided personal information to cbs interactive.he sought actual damages,civil penalties of per violation,injunctive relief,reasonable litigation expenses,and attorney fees.
ii.cbs demurrer 
cbs demurred to the first amended complaint.it asserted plaintiff has not and can not allege cbs ever shared his personal information with any third parties for any direct marketing purposes plaintiff has not and can not allege that he ever contacted or attempted to contact cbs about how his personal information might have been shared,or that cbs ever provided him with any incomplete,inaccurate,or untimely information plaintiff did not allege a cognizable injury cbs complied with the stl by providing designated contact information on its website and cbs complied with the stl because its privacy policy informs users how their personal information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes only with consent,as well as how to opt out and how to contact cbs with questions.
the trial court held a hearing on the demurrer on december.plaintiff counsel conceded that the first amended complaint did not allege plaintiff had made a disclosure request under the stl,but urged that such a request was not required.the trial court disagreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.its order stated as follows 
a business obligation to provide stl disclosures is triggered only if it discloses a customer information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and a customer makes a request for information.cal.a.the day safe harbor in cal.d further underscores that the act only applies once a customer makes a request.its plain language precisely describes violations for which a shine the light suit may be brought the failure to provide accurate and complete cal.a disclosures or timely disclosures under cal.b.if a plaintiff personal information was never shared or the plaintiff did not request or want to,try to,or was unable to request any stl disclosures,the business has no obligation to provide any disclosures in the first instance.
here,plaintiff fails to state a claim against cbsi cbs interactive for violation of the act.first,plaintiff fails to allege that cbsi actually disclosed his personal information to a third party for direct marketing purposes.if plaintiff personal information was never shared,cbsi had no obligation to provide the act disclosures to him in the first instance.
worse yet,plaintiff fails to allege that he ever requested,or even tried to,wanted to,or was unable to request,any stl disclosures from cbsi or that cbsi failed to provide a complete,accurate or timely response.plaintiff confirmed at oral argument that he never requested,or tried to request,any stl disclosures from cbsi.if plaintiff did not request,or want to request,any stl disclosures from cbsi,there is no obligation for cbsi to provide the disclosures to him.because plaintiff can not state a claim under the act,cbsi demurrer to plaintiff first cause of action is sustained without leave to amend.
plaintiff second claim for violation of the ucl hinges on alleged violations of the act.it thus fails for the reasons above.citation.moreover,plaintiff has failed to allege and causation,and thus has no standing under the ucl.citation.thus,cbsi demurrer to the ucl claim is also sustained witout leave to amend.
notice of entry of the order sustaining defendant demurrer without leave to amend was served december.the court entered a final judgment of dismissal on january,from which plaintiff timely appealed.
discussion 
central to the dispute between the parties is whether plaintiff has standing to pursue the present action.cbs contends,and the trial court agreed,that to have standing under the stl and,derivatively,under the ucl,a customer must either have made,or attempted to make,a disclosure request under section,subdivision a.plaintiff disagrees,contending that a disclosure request is not necessary it is enough that the defendant failed to make its contact information available as the stl requires.
we review independently the trial court judgment of dismissal following a demurrer,considering de novo whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete defense.mccall pacificare of,cal th,aubry tri city hospital dist.cal th.we assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations,facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded,and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.regents of university of california superior court th.we also review de novo issues of statutory construction,ascertaining the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statutes.day city of fontana cal th,regents of university of california superior court,supra,th at.
for the reasons that follow,we agree with the trial court that a plaintiff must have made,or attempted to make,a disclosure request in order to have standing under the stl.therefore,because it is undisputed that plaintiff has not alleged,and can not allege,that he made or attempted to make such a disclosure request,the demurrer to the first cause of action was properly sustained.because the ucl claim is derivative of the stl claim,the demurrer to the second cause of action was also properly sustained.
overview of the stl 
the substantive provisions of the stl are set out in section,subdivisions a through h.as relevant here,subdivision a provides that if a business with an established relationship with a customer has,within the preceding calendar year,disclosed specified categories of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes,the business shall,upon a customer request,disclose the categories of personal information disclosed during the preceding year and the names and addresses of third parties who received personal information for direct marketing purposes during the preceding year,subd.a.subdivision c permits businesses to opt out of the subdivision a disclosure requirement under subdivision c,if a business required to comply with subdivision a adopts and discloses to the public a policy of disclosing personal information to third parties only if the customer agrees to the disclosure,or of not disclosing personal information if the customer has exercised a nondisclosure option,the business may respond to a disclosure request by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information,and providing the customer with a means to exercise that right.subd.c.finally,subdivision b requires businesses to designate a mailing address,email address,telephone number,or facsimile number where customers may send disclosure requests,and it requires businesses to advise customers of the designated addresses or telephone numbers in at least one of three ways notify managers who supervise employees who regularly interact with customers of the designated addresses and phone numbers and instruct those employees that customers who inquire shall be informed of the addresses or phone numbers add to the home page of its web site a link either to a page titled your privacy rights or add the words your privacy rights to the home page link to the business privacy policy the first page of the link shall describe a customer rights pursuant to this section and shall provide the designated mailing address,address,as required,or telephone number or facsimile number,as appropriate or make the designated addresses or phone numbers readily available upon request of a customer at every place of business in california where the business or its agents regularly have contact with customers.subd.b.responses to disclosure requests must be provided within days.subd.b c.
section,subdivisions a through h provide the remedies available for violations of the stl.as relevant here and as discussed in greater detail below,subdivision b provides for a private right of action and damages,subdivision c provides for civil penalties,and subdivision e permits a court to enjoin any business that violates,proposes to violate,or has violated this title.
according to its legislative history,the stl was intended to provide consumers with information on how their information is being shared by businesses.the bill author said that at the time of the stl enactment,consumers were not only unable to stop the buying and selling of their personal information,they do not even know whether and to what extent it is taking place.the stl,thus,is designed to let free market forces work by shining the light on businesses practices so consumers can make educated privacy decisions and knowledgeable marketplace decisions.
ii.standing under the stl 
standing generally 
a litigant standing to sue is a threshold issue to be resolved before the matter can be reached on the merits.hernandez atlantic finance d.if we were to conclude that plaintiff did not have standing to maintain the action,not having been personally damaged by the defendants conduct,then there would be no need to address the merits of her cause.equally wasteful of judicial resources would be a resolution on the merits without reaching the standing issue.ibid.we will not address the merits of litigation when the plaintiff lacks standing,because california courts have no power to render advisory opinions or give declaratory relief.municipal court superior court gonzalez cal th.blumhorst jewish family services of los angeles th,
as a general principle,standing to invoke the judicial process requires an actual justiciable controversy as to which the complainant has a real interest in the ultimate adjudication because he or she has either suffered or is about to suffer an injury of sufficient magnitude reasonably to assure that all of the relevant facts and issues will be adequately presented to the adjudicator.pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d,municipal court superior court d,california water telephone county of los angeles d,witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.to have standing,a party must be beneficially interested in the controversy that is,he or she must have some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.carsten psychology examining com.cal d.the party must be able to demonstrate that he or she has some such beneficial interest that is concrete and actual,and not conjectural or hypothetical.holmes california nat.guard th.
the prerequisites for standing to assert causes of action are determined from the statutory language,as well as the underlying legislative intent and the purpose of the statute.surrey truebeginnings,llc th.
standing to pursue a cause of action under the stl 
as relevant here,section,which sets out the remedies available for a violation of section,provides 
b any customer injured by a violation of this title may institute a civil action to recover damages.
c in addition,for a willful,intentional,or reckless violation of section,a customer may recover a civil penalty not to exceed three thousand dollars per violation otherwise,the customer may recover a civil penalty of up to five hundred dollars per violation for a violation of section.
e any business that violates,proposes to violate,or has violated this title may be enjoined.
plaintiff contends that subdivisions b,c,and e of section are wholly independent of one another,and thus an individual need not have been injured by a violation of this title within the meaning of subdivision b to have standing to recover civil penalties or obtain an injunction under subdivisions c and e.cbs disagrees,urging that a plaintiff must have suffered a statutory injury in order to seek the remedies available under subdivisions b,c,or e.
we agree with cbs that a plaintiff must have suffered a statutory injury to have standing to pursue a cause of action under the stl,regardless of the remedies he or she seeks.as the statutory language quoted above makes clear,section,subdivision b creates a private right of action in any customer injured by a violation of this title.subdivisions c and e do not repeat the may institute a civil action language of subdivision b,and thus they do not create independent rights of action.because the right to institute a civil action arises only under subdivision b,a plaintiff must meet the terms of that section,he or she must be a customer who has been injured by a violation of this title to pursue an action for a violation of section.in the context of that action,the plaintiff may seek any of the remedies provided by section damages,statutory penalties,or injunctive relief.
our conclusion is consistent with that reached by the district court in boorstein men journal llc,supra,wl,a stl action brought by the present plaintiff in federal district court.there,the court held that to have standing under the stl,a plaintiff must suffer an injury caused by a violation of the statute.because the plaintiff could not show he had suffered such an injury,the court granted the defendant motion to dismiss.id.at pp.it explained t he stl law does not allow a cause of action based solely upon a failure to comply with the statute.rather,b expressly requires an injury resulting from a violation.thus,a violation of the statute,without more,is insufficient.id.at.the district court similarly concluded in miller hearst communications,supra,wl,at page t he stl law remedy provision requires an injury in conjunction with a violation.because plaintiff fails to allege a cognizable injury,she lacks statutory standing for her stl claim,regardless of whether her allegations are sufficient to state a violation of the stl law.see also king conde nast publications wl,t he stl law remedy provision requires an injury in conjunction with a violation.because plaintiff fails to allege a cognizable injury,he lacks statutory standing for his stl claim,regardless of whether his allegations are sufficient to state a violation of the stl law.
plaintiff cites edwards first am.cir edwards for the proposition that civil penalties are available in addition to and,importantly,even in the absence of economic damages caused by a violation of the act.edwards does not so hold nor,indeed,could it have done so,because the claim in edwards was brought under the real estate settlement procedures act of respa,not the stl.the edwards court held the plaintiff stated a claim under respa even though she had not alleged she had been overcharged because respa created a statutory cause of action whether or not an overcharge occurred.id.at.the court explained essentially,the standing question is whether the constitutional or statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiff position a right to judicial relief.citation.thus,we must look to the text of respa to determine whether it prohibited defendants conduct if it did,then plaintiff has demonstrated an injury sufficient to satisfy article iii.because the statutory text does not limit liability to instances in which a plaintiff is overcharged,we hold that plaintiff has established an injury sufficient to satisfy article iii.id.at.edwards,therefore,stands for the proposition that a plaintiff need not have suffered an injury to bring a claim under respa because an injury was not required by the plain language of the statute.edwards does not purport to announce a general rule that standing never requires an injury,nor to opine on the injury requirement under the stl 
iii.plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this action because he has not,and can not,plead a statutory injury 
having concluded that plaintiff must plead a statutory injury to state a claim under the stl,we now move to the second part of our inquiry whether plaintiff has alleged such an injury.as we have said,section,subdivision b says that a customer may institute a civil action if he or she was injured by a violation of this title.nowhere,however,does the statute define a violation of this title.
plaintiff contends that a failure to comply with any provision of the statute constitutes an actionable violation of this title.thus,he says,he has stated a claim for relief because he alleged that cbs did not provide contact information on its website in the manner required by section,subdivision b.cbs disagrees,urging that the only violation for which suit may be brought is the failure to provide complete,accurate,and timely disclosures in response to customer disclosure requests pursuant to section,subdivision a.the failure to post the contact information required by section,subdivision b,cbs says,is not an actionable violation because the posting of contact information is merely a means to permit a customer to make a subdivision a disclosure request,not an independent obligation under the statute.thus,cbs urges,because plaintiff admittedly did not make a subdivision a disclosure request,he can not state a claim for relief.for the reasons that follow,cbs is correct.
statutory language 
we begin with the language of the statute.our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.citation.bruns e commerce exchange,cal th.
section,subdivision c imposes a statutory penalty per violation a customer may recover a civil penalty not to exceed three thousand dollars per violation otherwise,the customer may recover a civil penalty of up to five hundred dollars per violation for a violation of section.italics added.that the legislature authorized penalties per violation suggests that a statutory violation is a discrete event,such that a court can quantify the number of violations.a failure to timely,accurately,or completely respond to a disclosure request is a discrete event a court can calculate a civil penalty for each failure by counting the number of disclosure requests to which the defendant did not appropriately respond.a failure to post information on a website,in contrast,is a continuing event that can not readily be quantified,and section does not provide a method for calculating a civil penalty for such a continuing event thus,we conclude that a continuing violation of this kind,without more,is not an actionable violation of this title.
our reading of the statute is supported by section,subdivision d,the safe harbor provision.subdivision d provides a business that is alleged to have not provided all the information required by subdivision a of section,to have provided inaccurate information,failed to provide any of the information required by subdivision a of section,or failed to provide information in the time period required by subdivision b of section,may assert as a complete defense in any action in law or equity that it thereafter provided regarding the information that was alleged to be untimely,all the information,or accurate information,to all customers who were provided incomplete or inaccurate information,respectively,within days of the date the business knew that it had failed to provide the information,timely information,all the information,or the accurate information,respectively.italics added.according to the statute legislative history,this provision was added to an amended version of the bill to accommodate business concerns that businesses might find themselves subject to liability under business and professions code section to individuals who wish to use the bill provisions as a liability trap.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.the amendment p rovide s businesses with a day right to cure unintentional violations,which provides a complete defense to lawsuits.state and consumer services agency,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess,italics added.while legislators acknowledged that the bill could result in increased litigation,they described the provision as providing businesses with a day right to cure unintentional violations that permit s business es that come into full compliance within days to assert a complete defense against any legal action.id.at,italics added.
that the subsequent albeit tardy provision of complete,accurate information is described as a complete defense in any action suggests that the actionable violation contemplated by the statute is the failure completely and accurately to provide any of the informa
