plaintiff harry toscano,a professional golfer,appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of the sponsors of senior pga tour golf tournaments,on his claim under section of the sherman antitrust act.toscano alleges that the defendants entered into a contract,combination,or conspiracy to unreasonably restrain trade in professional golf and among professional golfers by agreeing to sponsor golf tournaments in accordance with pga tour rules and regulations 
the sponsor defendants sought summary judgment solely on the basis that there was no actionable section agreement among any of the defendants.the district court agreed.it ruled that there was no direct evidence of such an agreement,and toscano circumstantial evidence failed to meet the summary judgment requirements of matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.we have jurisdiction under and we affirm.
the senior pga tour was organized to showcase senior golfers who had previously been successful on the regular pga tour.it adopted player eligibility criteria emphasizing both current performance and prior success.current eligibility regulations provide that the field in senior pga tour events will be made up of a the top available players from the previous year senior pga tour money list,b the top available players from the career money list including money won in pga tour and senior pga tour events who were not in the first list,c the top eight players from the yearly senior pga tour national qualifying tournament,d any other players who won a senior pga tour tournament within the past months,e the four low scorers in a qualifying round held on the monday before play begins in a particular tournament,f players usually four designated by the local host organization as sponsor exemptions,and g any otherwise player who has won an official pga tour or senior pga tour tournament.
toscano is a old golfer who began participating in senior pga tour events upon turning in.in late,toscano was one of the top eight finishers in the senior pga tour qualifying tournament and,therefore,qualified for all senior pga tour open events in.he participated in of the senior tour open events that year and earned a total of,but he was not among the top money winners as required to maintain his exempt status for the following year.
toscano failed to qualify or did not participate for health reasons in the senior tour qualifying tournament in each year from through.nevertheless,through one form of qualification or another,toscano was able to compete in of the senior pga tour open events in,of the senior pga tour open events in,of the senior pga tour open events in,and a lesser number of tournaments in later years.in none of those years did toscano win a tournament or finish sufficiently high on the money list to obtain exempt status for the following year.
a senior pga tour tournament has both a local sponsor and a title sponsor.a local sponsor organizes a tournament and receives a share of the tournament profits,usually for charitable purposes.typically,a local sponsor contracts with the pga tour to provide facilities,prizes,and other services the local sponsor obtains the site,arranges volunteer or other assistance for the event,publicizes and promotes the event,arranges for sales of concessions and certain player slots,and provides the bulk of the tournament prize money.the local sponsor contract defines player eligibility by pga tour rules and regulations,prohibits local sponsors from offering appearance incentives,and assigns the sponsor broadcasting rights to the pga tour.the contract also guarantees a local sponsor that its tournament will be the only senior pga tour event on the weekend of that tournament 
the local sponsors contracts also provide that they agree to organize and conduct the tournament in accordance with pga rules and regulations.these rules and regulations,incorporated by reference into the contracts,prohibit players from participating in tour events that conflict with a senior pga tour event without prior pga tour approval the conflicting event rule prohibit players from participating in any televised golf program,regardless of the date,without prior pga tour approval the television release rule and define player eligibility.toscano states that these restrictions effectively deprive any potential competing tournaments of access to the marquee players and give those players already on the tour a huge advantage over players when it comes to being able to get on and stay on the senior tour.
senior pga tour tournaments also have title sponsors,typically large corporations that contract with local sponsors to provide financial support for tournaments in exchange for the right to have a tournament named after them,as well as for additional promotional benefits.with one exception,the title sponsors in this suit did not contract directly with the pga tour.

local sponsors 
toscano contends that the contracts between the local sponsors and the pga tour provide direct evidence of a section agreement in restraint of trade sufficient to withstand summary judgment.he relies on the parts of the local sponsors contracts by which they agree to run tournaments in accord with pga tour rules and regulations.he contends these rules and regulations restrict competition among professional golfers and golf tournaments.
the local sponsors maintain that the district court correctly determined there was no direct or circumstantial evidence of an agreement in restraint of trade because the defendants merely accepted the pga tour rules and regulations and played no role in creating or enforcing them.we agree with the district court.
