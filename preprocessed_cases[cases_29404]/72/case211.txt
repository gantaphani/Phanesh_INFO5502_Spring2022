sarasota citizens for responsible government,et,collectively referred to as citizens appeal a trial court judgment validating bonds proposed for issuance by the city of sarasota and the county of sarasota in furtherance of an agreement bringing the baltimore orioles to sarasota for spring training on appeal in this court,citizens only allege sunshine law violations by the county.they do not challenge any other aspect of the bond validation proceedings,and they do not appeal the trial court determination that the city did not violate the sunshine law.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the trial court.
background 
as the trial court summarized,
t he sarasota county board of county commissioners board entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the baltimore orioles orioles in july.the mou obligated the orioles,among other things,to relocate to sarasota for spring training.sarasota county is obligated to fund construction of improvements at the ed smith complex,the location within the city of sarasota where the orioles are obligated to conduct spring training activities,and other facilities located elsewhere in the county.
negotiation of the mou with the orioles followed unsuccessful attempts to retain the cincinnati reds in sarasota and to secure relocation of the boston red sox to sarasota.in november,the board instructed the county administrator,james ley,to initiate negotiations with the orioles.ley delegated this task to deputy county administrator david bullock bullock.negotiations between the county and orioles began immediately and continued until the terms of the mou were finalized in july.the mou was approved by the board at a public meeting on july.at that public hearing,the board adopted an amended or modified tourist development tax ordinance,in part to provide part of the county funding obligation under the mou approved an interlocal agreement with the city which included an obligation of the city to convey the ed smith complex to the county,to transfer funds to the county to offset part of the cost of construction and to undertake responsibility for environmental remediation,if required,at the complex and adopted a resolution authorizing issuance of bonds for the purpose of financing costs associated with the improvements required by the mou.simultaneously,the city also authorized issuance of bonds to fulfill its obligations pursuant to the i nterlocal a greement.
more specifically,the mou between the county and the orioles states that the county shall provide million to the project and that it is estimated the city contribution will be approximately million,for a total not to exceed million from all governmental sources.the mou details that the proceeds of the county bond issuance is expected to be approximately million,that the proceeds of c ash collections of of one percent of the county tourist development tax is estimated to be approximately million,and that the county cash contributions from legally available valorem revenues will not exceed million.the county is also required to maintain and contribute annually to a capital repair and improvements fund with the orioles also contributing to this fund.the mou further explains that the city bond issue serviced by funds from the state of florida office of tourism,trade and economic development otted or a cash equivalent of valorem revenues will be in an amount no less than million.
the mou calls for the renovation of the ed smith stadium complex,including a renovated clubhouse,batting cages,pitching mounds,practice fields,parking facilities,utilities.additionally,the mou calls for renovations at the orioles minor league spring training facilities located at twin lake park,including practice fields,a renovated clubhouse,administrative offices,batting cages,utilities,weight rooms,pitching mounds.the mou provides that the orioles lease of these facilities commences on november,and continues through october.the orioles may not relocate its major league and minor league spring training operations from sarasota during this lease term,and the orioles rent for this lease term is.however,the orioles are generally responsible for the operating,maintenance,and repairs expenses.the orioles are to manage the ticketing and parking operations and are to receive the revenue from concessions.but the county maintains some ability to use both the major league and minor league sites for events and for natural disaster purposes.in the mou,the county and the orioles also acknowledge that it is mutually beneficial to facilitate the establishment of a youth baseball academy at the minor league site.
the interlocal agreement between the city and the county requires the city to transfer ownership of the ed smith stadium complex to the county.it also requires the city to pay the environmental remediation costs associated with this facility.the city is further required to use its best efforts to issue its bonds to be repaid by the otted funds in an amount estimated to be not less than million.
the terms of the mou and interlocal agreement were the result of extensive negotiations.in furtherance of the board directive to begin negotiations with the orioles,bullock retained two consultants for their baseball expertise and also consulted with county staff,including the county chief financial officer,the county attorney,the county parks and recreation director,and a county planning coordinator.bullock communications and discussions with these individuals were not advertised or otherwise treated as public meetings.
the negotiations with the orioles took place intermittently over a series of months through meetings,phone calls,and documents involving different individuals,all coordinated by bullock.representatives of the sarasota chamber of commerce became involved to advocate for an agreement with the orioles,and the chamber funded a study of the economic impact of spring training in sarasota.the orioles invoked the confidentiality provision of section,florida statutes,to keep confidential its proprietary economic development information relating to the proposed transaction.these negotiations led to the july,presentation to the board of the interlocal agreement and the mou and several mechanisms to finance renovations to the stadium and other facilities.
the negotiations with the orioles took place alongside a series of discussions by the board at its public meetings.for example,on november,the board approved a motion directing staff to open negotiations using percent of tourist development tax revenue and potential city contributions.on november,bullock provided a status report of the meetings and discussed the location of a proposed new facility and the components of the new facility.county staff also presented information regarding capital costs,potential funding sources,and the economic impact of the proposed new facility.on november,the board also discussed specific components of the potential deal,including operations and maintenance payments and a proposed cal ripken youth baseball academy.then,on december,the board discussed a proposal by one of the commissioners that involved million financed with percent of tourist development tax money to renovate the existing ed smith stadium.on december,bullock requested guidance from the board on acceptable parameters for a proposal to retain major league baseball.both county staff and orioles representatives made presentations.also on december,the board discussed and rejected an orioles proposal for a million spring training facility to be funded by an additional percent of tourist development tax money,but then approved a counteroffer involving a lower dollar figure.at public meetings on january,and february,the board again discussed the orioles negotiations.on march,the board directed the county administrator to send correspondence signed by the board chair to the orioles requesting a written counteroffer.
at various points after the start of negotiations with the orioles in november,from constituents or others to members of the board regarding the orioles were copied to other board members and sometimes included the reactions from other board members.in at least one correspondence,a comment was directly addressed from one board member to another.the last among board members produced at trial was sent on april.
thereafter,at its properly noticed public meeting on april,the board discussed the baltimore orioles negotiations,including construction costs and potential funding,and one of the commissioners presented a detailed,draft term sheet outlining funding,terms of the lease,advertising,the youth facility,and an agreement with the city,among other issues.the board rejected that commissioner proposal as well as another commissioner alternative proposal.at an april,meeting,the board discussed the orioles proposal and directed the county administrator to send correspondence to the city asking for formal confirmation of the city willingness to issue bonds.at a may,meeting,the board discussed the city resolution,and bullock advised the board on discussions with the orioles.the board discussed stadium costs and financing and then directed the county administrator to proceed with negotiations providing funding in the amount of million contingent upon specific terms relating to operations and maintenance,advertising,construction management,stadium uses,property taxes,terms of occupancy,and the cal ripken youth facility.then,on may,the board discussed the orioles response as well as funding sources for the renovation of the stadium.one commissioner noted that she could handle another million in addition to the prior million offer.and members of the public,including a representative of citizens,spoke regarding the proposed facilities.
ultimately,these negotiations and meetings resulted in board action on july.on that date,the board held a public hearing that lasted over four hours.the board heard from approximately forty citizens,including several representatives of citizens.bullock and staff gave a presentation on the provisions of the proposed documents and answered questions posed by the board.
then,on february,after citizens filed a suit alleging sunshine law violations against the city and the county,the board held another public hearing for the reconsideration and ratification of the interlocal agreement,the mou,and related actions.the board also adopted a new resolution authorizing the sale of bonds to finance the county portion of the facility renovations.
additionally,the county and the city filed separate complaints seeking validation of the bonds proposed for issuance in furtherance of the agreement with the orioles.the county validation complaint related to county resolution,which was adopted on february,and which authorized three types of bonds capital improvement revenue bonds,series federally america subsidy capital improvement revenue bonds,series federally america zone economic development subsidy and capital improvement revenue bonds,series.and the city validation complaint related to city resolutions and,which were adopted on november,and december,and which authorize sales tax payments revenue bonds,series federally america zone economic development subsidy.citizens alleged sunshine law violations as objections to both of these bond validation actions.
the trial court consolidated the bond validation proceedings and citizens sunshine law complaint.after a bench trial,the trial court validated the county and the city proposed bonds and denied citizens complaint.on appeal in this court,citizens allege that the trial court erred in ruling that a bullock consultations were not required to be in the sunshine,b the staff briefings of county board members prior to the july,public meeting were not a violation of the sunshine law,and c any violations were cured by the board public meetings.
ii.the negotiations team 
citizens contend that the trial court erred when ruling that bullock and the individuals he consulted in negotiating with the orioles the negotiations team were not a board or commission subject to the sunshine law.however,we agree with the city and county and affirm the trial court.
at the outset,we note the following 
a trial court must make three determinations during a bond validation proceeding whether the public body has the authority to issue the subject bonds whether the purpose of the obligation is legal and whether the authorization of the obligation complies with the requirements of law.city of gainesville state,so d.on appeal,this court reviews the trial court findings of fact for substantial competent evidence and its conclusions of law de novo.id.citing city of boca raton state,so d,panama city beach cmty.redev.agency state,so d.
bay county town of cedar grove,so d.this appeal regarding alleged sunshine law violations only concerns the third item above,whether the authorization complies with the requirements of law.
article i,section b of the florida constitution provides 
all meetings of any collegial public body of the executive branch of state government or of any collegial public body of a county,municipality,school district,or special district,at which official acts are to be taken or at which public business of such body is to be transacted or discussed,shall be open and noticed to the public and meetings of the legislature shall be open and noticed as provided in article iii,section e,except with respect to meetings exempted pursuant to this section or specifically closed by this constitution.
and section,florida statutes,commonly known as the government in the sunshine law,provides in part 
all meetings of any board or commission of any state agency or authority or of any agency or authority of any county,municipal corporation,or political subdivision,except as otherwise provided in the constitution,at which official acts are to be taken are declared to be public meetings open to the public at all times,and no resolution,rule,or formal action shall be considered binding except as taken or made at such meeting.the board or commission must provide reasonable notice of all such meetings.
because section was enacted in the public interest to protect the public from closed door politics the law must be broadly construed to effect its remedial and protective purpose.wood marston,so d.as this court has explained,
t he statute should be construed so as to frustrate all evasive devices.this can be accomplished only by embracing the collective inquiry and discussion stages within the terms of the statute,as long as such inquiry and discussion is conducted by any committee or other authority appointed and established by a governmental agency,and relates to any matter on which foreseeable action will be taken.
town of palm beach gradison,so d.mere showing that the government in the sunshine law has been violated constitutes an irreparable public injury id.therefore,where officials have violated section,the official action is void ab initio.id.
all governmental authorities in florida are subject to the requirements of the sunshine law unless specifically exempted.see art.i,c.const.the requirements may also apply to committees subordinate to or selected by traditional governmental authorities.this court in wood explained that the dispositive question is whether authority has been delegated to the committee.so d at.where the committee has been delegated authority,the committee meetings must be open to public scrutiny,regardless of the review procedures eventually used by the traditional governmental body.see id.at where a body merely reviews decisions delegated to another entity,the potential for always exists.to allow a review procedure to insulate the decision itself from public scrutiny invites circumvention of the sunshine law.in contrast,a committee is not subject to the sunshine law if the committee has only been delegated or authority and only conducts such activities.see id.at see also lyon lake county,so d,dca when a committee has been established for and conducts only information gathering and reporting,the activities of that committee are not subject to section,florida statutes.whether,in fact,the delegation is a delegation of authority or authority is evaluated according to the nature of the act performed,not on the of the committee or the
