background.
title ix.patterned after title vi of the civil rights act of,title ix prohibits gender discrimination in education programs receiving federal financial assistance,including athletic programs.section provides that n o person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.section authorizes federal funding agencies to promulgate regulations providing for the termination of federal funding of any noncomplying program or activity,provided,however,that no such action shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance can not be secured by voluntary means.pursuant to this authority,the department of education has promulgated regulations addressing equal opportunity issues in the provision of athletic scholarships and programs.see c.
though congress was silent on the question of private remedies,the supreme court has implied a private right of action to enforce title ix,cannon of chicago,d,and has authorized the award of money damages,franklin gwinnett county pub,d.however,in fashioning specific implied remedies,the court recently cautioned,courts must shape a sensible remedial scheme that best comports with the statute.gebser,at.in gebser,the court held that a school district is not liable for a teacher sexual harassment unless it had actual notice of,and was deliberately indifferent to,the discrimination.the court explained,at.
title ix express means of administrative on an assumption of actual notice to officials of the funding recipient 
it would be unsound,we think,for a statute express system of enforcement to require notice to the recipient and an opportunity to come into voluntary compliance while a judicially implied system of enforcement permits substantial liability without regard to the recipient knowledge or its corrective actions upon receiving notice where a statute express enforcement scheme hinges its most severe sanction on notice and unsuccessful efforts to obtain compliance,we can not attribute to congress the intention to have an implied enforcement scheme that allows imposition of greater liability without comparable conditions.
b.the administrative complaint against umd.umd receives federal funding and therefore must comply with title ix.in september,before these lawsuits were filed,the office for civil rights of the united states department of education ocr notified umd that a title ix complaint had been filed alleging that umd and its athletic department were violating title ix by 
not effectively accommodating the athletic interests and abilities of females 
failing to provide female athletes with proportional athletic financial assistance and 
failing to provide female athletes with equal opportunities for travel allowances,coaching,practice facilities,medical and training services,housing and dining,publicity services,and recruiting resources.
on april,umd and ocr entered into an agreement to resolve the september complaint.the agreement required umd to increase the squad size of its varsity teams for women,to provide women equivalent opportunities to receive athletic financial assistance,and to provide women equivalent access to the other services and facilities enumerated in the complaint.the agreement further required umd to submit status reports to ocr on october,and,and a final report on october,documenting its full implementation of this agreement.in november,after umd submitted those reports,ocr determined that umd had fully implemented all provisions of the agreement.ocr then terminated its administrative monitoring.
c.these actions commence.in february,umd student julie grandson filed the first action,seeking injunctive relief and compensatory damages for the scholarship and financial support she allegedly would have received as a member of the women varsity soccer team had umd not discriminated against female athletes.three months later,jennifer thompson,renata lindahl,and ginger jeffries collectively referred to as thompson plaintiffs filed the second action.the thompson plaintiffs purported to sue on behalf of a class of similarly situated female students.they sought injunctive relief requiring umd to end gender discrimination in its intercollegiate athletic program by increasing the total number of participation opportunities for women and by adding an ncaa division i women team.
at the time these actions were filed,umd fielded seven varsity athletic teams for men and seven for women.all the varsity teams competed at the ncaa division ii level,except for men ice hockey which was a division i team.in,as part of its title ix compliance efforts under the ocr agreement,umd added a division i women ice hockey team.earlier this year,that team won the first ncaa national championship for women ice hockey.see umd earns ncaa title,mpls.star,at.
procedural history.on june,the thompson plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaint to assert claims for money damages.the district court deferred that motion pending resolution of umd motion to dismiss,which was denied on march.shortly thereafter,the court entered a revised scheduling order,as requested by plaintiffs,which set july,as the deadline for filing dispositive motions.umd moved to strike the thompson plaintiffs class allegations because the motion for class dispositive motion under the district court local not been timely filed.
following a hearing on july,magistrate judge jonathan lebedoff recommended that the district court grant umd motion to strike the class allegations.the district court adopted this recommendation.judge lebedoff also denied the thompson plaintiffs motion to add money damage claims as futile.the district court affirmed this order.finally,on february,the district court granted summary judgment dismissing the individual plaintiffs remaining claims.the court ruled that the four plaintiffs lacked standing to seek injunctive relief because they had not played a varsity sport or had exhausted their ncaa eligibility.the court dismissed grandson damage claim under gebser because she did not allege that she complained to umd officials about her alleged unequal treatment and did not support her allegation of disparate funding with proof of intentional discrimination or deliberate disregard for women athletics.
describing these actions as suits to end twenty years of pervasive and intentional gender discrimination in the intercollegiate athletic program at umd,plaintiffs appeal district court rulings striking their class allegations,denying their motion to add damage claims,and dismissing the individual claims for injunctive relief and damages.
ii.discussion.
plaintiffs complain of widespread intentional discrimination in the funding of women varsity sports,in the allocation of athletic scholarships to men and women athletes,and in the spending of an annual women special allocation appropriated by the minnesota legislature.though plaintiffs do not disclose the specific relief they seek,it is
