brandon west was warming up with a few of his teammates in the outfield before a little league game.his coach threw him a pop fly.west lost the ball in the setting sun.it hit him in the eye and caused serious injury.west appeals from the judgment dismissing his complaint against defendants sundown little league of stockton,little league baseball,dennis hughes,ed krager,and bob whitaker.west contends the trial court erred in finding that as a matter of law the defense of primary assumption of risk applied to the particular conduct and defendants in question,and that defendants had not waived the defense in writing at the time that west was first enrolled in little league.losing a fly ball in the sun and being hit by it is an inherent risk of baseball assumed by all players whether it happens during little league or during game of the major league world series.the written release does not present a material question of fact concerning waiver.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in the spring of,plaintiff and appellant brandon west was years old.he was playing his first year on a little league organized hardball baseball team,although he had previously played softball baseball in a physical education class and with his friends.west team was a minor a second step up after in his league.while the minor league is instructional,there is still a certain amount of competitiveness inherent to the game itself.
west claimed he could play baseball as well as any of the other players on his team.prior to the day he was injured,west had participated in numerous practices,played in two practice games and played in several official games.normally,plaintiff played pitcher or at first base.
when she signed him up to play little league baseball,west mother,patricia west,completed and signed the little league application.one paragraph of that application stated know that participation in baseball or softball may result in serious injuries and protective equipment does not prevent all injuries to players,and do hereby waive,release,absolve,indemnify and agree to hold harmless the local little league,little league baseball incorporated,the organizers,sponsors,supervisors,participants and persons transporting child to and from activities for any claim arising out of any injury to child whether the result of negligence or for any other cause except to the extent and in the amount covered by accident or liability insurance.
the league safety officer brought information to the sundown little league board that shatterproof sunglasses would offer protection from losing the ball in the sun,but the board decided against purchasing these glasses based upon their cost.prior to the accident,no one in the league told west or his parents shatterproof type sunglasses could be good protection from eye injuries.west also had heard an umpire,who was also a coach,state that sunglasses were not allowed during games.based on unknown statements made to west mother by coaches and the language from the application,west mother believed that her son was not allowed to use any type of equipment other than that provided to him by the team.
west was injured on may.just before the scheduled game that day,west team was on the field.the other team was in its dugout.west was scheduled to play outfield.coach hughes stood on the third base line approximately halfway between third base and the outfield fence.he sent some of his players,including west,to center field to take fly ball practice.the sun was shining and located somewhere behind coach hughes as he faced center field.thus,the boys in center field were facing the afternoon sun as they were taking practice.
the league safety officer had warned coaches against hitting practice fly balls into the sun.coach hughes testified he was throwing,not intentionally trying to get the boys to practice catching a fly ball that might get lost in the sun.nevertheless,coach hughes believed west was sufficiently skilled to deal with losing a high fly ball in the sun.prior to his injury,west had not received instruction as to how to deal with balls lost in the sun.
west was either the second or third boy in line for this drill.one of the first two caught the ball thrown from coach hughes the other lost the ball in the sun.as coach hughes threw the ball,west saw it but lost the ball in the sun while it was still going up.the ball came down and struck him in the left eye,causing permanent injury to the eye.
west filed his complaint against the defendants,including his local league,little league baseball incorporated,and the coaches and agents of the league dennis hughes,ed krager,and bob whitaker.the complaint alleged a single cause of action for negligence.the complaint alleged the defendants were negligent and they increased the risk of harm to west by their actions.each of the defendants answered the complaint and asserted the affirmative defense of assumption of the risk.
defendants brought a motion for summary judgment based on primary assumption of the risk.west opposed the motion.
with his opposition,west filed the declaration of donald sinn,a purported expert on the subject of consulting for recreation and park planning and management.sinn opined the sun would not have been a significant risk to west as he was playing in the outfield during a game because the field was oriented on a axis from center field to home plate sinn also asserted that coach hughes significantly enhanced and maximized the inherent risk of losing the ball in the sun by the physical configuration of the practice drill.sinn averred coach hughes knew or should have known that catching pop flies in the sun was a skill beyond the level of first year minor league players.he stated players need to know how to protect their heads and faces while looking for the ball.indeed,even professional ball players wearing sunglasses are at some risk doing this activity making ten children attempt this feat without any training or eye protection is extremely negligent.
defendants filed written objections to sinn declaration on the grounds that it contains matters not appropriate for expert opinion,sinn does not have the qualifications and foundational facts necessary to express an expert opinion,he lacks personal knowledge of the matters about which he testified,and his declaration is irrelevant.despite defendants repeated efforts to obtain a ruling on these objections,the trial court refused to address them because,in its words,it just concentrated on primary assumption of the risk and really did consider much the declaration to throw out part of the expert testimony.under the circumstances,the objections are preserved for appeal.city of long beach farmers merchants bank th,d.
in granting the summary judgment motion,the trial court concluded being struck by a baseball,losing it in the sun,and changing lighting conditions are inherent risks of the sport of baseball.the court further concluded the defendants had no duty to affirmatively decrease any of these inherent risks,and defendants actions did not increase these inherent risks.thus,the court found west complaint barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk.the court also found the application form irrelevant to its analysis.
discussion 
assumption of risk 
west argues the trial court erred in finding that as a matter of law the defense of primary assumption of risk applied to the particular conduct and defendants in question we disagree.
primary assumption of risk arises where a plaintiff voluntarily participates in an activity or sport involving certain inherent risks primary assumption of risk bar s recovery because no duty of care is owed as to such risks.connelly mammoth mountain ski area th,d.whether,in a given case,the doctrine will be applied is a legal question which turns on the nature of the sport or activity in question and on the parties general relationship to the activity and to each other.knight jewett cal th,d.the conclusion that primary assumption of risk applies is the conclusion defendant owes no duty of care to the plaintiff.id.at,d.in knight,our supreme court concluded that the defendant owed no duty of care to a coparticipant he injured in a touch football game,absent evidence the defendant intentionally injured the plaintiff or engaged in reckless conduct that is totally outside the range of ordinary activity involved in the sport.id.at,d.
similar facts to those before us were presented to division three of the court of appeal,fourth appellate district.balthazor little league baseball,th,d balthazor.in balthazor,ryan balthazor was injured when an errant pitch hit him in the face while he was at bat.id.at,d.the plaintiff claimed the defendant breached a duty of care by,inter alia,failing to end the game as sunset approached and inadequate lighting conditions began to prevail,and failing to provide batting helmets with face guards.the court of appeal affirmed summary judgment for the defendant,concluding the risk of being hit by a wild pitch is inherent in the sport of baseball.id.at,d.
in rejecting the first argument concerning the lighting conditions,the court explained baseball is played under various lighting conditions,even during the day.on a bright sunny day,the position of the ball relative to the sun can result in an increased risk of being hit by either a thrown or batted ball.changing lighting conditions are inherent in the sport.it was not dark when the injury occurred,the sun had not set,and balthazor admitted he saw and avoided the first pitch.balthazor injury was simply a result of an inherent risk in the sport id.at,d.
on the second point,the court rejected balthazor contention the league should have provided face guards.the league,in its supervisory control of the game,assumed the role of instructor.balthazor,supra,th at,d.an instructor,however,is not an insurer of the student safety.ibid.instructors have a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport.citations.ibid.under primary assumption of risk,the defendant has a duty not to increase the risks inherent in the sport,not a duty to decrease the risks.id.at,d.there is no duty to provide additional safety equipment over that normally worn by the team.ibid.the court explained in fortier los rios community college dist.th,d,the court rejected the plaintiff contention that failure to provide specific safety equipment,in that case a helmet,increased the risk of injury in noncontact football.balthazor,supra,th at,d.to impose the duty to provide such equipment on schools and other supervisors and organizers of such sport in order to avoid liability for injuries inherent in the rough and tumble of such activity would have enormous social and economic consequences.citation.the opportunities to participate in organized,recreational football would be significantly diminished.ibid.the balthazor court concluded,here,the face guard which balthazor argues should have been required was not part of the normal safety equipment used by the league.the league failure to require additional equipment did not increase a risk inherent in the sport that a player might be struck by a carelessly thrown ball.ibid.
the declaration of west expert,donald sinn,does not raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether defendants increase d the risks to west over and above those inherent in the sport.knight jewett,supra,cal th at,d.as defendants correctly pointed out in the trial court,absent from sinn declaration is any evidence that he had personal knowledge of the layout of the little league diamond upon which west was injured.moreover,the motion of the sun and its effects on a baseball field and baseball players are matters of common knowledge,not the proper subject of expert testimony.sinn conclusion that defendants significantly enhanced and maximized the inherent risk of losing the ball in the sun is an inadmissible legal conclusion.adams city of fremont th,d opinion testimony is inadmissible and irrelevant to adjudging questions of law.thus,we are left with sinn opinion that the coach should have known that catching pop flies in the sun is a skill beyond the level of first year minor league players.this does not raise a triable issue because,as we will explain,losing sight of a pop fly in the sun is a risk inherent in baseball no matter what the level of play,and placing baseball players in practice or situations that replicate game conditions does not,as a matter of law,increase the risk over and above that inherent in the sport.
the juxtaposition of the sun and a baseball,either in practice,during or during a game,is an inherent risk in the game.being hit by that same ball after it disappears into the sun is a risk of the game.many a pop fly has disappeared in the sun to a player on the ground.sometimes it falls harmlessly away from the player.other times,the ball bounces off the player mitt.and sometimes,it hits the player trying valiantly to fight off the glare of the sun.tragically,in this case,the ball caused a serious injury.nothing the coach or the league,or little league baseball incorporated,did,however,increased these fundamental risks inherent in baseball.
the orientation of the field versus the orientation of the drill does not change the analysis.baseball is not a static game.the players and balls move across the field at all angles and directions.a fly ball down the right field line would travel at the same trajectory as the ball thrown from the third base line to center field.an overthrow from third to second also would follow this path in relation to the sun.as noted above the fielders on a regulation baseball field are always faced with this danger during an afternoon game.
furthermore,the league and its coaches had no obligation to provide additional safety equipment to its players.their obligation was to not increase the risk of the game,not to affirmatively protect the players by providing equipment to its fielders.
defendant urges us to focus on the level of play of the minor league as a ground to avoid applying primary assumption of risk.there is nothing legally significant,however,about the level of play of the minor leagues of little league baseball versus other levels of play.minor league teams can be just as competitive as major league teams,as shown by the testimony of the league safety officer.anyone who has been to a little league ballpark on a saturday morning can attest to that fact.fly balls occur in every level of baseball.the ball is the object of the game and hitting it as hard and far as you can is often the key to scoring runs.
plaintiff reliance on this court decision in bush parents without partners th,d is misplaced.in a decision,the majority held that dancing was not a sport to which the primary assumption of risk applied.id.at,d.as noted by the majority in bush,the primary assumption of risk rule has been applied in situations involving a wide variety of active sports,ranging from baseball to ice hockey and skating,emphasis added.bush simply has no application here.
it is not legally significant that this accident happened during a drill rather than during the game itself.a major purpose of practice and drills is to place the players in situations that replicate game conditions to enable and encourage the participants to play the game as it should be played.fortier los rios community college,supra,th at,d.in their practices,coaches and instructors may make mistakes.where those mistakes are not outside the range of ordinary activity for the sport,the coaches are not liable if injuries result from their missteps.kane national ski patrol system,th,d ski instructor not liable for injuries caused when instructor failed to properly assess the conditions and the skill level of his pupils.
coaches must be free to push their players to levels that may,in hindsight,be beyond the students abilities.bushnell religious cultural center th,d.in bushnell,a student was injured during a judo class practice when a volunteer instructor injured the student during a training session.ibid.in concluding the primary assumption of risk doctrine applied to this conduct,the court stated instruction in an activity such as judo necessarily requires pushing a student to move more quickly,attempt a new move,or tak
