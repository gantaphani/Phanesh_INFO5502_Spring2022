opinion of the court 
thousands of retired professional football players filed suit against the national football league and various other defendants alleging primarily that the defendants failed to take reasonable actions to protect players from the risks associated with concussive and head injuries.the cases were consolidated before the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.on july,the district court issued an order that preliminarily approved a proposed settlement agreement and conditionally certified for settlement purposes only the settlement class and subclasses.petitioners,seven retired professional football players who object to the proposed settlement agreement and class certification,filed a federal rule of civil procedure f petition for permission to appeal the district court july,order.
at issue in this request for interlocutory review is the nature of this court jurisdiction under rule f.because the district court order was not an order granting or denying certification under the plain text of the rule,we have dismissed the petition 
plaintiffs are retired professional football players who played in a member club of the national football league nfl and are not seeking active employment as players with any member club.beginning in july,retired professional football players began filing lawsuits alleging that defendants nfl and nfl properties,llc collectively nfl defendants failed to take reasonable actions to protect players from the chronic risks posed by concussive and head injuries in january,after more than retired professional football players brought suit,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated and transferred all pending cases to the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania for inclusion in coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.

on january,the district court denied the parties motion without prejudice.the district court initial denial was based on its primary concern that not all retired nfl football players who ultimately receive a qualifying diagnosis or their related claimants will be paid.in re football league players concussion injury,d.the district court reasoned that the proposed monetary fund may be inadequate to cover the likely amount of the awards to the class members.id.at.
the parties renegotiated the proposed settlement and,on june,filed another motion for preliminary approval and conditional certification of a revised settlement agreement.the revised settlement agreement guaranteed payment of all valid claims but put in place additional measures designed to prevent fraudulent claims.in re football league players concussion injury,md ab,dkt.at.june,the parties also proposed that a nationwide settlement class be conditionally certified,for settlement purposes only and include three types of claimants and two subclasses id.dkt.at.
on july,seven retired nfl football players collectively objectors filed an objection to the june,revised settlement agreement.objectors argued that the revised settlement agreement could not be certified under rule because it bargained away,without adequate representation,the rights of three distinct groups of former players those suffering from,or displaying symptoms consistent with,chronic traumatic encephalopathy who did not die before preliminary approval those who have suffered or are at risk of suffering a stroke or traumatic brain injury and those who played in nfl europe.additional defects raised by objectors include that the proposed notice was false and misleading the claims process was so onerous and confusing that it raised due process and fairness concerns the settlement agreement was not the product of arm length negotiation and that class counsel conducted no discovery by which to evaluate the strength of the claims and defenses.
on july,the district court issued an order and memorandum in which the proposed class action settlement agreement was preliminarily approved and t he settlement class and subclasses were conditionally certified for settlement purposes only.in re football league players concussion injury.in the district court supporting memorandum,it explained that rule e requires court approval of the settlement of a class action.a preliminary approval of the proposed settlement was set forth by the district court as 
typically proceed ing in two stages.at the first stage,the parties submit the proposed settlement to the court,which must make a preliminary fairness evaluation.if the proposed settlement is preliminarily acceptable,the court then directs that notice be provided to all class members who would be bound by the proposed settlement in order to afford them an opportunity to be heard on,object to,and opt out of the settlement.see.c,e,e.at the second stage,after class members are notified of the settlement,the court holds a formal fairness hearing where class members may object to the settlement.see.e b.if the court concludes that the settlement is fair,reasonable and adequate,the settlement is given final approval.e.at this time,plaintiffs request that i grant preliminary approval.
id.at.after conducting a preliminary review of the settlement agreement,the district court proceeded to analyze the parties request for conditional certification of the proposed class.
the district court premised its analysis of conditional certification of the settlement class and subclasses with the following standard of review 
a court must determine whether the proposed settlement class and subclasses satisfy the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure.see sullivan db,cir en banc.at the preliminary approval stage,a court may conditionally certify the class for purposes of providing notice,leaving the final certification decision for the subsequent fairness hearing.see manual for complex litigation fourth.
for the purposes of effecting the proposed rule e settlement process,the district court appointed class counsel,class counsel,and subclass counsel,approved the dissemination of class notice,and scheduled a fairness hearing for november.id.at.the district court also stayed any matters as they related to the nfl defendants and enjoined proposed class members from pursuing any related lawsuits.id.at.on july,objectors filed this petition for leave to appeal from the district court july,order.

objectors raise various substantive challenges to the merits of the district court july,order.before we can consider the merits of any appeal,it is first necessary to determine whether we have appellate jurisdiction.a federal appellate court generally has jurisdiction over appeals only from the entry of a final judgment by a district court,subject to certain limited exceptions.see cunningham hamilton.such is the limited nature of federal jurisdiction that we have an independent duty to satisfy ourselves of our appellate jurisdiction regardless of the parties positions.in re fosamax alendronate sodium prods.liab.litig.no.ii,cir quoting papotto hartford life accident ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as aptly explained by chief justice warren 
it is axiomatic,as a matter of history as well as doctrine,that the existence of appellate jurisdiction in a specific federal court over a given type of case is dependent upon authority expressly conferred by statute.and since the jurisdictional statutes prevailing at any given time are so much a product of the whole history of both growth and limitation of jurisdiction since the first judiciary act,stat,they have always been interpreted in the light of that history and of the axiom that clear statutory mandate must exist to found jurisdiction.

there are various exceptions to the general principle that appellate jurisdiction is limited to final orders.see,a granting appellate jurisdiction over certain types of interlocutory orders b allowing a district judge to certify an order involving a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and where immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.b permitting a district court to certify a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties for appellate review cohen beneficial indus.loan,permitting immediate appeal of an otherwise collateral order under certain circumstances.
the very narrowness of appellate jurisdiction is designed to discourage piecemeal litigation.camesi of pittsburgh med,cir.limited appellate jurisdiction prevents parties from employing tactics to obtain review of discovery orders,evidentiary rulings,or any of the myriad decisions a district court makes before it reaches the merits of an action.id.at.
rule f provides in relevant part a court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying certification under this rule if a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the circuit clerk within days after the order is entered.f.before the enactment of rule f,it was well settled that a class certification decision,per se,is not an appealable final order under.sullivan pacific indem,cir.appellate courts were generally reluctant to grant interlocutory review of class certification orders.courts that did grant such review used various devices,such as a writ of mandamus under the all writs act,a,see in re rhone poulenc rorer,cir,or exercised jurisdiction after a district court certified the,interlocutory order for appellate review pursuant to u.b,see castano american tobacco,cir.
yet courts were confronted by the reality that an extraordinary writ is just that,extraordinary.see in re sch.asbestos,cir,as amended,as the adjective extraordinary implies however,courts of appeals must be chary in exercising that power m andamus must not be used as a mere substitute for appeal.quoting roche evaporated milk ass n.accordingly,even courts granting writs of mandamus did so with an uneasiness that their actions stretched the writ traditionally restrictive parameters.newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir,as amended.and as to b interlocutory appeals,these were rare because a district court must first certify an order for appellate review under limited parameters.b.specifically,a district court would need to conclude that the order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.id.
it was not until the seventh circuit decision in in re rhone poulenc rorer,to exercise mandamus that the advisory committee on civil rules began to seriously explore reforms to appellate review and federal jurisdiction over certification decisions.see robert klonoff,the decline of class actions.in promulgating rule f,the advisory committee exercised its authority under e and sought to e xpan d opportunities to appeal.f advisory committee notes amendments the decision whether to allow appeal from an order granting or denying certification,however,was left to the sole discretion of the court of appeals.id.
subdivision f was added to rule in to provide a form of interlocutory review over certification decisions.the reason for adding subdivision f was that the certification decision is often decisive as a practical matter.id.the judicial conference committee on rules of practice and procedure standing committee explained 
denial of certification can toll the death knell in actions that seek to vindicate large numbers of individual claims.alternatively,certification can exert enormous pressure to settle.because of the difficulties and uncertainties that attend some certification decisions those that do not fall within the boundaries of practice the need for immediate appellate review may be greater than the need for appellate review of many routine civil judgments.
report at the advisory committee notes to the amendments to rule f provide 
appeal from an order granting or denying class certification is permitted in the sole discretion of the court of appeals.no other type of rule order is covered by this provision.the court of appeals is given unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal,akin to the discretion exercised by the supreme court in acting on a petition for certiorari.
f advisory committee notes amendments emphasis added 
in light of this drafting history,parsing the text of rule f is fundamental to understanding the nature of the interlocutory review contemplated by this provision.to begin,rule f is premised on the notion that a court of appeals grant of a petition for interlocutory review is discretionary.the rule states that a court of appeals may permit an appeal.f emphasis added.references in the advisory committee notes that appeals are in the sole discretion of the court of appeals and that the court of appeals is given unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal support this reading.f advisory committee notes amendments.
in newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,we recognized the discretionary nature of our review rule f provide s for interlocutory appeal by permission of the court of appeals and permits the appellate courts to develop a coherent body of jurisprudence in this area.at.there are five flexible principles from the advisory committee note that may guide our exercise of discretionary jurisdiction id.at.the advisory committee taxonomy is not exclusive,however,and is not intended to circumscribe our discretion there may also be other valid reasons for the exercise of interlocutory review.id.at.accordingly,newton makes clear that the beginning text of rule f,which provides that a court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal.f emphasis added,was itself a delegation of authority to the courts of appeals to determine when to grant a rule f motion and to develop a jurisprudence to guide such determinations.
what newton and its progeny do not discuss,and what this court has yet to address,is the type of order this court may review.the plain text of rule f provides the courts of appeals with discretion to permit an appeal from a specific type of order that is,from an order of a district court granting or denying certification.f emphasis added.the advisory committee notes to the amendments to rule f explain no other type of rule order is covered by this provision.f advisory committee notes amendments.there is only one subdivision within rule governing certification orders rule c in this way,the text of rule f inextricably ties the type of order appealable to rule c 
when rule f was enacted in,rule c permitted a district court to conditionally certify a proposed class.in,concerned that district courts were conditionally certifying putative class actions without undertaking a thorough analysis of the rule a and b certification requirements,the supreme court and congress deleted the portion of rule c that provided that class certification may be conditional.c advisory committee notes amendments the advisory committee notes directed that a court that is not satisfied that the requirements of rule have been met should refuse certification until they have been met.id.rule c was also altered to require that the determination whether to certify a class be made at an early practicable time,rather than as soon as practicable.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this change was made because district courts may need time to gather information necessary to make the certification decision.id.the other notable change within rule c was with relation to the provision that permits alteration or amendment of an order granting or denying class certification.id.the amendments changed the point to alter a certification order at final judgment rather than the decision on the merits in order to avoid the possible ambiguity in referring to the decision on the merits.id.this ambiguity stemmed from the reality that after determining liability and in analyzing a remedy,there may be the need to amend the class definition or subdivide the class.id.
under the present structure of rule c,we made clear in hohider united parcel service,that a district court was no longer permitted to issue a conditional certification.f d,cir in hohider,we analyzed a litigation class seeking certification over claims of discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of.id.at.after analyzing the claims that could be subject to certification,the trial court determined plaintiffs claims for compensatory and punitive damages could not be certified for classwide treatment under rule b.id.at.the trial court,however,withheld judgment on plaintiffs claims reasoning that there could be a protocol for identifying those monetary damages.id.we rejected such an approach.we held that the trial court conditional certification of plaintiffs request for back pay was improper because a trial court must make a definitive determination that the requirements of rule have been met before certifying a class.id.at quoting in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir.our ruling was based on the amendments to rule that eliminated the language that had appeared in rule c providing that a class certification may be conditional.id.quoting in re hydrogen peroxide,at 
in short,rule f provides the court of appeals broad discretion in granting interlocutory review,but only as to one type of rule order a certification order issued pursuant to rule c.
the issue of class certification pursuant to rule c may also be relevant to the treatment of settlements under rule e,which provides the procedures applicable to proposed settlements,voluntary dismissals,or compromises the approval of a settlement is governed by rule e,which specifically requires that a district court approve a settlement agreement only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair,reasonable,and adequate.e.thus,when a district court is presented with a class settlement agreement,the court must first determine that the requirements for class certification under rule a and b are met,and must separately determine that the settlement is fair to the class under rule e.sullivan,at quoting in re ins.brokerage antitrust,cir.the intent of these procedures is to provide transparency for class members and authority to the district court to act as a fiduciary for putative class members by guarding the claims and rights of absent class members.see ehrheart verizon wireless,f d,cir.
what renders these seemingly directives less than clear is the procedural posture presented when a settlement is reached before the district court has issued a certification order under rule c.the advisory committee notes to the amendments do contemplate that the decisions on certification and settlement may proceed simultaneously.e advisory committee notes amendments.further,even where class certification has already occurred,a district court review of a settlement may provide an occasion to review the cogency of the initial class definition.id.
the exact process a district court should follow when presented with a settlement class is not prescribed by rule e.a settlement class offers defendants the opportunity to engage in settlement negotiations without conceding any of the arguments they may have against class certification.often the parties never intend to litigate the claims rather,from the time plaintiffs file the complaint,the goal on both sides is to reach a nationwide settlement.in re cmty.bank of,cir.further,a district court management of a settlement class is different from a litigation class in that the court is acting as fiduciary to protect unnamed members of the class.ehrheart,at sullivan,at.these differences aside,the settlement only class has become a stock device.amchem,at.
section of the federal judicial center manual for complex litigation fourth explains that the r eview of a proposed class action settlement generally involves two hearings.manual for complex litigation ed hereinafter manual for complex litigation.in the first hearing,or preliminary fairness review,counsel submit the proposed terms of settlement and the judge makes a preliminary fairness evaluation.id.in the context of a preliminary fairness review of an uncertified settlement class,provides that the certification hearing and preliminary fairness evaluation can usually be combined.id.when combining a certification and preliminary fairness hearing 
the judge should make a preliminary determination that the proposed class satisfies the criteria set out in rule a and at least one of the subsections of rule b.see section.if there is a need for subclasses,the judge must define them and appoint counsel to represent them.the judge must make a preliminary determination on the fairness,reasonableness,and adequacy of the settlement terms and must direct the preparation of notice of the certification,proposed settlement,and date of the final fairness hearing.
id.emphasis added.
this case management technique for uncertified settlement classes makes sense,particularly from a notice perspective.rule e requires the district court to direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.e.the principal purpose of this provision is to ensure that absentee class members,for whom a settlement will have preclusive effect,have an opportunity to review the materials relevant to the proposed settlement and to be heard or otherwise take steps to protect their rights before the court approves or rejects the settlement.mclaughlin on class actions ed.this notice can be sent to putative class members before the district court issues a certification order or,i n cases in which a litigation class has already been certified the notice of settlement may also be sent to to give them an opportunity to rejoin the class.id.
the preliminary analysis of a proposed class is therefore a tool for settlement used by the parties to fairly and efficiently resolve litigation.in the context of a rule b class,this affords defendants the opportunity to determine whether there will be sufficient participation in the class before certifying the class and dispersing any settlement fund.this also allows the parties to forgo a trial on the merits,which often leaves more money for the resolution of claims.
arguably,the manual for complex litigation does not reconcile a preliminary determination under rule e of class certification with the elimination of conditional certification under rule c.although the federal judicial center current version of the manual for complex litigation was published in,it is unclear whether the drafters had the opportunity to address the nuances between subdivisions c and f of rule following the amendments despite that,many district court judges rely,and rightfully so,on the manual for complex litigation in managing class actions.
in light of the interplay between subdivision c,e,and f of rule,we emphasize that a district court should be fastidious in its choice of language when making a preliminary determination as recommended by to be clear conditional certification should not be a preferred term of art in this circuit.district courts should not couch a ruling as providing conditional certification when they actually intend to issue a certification order at a later date.instead,district courts should more appropriately note that they are conducting a preliminary determination regarding class certification for a settlement class in order to provide notice to absent class members and that they are reserving the certification decision for a later date.conditional certification rulings are not contemplated under rule c and district courts always have the ability to amend and alter an order before final judgment under rule c c.see hohider,at in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,at.courts wishing to actually make a certification decision at a preliminary fairness hearing should do so by issuing an order pursuant to rule c and without reference to the order being conditional.
we hold that an interlocutory appeal pursuant to rule f permits the court of appeals to review only an order granting or denying certification issued pursuant to rule c.an order issued under some other subdivision of rule,such as a case management order issued pursuant to rule e that preliminarily or conditionally addresses class certification but reserves the class certification determination for a later time,does not qualify as an order granting or denying certification that is subject to interlocutory review under rule f such is the case before us.we conclude that the district court july,order that conditionally certified the proposed settlement class and subclasses was not issued pursuant to rule c.instead,the district court properly exercised its authority under rule e and was managing a settlement agreement as requested by the parties.
the structure and text of the district court order and memorandum support this conclusion.two aspects of the district court order are telling.first,the district court ordered that the proposed class action settlement agreement is preliminarily approved and that the settlement class and subclasses are conditionally certified for settlement purposes only.in re football league players concussion injury,at emphasis added.the order specifically couched review of the settlement agreement as preliminary and the class was only conditionally certified for settlement purposes.
second,the district court scheduled a fairness hearing for november,to consider comments on and objections to the proposed settlement agreement and to consider whether a to approve the settlement agreement as fair,reasonable,and adequate,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,b to certify the settlement class and subclasses,and c to enter the final order and judgment as provided in article xx of the settlement agreement.id.at emphasis added.this language clearly reveals that the district court regarded its july,order as having not yet reached a rule c determination on class certification.
the notice template attached to the district court order also made patent that the settlement itself was only proposed and identified the proposed class representatives and their lawyers.id.at,ex.had the district court actually certified the class,the class representatives would not have been described as proposed,see.a rather,class counsel would have been appointed outright,see.c b,g.
yet ultimately it is the content of the district court memorandum that is most telling.the district court began its discussion of conditional certification of the settlement class and subclasses with the following standard of review 
a court must determine whether the proposed settlement class and subclasses satisfy the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure.see sullivan db,cir en banc.at the preliminary approval stage,a court may conditionally certify the class for purposes of providing notice,leaving the final certification decision for the subsequent fairness hearing.see manual for complex litigation fourth.
in re football league players concussion injury,at.
the district court premised its rule a and b analysis on the analytical approach suggested by of the manual for complex litigation the district court also made clear that its preliminary approval was for purposes of providing notice.id.the district court expressly provided in its memorandum that the proposed settlement class and subclasses preliminarily satisf ied the requirements of rule a and b.id.at.the thoroughness and precision of the district judge memorandum indicates that had she actually wished to certify the proposed class and subclasses,she would have done so and referenced rule c.we read the district court order and memorandum as having expertly addressed the management of a settlement class and no more.
accordingly,the district court july,order reserved the determination of certification and fairness until after the november,hearing.the district court accompanying july,memorandum conducted only a basic and necessarily contingent analysis in short,a preliminary analysis of rule a and b to determine whether the proposed approach to settlement and for providing notice to the putative class members were effective case management tools.
the district court did not certify the class.instead,it reserved the rigorous analysis prescribed by hydrogen peroxide until after the november,fairness hearing,at which a full record could be developed.we clarify for the first time for district courts in this circuit that the manual for complex litigation use of the phrase conditional certification should be avoided.rather than use the word conditional,courts in a similar procedural posture should make clear that they are making a preliminary determination on certification for the purpose of issuing notice of settlement,and that they are reserving the issuance of a certification order until after a fairness hearing.the certification order ultimately issued must necessarily be entered before the district court approves the class settlement,sullivan,at,but need not occur before providing notice under rule e.permitting a district court to manage a settlement class in this manner provides the flexibility needed to protect absent class members interests and efficiently evaluate the issues of class certification and approval of a settlement agreement.
objectors disagree with this interpretation of the district court order and contend that five basic points govern the analysis of our jurisdiction under rule f.none of these points are persuasive.
first,objectors argue that the district court need not issue a final certification order for the court of appeals to have jurisdiction.this focus on a final order,however,misses the point.rule c c provides that an order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.thus,all certification orders issued under rule c are as a practical matter conditional so far as they are subject to change before the district court enters final judgment.this means that a district court can not grant certification on the condition that a rule a or b certification requirement is later met.hohider,at.the district court premised its analysis on providing notice to absent class members before issuing an order on certification or approving the settlement agreement.rather than limit rule f appeals to final orders,our holding today is simply that a district court must issue an order pursuant to rule c before we have jurisdiction to conduct interlocutory review pursuant to rule f.
objectors second point is that rule f is intended to afford an opportunity for prompt correction of a district court error to spare the parties significant litigation or settlement costs.here the district court has yet to commit any error that we could correct.in fact,the very purpose of the july,order was to provide putative class members with notice so that they could meaningfully participate in the fairness hearing.reviewing the july,order now would greatly undermine the policy against piecemeal litigation.camesi,at.
regarding the issues of litigation and settlement costs,objectors erroneously focus on the typical pressures facing a litigation class rather than a settlement class.in a traditional litigation class,after a certification order,the result could sound the death knell of the litigation on the part of the plaintiffs or place hydraulic pressure on defendants to settle.newton,at,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.because the district court reserved issuing its class certification order until after the fairness hearing,we are left with dead silence rather than a death knell.moreover,there can be no application of hydraulic pressure where there has been no application of force at all.here,nfl defendants elected to negotiate a settlement agreement.the district court preliminary determination regarding class certification did not so pressure nfl defendants that they were forced to settle the pending lawsuits.
third,objectors cite to the unfettered discretion granted to courts of appeals in permitting a rule f interlocutory appeal.as noted above,this phrase from the advisory committee notes to the amendments fails to distinguish between the different textual components of rule f.although the word may gives the courts of appeals unfettered discretion,that discretion is only applicable to appeals from an order granting or denying certification.f.
we grant that there is some ambiguity in the amendments regarding the type of order that may be subject to interlocutory review under rule f.the advisory committee notes to the amendments to rule f provide 
the district court,having worked through the certification decision,often will be able to provide cogent advice on the factors that bear on the decision whether to permit appeal.this advice can be particularly valuable if the certification decision is tentative.even to a firm certification decision,a statement of reasons bearing on the probably sic benefits and costs of immediate appeal can help focus the court of appeals decision,and may persuade the disappointed party that an attempt to appeal would be fruitless.
f advisory committee notes amendments emphasis added.references to a tentative versus a firm certification decision may indicate to some that preliminary or conditional certification decisions are properly subject to interlocutory review.
although the advisory committee did not revise or cross reference these comments in the amendments to rule c,the text of rule f did not require such a revision.rule f is tied by reference to an order granting or denying certification.therefore,an order is only reviewable under f once a district judge has actually issued an order granting or denying class certification under rule c.as in the game itself,we do not have instant replay over all aspects of the parties progression prior to that point.official playing rules of the national football league,ed.no jurisdiction to review an official determination as to what down it is.
accordingly,any unfettered discretion held by the courts of appeals would be applicable to only an order granting or denying class certification no other type of rule order is covered by this provision.f advisory committee notes amendments emphasis added.any question of what the advisory committee might have meant when referencing tentative is meaningless considering that tentative or conditional certification orders are no longer permitted under rule c.
objectors fourth point is that we should evaluate a district court ruling on class certification that is likely erroneous.see newton,at.this position presumes that there is a ruling available to analyze,which there is not.that ruling is destined to be issued now that the district court has conducted the november,fairness hearing.the use of the phrase likely in newton can not be read to imply that we should anticipate how a district court might err based on a rule e preliminary determination of class certification.if such a reading of newton were given warrant,courts of appeals could meddle at will in the district courts careful and thoughtful management in reviewing class settlement agreements.
objectors final point also relies on newton and our statement that our discretion to grant interlocutory review may be based on any consideration we deem persuasive.see id.at.this argument continues to misconstrue newton as an answer to the open question before us precisely what qualifies as an order granting or denying certification see.f.although we may permit an appeal only from such an order,the discretion inherent in the word may can not undermine the fact that rule f pertains only to one type of order under rule.
as a final matter,both parties cite to the eighth circuit decision in liles del campo,cir,as supporting their respective positions.objectors argue that liles stands for the proposition that an interlocutory appeal of an order granting preliminary proposed or conditional certification may be permitted under rule f.this contention stretches the logic of liles.liles did not address the scope of the court of appeals jurisdiction under rule f.the eighth circuit held the following 
we conclude that an interlocutory appeal would be premature in this case.several steps remain before the district court finally approves class certification and any settlement.to permit an appeal at this stage would unnecessarily delay the resolution of the litigation and further jeopardize the limited assets available for resolving the claims.permission for an interlocutory appeal of the conditional class certification should therefore be denied.
id.at emphasis added.
objectors quote the liles court statement that an interlocutory appeal would be premature in this case,and argue that there may be some case presenting a conditional certification question that would properly be addressed under rule f.a reading of the full paragraph,however,reveals that the eighth circuit was hesitant to review a district court order that does not approve class certification and any settlement.id.as in this case,the liles litigation involved a joint motion for preliminary approval of a settlement agreement and for conditional class certification that resulted from settlement negotiations.id.at.the more sound reading of liles is that there is simply nothing for a court of appeals to review under rule f before the district court issues a certification order under rule c.objectors interpretation of liles is unpersuasive and the facts of this case present precisely the same problem,that there is nothing to review until the district court issues its certification order following the fairness hearing.
in sum,the district court order and memorandum pursuant to rule e that provided preliminary approval of the proposed class for settlement purposes only and explicitly reserved its certification order for a later date was not a certification order under rule c.accordingly,this court lacks jurisdiction over objectors petition.
because the district court has yet to issue an order granting or denying certification,we have dismissed the rule f petition for lack of jurisdiction by our order of september.
petitioners seek,under federal rule of civil procedure f,our review of judge brody conditional certification of a settlement class and subclasses as preliminarily satisfy ing the requirements of rule.in re football league players concussion injury.my colleagues dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction because they deem conditional orders as no longer proper under rule c,the only provision in rule directly concerning class certifications.as i believe rule f authorized and for sure nowhere limits in word or intent our review of the order judge brody entered,i would deny the petition for review because granting it would result in inefficient indeed,chaotic piecemeal litigation that would interfere with the formal fairness hearing on the settlement.though in either case petitioners lose,i dissent from my colleagues means to that end.
federal rule of civil procedure f,adopted in,states that a court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying certification under this rule if a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the circuit clerk within days after the order is entered.per the advisory committee note for this provision,permission is in the sole discretion of the court of appeals,which 
is given unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal,akin to the discretion exercised by the supreme court in acting on a petition for certiorari.
the district court,having worked through the certification decision,often will be able to provide cogent advice on the factors that bear on the decision whether to permit appeal.this advice can be particularly valuable if the certification decision is tentative.
f advisory committee notes amendments emphases added.
five years later,federal rule of civil procedure c was modified to eliminate class certifications that may be conditional on later proof that a proper class exists.thus a court that is not satisfied that the requirements of rule in effect,sections a and b have been met should refuse certification until they have been met.c advisory committee notes amendments.no change to section f occurred,nor was there any advisory committee comment as to the effect of the c change on section f.the blink response,both textual and logical,is that appellate courts still have unfettered discretion to review orders of any conditional especially so where a court is not satisfied that there exists what rule requires to certify a class or not.
the federal rules of civil procedure have as thorough a review process as any i know or can imagine.in practice,that process begins with the advisory committee on civil rules,which is comprised of civil procedure experts from the judiciary and academia and is advised by one or more reporters assigned to it.the advisory committee reviews suggestions for rules changes and drafts proposed new rules and rules amendments along with annotated notes of explanation.when the advisory committee decides to recommend an amendment,it seeks approval from the judicial conference committee on rules of practice and procedure the standing committee to publish a proposed amendment for comment from the bench,bar and public.the comment period lasts at least six months and includes public hearings.the advisory committee reviews the comments and hearing testimony,typically makes changes to the proposed rules if substantial,an additional period for notice and comment usually follows,and forwards those changes to the standing committee along with any minority views of advisory committee members.if the standing committee approves the proposals of the advisory committee,it forwards them to the judicial conference of the united states which includes at its head the chief justice of the united states along with the advisory committee report and the standing committee own recommendations.if approved by the judicial conference,and congress does not act otherwise,the rules go into effect.see how the rule making process works,overview for the bench,bar and public,united states courts.aspx last visited.what all this means is that experts on civil procedure review all content of the federal rules of civil procedure.it is the opposite of legislative history drafted two weeks after a floor amendment passes in congress.
in reviewing any civil rules dispute,a court intent is to follow the drafters intent.the latter is taken from a rule words and the accompanying advisory committee notes.as we know from reading the rules and their notes,little is left to the imagination.in this case,the text of rule f grants without restriction the authority to consider appeals from orders granting or denying class certification,and its advisory committee note makes clear the grant is so unconstrained that it is the equal of the discretion given the supreme court to grant certiorari.if,for example,an order certified a class without findings that rule requirements are met hence a conditional order,a court of appeals can rule that this is improper and deny the appeal.this is what our court did in hohider united parcel service,cir.
despite this,my colleagues think the change in to subsection c annuls the jurisdiction of an appellate court even to consider an appeal from a conditional order.their logic at base is that a change in to circumscribe rule c must intend a change to f such that no longer can there be appeals literally from an order granting class action certification,but only from an order issued pursuant to rule c.an order that preliminarily or conditionally addresses class certification but reserves the class certification determination for a later time,does not qualify as an order granting or denying certification that is subject to interlocutory review under rule f.op.at.in,the drafters somehow forgot to limit order in section f or to change the advisory committee note to that section.i can not go for this overstretch when the words of rule f are nowhere short of clear and the consequence is that a federal appellate court gives back jurisdiction given it by our rules drafters and those who must approve that grant.
a textualist one who seeks the meaning of a statute or regulation by reviewing its actual words without resort to extratextual sources begins with the text of rule f,and so does judge smith,a textualist.indeed,he claims here to rely on plain text.id.at.that ironic,as the rule direct text gives appellate courts the discretion to allow interlocutory appeals from orders.but,says judge smith,the type of order has yet to be addressed.id.at emphasis in text.only one subdivision within rule govern s certification orders rule c.id.though in it allowed district courts to certify a class conditionally,that authority,he believes,was taken away in when a district court was no longer permitted to issue a conditional certification.id.at citing hohider,at.
what is interesting in citing our decision in hohider is that there our court noted that it had jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal involving,among other things,an improper conditional certification of a class under.f.at.despite the amendment to rule c,in we had the appellate authority to tell a district court that it may not certify a class conditionally.my colleagues acknowledge this by their statement that hohider held that the trial court conditional certification was improper.op.at emphases added quoting hohider,at.
the exercise of jurisdiction over a conditional certification is what our second circuit colleagues did as well in denney deutsche bank ag,cir,though there the court went further to hold that conditional certification survives the amendment to rule c,id.at.the eighth circuit also did not question its jurisdiction to review a conditional certification order in liles del campo,cir.i note that the eighth circuit opinion in liles issued only the day after the amendments to rule c went into effect,and the court did not address directly its jurisdiction.that said,the proposed changes to c were in circulation many months before they were effective.
so how,five years after hohider,can our court pronounce that we have no jurisdiction here is my colleagues take.judge brody order that,in her words,conditionally certified the proposed settlement class and subclasses was not issued pursuant to rule c.instead,she exercised her authority under rule e which covers settlement procedures for class action settlements and was managing a settlement agreement.op.at.however,as t he exact process a district court should follow when presented with a settlement class is not prescribed by rule e,id.at,the manual for complex litigation ed is consulted even though my colleagues concede it 
does not have the force of law and can not undermine decisions of this court.in re pharmacy benefit managers antitrust,cir see also manual for complex litigation,introduction explaining that the manual should not be cited as authoritative legal or administrative policy,the federal judicial center has no authority to prescribe practices for federal judges,and t he manual recommendations and suggestions are merely that.
notwithstanding these statements to the contrary,id.at id.at,my colleagues in effect move the manual above the rule and its commentary.they do so as follows.section of the manual provides that the certification hearing and preliminary fairness evaluation can usually be combined.in doing so,t he judge should make a preliminary determination that the proposed class satisfies the criteria set out in rule a and at least one of the subsections of rule b.op.at quoting manual for complex litigation emphasis added in quote.calling this a case management technique,id.at,to ensure notice to absentee class members,t he preliminary analysis of a proposed class is therefore a tool for settlement.id.emphasis in text.
what all this has to do with rule f is unclear.id.at.but there is an interplay between subdivision c,e,and f of rule,and my colleagues emphasize that a district court should be fastidious in its choice of language when making a preliminary determination as recommended by of the manual.id.at emphasis added.
what the point to be clear conditional certification should not be a preferred term of art in this circuit.district courts should not couch a ruling as providing conditional certification when they actually intend to issue a certification order at a later date.id.at.our court,though it does not have the jurisdiction to tell judge brody that her conditional certification is not the right call sign,nonetheless in several pages of dicta tells her so.
my take on my colleagues reasoning is,to quote the late hollywood film producer samuel goldwyn,include me out.here why.our highly experienced and respected district court colleague knew exactly what she was doing.judge brody conditionally certified a class and subclasses for settlement purposes only.in re football league players concussion injury,at.she did so after analyzing the requirements of rule a and b,id.at,and found that the proposed settlement class and subclasses preliminarily satisf ied those requirements,id.at.this was not the type of premature and unanalyzed approval of a litigation class that rule c meant to bar because conditional certifications of litigation classes give inordinate leverage to plaintiffs class counsel to force a settlement not called for under closer scrutiny.rather,judge brody,after satisfying herself that the relevant rule a and b requirements were met,provisionally certified a class already set to settle once that settlement is found to be fair at a later hearing.indeed,she gave preliminary approval of the proposed settlement after making a preliminary fairness evaluation of it.id.at.that certification was needed to know to whom notice and the settlement should be sent.the use of conditional in this context is thus not verboten under subsection c.indeed,conditional certifications for settlement classes continue after.see denney,at see also ault walt disney world,cir noting the use of conditional certification by the district court.
even if we assume judge brody used conditional incorrectly,an error in the class certification decision that does not implicate novel or unsettled legal questions may still merit interlocutory review given the consequences likely to ensue w e emphasize that the courts of appeals have been afforded the authority to grant or deny rule f petitions on the basis of any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir quoting.f advisory committee notes amendments.
my colleagues and i can agree that appellate courts should be reluctant to review orders on an interlocutory basis.to me that is enough.to go so far further by holding that we lack even the power to do so here is a bridge too far especially in the wake of hohider and no other circuit after finding its jurisdiction lost for interlocutory appeals of conditional class certifications.there is no support for ceding jurisdiction in the words of rule f,the advisory committee note for that section,or subsection c.to seek that support in the manual for complex litigation,which tells us it is not to be cited as authority,complexifies what is simple appellate courts have unfettered discretion to consider any order that grants or denies certification.those certification orders were circumscribed in to ones that require more careful attention to the requirements of rule a and b.that occurred without any change to the unconstrained review of certification orders given to appellate courts only five years earlier.hence rule c does not bleach out the simple and direct words of rule f.
if rule f appellate jurisdiction is to be limited,it must come from its drafters amid the approval process in place.in the meantime,not to follow the words of rules in place substitutes us as their drafters and makers of policy.as that is too active a role for a court,i respectfully dissent.
on september,we entered the following order the foregoing petition of objecting class members pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f for leave to appeal from the district court order granting settlement class certification is denied.the court will issue an opinion in this matter at a later time.this opinion provides the rationale for our order.
various plaintiffs also brought suit against a helmet manufacturer,riddell,and several of its affiliated entities collectively riddell defendants.the riddell defendants are not parties to the settlement at issue in this pending rule f petition.
on july,the district court directed the parties to mediation before a retired district judge.on august,the parties signed a term sheet incorporating the principal terms of a settlement.
the revised settlement created several avenues for compensation a a baseline assessment program fund of up to to offer retired nfl football players one baseline neuropsychological and neurological examination to identify any neurological defects,id.at b an uncapped monetary awards fund to provide payment of cash monetary awards and derivative claimant awards to retired nfl football players diagnosed with a qualifying diagnosis and their representative and derivative claimants,id.at and c a education fund to support education about cognitive impairment,safety,and injury prevention with regard to football players,id.at.
the three types of claimants include all living nfl football players who,prior to the date of the preliminary approval and class certification order,retired,formally or informally,from playing professional football with the nfl or any member club,including american football league,world league of american football,nfl europe league and nfl europa league players,or were formerly on any roster,including preseason,regular season,or postseason of any such member club or league and who no longer are under contract to a member club and are not seeking active employment as players with any member club,whether signed to a roster or signed to any practice squad,developmental squad,or taxi squad of a member club retired nfl football players authorized representatives,ordered by a court or other official of competent jurisdiction under applicable state law,of deceased or legally incapacitated or incompetent retired nfl football players representative claimants and spouses,parents,children who are dependents or any other person who properly under applicable state law assert the right to sue independently or derivatively by reason of their relationship with a retired nfl football player or deceased retired nfl football player derivative claimants.id.at.the two subclasses of the settlement class consist of the following retired nfl football players who were not diagnosed with a qualifying diagnosis prior to the date of the preliminary approval and class certification order and their representative claimants and derivative claimants and,retired nfl football players who were diagnosed with a qualifying diagnosis prior to the date of the preliminary approval and class certification order and their representative claimants and derivative claimants,and the representative claimants of deceased retired nfl football players who were diagnosed with a qualifying diagnosis prior to death or who died prior to the date of the preliminary approval and class certification order and who received a diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.id.at footnote omitted.because we do not address the merits of objectors arg
