background 
fantasy is the assignee of the patent,which relates to a method of and apparatus for playing a fantasy football game on a computer.patent.the game is played by a number of owners or managers who operate fantasy teams or franchises based on actual football players.points are awarded to each team based upon the performance of its players in actual professional football games for categories such as touchdowns,field goals,and points after touchdowns pats.the total points for each team are tabulated utilizing a database containing the relevant statistics for each player,which is automatically updated after the actual football games are played each week.the specification teaches that in addition to the standard points given for a particular play in an actual game,bonus points may be awarded based upon,inter alia,the difficulty of the play.id.at.
claim of the patent is the only independent claim at issue,and it reads as follows 
a computer for playing football based upon actual football games,comprising 
means for setting up individual football franchises 
means for drafting actual football players into said franchises 
means for selecting starting player rosters from said actual football players 
means for trading said actual football players 
means for scoring performances of said actual football players based upon actual game scores such that franchises automatically calculate a composite win or loss score from a total of said individual actual football players scores 
said players scores are for quarterbacks,running backs and pass receivers in a first group and kickers in a second group and 
wherein said players in said first and second groups receive bonus points.
id.at,emphasis added.the claim interpretation dispute in this appeal centers around the bonus points limitation.
fantasy filed suit against the defendants alleging that the defendants computerized fantasy football games infringed the patent fantasy i,d at.filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement,arguing that its sports fantasy football game does not satisfy the bonus points limitation.id.the district court interpreted the bonus points limitation to mean points that are awarded in addition to the normal points for a scoring play,id.at,and determined that fantasy disclaimed any game that awards additional points for distance scoring and total yardage by amending claim to add the bonus points limitation in order to overcome a rejection based upon a prior art publication entitled the article,id.at.based on that construction,the court granted summary judgment that product does not infringe the patent as a matter of law because,except for the additional points awarded based on yardage,it only awards points equal to the points given in an actual professional football game.id.at.
espn and sportsline thereafter filed separate motions for summary judgment of noninfringement based on the claim construction set forth in fantasy i.the court clarified its previous construction of the term bonus points to mean additional points,above and beyond standard scoring,that are based upon the difficulty of the play,for scoring plays not typically associated with the position of the scoring player.fantasy ii,slip op.at.the court then determined that espn fantasy football game did not infringe as a matter of law because that product does not award additional points for scoring,a running back throwing a touchdown pass.id.at.the court also granted summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to sportsline fantasy football and football challenge games because it determined that those products awarded additional points based only upon yardage.id.at.finally,the court determined that sportsline product could not directly infringe because it found that the is not a fantasy football game,but rather is a software tool by which subscribers operate their own fantasy football leagues on customized internet web pages.id.at.the court also rejected fantasy contributory infringement argument because it determined that fantasy failed to prove that any subscriber actually operated the in an infringing manner.id.at.
thereafter filed a motion for attorney fees and costs.the district court denied motion because it determined that failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that this case was exceptional within the meaning of.fantasy iii,slip op.at.the court reasoned that although fantasy applied a flawed,overly expansive interpretation of the scope of the patent to fantasy football products,its allegations were not so frivolous as to constitute a rule violation.id.at.

claim construction 
fantasy argues that the bonus points limitation should be broadly construed to cover any points awarded in addition to those given in an actual football game.fantasy contends that the plain meaning of the term bonus is anything given in addition to the customary or required amount,and that nothing in claim limits that term to any specific type of additional points.fantasy also argues that it did not disclaim coverage of all the bonus points discussed in the article because it distinguished that reference during prosecution on the grounds that it did not utilize a computer and did not disclose the combination of awarding bonus points and using two separate groups of players for scoring purposes.fantasy further contends that the specification makes clear that the term bonus points includes plays,such as total yardage,because it states that b onus points are awarded based upon the difficulty of the play,not the scoring play.finally,fantasy argues that the doctrine of claim differentiation dictates that a broader construction must be given to claim because claim limits the definition of the term bonus points to complex or difficult plays,and claim defines that limitation in terms of specific examples,extra points for a quarterback who receives or runs for a touchdown.
the defendants respond that the term bonus points means additional points awarded beyond those given in an actual football game for scoring plays in which a player scores out of position.the defendants argue that the prosecution history clearly shows that the examiner interpreted the bonus points limitation to exclude the scoring methods disclosed in the article,and that fantasy acquiesced in that interpretation,thus surrendering a broader meaning for that term.the defendants also contend that,reading the specification as a whole,it is apparent that the plays that qualify for bonus points are scoring plays,and that therefore the bonus points limitation does not include points awarded for total yardage or any other statistic.finally,the defendants argue that the doctrine of claim differentiation must yield where,as here,the specification and prosecution history clearly define the scope of the invention.
we conclude that the term bonus points is limited to additional points awarded beyond those given in an actual football game for unusual scoring plays,such as when a player scores in a manner not typically associated with his position.t he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and accustomed meaning,unless it appears from the specification or the file history that they were used differently by the inventor.carroll touch,electro mech.the specification states that c omputerized football points are awarded for touchdowns,field goals,and points after touchdowns.bonus points are also awarded based upon the difficulty of the play.patent,emphases added.the term bonus points therefore must be construed to mean points that are awarded for a scoring play in addition to the points given for that scoring play in an actual football game.
furthermore,the prosecution history in this case clearly demonstrates that fantasy surrendered any interpretation of the term bonus points that encompasses the methodologies taught in the article for awarding additional points beyond those given in an actual football game.in the application that eventually led to the patent,fantasy set forth a number of claims that did not include the bonus points limitation and cited the article as prior art in an information disclosure statement.the article discloses the concept of fantasy football and teaches how to organize a fantasy football game played on paper.that article also details a number of scoring methods that may be utilized in tabulating the total points for each fantasy franchise,including but not limited to assigning points for distance scoring and total yardage.the examiner rejected all but three of the claims in fantasy application over,inter alia,the article,and in doing so made a number of comments relevant to this appeal.first,the examiner noted that the u se of a computer to store data previously maintained on paper files is well known.paper at.the examiner also stated that grouping players is obvious since running backs and pass receivers form the offensive line,special teams line backers and defensive backs form the defensive line and kickers perform kickoffs and field goals,functions which differ from that of both offensive and defensive teams.id.at.finally,and most significant to the present appeal,the examiner rejected application claim,which incorporated the computer and grouping limitations by reference and added the further limitation that additional points are awarded based upon the number of yards that were involved in the play that received a touchdown,because the article discusses the use of a distance scoring method in which player scores are a function of the length of the play.id.at.the examiner,however,also stated that claims,the only claims that contained the bonus points limitation at issue,are found allowable over the article since the examiner fails to find reference to the award of bonus points for players of first and second groups in the prior art.id.at.fantasy,without comment,rewrote application claims in independent form as suggested by the examiner,and those claims subsequently issued as claims of the patent.
contrary to fantasy argument on appeal,the examiner found that the use of a computer to play fantasy football games and the organization of players in a first and second group were either known in the art or obvious therefrom.the examiner rejection of claim also demonstrates that he found the combination of one or more of those limitations with fantasy broad interpretation of the term bonus points to be unpatentable.fantasy acquiesced in those rejections by canceling all claims that did not contain the bonus points limitation at issue on appeal,and thus can not now be heard to argue post hoc that it was the combination of the aforementioned limitations that rendered its invention patentable over the prior art.fantasy therefore disclaimed any interpretation of the term bonus points that encompasses scoring methods described in the article,including distance scoring and total yardage.see southwall,cardinal ig,the prosecution history limits the interpretation of claim terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution.citations omitted.
fantasy argument that the specification broadly defines the term bonus points to include plays,such as total yardage,is not persuasive.aside from the fact that the prosecution history defines the contours of the bonus points limitation,the portion of the specification cited by fantasy must be read in context.the sentence b onus points also are awarded based upon the difficulty of the play,id.at ii.emphasis added,uses the word play in the context of the preceding sentence.that sentence states that points are awarded for touchdowns,field goals,and points after touchdowns,id.at ii,all of which are scoring plays.moreover,the specification makes clear elsewhere that only certain types of unusual plays are encompassed within the bonus points limitation,including,when a quarterback receives a pass or runs for a touchdown,patent,ii.when a running back throw s or receive s a touchdown pass,id.at ii.when a wide receiver pass es the ball or run s for a touchdown,id.at ii.when a fumble result s in a touchdown,id.at ii.or when a lateral recover y is made in the end zone,id.accordingly,in light of the specification and the prosecution history,we interpret the bonus points limitation to mean additional points awarded beyond those given in an actual football game for unusual scoring plays,such as when a player scores in a manner not typically associated with his position.
finally,fantasy claim differentiation argument is without merit.the doctrine of claim differentiation creates only a presumption that each claim in a patent has a different scope that can not broaden claims beyond their correct scope.kraft foods,int l trading,citation omitted.although claims and attempt to further define the term bonus points,that presumption is overcome by fantasy disclaimer of subject matter in the prosecution history.see id.at,at determining that any presumption arising from the doctrine of claim differentiation was overcome by the written description and prosecution history.consequently,the bonus points limitation must be given the same scope in all of the claims of the patent.
we therefore conclude that the bonus points limitation must be construed to mean additional points awarded beyond those given in an actual football game for unusual scoring plays,such as when a player scores in a manner not typically associated with his position.
infringement 
although most of fantasy infringement argument on appeal depends upon its proposed construction of the bonus points limitation,fantasy argues that genuine issues of material fact exist that preclude entry of summary judgment of noninfringement as to each of the defendants products even under the district court claim construction.because our interpretation of the term bonus points differs slightl
