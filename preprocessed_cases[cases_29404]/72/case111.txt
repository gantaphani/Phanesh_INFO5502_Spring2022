plaintiff appellant bruce matthews played professional football for years.when he retired in,he was employed by the tennessee titans.in,he filed a workers compensation claim in california,alleging that he suffered pain and disability from injuries incurred during his career as a professional football player.
matthews asks us to vacate an arbitration award that prohibits him from pursuing workers compensation benefits under california law.he contends that the award violates california public policy barring contractual waiver of workers compensation benefits and federal labor policy providing that an employment agreement may not preempt state minimum labor standards.matthews also argues that the award is in manifest disregard of the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution.
we hold that matthews has not alleged sufficient contacts with california to show that his workers compensation claim comes within the scope of california workers compensation regime.he has therefore not met his burden of establishing that the arbitration award prohibiting him from pursuing california benefits violates an explicit,and dominant public policy of the state of california.because matthews has not shown that the award deprives him of something to which he is entitled under state law,he likewise has not shown that it violates federal labor policy.nor has matthews established that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the full faith and credit clause.we accordingly affirm the district court order confirming the arbitration award.
background 
matthews played football in the national football league nfl from to,first for the houston oilers and later for its successor teams,the tennessee oilers and the tennessee titans titans.he retired in.in,matthews filed for workers compensation benefits in california.matthews claimed pain and disability resulting from injuries incurred while he was employed by the nfl at various locations over years of playing and practicing professional football.he did not allege that he sustained any particular injury in california.
the titans and the national football league management council nflmc filed a grievance against matthews.they argued that by applying for workers compensation benefits in california,matthews breached his employment agreement,which provided that all workers compensation claims would be decided under tennessee law they sought to prevent matthews from pursuing his workers compensation claim in california.pursuant to a binding arbitration clause in the nfl collective bargaining agreement,the parties arbitrated their dispute.
the arbitrator found that the choice of law clause in matthews contract constituted a promise to resolve workers compensation claims under tennessee law and that by pursuing workers compensation under california law,matthews was in violation of the agreement.the arbitrator ordered matthews to cease and desist from seeking california benefits.matthews filed suit in federal district court to vacate the arbitration award.see carter health net of,cir recognizing that the labor management relations act lmra creates federal question jurisdiction over petitions to confirm or vacate arbitration awards.
in january,the district court denied matthews motion to vacate the arbitration award and granted the titans and the nflmc to confirm the award.matthews appealed.

matthews argues that the arbitration award here contravenes california workers compensation policy and federal labor policy.we address each argument in turn.
california public policy 
matthews contends that california has an explicit,and dominant public policy militating against agreements that purport to waive an employee right to seek california workers compensation benefits before a california tribunal,no matter how tenuous the connection between california and the employee or the employment.matthews derives this no waiver policy primarily from the california workers compensation statute,see cal.labor code no contract,rule,or regulation shall exempt the employer from liability for the compensation fixed by the workers compensation statute.id.any contract or agreement,express or implied,made by any employee to waive the benefits of this article or any part thereof,is null and void,and the decision of the california supreme court in alaska packers ass industrial accident commission,cal d,cal,which held that the statutory predecessor to of the california labor code barred an employer from using a contractual choice of law clause to prevent an employee from receiving workers compensation benefits under california law.matthews contends that by prohibiting him from seeking benefits under california law,the arbitration award violates this fundamental policy.
we do not read california policy so broadly.rather than guarantee a universal right to seek california workers compensation benefits,the workers compensation statute establishes a rule that an employee who is otherwise eligible for california benefits can not be deemed to have contractually waived those benefits,and an employer who is otherwise liable for california benefits can not evade liability through contract.see cal.labor code a providing that employers are liable for injuries to their employees only when,among other things,at the time of the injury,both the employer and the employee are subject to the compensation provisions of this division id.no contract,rule,or regulation shall exempt the employer from liability for the compensation fixed by this division emphasis added id.any contract or agreement,express or implied,made by any employee to waive the benefits of this article or any part thereof,is null and void emphasis added.the no waiver rule applies only when an employee workers compensation claim is subject to california law.
our reading of the statute is consistent with alaska packers.there,an employee applied for workers compensation under california law despite a choice of law clause in his employment agreement,which provided that the parties would resolve workers compensation disputes under alaska law.see alaska packers ass n,cal d at.the california supreme court concluded that the choice of law clause was unenforceable under the statutory predecessor to,but only after finding that the employment relationship in question had sufficient contacts with california to apply california workers compensation law.see id.at,holding that employment relationships entered into in california were subject to california workers compensation laws,under which a contract attempting to avoid the liability imposed by the workers compensation act was invalid.see also pac.emp rs ins.indus.accident comm n,cal d,cal holding that an employee who resided in massachusetts,entered into
