the death last month of race car legend dale earnhardt at the daytona was tragic,but not unpredictable.indeed,the sport of automobile racing is a hazardous activity,and drivers on the nascar circuit know very well that they risk life and limb every time they get into a race.the same can be said,though to a lesser degree,to be sure,of go kart racers.as karts have become faster and more maneuverable,the sport has matured from little more than child play to a rather dangerous activity.although the risks of negotiating a race course at high speeds in a vehicle that offers little protection seem obvious,organizers of go kart races have adopted the practice of requiring participants to sign a release flagging those risks and waiving claims arising from injuries sustained during a race.in this case we confront the question of whether such a release can be enforced against a racer who likely was aware of the requirement that she execute it,but somehow participated in the race without doing so.
first,a little bit of background.in july of,plaintiff dorothy beaver participated in the annual elkhart grand prix,a series of go kart races held in elkhart,indiana.during the event in which she drove,a piece of polyurethane foam padding used as a course barrier was torn from its base and ended up on the track.one portion of the padding struck beaver in the head,and another portion was thrown into oncoming traffic,causing a collision during which beaver sustained severe injuries.in beaver and her husband stacy filed this diversity action against the race organizers grand prix karting association,national kart news,and curt paluzzi and the manufacturers of the foam padding foamcraft,and,by later amendment,foamex international,and foamex which the beavers claimed was defective.the race organizers denied the material allegations of the included counts alleging willful and wanton conduct,misrepresentation and concealment,and failure to asserted the affirmative defense that beaver executed a valid and proper release and indemnification agreement.
much to the race organizers chagrin,discovery revealed that the release upon which they relied was executed by beaver prior to the elkhart grand prix,a race in which she participated one year before her accident.a search for a release executed by beaver for the race turned up nothing.despite this major setback,the race organizers pressed on with a motion for summary judgment,arguing the evidence demonstrated beaver had executed a release applicable to the race notwithstanding their inability to find it and,even if she had not executed such a release,her actions manifested her intention to be bound by its terms.
either of the race organizers arguments,if successful,would substantially relieve them of liability and obviate further proceedings on the merits of certain of beaver claims.but both arguments depended on disputed issues of fact and thus were inappropriate for resolution at the summary judgment stage.the district judge recognized this and,in a commendable effort to avoid wasting scarce judicial resources,empaneled a jury to resolve the limited issues of whether beaver executed a release applicable to the race and,if not,whether her actions,combined with her knowledge that go kart events customarily require drivers to execute releases,indicated a willingness to be bound in any event.
at the trial,beaver testified that she had participated in a number of go kart races since taking up the sport in,that many of these races required her to execute a release in order to participate,and that she had never refused to sign one.beaver acknowledged her signature on the release for the elkhart grand prix but could not remember executing a fresh copy at registration for the race.although she participated in the race,and a photograph of her taken prior to the race shows her wearing a wristband she received at race registration,beaver remembers nothing about the race due to the injuries she sustained.
paluzzi,the race promoter,testified for the defense.he stated that all participants in the race were required to sign a release,identical to the one used in,as part of the registration process.paluzzi confirmed that beaver had and checked in at the race site.it was never brought to paluzzi attention that anyone refused to sign the release,and if anyone had done so,he or she would not have been permitted to race.paluzzi admitted,however,that he had searched far and wide for beaver release before coming up dry.in addition,paluzzi admitted that several race officials who entered a restricted area,the track,pit,and other potentially dangerous areas covered by the release had not executed releases.
paluzzi testimony was corroborated by several other race officials who testified that race policy required a release and that they could conceive of no way a racer could complete registration without executing one.at least two of these individuals admitted that they did not sign releases themselves,however,despite the fact that they entered restricted areas.finally,the race organizers called a host of witnesses who testified that in the dozens or hundreds of races in which they had participated,a release was always required.
beaver mother,father,and go kart racers by deposition.although her mother could remember no race that did not require a release,her father and brother each named certain events that permitted drivers to race without executing a release.none of beaver family members had ever refused to sign a release when asked.in addition,an acquaintance of beaver named van dorn testified that he had gone to registration with beaver,and that neither she,her brother,nor van dorn had signed a release.
at the conclusion of the evidence,judge allen sharp submitted two questions to the jury 
did dorothy beaver sign the release and waiver of liability and indemnity agreement for the elkhart grand prix 
did dorothy beaver,by her actions in participating in the elkhart grand prix,agree to the terms of the release and waiver of liability and indemnity agreement for the elkhart grand prix 
the jury answered no to the first question and yes to the second.based on the jury determination that beaver had agreed to be bound by the terms of the release,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the race organizers.beaver appeals 
beaver raises a host of alleged errors committed by the district court,but her primary argument is that she may be bound by the release only if she expressly agreed to its terms.see fresh cut,fazli,stating in dicta that liability may be limited by an exculpatory clause or an express agreement to assume the risk emphasis added,vacated in part on other grounds.an express agreement,according to the sixth edition of black law dictionary,is one that is m anifested by direct and appropriate language,as distinguished from that which is inferred from conduct.as the jury found and the race organizers do not dispute on appeal,beaver never executed a release applicable to the race.and there is no evidence that she ever orally indicated her assent to be bound by its terms.accordingly,beaver argues,the district court had no legal basis to submit the second interrogatory to the jury,and the jury answer to that interrogatory must be vacated as a matter of law.
notwithstanding the dicta in fresh cut implying that an exculpatory agreement is invalid absent an express agreement to its terms,indiana courts repeatedly have held that assent to a that,in essence,is what a release be established by acts which manifest acceptance.in herald telephone fatouros,for example,the court held that the defendant newspaper had formed a contract to print an advertisement by accepting a proposed copy of the advertisement along with payment.although the newspaper never expressly promised to print the advertisement,its actions unequivocally manifested its intent to accept the advertiser offer to contract.id.at.such a manifestation or expression of assent necessary to form a contract may be by work,act,or conduct which evinces the intention of the parties to contract.calumet motor sales of hammond,cooper builders,quoting d contracts.
