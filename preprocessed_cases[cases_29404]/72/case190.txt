plaintiff factual allegations 
on april,plaintiff attended a kings hockey game at the forum.during the warm ups,several pucks were in play on the ice.plaintiff had a,season ticket seat but could not see the ice because there were more people congregating around her area than she had ever seen before.no ushers asked the crowd to go to their proper seats as required.plaintiff tried folding up her seat and sitting on the edge to obtain a clear view,but still could not see over the crowd the venue had allowed to form around and in front of her.plaintiff was perplexed and distracted by the fact that she had never seen such a crowd form around her at any previous hockey game she had attended.she was unsure what to do about the situation.ultimately,a puck did fly off the ice.plaintiff was unable to see the puck come off the ice,heading directly toward her she was unable to take evasive action.the hockey puck struck plaintiff in the mouth and face,causing severe injuries.
plaintiff theory of liability is that defendants were negligent in failing to prevent the spectators from milling around the ice during warm ups the suit was based on the fact that defendants,by allowing a crowd to form and to remain in an area where they were not supposed to be congregating,increased the normal risk inherent in attending a hockey game,while a puck leaving the ice might be a normal risk of attending a game,that risk was significantly increased by allowing the spectators views to be blocked so that they could not see the puck coming,and take evasive action.
due to the risk of hockey pucks leaving the ice during play,the forum requires the usher staff to prevent latecomers from blocking the view of seated guests.the forum handbook for ushers and ticket takers states in part during game action you must stop latecomers from blocking the view of seated guests.politely request all ticket holders to stand along the back wall loge or the base of the stairway collonade until there is a stoppage of play.following a whistle,instruct guests to quickly take their seats.all portals are to be kept clear.the handbook also states approach people congregating around your section.ask them if you can provide assistance in helping them find their seats.politely remind them that no one may stand or congregate in or at the top of the aisles.the handbook further provides one of the primary functions of the guest services department is protecting the personal safety of all our guests the safety of our guests and staff must be a constant concern of all of our employees.be aware of all physical conditions in your work area at all times.report any problems immediately to your supervisor or building staff.
plaintiff expert witness on security and crowd control,forrest franklin,believes defendants failure to observe proper crowd control procedures during the warm ups fell below the standard of care for ice hockey rinks.
the nonsuit ruling 
standard of review 
a defendant is entitled to a nonsuit only if a trial court determines,as a matter of law,the plaintiff evidence is insufficient to sustain a verdict.code civ.in determining the sufficiency of the plaintiff evidence,the trial court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the court must accept as true the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff,and disregard any conflicting evidence.santa barbara pistachio ranch chowchilla water dist.th,d.
knight jewett 
in,the california supreme court examined the proper application of the assumption of risk doctrine in light of this court adoption of comparative fault principles in li yellow cab cal d,knight jewett,supra,cal th at,d.knight held that as between participants in a touch football game,recovery for a personal injury suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant careless or negligent behavior in knocking her over,stepping on her hand,and injuring her finger,was barred under the primary assumption of risk doctrine.id.at,d.the court noted that the defendant conduct was not reckless or so outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in playing touch football so as to breach any legal duty of care owed to the plaintiff.ibid.knight held that a participant in an active sport breaches a legal duty of care to other,engages in conduct that properly may subject him or her to financial if the participant intentionally injures another player or engages in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in that sport.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
as the court in knight noted,earlier decisions had also applied the assumption of the risk defense to other contact injuries caused by the ordinary negligence of other players,under an inherent risk theory in some situations,the careless conduct of others is treated as an inherent risk of a sport,thus barring recovery by the plaintiff.for example,numerous cases recognize that in a game of baseball,a player generally can not recover if he or she is hit and injured by a carelessly thrown ball see,mann nutrilite,d,and that in a game of basketball,recovery is not permitted for an injury caused by a carelessly extended elbow see,thomas barlow.knight jewett,supra,cal th at,d.
knight also recognized that,due to the inherent risk of injury,courts have also exempted sporting venues from the duty to eliminate conditions or conduct that otherwise might be viewed as dangerous,but are an integral part of the sport itself.in this regard,knight stated as a general rule,persons have a duty to use due care to avoid injury to others,and may be held liable if their careless conduct injures another person.see.thus,for example,a property owner ordinarily is required to use due care to eliminate dangerous conditions on his or her property.see,rowland christian cal d,in the sports setting,however,conditions or conduct that otherwise might be viewed as dangerous often are an integral part of the sport itself.thus,although moguls on a ski run pose a risk of harm to skiers that might not exist were these configurations removed,the challenge and risks posed by the moguls are part of the sport of skiing,and a ski resort has no duty to eliminate them.see generally annot.in this respect,the nature of a sport is highly relevant in defining the duty of care owed by the particular defendant.although defendants generally have no legal duty to eliminate or protect a plaintiff against risks inherent in the sport itself,it is well established that defendants generally do have a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport.thus,although a ski resort has no duty to remove moguls from a ski run,it clearly does have a duty to use due care to maintain its towropes in a safe,working condition so as not to expose skiers to an increased risk of harm.the cases establish that the latter type of risk,posed by a ski resort negligence,clearly is not a risk inherent in the sport that is assumed by a participant.citation.knight jewett,supra,cal th at,d.
inherent risks to spectators posed by flying bats,balls,and pucks 
california courts have long held that the risk to spectators of being hit by an accidentally thrown bat or a foul ball is an inherent risk of baseball that is assumed by the spectator.see,quinn recreation park cal d,o ne of the natural risks assumed by spectators attending professional games is that of being struck by batted or thrown balls.while the stadium owes no duty to insure spectators against injury from flying bats or balls,the stadium must exercise ordinary care to protect spectators from such injuries.ibid.according to the california supreme court,the stadium is not obliged to screen all seats,because,as pointed out by the decisions,many patrons prefer to sit where their view is not obscured by a screen.moreover,the management is not required to provide screened seats for all who may apply for them.the duty imposed by law is performed when screened seats are provided for as many as may be reasonably expected to call for them on any ordinary occasion citations and if a spectator chooses to occupy an unscreened seat,or is unable to secure a screened seat and consequently occupies one that is not protected,he assumes the risk of being struck by thrown or batted balls and if injured thereby is precluded from recovering damages therefor ibid.
after quinn,intermediate appellate courts initially differentiated between the common knowledge of the risk of injury to spectators at baseball games versus ice hockey games.unlike the injured spectator in quinn whose action was defeated by motion for directed verdict based on the assumption of the risk defense,the actions of two injured ice hockey spectators were not barred,as a matter of law,by the assumption of the risk defense.in thurman ice palace d,the court reversed a directed verdict for the defendant ice rink,concluding the plaintiff spectator was entitled to a trial on whether the defendant had negligently failed to provide warnings or screens to protect against flying pucks.thurman distinguished quinn,the baseball case,stating it is not common knowledge that pucks used in ice hockey games are liable to be batted into the section occupied by the spectators.indeed,the puck is ordinarily batted along the surface of the ice,but in a baseball game the ball is ordinarily batted into the air rather than along the surface of the playing field.thurman,at.
ten years after thurman,the defendant ice rink in shurman fresno ice rink d,argued that the thurman decision was in,and since that time over persons have seen ice hockey games and should be familiar with the method of playing it and should assume the risk,as is ordinarily done by occupants of baseball bleachers.citation.id.at.while the appellate court in shurman granted a new trial to permit the ice rink to show that its warning signs and safety netting were sufficient to absolve it of liability,the court refused to absolve the ice rink of liability,as a matter of law,under the assumption of the risk defense,stating i t can not be held,as a matter of law,that the general public has,at this particular date,become so familiar with the hazards of this sport and of the actual appreciation of the seriousness of the risk as to bring them within the common knowledge rule and under the doctrine of assumption of risk.citations.id.at.
more than years have elapsed since the thurman and shurman decisions,during which professional ice hockey has grown in popularity both in california and nationally.in the present case,it is undisputed that ice hockey spectators face a known risk of being hit by a flying puck.plaintiff concedes there is a risk of hockey pucks leaving the ice during play in addition,plaintiff makes no contention that any player was negligent in hitting the puck into the stands.
defendants duty to plaintiff 
cognizant of the inherent risk to spectators of being hit by a flying puck,plaintiff states in her opening brief that she did not contend that defendants had any legal duty to keep pucks from flying off the ice.she did,however,contend that defendants had a duty to eliminate those risks which could be eliminated or minimized without negatively impacting play such as making sure spectators had an unobstructed view of the ice so that they could protect themselves in the event a puck did leave the ice during play plaintiff argued that,while the risk of a hockey puck leaving the ice might be inherent in the game the risk of people with bad tickets sneaking down close to the ice,blocking spectators views,and not being removed by is not an inherent risk of attending a professional hockey game.
obstructions of view caused by the unpredictable movements of other fans are an inherent and unavoidable part of attending a sporting event.views are blocked whenever fans spontaneously leap to their feet or move to and from their seats.
in this case,plaintiff contends an unusually large number of people were milling around in front of the ice,blocking her view.she emphasizes that she is not complaining about a single hot dog vendor walking by,or a lone fan standing up to cheer.instead,she states,a huge crowd of fans was crammed into the aisles down near the front of the ice rink,where her assigned seat was located thus,there is a strong inference that the people blocking plaintiff view of the ice were not actually assigned to the seating area where they were congregating,if the seats were all occupied,those seats could not have belonged to the people congregating near the rink around plaintiff.she claims there was nowhere around her for this mass of fans to sit down the seats were full people were all standing in the aisle they were blocking her view in all directions.there were even people standing in her own ticketed seats,and she had to shoo them away.
plaintiff concedes that while it may be unreasonable to expect defendants to keep every single spectator perfectly seated at all times,o r to prevent someone from getting up for a moment to go to the rest room,defendants can and should be required to prevent a huge crowd of people from congregating in and around the aisles down near the front of the arena,directly between the ice and the other spectators,while hockey pucks are in play.
as far as we are aware,however,no court has imposed a legal duty upon an athletic team,sports league,or sports arena to prevent large crowds of spectators,during warm ups,from congregating in the aisles near the front of the arena,or from blocking the views of seated spectators.we know of no published decision in which tort liability was upheld based upon the injured spectator alleged inability to evade a flying bat,ball,or puck during warm ups due to the defendants breach of its duty to prevent other fans from obstructing the plaintiff view.
plaintiff contends that if we impose upon defendants the duty to prevent large crowds of fans from congregating in front of the ice during warm ups,whether the breach of that duty was the legal cause of her injury is a jury question.according to plaintiff,the trial court erred in concluding her injury was caused not by the obstruction of her view,but by the inherent risk of being hit by a flying puck.
plaintiff,however,failed to contend in her opening statement that if she had a clear line of sight,she would have been able to avoid the flying puck.in other words,she claimed defendants poor crowd control had increased her risk of injury by lessening her chances of evading the puck.given that flying pucks are an integral and unavoidable part of the sport,however,it would be purely speculative to conclude that poor crowd control was causally related to plaintiff injury.based on plaintiff opening statement,the trial court correctly concluded,as a matter of law,she was not injured because of poor crowd control,but due to an integral aspect of ice pucks.accordingly,like the trial court,we conclude the relevant issue is not whether defendants owed a duty to provide better crowd control but whether defendants owed a duty to eliminate the risk of injuries from flying pucks.
although not quite on point,neinstein los angeles dodgers d,persuades us defendants owed no such duty.in neinstein,a dodger fan injured by a foul ball sued the dodgers,claiming the defendant was negligent in failing to protect her.in affirming summary judgment for the defendant,division two of this district stated in part we think it appropriate at this juncture to narrow the focus of this case by stating what is not at is
