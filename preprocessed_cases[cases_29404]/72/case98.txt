matrix,which is headquartered and incorporated in florida,produces and sells bags for sporting equipment.rawlings,a delaware corporation,makes sporting equipment for use in baseball,softball,basketball and football.on july,rawlings and matrix executed the contract which is the subject of this litigation.under that contract,matrix had an exclusive license to use rawlings trademarks in producing,marketing,and selling equipment bags,and the license was to continue so long as certain conditions were satisfied.matrix agreed to use its best efforts to foster and develop the products and to maximize sales.it further agreed to meet certain minimum average annual sales levels over a five year period.rawlings agreed not to produce or sell bags that competed with those of matrix or to sell bags over a certain size.a section entitled breach provided that if either party breache d any of the provisions of the contract,written notice of the breach had to be given to the breaching party.the other party was entitled to terminate the contract if the breaching party did not cure the breach within thirty days after the written notice.a separate section entitled immediate termination stated that rawlings,upon notice to matrix,could immediately terminate the agreement if matrix became insolvent.the contract was to be governed by the law of delaware.
there was testimony at trial that annual sales of rawlings bags were about at the time matrix took over its sporting bag business.by sales had reached million per year,but in the next several years they declined and were at about in.nevertheless,matrix met the contract minimum sales requirements at all times during the contract period.
in march acquired rawlings as a subsidiary,and then in september it also acquired worth,a competitor to matrix in the sporting equipment bag industry.made plans to consolidate parts of the sales forces of rawlings and worth,and louis orloff,the president of matrix,wrote to rawlings that such a consolidation would violate the noncompete clause of the agreement between matrix and rawlings.
for some time rawlings had been concerned with the decline in its bag sales and believed that matrix was uninterested in growing this business and was not using its best efforts to foster and develop its products.in a meeting with orloff in november,rawlings management expressed concern that the bag line was stagnant.rawlings was dissatisfied with orloff s response to these concerns,which it believed showed that orloff considered rawlings bag line relatively unimportant and that he had no desire to innovate.during that same month consolidation plans were carried out,and portions of the rawlings and worth sales forces were combined.
after the november meeting between orloff and rawlings management,orloff sent a letter to rawlings referring to the parties disputes and outlining matrix positions on them.he reiterated his belief that consolidation of the rawlings and worth sales forces would violate the parties contract.rawlings felt that this letter did not satisfactorily respond to its concerns and its president,robert parish,discussed the matrix letter with monte baier,general counsel,and decided to terminate the license agreement.
on january,matrix initiated its breach of contract action against rawlings in the united states district court for the district of maine,alleging breach of the license agreement noncompete duties.by letter dated february,rawlings informed matrix that it would terminate the contract effective thirty days from the date of the letter for matrix failure to use best efforts.the letter further stated that the contract notice provision,requiring a thirty day period for cure of breach,was inapplicable because rawlings has repeatedly requested that matrix comply with the terms of the agreement requiring matrix to use its best efforts and matrix has failed and refused to comply.on the same date as that letter,rawlings filed its action against matrix in federal district court in the eastern district of missouri for breach of matrix duty to use best efforts.
matrix moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against rawlings in the maine case while rawlings sought to transfer that action to the eastern district of missouri.the district court denied matrix motion and transferred the maine case to the eastern district of missouri where it was consolidated with the action already filed there.
the cases were realigned,and additional claims were asserted.matrix alleged that rawlings had wrongfully terminated the contract by failing to give it the required thirty day period in which to cure its breach.matrix also joined as a party and alleged that it and rawlings had violated the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act.stat.in addition matrix asserted that,by acquiring worth and consolidating the sales forces of rawlings and worth,had caused rawlings to breach the license agreement noncompete clause and tortiously interfered with that agreement in violation of florida common law.matrix sought compensatory and punitive damages,as well as equitable relief to prevent consolidation of the rawlings and worth sales forces and the selling or promoting of competing bags.
rawlings and subsequently moved for dismissal of matrix florida statutory claim and for summary judgment on matrix contract and common law tort claims.in its motion rawlings raised an additional theory justifying its termination of the contract on the ground that matrix was insolvent and therefore in breach.to support this theory it produced a balance sheet from showing that matrix liabilities exceeded its assets.matrix in turn moved for summary judgment both on its claim that rawlings had wrongfully terminated the license agreement and on rawlings breach of contract claim.
in ruling on these motions,the district court concluded that matrix statutory claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.summary judgment was granted to rawlings on the tortious interference claim against it,but denied to.the district court also granted summary judgment to matrix for wrongful termination after concluding that rawlings notice had violated the contract thirty day cure provision and that there was insufficient evidence that matrix had been insolvent.
the parties then went to trial on matrix claims against rawlings for breach of the license agreement noncompete clause and against for tortious interference.as part of its compensatory damage claim,matrix sought lost profits which it would have gained from the license absent breach.its expert witness,donna beck smith,split her calculation of lost profits into two segments the profits matrix would have gained from the license for the first ten years after termination,and the terminal value of the license or its residual value after those ten years.and rawlings moved for a directed verdict on the license terminal value,claiming such damages were too speculative to be awarded,and moved for judgment as a matter of law on the tortious interference claim.the motions were denied,and the cases were submitted to the jury by special verdict with instructions that if the jury found for matrix it was to award separate damages for the ten year period after termination and for the terminal value of the license.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of matrix and awarded damages against rawlings in the amounts of for the ten year period and for terminal value.it also returned a verdict against for.the district court entered judgment on the jury verdicts.rawlings and filed post trial motions for judgment or in the alternative for a new trial.the district court denied the motions in large part,but it did grant rawlings motion in respect to the terminal value award,and the judgment was amended to eliminate that portion of matrix award.
all parties have appealed.rawlings argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to matrix on its wrongful termination claim.asserts that the jury instructions on matrix tortious interference claim were faulty and that it should have been granted judgment as a matter of law on that claim.both rawlings and argue in the alternative that they are entitled to a new trial because the verdicts were against the weight of the evidence.on its cross appeal matrix argues that its claim under the florida statute should not have been dismissed,that the jury should have been allowed to consider whether to award punitive damages against,and that the district court erred in setting aside the jury award of damages for the license terminal value.
in challenging the district court summary judgment decision,rawlings argues that it was excused from complying with the contract thirty day notice and cure provision because matrix had already materially breached the contract by failing to use its best efforts.according to rawlings,this prior breach is a complete defense to matrix breach of contract action because a plaintiff must demonstrate substantial compliance with all contractual provisions before receiving relief.matrix responds that the contract must be enforced according to its own terms and that it unambiguously required notice of breach and provided a thirty day period to cure.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.hope klabal,cir.a district court interpretation of state law is also reviewed de novo.id.
the contract provided for delaware law to control,and rawlings argues that under that law a party need not give notice of termination if there is a material breach of the contract by the other party.we have found no decision of the delaware supreme court on this point of law,and rawlings cites none.rawlings does cite dicta in one chancery case,see dervaes houdaille,wl at,and also a trial court decision interpreting a statutory notice provision,see braxton adirondack group,wl at.matrix cites a federal district court case that directly contradicts rawlings position,however.harper.valley,aff,cir.in harper,the district court applied delaware law to hold that one party alleged failure to perform adequately under a consulting agreement did not excuse the other party failure to follow a fifteen day notice and cure provision.id.at.
while the case on which matrix relies is more apposite than those cited by rawlings,none is conclusively determinative of delaware law.see comm r estate of bosch,d.what should determine the outcome here is the more fundamental principle that the unambiguous language of a contract must be given its plain meaning and full effect.westfield ins.group wharf.as the delaware court of chancery has explained,where contract language speaks to a particular dispute,the court gives those privately negotiated and agreed upon terms their full and plain meaning.cont l ins.rutledge.
here,the license agreement thirty day notice and cure provision speaks directly to this dispute.the unambiguous text of that provision applies to any breach other than those addressed in the immediate termination provision.the thirty day provision does not exclude material breaches from its required notice and cure period.if only nonmaterial breaches required notice,the word any would be nullified.rawlings was thus not excused from giving matrix notice and the period to cure.
the principle that unambiguous text governs contractual interpretation also persuades us that an alleged breach of the contract best efforts provision is not a defense to matrix breach of contract action.it is precisely when a party is not in substantial compliance with the contract that the notice and cure provision mandates the giving of thirty days notice.in similar circumstances the eleventh circuit has come to the same conclusion while applying the law of pennsylvania.see alliance metals,hinely,cir it would otherwise effectively render meaningless contractual notice and cure requirements.the district court did not err by granting summary judgment to matrix on these defenses of rawlings to the breach of contract action.
rawlings raises an additional point in addressing the only contractual exception to the notice and cure provision.it argues that because it presented uncontroverted evidence that matrix was insolvent,the license agreement immediate termination provision gave it the right to terminate matrix immediately upon notice.that provision states that rawlings shall have the immediate right to terminate this agreement upon written notice to matrix in the event that matrix becomes or is declared insolvent.matrix disputes rawlings reading of the agreement and contends that it incorrectly interprets the term insolvent to mean balance sheet insolvency,when in actuality the term refers to equitable insolvency.matrix also argues that rawlings waived its insolvency defense by failing to state in its written notice to matrix that it was terminating the contract due to insolvency.the district court agreed with matrix interpretation,and we review its construction of the contract de novo.oak river ins.truitt,cir.
matrix argues that rawlings can not now rely on an insolvency defense because it failed to mention insolvency in its notice of termination.a party may justify its termination of an agreement,however,by proving that there was,at the time,an adequate cause,although it did not become known to him until later.brywil,stp,wl at.july,quoting coll.point boat united states.brandeis,see also barisa charitable research,aff.rawlings is entitled to argue insolvency.
insolvency carries two distinct meanings.balance sheet insolvency,the interpretation which rawlings urges for the contract term,occurs when an entity liabilities exceed its assets.see geyer ingersoll publ ns.matrix argues on the other hand that what is intended by the agreement is equitable or cash flow insolvency.that type of insolvency is understood under delaware law to mean a deficiency of assets below liabilities with no reasonable prospect that the business can be continued in the face thereof,or an inability to meet maturing obligations as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.prod.res.group,nct group.
both parties cite cases which discuss the fiduciary duties owed by corporate directors to creditors.compare bank timberlands klamath falls,using the equitable definition,vacated on other grounds,with geyer,at using the balance sheet definition.to support its interpretation of insolvent,rawlings points to cases employing the balance sheet definition decided under the delaware fraudulent conveyances act,harrington hollingsworth,wl at.july.matrix relies on decisions which use the equitable definition and deal with the appointment of corporate receivers,nct group,at.
none of these cited cases deals with the interpretation of a contract containing the term insolvent.the cases simply show that insolvent is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations and is therefore an ambiguous term.see basic chems.am.motorists ins.delaware law directs us to look at the meaning of insolvent in the particular context in which it appears.the question is what reasonable persons in the position of the parties would have interpreted the ambiguous term to mean.see kaiser aluminum matheson.to aid our inquiry we look to the parties acts and statements,the business context,any prior dealings,and relevant customs in the industry.in re explorer pipeline.
while this agreement called for matrix to keep records necessary for the calculation of royalties payable under it,it did not require matrix to furnish rawlings with general data on its financial condition.this omission indicates that under the contract,insolvency was intended to mean an inability to continue business in the face of mounting liabilities or the inability to pay its bills as they became due.rawlings would learn about such occurrences without access to matrix balance sheets or income statements.since rawlings admits that it was unaware of the matrix balance sheet on which its insolvency argument relies until after litigation had begun,it apparently did not consider it necessary to monitor the company balance sheets.see artesian water state,parties own actions of great weight in determining contract meaning and lead court to presumptively correct interpretation.moreover,due to costs of replacing matrix with another licensee,it is questionable that rawlings would have only been concerned with a temporary state of matrix balance sheet.in a contract of indefinite duration like this one,rawlings would have been more likely concerned with matrix long term financial health and its ability to pay its bills and grow its business.interpreting the contract to refer to equitable rather than balance sheet insolvency is the more reasonable and therefore preferable interpretation.see holland automotive fibres.because it is undisputed that matrix was not equitably insolvent,we conclude that summary judgment was correctly granted to matrix on this issue.
argues on appeal that matrix did not establish a submissible case of tortious interference with a business relationship because it failed to prove an essential element of its claim namely,that had intentionally and unjustifiably interfered with the license agreement between matrix and rawlings.contends that its consolidation of the rawlings and worth sales forces was justified by its interest in its own business and its competitive position in the sporting goods industry.furthermore according to,matrix did not show that its actions were specifically intended to interfere with the license agreement and the damages awarded against it were duplicative of those awarded for rawlings breach of contract.we review de novo a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of matrix,without making credibility assessments or weighing the evidence.battle united parcel,cir.
the elements of a claim for tortious interference with a business relationship under florida law are the existence of a business relationship,the defendant knowledge of that relationship,the defendant intentional and unjustified interference with that relationship,and damage to the plaintiff as a result of the breach of the relationship.ethan allen,georgetown manor,so d,at trial there was testimony that was aware of the contract between rawlings and matrix and its provisions and that president parish of rawlings had discussed a key letter from matrix president orloff with general counsel.that letter had warned rawlings that plan to consolidate the rawlings and worth sales forces would breach the contract.because nonetheless went ahead with consolidation,the jury was entitled to infer that intended to procure a breach of the contract.chi.title ins.title of,so d.purposely causing a breach of contract is an improper means of interference,mccurdy collis,so d,and using improper means to interfere with a business relationship constitutes unjustifiable interference,ethyl balter,so d.the jury was entitled to find from the evidence that had used improper means of interference and that it had intentionally and unjustifiably interfered with the license agreement.
also unavailing is argument that the damages awarded against it were duplicative.damages for breach of contract and tortious interference are not coextensive,and a jury may award damages under both claims.see montage group,computer,so d.matrix expert witness testified that it suffered a total of in damages,but the damages which the jury awarded against both rawlings and totaled only.the jury aggregate award was thus well within the bounds of the evidence presented at trial,and a jury may rationally allocate damages between the two different causes of action,one for breach of contract,and one for tort.indu craft,bank of baroda,cir.
because a reviewing court role under the seventh amendment is to reconcile and preserve whenever possible a jury verdict,we must start with a presumption that the damages awarded were not duplicative.id.moreover,the acts committed by rawlings and those committed by were different.while rawlings breached the contract by improperly terminating matrix without a period of cure,ordered the sales forces of worth and rawlings to consolidate,thus causing a breach of the license agreement noncompete clause.the jury apparently intended to apportion damages between the defendants for these separate acts.in light of these points and failure to raise the issue in timely fashion,we conclude that the damages awarded against should be affirmed and that the district court did not err in denying motion for judgment as a matter of law.see jackson city of louis,cir.
also argues that the district court instructions on tortious interference were an abuse of discretion,but never made a specific objection to the instructions before submission of the case to the jury.it stated only that the instruction as proposed is far broader than the issues as framed by the pleadings and the evidence.this objection to the district court was too general to preserve the specific objections that argues on appeal,and the instructions will be reviewed for plain error only.dupre eng g,cir.
claims that the court erred in instructing that one of the elements of a tortious interference claim was existing business relationships without specifying what those relationships were.no specification was necessary,however,since the trial focused on matrix relationship with rawlings.the instructions were also faulty,argues,in failing to define interference,thus allowing the jury to understand the term more broadly than does florida law.overlooks the fact that the instructions correctly stated florida law by excluding from interference any action that was justified or that did not employ improper means there was no plain error in the jury instructions.
rawlings and contend that the district court erred by denying their motion for a new trial.rawlings asserts that the lost profits award was against the weight of the evidence because matrix expert testimony was unreliable,and claims that the verdict against it was a miscarriage of justice.the denial of a new trial motion based on the argument that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence is virtually unassailable on appeal,however.grogg.pac,cir.rawlings never made a challenge under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,to the expert testimony whose calculations it now attacks,and neither rawlings nor has shown that the verdicts were against the weight of the evidence or that there was a miscarriage of justice.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.
matrix challenges the district court post trial elimination of the jury award for terminal value damage.the district court set aside those damages as speculative,but matrix argues that terminal value is a well accepted concept under the law.even if its expert projections were optimistic,matrix argues,there was nonetheless a reasonable basis for the award.while the jury valued the license agreement terminal value at only about million,the expert testimony set it at million.rawlings responds that speculation is necessarily involved in estimating terminal value because revenue lost over an infinite period could be included.
