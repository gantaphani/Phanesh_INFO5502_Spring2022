donaghy began his career as an nba referee in september and continued in that position for thirteen seasons.he first began placing bets on nba games,including games he officiated,during the season through his friend jack concannon.the conspiracy at issue here,however,began in december and continued until april.donaghy provided picks on nba games,again including games he officiated,to battista and martino.battista agreed to pay donaghy a fee for each game in which donaghy correctly picked the winner.donaghy provided the picks to martino,martino relayed the information to battista,and battista placed the bets.according to the government,donaghy and martino devised a code for communicating picks over the telephone using the names of martino two brothers.if donaghy mentioned martino older brother,the pick would be the home team if donaghy referred to martino younger brother,the pick would be the visiting team.in making his picks,donaghy relied on,among other things,nonpublic information to which he had unique access by virtue of his position as an nba referee.this information included his knowledge of the officiating crews for upcoming nba games,the interactions between certain referees,players and team personnel,and the physical condition of players.during the course of the conspiracy,martino met with donaghy in several cities for the primary purpose of paying donaghy for his correct predictions.
after the government discovered the gambling scheme,donaghy agreed to cooperate with its investigation.thereafter,in august,donaghy pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of and conspiracy to transmit wagering information in violation of.in february,battista and martino were both charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to transmit wagering information as pertinent here,the indictment alleged that martino and battista committed the following overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy to transmit wagering information

f rom december of to march,i was engaged in the business of sports betting,and i agreed with tom martino and tim dona ghy to use the telephone across state lines to obtain information to assist me in wagering on sporting events,on nba basketball games.i received information from tom martino,who received his information from the nba referee tim dona ghy.this agreement was formed during a meeting between the three of us,in a hotel in december of.during the course of this agreement from time to time i directed martino to do certain things such as having meetings with dona ghy.
battista further admitted that he had met with donaghy in pennsylvania for payment.
the nba,and the united states on its behalf,sought restitution against all three defendants.the nba requested restitution for donaghy compensation for the portions of the,and seasons when he officiated games in which he had a financial interest that portion of the salaries of nba employees attributed to reviewing the tapes of the games donaghy refereed and attorneys fees incurred by the nba in connection with assisting the government in its investigation and prosecution.
after a comprehensive and particularized discussion of each restitution claim asserted by the nba,the district court ordered the defendants to pay restitution in the total amount of,breaking down the portions owed by all the defendants jointly and severally,battista and martino jointly and severally,and each defendant individually.see united states donaghy,d.as relevant to the issues battista raises on appeal,the district court concluded that the nba was a victim of battista crime of to transmit wagering either the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra,or the victim and witness protection act of vwpa.the court determined that battista crime was covered by the mvra,which applies to offense s committed by fraud or deceit,c a ii,concluding that the phrase committed by fraud or deceit appears to refer to the way in which a particular offense was carried out rather than its elements.d at.in the alternative,the court concluded that battista was accountable for restitution under the vwpa and rejected the argument that his current unemployment and familial obligations foreclosed vwpa restitution.id.at.
battista appeals the district court restitution order,arguing that the nba was not a victim of the offense to which he pleaded guilty under either the mvra or the vwpa his crime of conviction is not covered under either restitution statute attorneys fees and investigative costs incurred by the nba are not recoverable and his financial obligations were sufficiently burdensome to exempt him from paying restitution under the vwpa.for the following reasons,we reject battista contentions and affirm the district court order.
the goal of restitution,in the criminal context,is to restore a victim,to the extent money can do so,to the position he occupied before sustaining injury.united states boccagna,cir.in the context of the mvra,we have observed that the statutory focus is on the victim loss and upon making victims whole.united states coriaty,cir.the procedures a sentencing court must follow in determining whether,and to what extent,to order restitution pursuant to the mvra or the vwpa are set forth in d,d.see united states reifler,cir.
mvra or vwpa 
under the mvra,restitution is mandatory for certain crimes,such as an offense against property under this title including any offense committed by fraud or deceit.c a ii.a district court must order restitution where an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a pecuniary loss.id.c b.in contrast to the mvra,however,restitution under the vwpa is discretionary.the vwpa provides that t he court,when sentencing a defendant convicted of any offense under this title,may order that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such offense.a a emphasis added.the vwpa requires sentencing courts to consider the amount of the loss sustained by the victim as a result of the offense,the defendant financial resources,the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant dependents,and other factors the court deems appropriate.see id.a b i united states ben zvi,cir.while the district court must review these statutory factors,detailed factual findings for each factor are not required.see united states stevens,cir.aside from the aforementioned differences,the provisions of the vwpa and the mvra are nearly identical in authorizing an award of restitution.united states serawop,cir internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
in this case,the district court determined that battista offense of to transmit wagering covered under the mvra,reasoning that the phrase committed by fraud or de
