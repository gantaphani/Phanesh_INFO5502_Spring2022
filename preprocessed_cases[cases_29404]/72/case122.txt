the statute known as title ix,is widely recognized as the source of a vast expansion of athletic opportunities for women in the nation schools and universities,so much so that a company that sells women athletic apparel now mimics its name.see.despite that renown,the district court in this case held that a university that receives federal funds can not be held liable in damages for failing effectively to accommodate the athletic interests of both men and women unless the aggrieved women first provide the appropriate university officials with notice of their disadvantageous treatment and an opportunity to cure it.
we disagree and so,with respect to the central issue in this case,reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on that ground.we hold as well that the defendant university is not entitled to summary judgment on the alternative ground that it has complied with title ix.we also reverse the order dismissing the plaintiffs equal protection claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
arezou mansourian,lauren mancuso,and christine ng hereafter plaintiffs or students are women who wrestled in high school and chose to attend the university of california,davis ucd so they could participate in the university acclaimed wrestling program,which had long provided opportunities for women the plaintiffs participated in varsity wrestling and enjoyed the benefits associated with varsity status training,coaching,and laundry services academic tutoring insurance and access to varsity facilities and equipment ucd did not operate separate wrestling teams for men and women a handful of women wrestlers participated in what was largely a men team,practicing with the men and receiving coaching from coach mike burch.
during the academic year,ucd eliminated all women from the wrestling team.after the students protested to ucd administrators and filed a complaint with the office for civil rights ocr ucd agreed to permit women again to participate in varsity wrestling.their participation,however,was conditioned on their ability to beat male wrestlers in their weight class,using men collegiate wrestling rules.prior to their elimination from the team,women wrestlers at ucd had competed only against other women and used international freestyle rules.as a result of the new requirement that they compete against men under men rules,the female students were unable to participate on the wrestling team and lost the benefits associated with varsity status,including scholarships and academic credit.
the students then filed a class action against ucd and several ucd officials in their individual and official capacities,on behalf of all current and future female ucd students denied equal athletic participation opportunities.the plaintiffs sought damages and injunctive relief under title ix and also asserted equal protection claims under 
just before the scheduled hearing on class certification,the plaintiffs requested a stay due to their attorney serious illness.during the stay,mancuso,the only named plaintiff still attending ucd at that point,graduated.as soon as the stay ended,the plaintiffs moved to add as plaintiffs three students,kelsey brust,laura ludwig,and jessica bulala,all still enrolled at ucd.the district court refused to allow the amendment,holding that the plaintiffs failed to meet the good cause required under federal rule of civil procedure when such a motion is filed after the issuance of a scheduling order.see johnson mammoth recreations,cir.without any named plaintiffs currently attending ucd,the plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal of the class claims for injunctive relief.
the district court subsequently dismissed the claim as subsumed by the title ix claim,citing middlesex county sewer authority national sea clammers ass.the district court then granted ucd motion for summary judgment,holding that the students were required,to perfect their claim,to give ucd notice in advance of filing suit of the alleged title ix violation and an opportunity to cure it,and had failed to do so.the students timely appealed.
we review de novo the district court dismissal on the pleadings pursuant to rule c,dunlap credit protection ass n,cir,as well as the grant of summary judgment.avista.wolfe,cir.we review the denial of a motion to amend under rule b for abuse of discretion.noyes kelly,cir.
before proceeding to discuss the merits of this case,we consider whether we have jurisdiction to decide the plaintiffs challenge to the district court denial of their motion to add brust,bulala,and ludwig as plaintiffs.we hold that this issue is moot and so beyond our jurisdiction,for the reasons we now explain.
after the district court denied the motion,brust,bulala,and ludwig initiated a separate lawsuit against ucd.the district court certified a class of a ll present,prospective,and future women students at ucd who seek to participate in who are deterred from participating in intercollegiate athletics at ucd.stipulated judgment and order at,brust regents of the of.the parties to the brust action reached a settlement,approved by the district court,which resolves all class member claims for injunctive relief.id.at.moreover,brust,ludwig,and bulala have now graduated from ucd.it is therefore apparent that,even if the district court had erred in denying the motion to add brust,ludwig,and bulala initially,which we do not decide,they would no longer be appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation for the purposes of injunctive relief,as the current plaintiffs recognize.see flint dennison,cir generally,once a student graduates,he no longer has a live case or controversy justifying declaratory and injunctive relief against a school action or policy,and his case is therefore moot.cole oroville union high,cir holding,where the two original plaintiffs had graduated and a third,plaintiff subsequently graduated before the appeal,that all three lacked standing to seek injunctive relief.
the plaintiffs contend,however,that the brust settlement does not preclude current female students from seeking the specific injunctive awarded as part of the brust restoring the women wrestling program.that may be so we need not decide whether it is or not.there are no current students in this case seeking that relief no identified,current students looking to intervene in this case to seek that relief and no identified,current students whom the plaintiffs seek to add to the case for purposes of obtaining that relief.
we therefore may not reach the merits of the claim that the district court improperly denied the motion to add new plaintiffs,as there is presently no cognizable dispute that would be affected by such a determination see,mcquillion schwarzenegger,cir holding that a prisoner successful habeas petition and subsequent relief rendered moot his claim for injunctive and declaratory relief under porter jones,cir noting that a case or issue becomes moot when the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome quotation omitted di giorgio lee in re di giorgio,cir holding that tenants challenge to a state statute permitting their eviction was moot after they voluntarily vacated the property.
turning to the merits of the students damages claims,we begin by setting out the statutory and regulatory framework governing title ix athletics cases.title ix provides that 
n o person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
a.as applied to intercollegiate athletics,the department of education title ix regulations interpret the statute as requiring funding recipients to provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes.c 
the regulations establish two components of title ix equal athletic opportunity requirement effective accommodation and equal treatment.effective accommodation title ix requirements derive from the title ix regulation at c,which bases title ix compliance in part on whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.the equal treatment title ix standard,in contrast,derives from c,which has been interpreted by ocr to require equivalence in the availability,quality and kinds of other athletic benefits and opportunities provided male and female athletes.
department of education office for civil rights,clarification of intercollegiate athletics policy guidance the test clarification,available at.effective accommodation claims thus concern the opportunity to participate in athletics,while equal treatment claims allege differences in the schedules,equipment,coaching,and other factors affecting participants in athletics.see mccormick sch.dist.of mamaroneck,cir holding that a competition schedule permitting male but not female high school soccer players to participate in state and regional championships deprived female players of equal treatment under title ix see also pederson.state,cir explaining the relationship between effective accommodation and equal treatment claims boucher syracuse,cir same.so an institution may violate title ix solely by failing to accommodate effectively the interests and abilities of student athletes of both sexes,even if the benefits provided athletes of both sexes are equivalent.kelley bd.of,cir see also roberts.state bd.of,cir cohen brown,cir.
whether a funding recipient has met its effective accommodation obligation is determined using a test drawn from ocr policy interpretation,and further elaborated in ocr clarification congress has specifically authorized ocr to promulgate regulations governing intercollegiate athletics see,stat,and the resulting test gives universities three options for demonstrating compliance with title ix showing substantial proportionality the number of women in intercollegiate athletics is proportionate to their enrollment proving that the institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion for the underrepresented sex in this case,women or where the university can not satisfy either of the first two options,establishing that it nonetheless fully and effectively accommodate s the interests of women.
funding recipients can satisfy any of the three options to comply with title ix.ucd claims to have satisfied the second option by showing a history and continuing practice of program expansion compliance with this option focuses on whether an institution has expanded the number of intercollegiate participation opportunities for women,but provides institutions flexibility in choosing which teams they add.clarification nn.the number of participation opportunities for women is defined by the number of female athletes actually playing intercollegiate sports.
the district court determined that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded a claim for effective accommodation under title ix by alleging that ucd chooses to make fewer athletic participation opportunities available to female students than to male students.the district court did not,however,reach the merits of whether ucd complied with option two,instead concluding that money damages can not be awarded unless a plaintiff has given notice of and an opportunity to rectify the specific violation alleged by a title ix plaintiff.finding that the plaintiffs had failed to provide such notice,the district court granted summary judgment to ucd.
this circuit has yet to address whether any such requirement applies in the athletics context.we conclude that it does not.
ucd notice argument,adopted by the district court,proceeds by analogy to the supreme court holding that notice and an opportunity to cure a violation is an essential precursor to a sexual harassment suit for damages under title ix.we therefore begin by discussing the pertinent title ix sexual harassment cases.as will appear,the analogy between this case and those is not apt.
the starting point for this inquiry is franklin gwinnett county public schools,in which the defendant school district was aware of a teacher sexual harassment of a student but took no action to stop it.the court recognized that pennhurst state school and hospital halderman,precludes the award of damages for unintentional violations of statutes,like title ix,enacted pursuant to congress spending authority.see franklin,at.franklin held,however,that the failure to halt harassment of which a school district is aware constitutes intentional discrimination for which monetary damages are an appropriate remedy.id.at.
gebser lago vista independent school district,further defined the scope of a school monetary liability under title ix for inaction in the face of serious sexual harassment.in gebser,the court held that principles of respondeat superior and constructive notice are inadequate to impose title ix liability on a school district for a teacher sexual abuse of a high school student.id.at.noting that title ix express enforcement scheme,termination of federal funding,requires an opportunity for voluntary compliance before suspending or terminating funding,see,gebser held that the judicially implied private right of action similarly should not impose liability without regard to the recipient knowledge or its corrective actions upon receiving notice.id.at.monetary damages premised on constructive notice or respondeat superior for sexual harassment,the court held in gebser,would entail a risk that the recipient of funds was unaware of the discrimination.id.at.rather,
in cases like this one that do not involve official policy of the recipient entity,a damages remedy will not lie under title ix unless an official who has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures has actual knowledge of discrimination and fails adequately to respond.
id.at emphasis added.
critically for present purposes,gebser does not make notice of an alleged violation a prerequisite to recovery in every title ix case,or even in every sexual harassment case.proof of actual notice is required only when the alleged title ix violation consists of an institution deliberate indifference to acts that do not involve official policy of the recipient entity.id.in sexual harassment cases,it is the deliberate failure to curtail known harassment,rather than the harassment itself,that constitutes the intentional title ix violation see davis monroe county bd.of,holding that gebser permits the plaintiff to hold the board liable for its own decision to remain idle in the face of known harassment in its schools.the tenth circuit has held that a corollary of this principle is that where the official policy is one of deliberate indifference to a known overall risk of sexual harassment,notice of a particular harassment situation and an opportunity to cure it are not predicates for liability.see simpson of.boulder,cir 
consistent with the reasoning underlying gebser,the supreme court has made clear that no notice requirement is applicable to title ix claims that rest on an affirmative institutional decision.jackson birmingham board of education,held that a high school athletics coach fired in retaliation for complaining about discrimination in athletics funding had a private right of action under title ix.the court held that no notice is required in the retaliation context.in gebser and davis,the court stated,we emphasized that the notice limitation on private damages actions is not a bar to liability where a funding recipient intentionally violates the statute.id.at quotation omitted.as retaliation is easily attributable to the funding recipient and it is,the court allowed jackson retaliation claim to proceed without regard to whether adequate notice and opportunity to cure the violation had been provided.
universities decisions with respect to athletics are even more easily attributable to the funding recipient and,id.at,than the retaliation in jackson.institutions,not individual actors,decide how to allocate resources between male and female athletic teams.decisions to create or eliminate teams or to add or decrease roster slots for male or female athletes are official decisions,not practices by individual students or staff.athletic programs that fail effectively to accommodate students of both sexes thus represent official policy of the recipient entity and so are not covered by gebser notice requirement.gebser,at.
moreover,a judicially imposed notice requirement would be superfluous in light of universities ongoing obligations to certify compliance with title ix athletics requirements and to track athletics gender equity data.ocr regulations require funding recipients to evaluate their policies and certify,as a condition for receiving funds,that they are tak ing whatever remedial action is necessary.to eliminate discrimination.see also id.ucd and other funding recipients therefore have an affirmative obligation to ensure compliance with at least one prong of the effective accommodation test.
the equity in athletics disclosure act eada further requires federally funded universities to report to the department of education and make available to students the number of undergraduates and athletes,broken down by sex,as well as data on operating expenses,coach salaries,athletic scholarships,recruiting expenditures,and revenues.g.ucd eada reports contain ample data demonstrating that it could not satisfy the substantial proportionality option and that the trend of increasing female athletic participation reversed after,indicating that ucd may not have had a continuing practice of program expansion.thus,where the alleged harm is unequal provision of athletic opportunity,the notice requirement would not supply universities with information of which they are legitimately unaware.see gebser,at.
we conclude for these reasons that notice and opportunity to cure is not necessary in cases alleging unequal provision of athletic opportunities in violation of title ix.applying the notice requirement to institutional decisions would contravene the clear language of gebser and its progeny.it would also be inconsistent with funding recipients affirmative obligations to provide nondiscriminatory athletic participation opportunities and continually to assess and certify compliance with title ix.
the fifth circuit has reached the same conclusion we do,holding that 
the requirement in the sexual harassment the academic institution have actual knowledge of the sexual not applicable for purposes of determining whether an academic institution intentionally discriminated on the basis of sex by denying females equal athletic opportunity in the instant case,it is the institution itself that is discriminating.
pederson,at.the eighth circuit,the only other circuit to address the issue,has assumed,without any analysis,that gebser notice requirement applies equally to title ix cases where plaintiffs allege discrimination in the administration of an athletic program.grandson of minn,cir.but the plaintiffs in grandson did not argue otherwise,and the eighth circuit reached the merits of a later title ix athletics case without mentioning grandson,gebser,or the notice requirement.see chalenor.it is therefore far from clear that grandson is controlling even in the eighth circuit.if it is,then the circuits are already split on the issue,and we find the fifth circuit holding and that of the tenth circuit in simpson,on a different but related issue the more persuasive,for reasons already surveyed.
we therefore join the fifth circuit in holding that gebser notice requirement is inapplicable to cases alleging that a funding recipient has failed effectively to accommodate women interest in athletics.the district court decision granting summary judgment on that basis is reversed.
ucd also moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the record demonstrated a history and continuing practice of program expansion for women that satisfied option two of the test.although the district court granted summary judgment on the notice grounds discussed above,ucd contends that we could,alternatively,affirm the district court decision on the merits.see atel fin.quaker coal,cir.that is so,but only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the students,there are no genuine issues of material fact concerning ucd compliance with option two.see,becerril pima county assessor office,cir.on the record before us we can not affirm on this alternative ground.
in assessing compliance with option two,we must,under the clarification,focus on both the institution record of adding female participation opportunities and its current plan of program expansion that is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of women.history and continuing practice thus constitute two separate inquiries.we conclude that the undisputed facts fall short of demonstrating ucd compliance with either facet of option two.
the clarification specifies the following factors as evidence of an institution history of program expansion 
a n institution record of adding intercollegiate teams,or upgrading teams to intercollegiate status,for women an institution record of increasing the number of participants in intercollegiate athletics who are women and an institution affirmative responses to requests by students or others for addition or elevation of sports.
the option two analysis focuses primarily,but not exclusively,on increasing the number of women athletes rather than increasing the number of women teams.ocr will assess whether past actions of the institution have expanded participation opportunities for the underrepresented sex emphasis added.the number of participation opportunities is defined by the number of female athletes actually playing intercollegiate sports.
ucd had seven women teams in and added another in,thereby increasing the number of female varsity athletes.the record indicates that ucd did not further expand participation opportunities for women until.the report of the ucd title ix review committee report indicated that ucd did not comprehensively review its compliance with title ix between and.the report also stated that since,ucd had added two women sports soccer and cross country track but dropped two golf and field hockey the report concluded that ucd record can not be termed a demonstrably responsive process of program expansion particularly when female participation relative to male participation has been decreasing over the past three years.internal ucd memoranda from directors of the athletics program suggest that the numerical participation gap continued to grow over the next two years 
in,ucd decided to add three women varsity teams.the university reviewed proposals from five women club teams and elevated water polo,crew and lacrosse to varsity status.when the three new teams began competing the following year,the number of female athletes rose from to,with the difference between female enrollment and female participation in athletics dropping from twenty percent to eleven percent.
ucd represents that it created another women varsity team,indoor track,in.the addition of indoor track,however,can not be considered evidence of program expansion.it did nothing to expand the number of female athletes,as all the women participating in indoor track also participated in an existing varsity sport.see cohen brown,aff,cir dismissing the alleged addition of winter track as a sport that merely involved providing indoor space to the existing women track team.nonetheless,the number of women athletes did continue to rise.in the school year,women varsity athletes at ucd reached a historic high in both total numbers and proportion of female athletes to enrolled women students.
subsequently,however,the number of women playing intercollegiate athletics dropped sharply.meanwhile,in the ten years since ucd last added a significant number of female varsity slots,the number of female students at ucd grew by.rather than keeping pace with this growth in women enrollment,the number of female athletes fluctuated but never regained the apex it reached in.
in sum,ucd expanded varsity opportunities for women only between and.ucd elimination of women from the varsity wrestling team thus took place in the context of an overall contraction of female athletic participation opportunities that began in ucd strategy for sports equality between the sexes appears to have consisted of reducing varsity athletics overall,and in the process reducing men participation more than women participation by using roster management to limit the size of men teams.the clarification explicitly precludes considering such reductions as evidencing program expansion 
ocr will not find a history and continuing practice of program expansion where an institution increases the proportional participation opportunities for women by reducing opportunities for men alone or by reducing participation opportunities for men to a proportionately greater degree than for women.option two considers an institution good faith remedial efforts through actual program expansion cuts in the program for women,even when coupled with cuts in the program for men,can not be considered remedial because they burden members of the sex already disadvantaged by the present program.
an institution that has eliminated some participation opportunities for women can still satisfy option two if the elimination is offset by a strong history of program expansion.in ucd case,however,the elimination of women wrestling opportunities occurred in the context of a women athletics program that was,at best,stagnant.we therefore hold that ucd has not had a history of program expansion for women and so did not satisfy option two through such a history.
the clarification lists two factors that may indicate a continuing practice of program expansion 
a n institution current implementation of a nondiscriminatory policy or procedure for requesting the addition of sports including the elevation of club or intramural teams and the effective communication of the policy or procedure to students and an institution current implementation of a plan of program expansion that is responsive to developing interests and abilities.
the record contains undisputed evidence that ucd has a procedure for requesting additional varsity sports and effectively communicates that procedure to students.according to the procedure distributed to students,the primary factor in ucd evaluation of proposals to create new varsity teams is the o verall impact on intercollegiate program gender equity.in,ucd received detailed applications from members of four women club sports bowling,horse polo,field hockey,and rugby seeking elevation to varsity status.these applications indicate that students are aware of the opportunity to request new varsity athletic opportunities 
the application was the field hockey club team second attempt to regain varsity status.an earlier application was rejected in.at that time,the title ix advisory committee advocated elevating lacrosse rather than field hockey to varsity status but noted that field hockey had developed strong interest from students and was a relatively strong ncaa sport,with three division i teams competing at nearby universities.the committee recommended that s hould gender equity not be achieved by the addition of the three sports proposed,and funding be available in the future,field hockey would be considered a prime candidate for addition to the ica program in the future.
when field hockey club players applied for varsity status in,however,their application was again denied.in fact,ucd rejected all four club team applications,even though all applicants were evaluated as successful and active club teams with a long tradition of participation.instead,ucd decided to create a women golf team at the behest of the men golf coach.
ucd contends that the fact that golf was proposed by the men golf coach rather than female students is irrelevant.we disagree.universities are free to consider applications from individuals other than students,and it is appropriate to evaluate interest at the high school level as well as among current ucd students.a funding recipient can only satisfy option two,however,by showing an expansion of participation opportunities that is demonstrably responsive to women developing interests and abilities includ ing interests that already exist at the institution.the fact that there were no women currently attending ucd who were interested enough in golf to participate at the club level or to request varsity status suggests that the addition of golf instead of field hockey,bowling,horse polo or rugby was not demonstratively responsive to the interests of current female students.
moreover,ucd selection of golf,which added only seven participation opportunities for women,was at odds with its stated priority of taking a significant step toward overall gender equity.elevating horse polo,rugby or field hockey would have added far more female varsity athletes 
we recognize that budgetary constraints often prevent universities from creating new teams and adding varsity slots.but title ix does not require that a school pour sums into its athletic establishment.cohen brown,at.universities may achieve compliance by reducing men athletic slots until participation rates become substantially proportionate to the undergraduate population.neal,f d at kelley,at roberts,at.they may not,however,maintain varsity teams for male students while denying female students comparable opportunities to enjoy the thrill of victory,the agony of defeat,and the many tangible benefits that flow from just being given a chance to participate in intercollegiate athletics.neal,at.
ucd took a significant step towards title ix compliance by adding three women teams in,but option two requires more than a single step.it requires evidence of continuous progress toward the mandate of gender equality that title ix has imposed on funding recipients for the past thirty years.the record before us does not contain undisputed facts showing a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to women interests.
we conclude that the grant of summary judgment to ucd can not be affirmed on the alternative merits ground that ucd complies with title ix requirement of providing equal athletic opportunities to students of both sexes.
the students also sue under,alleging that ucd violates the equal protection clause by maintaining an athletics program that discriminates on the basis of gender.the district court dismissed the claim because it determined that title ix enforcement scheme is sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate that congress intended to preclude claims when it enacted this statute.
fitzgerald barnstable school committee,decided after the district court dismissed the students claims,held,to the contrary,that title ix does not bar suits to enforce rights under the equal protection clause.as in fitzgerald,the plaintiffs here invoke to seek damages for violations of constitutional rights.see id.at explaining distinctions between the rights created by title ix and those afforded by the equal protection clause.
the defendants concede that the district court ruling does not survive fitzgerald but urge us to affirm dismissal of the claim on other grounds.we decline to do so,for reasons we now explain.
ucd first contends that the claim for damages is precluded by the statute of limitations and that the district court did not address this argument.in fact,the district court considered and rejected the statute of limitations defense as to both the title ix effective accommodation and equal protection claims in response to ucd original motion to dismiss.the court held that because the students claimed that they were currently being subjected to defendants allegedly sex discriminatory practices their claims accrue each and every day they are denied equal access to athletic participation.
