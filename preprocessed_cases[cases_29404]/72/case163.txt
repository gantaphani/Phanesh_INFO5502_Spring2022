plaintiff appeals from a summary judgment entered against him in his action arising out of injuries he sustained during a high school football game.defendant provided ambulance services at the game the crew of the standby ambulance assessed plaintiff condition and summoned a transport ambulance to take plaintiff to the hospital.a short time later,plaintiff condition deteriorated and the transport ambulance upgraded the call to a lights and siren emergency.at the hospital,plaintiff was diagnosed with and treated for a subdural hematoma.plaintiff alleged the standby ambulance crew was grossly negligent in not properly assessing plaintiff condition and immediately transporting him to the hospital in the standby ambulance.defendant motion for summary judgment was based on evidence its personnel were not grossly negligent in their assessment or care of plaintiff,and there was no evidence the brief delay caused by transferring plaintiff from one ambulance to the other caused any increase in the severity of his injuries.the motion was supported by extensive expert declarations.the trial court sustained objections to some of the opinions in the expert declaration submitted by plaintiff in opposition.it found there was no triable issue of material fact regarding causation and granted defendant motion.we find no error and therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on october,plaintiff sustained an injury to his head while playing in a high school football game.the coaches,noticing he was unsteady when he walked,examined him.plaintiff complained of head pain and winced when a coach shined a flashlight in his eyes.the coaches waved over the standby ambulance and its crew,paramedic aaron moses and emergency medical technician emt ben armstrong.the ambulance and crew arrived within two minutes.
moses first contacted plaintiff at approximately plaintiff was sitting upright on a table at the sideline of the field he responded to moses questions.moses testified he assessed plaintiff using the glasgow coma scale,a clinical tool designed to assess coma and impaired consciousness.the patient is given a score for each of three categories of responses eye opening response,verbal response,and motor response.moses stated he assessed plaintiff with the highest total score possible,out of,because of his responses to moses.plaintiff asserted moses either did not assess plaintiff condition correctly or did not assess his condition at all,based on the symptoms plaintiff exhibited.nonetheless,moses told plaintiff he should go to the hospital and plaintiff agreed.
at,moses radioed dispatch for a backup ambulance to transport plaintiff to the hospital code immediate response without lights and siren the standby crew applied spinal precautions,which were appropriate under the circumstances.they then loaded plaintiff into the ambulance and drove to the northeast corner of the field to meet the transport ambulance.the transport ambulance arrived at the football field at.the transport ambulance crew,paramedic benjamin ferguson,emt william hendricks,and trainee ryan rice,made first contact with plaintiff at.by,the transport ambulance was leaving the football field on its way to the hospital.between and,the transport ambulance crew upgraded the call to a code,a lights and siren emergency.they transported plaintiff to kern medical center kmc,a distance of approximately miles,in minutes.the emergency room personnel took custody of plaintiff at.
after a computerized tomography ct scan,plaintiff was diagnosed with a subdural hematoma.at,he was administered mannitol to reduce brain swelling.at,he was taken to the operating room where,at on october,he underwent craniotomy surgery to relieve his brain hemorrhage.at some point,plaintiff suffered a posterior artery stroke.
in this action,plaintiff sued kern emergency medical transportation corporation doing business as kern ambulance service defendant and others for his injuries.he alleged defendant was grossly negligent the standard of care applicable to paramedics and emts pursuant to health saf.code,in the care and treatment it rendered to him defendant failed to properly assess him and failed to recognize he had sustained a traumatic brain injury that required immediate,urgent transport to a trauma center.defendant allegedly wasted time and did not immediately,urgently or rapidly transport plaintiff to a trauma center,as a proximate cause of which his brain injury was made worse.plaintiff conceded the crew of the transport ambulance did not act in bad faith or with gross negligence in treating him he also conceded the hospital personnel were not negligent in their care of plaintiff.
defendant moved for summary judgment,asserting there was no evidence to support plaintiff allegations of gross negligence or causation of any damages.it argued moses properly evaluated plaintiff condition and could not have immediately transported plaintiff to the hospital in the standby ambulance code because plaintiff did not meet kern county criteria for activating the trauma system,transporting plaintiff code until he was placed in the transport ambulance and his condition deteriorated.using a timeline,defendant also argued that the delay caused by using two ambulances was only two minutes,which did not harm plaintiff or increase his injuries.additionally,it argued that,even if the delay was as much as minutes,plaintiff could not demonstrate the delay caused him any injury,or increased the injury he suffered,because the medical literature indicates there is no evidence such a brief delay in treatment correlates with a worse outcome for the patient.
plaintiff opposed the motion,arguing moses failed to assess plaintiff condition,or failed to properly assess it,and his resultant failure to rapidly transport plaintiff to the hospital was a substantial factor in causing his brain injury to be more extensive or severe.in support,he submitted expert declarations,including the declaration of fardad mobin,a neurological surgeon.without addressing any of the medical literature presented by defendant,mobin opined,among other things,that had plaintiff been transported immediately upon moses initial contact at,there would have been a decrease in brain swelling,and thereby pressure,because the administration of mannitol would have occurred much sooner.defendant objected to portions of mobin declaration.
the trial court granted defendant motion for summary judgment,after sustaining some of defendant objections to mobin declaration and overruling others.it concluded plaintiff failed to proffer substantial,admissible evidence from which a trier of fact could find in his favor on a necessary element of causation of injury.plaintiff appeals from the judgment subsequently entered.

thus,a properly qualified expert may offer an opinion relating to a subject that is beyond common experience,if that expert opinion will assist the trier of fact.bushling fremont medical center th,bushling.however,even when the witness qualifies as an expert,he or she does not possess a carte blanche to express any opinion within the area of expertise.citation.for example,an expert opinion based on assumptions of fact without evidentiary support citation,or on speculative or conjectural factors citation,has no evidentiary value citation and may be excluded from evidence.citations.similarly,when an expert opinion is purely conclusory because unaccompanied by a reasoned explanation connecting the factual predicates to the ultimate conclusion,that opinion has no evidentiary value because an expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons upon which it rests.jennings palomar pomerado health systems,th,jennings.an expert who gives only a conclusory opinion does not assist the jury to determine what occurred,but instead supplants the jury by declaring what occurred.id.at.regarding causation,the plaintiff must offer an expert opinion that contains a reasoned explanation illuminating why the facts have convinced the expert,and therefore should convince the jury,that it is more probable than not the negligent act was a of the plaintiff injury.id.at.
these rules apply to expert witness declarations submitted in connection with a motion for summary judgment.powell,supra,th at bushling,supra,th at.cases dismissing expert declarations in connection with summary judgment motions do so on the basis that the declarations established that the opinions were either speculative,lacked foundation,or were stated without sufficient certainty.sanchez hillerich bradsby th.u nder evidence code section,the trial court acts as a gatekeeper to exclude speculative or irrelevant expert opinion.sargon,supra,cal th at.t he gatekeeper role is to make certain that an expert,whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience,employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.id.at.
plaintiff contends the trial court improperly sustained five of defendant objections to mobin declaration objections,and.in his briefs,plaintiff has not addressed each individual objection,but argues generally that there was a sufficient foundation for the opinions expressed,so that the objections should have been overruled.he argues that as long as the expert declaration establishes the matters he relied on in expressing his opinion,and establishes that those matters are of the type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject in issue,the opinion is admissible.see evid.code.he concludes that,because the declaration shows mobin relied on his review of plaintiff medical records and his own experience,education,training,and clinical practice as a neurosurgeon,that foundation was established and the declaration was sufficient.in light of the facts and supporting medical literature set out in or accompanying the expert declarations submitted by defendant,however,mobin declaration failed to demonstrate his opinions were based on matters that experts reasonably rely on in forming such opinions and failed to include a reasoned explanation connecting the factual predicates to the ultimate conclusion.
objections 
objections,and 
defendant objections,and addressed the following language in mobin declaration.
objection,to a portion of paragraph because every minute is essential to the recovery of a patient experiencing head trauma,the first hour,otherwise known as the golden hour immediately following the brain injury is the most critical to the patient ultimate recovery.the delay jeopardized the recovery because it led to ischemia.
objection,to a portion of paragraph the quicker a subdural hematoma patient gets to the hospital,the better the outcome.because moses did not transport abraham sanchez to the hospital immediately that delay not only contributed to a more severe brain injury than abraham sanchez would have suffered had he been taken to the hospital quicker,but also jeopardized abraham overall recovery.
objection,to paragraph abraham arrived at kern medical center at,at which time abraham was rushed into a ct scan.shortly thereafter,abraham was administered mannitol to decrease his brain swelling.had abraham been transported immediately upon moses initial contact at,there would have been a decrease in brain swelling,and thereby pressure,because the administration of mannitol would have occurred much sooner.
defendant objected on the grounds the statements lacked foundation and were conclusory and speculative.it also objected that the quoted portion of paragraph the subject of objection was irrelevant,because plaintiff arrived at kmc within one hour of his first contact with the standby ambulance crew.defendant referred to its experts declarations,which presented detailed analyses of medical literature showing that delays of less than four hours before surgical treatment of a subdural hematoma,and more specifically delays less than minutes,do not affect patient outcomes.it referred to federal case law that rejected the notion that quicker is necessarily better in neural injury cases,and noted mobin provided no evidence to support that conclusion.defendant stated plaintiff failed to address or refute case law and expert testimony repudiating the conclusory connection between neural pressure and clinical outcome.
the undisputed evidence indicated the standby ambulance crew first contacted plaintiff at approximately.moses called for a transport ambulance at.the transport ambulance crew first contacted plaintiff at,and the transport ambulance left the football field for the hospital by.thus,a total of approximately minutes elapsed between the time moses arrived and began his assessment of plaintiff condition and the time the transport ambulance left the scene with plaintiff,on its way to kmc.
mobin statement in paragraph the subject of objection indicates his opinion was based on a belief plaintiff should have been transported immediately upon moses initial contact at,at.but that assumption is not supported by the admitted facts of this case.it ignores the time it took moses to determine that plaintiff should be transported to the hospital approximately five minutes between first contact and his call to have a transport ambulance dispatched.plaintiff does not contend that time constituted undue delay.in fact,plaintiff submitted the expert declaration of robert krause,a certified paramedic,who opined that a paramedic responding to an emergency situation must conduct both a primary survey and a secondary survey of the patient in order to determine and properly respond to the patient condition.he concluded moses failed to perform a complete primary survey and failed to conduct a thorough secondary survey.if anything,plaintiff theory of liability would have required that moses spend more time assessing plaintiff condition.
mobin opinion also ignored the time the standby ambulance crew spent applying spinal precautions prior to transporting plaintiff.plaintiff admitted it was appropriate for the standby crew to take those precautions.the exact time spent on the precautions is not known,but between and the standby crew applied the precautions,loaded plaintiff into the standby ambulance,and drove to the northeast corner of the football field to meet the transport ambulance.thus,the spinal precautions took something less than eight minutes.defendant submitted the expert declaration of charles flack,a licensed paramedic,who referred to an article in which the authors observed different teams of experienced paramedics and measured the time required for spinal immobilization.t he mean time required for proper spinal immobilization was minutes.the minimum time was minutes and the maximum was minutes.defendant computed an approximate two and minute delay,that might be considered unnecessary,by deducting from the eight minutes between and the approximate median time to complete the spinal precautions five minutes.
although mobin declared that he reviewed various materials,including plaintiff hospital records and some depositions,his declaration did not set out any of the relevant time periods,except that moses first contacted plaintiff at and plaintiff arrived at kmc at mobin repeatedly referred to the delay,without defining that term.he did not limit his opinions to unnecessary delay,explain which delays he attributed to defendant gross negligence,or specify the length of the delay on which he based his opinions.
mobin declaration identified the materials he reviewed as the basis for his opinion.they did not include the flack declaration,in which flack set out defendant calculations of the time period that might be considered unnecessary delay.mobin did not respond to or refute those time calculations.
mobin declaration reflects that he did review the declaration of defendant expert,david schriger,a physician board certified in emergency medicine.schriger declared that he reviewed the world research literature on the effect of upon patient outcome in subdural hematoma.he summarized the results of this research and found the concept that faster is better was not substantiated by the medical literature.he concluded there was no evidence in the literature to support the notion that delays in treatment in the range of to minutes affect patient outcome in cases of subdural hematoma.italics omitted.schriger estimated that the amount of time in issue the difference between the time of arrival at kmc if plaintiff had been transported by the standby ambulance and the actual time of arrival was two to minutes.he concluded there was absolutely no published evidence that a difference of this magnitude matters or that it would result in a worse outcome.mobin did not discuss schriger analysis or opinion.
mobin did not review the declaration of jeff victoroff,a neurologist,whose expert declaration was also submitted by defendant.victoroff observed that it would be unrealistic to expect the standby ambulance to immediately transport plaintiff at,without assessing him,declaring an emergency,applying spinal precautions,and loading him into the standby ambulance.although he stated the actual delay from the use of two ambulances was probably considerably less than the minutes between moses first contact with plaintiff and the activation of a code at,at the request of counsel,he considered whether a rational and informed fact finder could trace any increased severity in plaintiff outcome to a delay in transport of up to minutes.
based on his own review of the literature,victoroff endorsed schriger conclusion that there was no evidence in the literature to support the notion that delays in treatment in the range of to minutes affect patient outcome in cases of subdural hematoma.he added his own analysis of the medical literature and research studies and concluded they roughly agree it is probably better to get acute symptomatic subdural hematoma patients to the operating room within hours.plaintiff underwent surgery two hours minutes after onset of symptoms of a severe head injury,and the greatest part of this time was the one and hours between diagnosis at kmc and the start of surgery.victoroff opined by comparison,the time consumed transferring between ambulances was trivial.no scientific evidence whatsoever exists to support the contention that a difference of,or even minutes in a subdural hematoma patient arrival time will make the slightest difference in outcome.victoroff concluded,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,that a transport delay of up to minutes did not cause any difference in plaintiff outcome.the gut instinct that sooner is better every minute counts in intervention after acute subdural hematoma has never been supported by a single medical study in humans or any other species.no study,using any measure of outcome,has ever shown that a delay in arrival at the hospital makes the slightest difference in outcome.
mobin declaration indicates he did not review the declarations of flack and victoroff.although it indicated he reviewed schrager declaration,mobin did not respond to the content of that declaration.he did not controvert schrager analysis of the medical literature or the conclusions schrager drew from it.mobin did not provide any contrary medical literature or evidence supporting a different conclusion.he did not explain why he reached a different conclusion.in the challenged portions of paragraphs,and,mobin simply asserted the golden hour is critical and the quicker the subdural hematoma patient gets to the hospital,the better the outcome he then opined that the delay,which he apparently defined as the entire time from until the transport ambulance departed the scene,contributed to a more severe brain injury than if he had been taken to the hospital quicker.
mobin opinion that plaintiff should have been transported immediately at is not supported by the undisputed facts of this case.it was undisputed that it was necessary for the paramedic,moses,to assess plaintiff condition before determining the appropriate steps to take for his care it was also undisputed that the spinal precautions the standby crew took before transporting plaintiff were appropriate.thus,the only delay in issue was the time spent transferring plaintiff from one ambulance to the other prior to transporting him to the hospital.mobin did not establish that his opinions were based solely on this period of alleged delay.
plaintiff contends that,i n light of the rule of liberal construction,a reasoned explanation required in an expert declaration filed in opposition to a summary judgment motion need not be as detailed or extensive as that required in expert testimony presented in support of a summary judgment motion or at trial.the cases cited by plaintiff in support of this statement,jennifer los angeles unified school dist.th jennifer and powell,supra,th,did conclude that expert declarations opposing summary judgment need not be as detailed as those offered in support of it.however,they are distinguishable.
in jennifer,the plaintiff,a special needs student with a mental disability,was approached by another special needs student during lunch break she accompanied him to a secluded area of the campus,where he sexually assaulted her.jennifer,supra,th at.the school district moved for summary judgment,with evidence that tended to show adequate supervision the school had placed bright yellow chains around the alcove where the assault occurred,to indicate it was off limits the student body had been informed the area was off limits school employees and volunteer parents provided supervision during lunchtime four were assigned to supervise the area where the assault occurred one checked the alcove every six minutes during lunch school employees were not aware of any prior sexual assaults or other illicit activity during school hours in the alcove area.id.at.in opposition,the plaintiff submitted the declaration of an expert in school safety and supervision,who critiqued the supervision he opined that,if the supervision had been done in a reasonable manner,he would have expected that the students would have been found earlier or intercepted on the way to the alcove.id.at.the expert stated the plaintiff was particularly vulnerable to sexual assault,required close supervision,and would not have understood the significance of the yellow chains.id.at.in support of his opinions,the expert relied on his experience,the facts surrounding the incident,the plaintiff individualized educational plans,her psychological assessments,and other school records.id.at.on appeal,applying a liberal construction,the court found the expert opinions were adequately supported by a reasoned explanation,were not conclusory,and should not have been excluded.id.at.
in powell,the plaintiff sued the defendants for medical malpractice after they allegedly failed to promptly diagnose and treat an injury to his spinal cord.powell,supra,th at.defendant kleinman moved for summary judgment,submitting the declaration of an expert,based on his review of the medical records and depositions,stating that kleinman treatment of the plaintiff was reasonable,met the applicable standard of care,and did not cause the plaintiff injuries.id.at.in opposition,the plaintiff submitted an expert declaration by meub,based on review of the medical records and depositions,opining that kleinman breached the standard of care by failing to recognize weakness as a sign of spinal cord compromise,failing to obtain the results of a magnetic resonance imaging test mri performed four days earlier,and assuming,without confirmation,that hospital staff had tested for spinal cord compromise.id.at.the trial court sustained defendant objections to meub declaration on grounds including lack of foundation and lack of supporting evidence and granted summary judgment.id.at.
applying the rule of liberal construction to meub declaration in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,we concluded two of the defendant objections were properly sustained because the opinions expressed were not based on the facts and evidence presented.powell,supra,th at.however,two paragraphs of the declaration to which objections were sustained,which addressed kleinman failure to obtain the results of an mri and his assumption that hospital staff had tested for spinal cord compromise,were reasonably based on inferences from the medical records and undisputed facts.id.at.because these two paragraphs raised triable issues of material fact regarding both breach of duty and causation,summary judgment was precluded.id.at.
unlike the situation in this case,in jennifer and powell,the expert in issue did not assume facts contrary to the undisputed facts of the case.further,in those cases the moving papers did not include expert declarations making a prima facie showing that the medical literature refuted the assumptions on which the opponent expert opinions were based,leaving those opinions without a foundation upon which reasonable experts in the same field would rely.when the moving papers undermine the assumptions on which the opposing expert opinion is based,the opposing expert must do more than simply assert those discredited assumptions in order to meet the admissibility requirements of evidence code section,subdivision b.
in light of the evidence presented by the defense experts,mobin declaration failed to show that his conclusions regarding causation that the delay jeopardized plaintiff recovery and contributed to a more severe brain injury were b ased on matter that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject to which his testimony relates.evid.code,subd.b.this was not a case in which the experts relied on different medical studies or different interpretations of the medical literature to support their opinions in such a case,the court on summary judgment can not weigh the merits of the opinions or their foundations,but must leave that task to the trier of fact.garrett howmedica osteonics th.rather,the defense experts challenged the bases of mobin opinions and showed the assumptions on which the opinions were founded were not valid,according to the medical literature.mobin made no contrary showing.plaintiff did not refute defendant showing that mobin opinions were based on assumptions of fact without evidentiary support or on speculative or conjectural factors.such expert opinions have no evidentiary value and may be excluded from evidence.sargon,supra,cal th at bushling,supra,th at.
in shiffer cbs th shiffer,the plaintiff sued the successor of westinghouse,alleging he developed mesothelioma from exposure to westinghouse asbestos at a power plant in.id.at.defendant conceded that insulation for the turbine generator and certain related piping,installed at the plant in,contained westinghouse asbestos.id.at.in his deposition,the plaintiff testified that,when he arrived at the power plant in,construction was in its last stages and the main turbine insulation had already been installed.ibid.he observed some drains and smaller auxiliary lines being insulated,but his workstation was in another building.ibid.in his declaration in opposition to the defendant motion for summary judgment,the plaintiff was less specific about what work was already completed or still in progress upon his arrival.id.at.
the plaintiff experts opined that he was exposed to hazardous levels of respiratory asbestos during work on the turbines and this exposure was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff total aggregate exposure to asbestos.shiffer,supra,th at.the experts had not reviewed the plaintiff deposition testimony,however.the trial court excluded or did not consider the expert opinions on the grounds they lacked foundation and were speculative.ibid.it granted the defendant motion for summary judgment.
the reviewing court affirmed,finding the plaintiff evidence insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact.shiffer,supra,th at.there was no evidence the plaintiff was in the turbine room when the insulation for the turbine and related piping was installed,or that the insulation the plaintiff observed being installed was part of the insulation.id.at.the plaintiff experts did not have his deposition testimony,but only his less detailed declaration.thus,the experts,whose opinions on causation were essential to shiffer case citations,considered a significantly incomplete universe of information,leaving them without an adequate basis to conclude,as two of them did,that shiffer exposure to asbestos was hazardous and a substantial cause of his mesothelioma.an expert opinion is only as good as the facts on which it is built.id.at.the problem was foundational and the trial court did not err in excluding the experts opinions.id.at.
mobin similarly considered a significantly incomplete universe of information.he did not review flack analysis of the timing of events or victoroff analysis of relevant medical literature.he also apparently did not take into account the undisputed evidence that much of the time between moses first contact with plaintiff and the departure of the transport ambulance for the hospital was spent appropriately on assessment of plaintiff condition and application of spinal precautions.rather,he assumed,without evidentiary support,that the entire period from moses first contact with plaintiff to the departure of the transport ambulance from the football field constituted unnecessary delay attributable to the wrongful conduct of defendant.he also assumed,in the face of the defense experts medical literature to the contrary and without challenging that literature in any way,that any delay in reaching the hospital increased the severity of plaintiff outcome.
the trial court could reasonably have concluded mobin opinions as expressed in these challenged paragraphs were based on assumptions of fact without evidentiary support,were speculative or conjectural,and lacked a reasoned explanation of why the facts led to mobin conclusion regarding causation.accordingly,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining defendant objections to the challenged portions of paragraphs,and of mobin declaration.
defendant objection challenged the following statement by mobin in paragraph of his declaration 
according to plaintiff ct scans it is clear that plaintiff suffered a posterior artery stroke on the date of the incident as a result of the brain herniation from the delay in transport.
defendant objected that the statement was conclusory,lacked foundation,and assumed facts without evidentiary support.defendant challenged both mobin conclusion that the stroke occurred on the date of the incident and his conclusion it was caused by a delay in transport.
defendant experts,victoroff and greg zaharchuk,a neuroradiologist,addressed the issue of the stroke.zaharchuk reviewed plaintiff medical records and other materials,including the radiological images from various ct scans.he stated ct scans of plaintiff head,performed on october,at and october,at did not show a posterior cerebral artery pca stroke.it was first visible on a ct scan performed days later,on october,at.zaharchuk opined that there was nothing in the radiological findings from which anyone could reasonably conclude that it is more likely than not that plaintiff suffered his pca stroke prior to completion of the craniotomy at on.he based this conclusion on the size of the stroke and the fact that most strokes of this type and size will be apparent on a ct scan within hours of onset.since there was a time lapse of five hours between completion of the craniotomy and the october,ct scan,a stroke occurring prior to the completion of surgery would more likely than not have been visible on the scan.
victoroff agreed that the october ct scan was the first to show the pca stroke.he then considered in detail the likelihood the stroke occurred during different time periods,including the time period between injury and clinical deterioration approximately,between clinical deterioration and receipt of mannitol at,between receipt of mannitol and commencement of surgery,during the surgery itself,between completion of surgery and the october ct scan,and between the october ct scan and the october ct scan.victoroff asserted there was no current scientific strategy to determine exactly when a stroke occurred.he stated most strokes are visible on ct scans within six hours,and discussed the medical literature supporting this statement.he concluded that,if the stroke occurred at any time before plaintiff surgery,it was more probable than not that the stroke would have been visible on the ct scan on the morning of october.
regarding the cause of the pca stroke,zaharchuk expressed his opinion that there is nothing in the radiological findings from which a rational fact finder could conclude that it is more likely than not that but for a delay of up to minutes in transporting plaintiff to kern medical center,his outcome would have been less severe.he explained the basis for this opinion,then concluded therefore,the contention that plaintiff outcome was somehow made worse by a short delay in transport to the hospital can not be squared with the imaging findings and clinical history.
victoroff opined that,even if the stroke occurred prior to initiation of treatment at the hospital,there were no studies showing that the outcome from a posttraumatic stroke would be different if efforts were made to reduce intracranial pressure to minutes sooner.he stated that,even assuming the pca stroke occurred prior to surgery contrary to the most probable medical inferences,there was no way to measure how many neurons were lost as a result of delay and no way to correlate lost neurons to any measure of patient outcome.
mobin declaration explained that a subdural hematoma is a collection of blood in the space between the membranes covering the brain.the accumulated blood exerts pressure,shifting the intracranial contents away from the subdural hematoma.as the pressure increases,it impedes the blood and oxygen supply to the rest of the brain,which leads to further brain swelling.when the pressure reaches a critical level,the brain is forced through small orifices at the base of the skull,causing progressive decline in neurological function.ultimately,the part of the brain that herniates through the skull base openings will cease to function.
mobin opined that the signs and symptoms reflected in the kmc trauma history and physical,dated october,at,were consistent with brain herniation syndrome and plaintiff was facing impending brainstem herniation and brain death.as a consequence of the downward brain herniation,the arteries at the base of the brain can be compressed,resulting in stroke of the corresponding parts of the brain.according to plaintiff ct scans it is clear that plaintiff suffered a posterior artery stroke on the date of the incident as a result of the brain herniation from the delay in transport.
to be admissible,an expert opinion must be b ased on matter th
