we hold that labor code section and code of civil procedure section require verification of a petition to review a decision of the appeals board.after oral argument,we granted petitioner request to file a verified petition.thus,reaching the merits,we hold that california has a legitimate interest in an industrial injury when the applicant was employed by a california corporation and participated in other games and practices in california for nba teams,during the period of exposure causing cumulative injury.subjecting petitioner to california workers compensation law is reasonable and not a denial of due process.the decision of the appeals board is therefore affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
macklin claimed a cumulative trauma injury arising out of and occurring during the course of his employment as a professional basketball player while employed by multiple nba teams.for the cumulative injury period of his workers compensation claim,macklin was employed as follows august,through june,by the atlanta hawks insured for workers compensation by insurance company of north america june,through december,by petitioner permissibly and adjusted by murphy and beane,tpa late through mid to late by the albany patroons a minor league basketball team and september,through october,by the los angeles clippers workers compensation insurer was insurance company of north america,the adjusting agency of which was esis.the cumulative trauma period runs from august,through november.
during his time as a member of the atlanta hawks team,macklin played three games in california against california teams the los angeles lakers,the golden state warriors,and the diego clippers.when his team travelled out of state,it would arrive in the state in which the game was being played the day before the game and practice on the day of the game.
while employed by petitioner,macklin practiced in the morning and played in a game in california against the golden state warriors on november,he travelled to california with his team for a game against the diego clippers on december,and against the los angeles lakers on december.he did not play in those games against the clippers and the lakers,but he participated in practices and before those games.
in june of,macklin signed a contract with the los angeles clippers macklin attended the clippers training camp in california,and played in games in october.macklin was released by the clippers on october.
macklin testified that he was never advised about his right to file for workers compensation benefits while he was playing.he first learned about his workers compensation rights in approximately june from an nba player and filed his claim two months thereafter.while with atlanta,macklin received treatment for his back and other body parts.with petitioner,he engaged in intense workouts and felt stress and strains all over his body.he had other physical maladies such as dehydration and low back pain.
rulings of workers compensation judge wcj and appeals board 
the wcj concluded there was subject matter jurisdiction over macklin cumulative trauma claim because at least a portion of macklin cumulative trauma injury occurred within the state of california.the wcj also said it had personal jurisdiction over the three nba defendants atlanta hawks,petitioner,and los angeles clippers.each of the nba defendants engaged in basketball business activities within california.
the wcj found that macklin had sustained various injuries to his lower back and elsewhere as a result of his employment as a basketball player.the wcj concluded that the august,claim was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations because macklin first learned in june that his physical injuries were related to his employment as a professional basketball player and that he had potential or actual rights to workers compensation.the wcj also determined that the doctrine of laches did not bar the claim because the date of injury was delayed by the nba defendants failure to advise or give notice to macklin of his potential or actual rights to workers compensation.
macklin was found to be percent permanently disabled with no apportionment of the cause of the injury with other,nonindustrial reasons.petitioner sought reconsideration on the ground,inter alia,there was no subject matter jurisdiction because there was an insufficient relationship between california and the injuries suffered and lack of a legitimate interest in the matter to determine that california workers compensation law should apply as it pertains to petitioner.the wcj recommended that reconsideration be denied.
the appeals board affirmed the wcj award.the appeals board concluded that the effect of applicant work in this state while employed by his california employer,the los angeles clippers,along with the effect of his work within the state while employed by his other employers,establishes more than a de minimis connection between the injury and this state.according to the appeals board,there was no denial of due process in exerting subject matter jurisdiction over petitioner because california had a legitimate interest in allocating liability among macklin employers during the period of injury exposure.
petition for writ of review 
petitioner filed a timely,but unverified,petition for writ of review asserting a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in the petition,petitioner contended that macklin had no connection with california,and there is no indication of an injury in california.petitioner further argued that macklin one game in california as a new york knick,in which he suffered no injury,was de minimis and therefore could not create a legitimate interest for california in his injuries.
macklin objected to consideration of the petition because it was not verified.macklin also objected to petitioner forum selection of the second district.in reply,petitioner argued that verification is not required by rule of the california rules of court,which governs petitions for writs of review in workers compensation cases,and that the venue was proper.
we granted the petition for a writ of review.after oral argument,we permitted petitioner to file a verification of its petition,which petitioner then filed.
