during a grand jury proceeding,defendant gave a rambling,answer to a simple question.because there is insufficient evidence that statement c was material,defendant conviction for obstruction of justice in violation of is not supported by the record.whatever section scope may be in other circumstances,defendant conviction here must be reversed.
a reversal for insufficient evidence implicates defendant right under the double jeopardy clause.see united states preston,cir en banc citing burks united states.his conviction and sentence must therefore be vacated,and he may not be tried again on that count.
can a single answer by a grand jury witness support a conviction for obstruction of justice under 
defendant,who was then a professional baseball player,was summoned before a grand jury and questioned for nearly three hours about his suspected use of steroids.he was subsequently charged with four counts of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice,all based on his grand jury testimony.the jury convicted him on the obstruction count and was otherwise unable to reach a verdict.
the jury instructions identified seven of defendant statements that the government alleged obstructed justice.the jury,however,found only one statement obstructive.that statement was referred to as statement c at trial and is underlined in the passage below 
q did greg,your trainer,ever give you anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with 
a i only had one doctor touch me.and that my only personal doctor.greg,like i said,we do get into each others personal lives.we friends,but i do we do sit around and talk baseball,because he knows i do want do come to my house talking baseball.if you want to come to my house and talk about fishing,some other stuff,we be good friends.you come around talking about baseball,you go on.i do talk about his business.you know what i mean 
a that what keeps our friendship.you know,i am sorry,but that you know,that i was a celebrity child,not just in baseball by my own instincts.i became a celebrity child with a famous father.i just do get into other people business because of my father situation,you see.
defendant was again asked about injectable steroids immediately following this exchange and a few other times during his testimony.he provided direct responses to the questions.for example,he was asked whether he ever injected him self with anything that greg gave him.he responded i not that talented,no.the government believed that those answers were false but,as noted,the jury failed to convict defendant on the false statement counts.
the district court rejected defendant motion for acquittal on the obstruction count and a panel affirmed.united states bonds,cir.we granted en banc rehearing.united states bonds,cir.
title a,which defendant was convicted of violating,provides in relevant part as follows whoever corruptly or by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication,influences,obstructs,or impedes,or endeavors to influence,obstruct,or impede,the due administration of justice,shall be punished as provided in subsection b.known as the omnibus clause,this language was designed to proscribe all manner of corrupt methods of obstructing justice.united states rasheed,cir.we have held that a defendant corruptly obstructs justice if he acts with the purpose of obstructing justice.id.
as should be apparent,section coverage is vast.by its literal terms,it applies to all stages of the criminal and civil justice process,not just to conduct in the courtroom but also to trial preparation,discovery and pretrial motions.indeed,it arguably covers conduct taken in anticipation that a civil or criminal case might be filed,such as tax planning,hiding assets or talking to police.and the text of the omnibus clause,in concert with our definition of corruptly,encompasses any act that a jury might infer was intended to influence,obstruct,or impede the due administration of justice.that true even if no actual obstruction occurs,because the clause use of endeavors makes success irrelevant.see united states richardson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
stretched to its limits,section poses a significant hazard for everyone involved in our system of justice,because so much of what the adversary process calls for could be construed as obstruction.did a tort plaintiff file a complaint seeking damages far in excess of what the jury ultimately awards that could be viewed as corruptly endeavoring to influence the due administration of justice by seeking to recover more than the claim deserves.so could any of the following behaviors that make up the bread and butter of litigation filing an answer that denies liability for conduct that is ultimately adjudged wrongful or malicious unsuccessfully filing or opposing a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment seeking a continuance in order to inflict delay on the opposing party frivolously taking an appeal or petitioning for certiorari the list is endless.witnesses would be particularly vulnerable because,as the supreme court has noted,u nder the pressures and tensions of interrogation,it is not uncommon for the most earnest witnesses to give answers that are not entirely responsive.bronston united states.
lawyers face the most pervasive threat under such a regime.zealous advocacy sometimes calls for pushing back against an adversary just case and casting a despicable client in a favorable light,yet such conduct could be described as endeavor ing to impede the due administration of justice.even routine advocacy provides ample occasion for stumbling into the heartland of the omnibus clause sweeping coverage.oral arguments provide a ready example.one need not spend much time in one of our courtrooms to hear lawyers dancing around questions from the bench rather than giving pithy,direct answers.there is,for instance,the ever popular but that is not this case retort to a hypothetical,which could be construed as an effort to divert the court and thereby influence the due administration of justice.
it is true that any such maneuver would violate section only if it were done corruptly.but it is equally true that we have given corruptly such a broad construction that it does not meaningfully cabin the kind of conduct that is subject to prosecution.as noted,we have held that a defendant acts corruptly,as that term is used in section,if he does so with the purpose of obstructing justice.rasheed,at.in the examples above,a prosecutor could argue that a complaint was filed corruptly because it was designed to extort a nuisance settlement,or an answer was filed corruptly because its principal purpose was to pressure a needy plaintiff into an unjust settlement,or that the lawyer who parried a judicial hypothetical with but that is not this case was endeavoring to distract the court so it would reach a wrong result.that a jury or a judge might not buy such an argument is neither here nor there a criminal prosecution,even one that results in an acquittal,is a event.nor does an acquittal wipe clean the suspicion that a guilty defendant got off on a technicality.
we have no doubt that united states attorneys and their assistants would use the power to prosecute for such crimes judiciously,but that is not the point.making everyone who participates in our justice system a potential criminal defendant for conduct that is nothing more than the ordinary tug and pull of litigation risks chilling zealous advocacy.it also gives prosecutors the immense and unreviewable power to reward friends and punish enemies by prosecuting the latter and giving the former a pass.the perception that prosecutors have such a potent weapon in their arsenal,even if never used,may well dampen the fervor with which lawyers,particularly those representing criminal defendants,will discharge their duties.the amorphous nature of the statute is also at odds with the constitutional requirement that individuals have fair notice as to what conduct may be criminal.see united states jdt,cir citing skilling united states.
because the statute sweeps so broadly,due process calls for prudential limitations on the government power to prosecute under it.such a limitation already exists in our case law interpreting section the requirement of materiality.see united states thomas,cir.materiality screens out many of the statute troubling applications by limiting convictions to those situations where an act has a natural tendency to influence,or was capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body.see kungys united states,internal quotation marks omitted thomas,at.put another way,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the charged conduct was capable of influencing a decisionmaking person or example,by causing it to cease its investigation,pursue different avenues of inquiry or reach a different outcome.see united states mckenna,cir finding statement material because it could have affected the process weinstock united states,noting that,to be material,a statement must have some weight in the process of reaching a decision.
in weighing materiality,we consider the intrinsic capabilities of the statement itself,rather than the statement actual effect on the decisionmaker,see united states serv.deli,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and we evaluate the statement in the context in which it was made,united states rigas,cir see also united states mcbane,cir weinstock,at noting that in context,a statement was rob bed of any materiality any possible influence upon the decisionmaker in reaching its decision.
we start with the proposition that statement c,standing alone,did not have the capacity to divert the government from its investigation or influence the grand jury decision whether to indict anyone.here it is again 
that what keeps our friendship.you know,i am sorry,but that you know,that i was a celebrity child,not just in baseball by my own instincts.i became a celebrity child with a famous father.i just do get into other people business because of my father situation,you see.
the statement says absolutely nothing pertinent to the subject of the grand jury investigation.even when paired with the question that prompted it,
did greg ever give you anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with 
statement c communicates nothing of value or detriment to the investigation.had the answer been i afraid of needles,it would have been plausible to infer an unspoken denial,with the actual words serving as an explanation or elaboration.but,as given,the answer did not enlighten,obfuscate,confirm or deny anything within the scope of the question posed.
the most one can say about this statement is that it was and thereby impeded the investigation to a small degree by wasting the grand jury time and trying the prosecutors patience.but witness examinations,unlike those in movies and on television,invariably are littered with and irrelevant answers.this happens when the speaker does understand the question,begins to talk before thinking lawyers do this with surprising frequency,wants to avoid giving a direct answer ditto,or is temporizing.courtrooms are environments and a certain number of or irrelevant statements can be expected as part of the of courtroom discourse.because some answers are among the road hazards of witness examination,any one such statement is not,standing alone,capable of influencing the decision of a decisionmaking body.see thomas,at.
this is true even if,as the government now argues,statement c is literally false.an irrelevant or wholly answer says nothing germane to the subject of the investigation,whether it true or false.for example,if a witness is asked,do you own a gun it makes no difference whether he answers the sky is blue or the sky is green.that the second statement is false makes it no more likely to impede the investigation than the first.
statement c does not,however,stand alone.it was a small portion of a much longer examination,and we must look at the record as a whole to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the statement capable of influencing the grand jury investigation,in light of defendant entire grand jury testimony.if,for example,a witness engages in a pattern of irrelevant statements,or launches into lengthy disquisitions that are clearly designed to waste time and preclude the questioner from continuing his examination,the jury could find that the witness behavior was capable of having some sway.
on careful review of the record,we find insufficient evidence to render statement c material.in conducting this review,we are mindful that we must give the jury the benefit of the doubt and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of its verdict.see jackson virginia.at the same time,we must conduct our review with some rigor for the prudential reasons discussed above.see supra.
the government charged a total of seven statements,only one of which the jury found to be obstructive.two of these statements including statement c appear to be wholly irrelevant verbal detours with no bearing on the proceedings.one statement is i do know,followed by a brief explanation for the lack of knowledge.the rest are direct answers that the government claimed were false,all concerning whether defendant trainer had provided or injected him with steroids.in the context of three hours of grand jury testimony,these six additional statements are insufficient to render the otherwise innocuous statement c material.if this were enough to establish materiality,few witnesses or lawyers would be safe from prosecution.
i agree that no reasonable juror could have found bonds guilty of violating.
bonds was convicted of obstructing justice by offering a misleading or evasive statement statement c to the grand jury.the government expressly declined to seek a conviction on the grounds that statement c was false when evaluating whether the evidence was sufficient to show that statement c violated,we must determine whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia.this standard of review requires us to determine whether the jury could draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.id.in this particular case,we must determine whether a single truthful but evasive or misleading answer could constitute evidence of obstruction of justice under.it can not.
section a punishes those who corruptly influence,obstruct,or impede,or endeavor to influence,obstruct,or impede,the due administration of justice.the supreme court has imposed a materiality requirement on the broad reach of,requiring that the endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice.united states aguilar,internal quotation marks omitted.the government is required to prove materiality to the jury.united states gaudin.the supreme court further instructs us,when dealing with the sweeping language of,to exercise restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute out of concern that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand,of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.aguilar,at internal quotation marks omitted.
congress could not have intended to be so broadly applied as to reach a single truthful but evasive statement such as statement c.our conclusion that statement c could not have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury investigative function stems from two sources the government duty to clarify merely misleading or evasive testimony and relevant precedent indicating that the government must show that truthful but misleading or evasive testimony must amount to a refusal to testify before it is material.taken together,these two sources lead to the conclusion that a single truthful but evasive or misleading statement can not satisfy materiality requirement 
the supreme court decision in bronston united states,requires the conclusion that statement c does not violate.although bronston dealt with a conviction for perjury,the supreme court language regarding the government duty to conduct competent and thorough questioning is illuminating.in short,t he burden is on the questioner to pin the witness down to the specific object of the questioner inquiry.id.at.extending reach to transient evasive or misleading statements would obviate the prosecutor duty to thoroughly examine the witness.id.at noting that competent should be conducted by counsel alert as every examiner ought to be to the incongruity of the witness unresponsive answer.it would be contrary to the statute purpose to allow the government to permit an evasive or misleading statement to go unchallenged,in the hopes of obtaining an obstruction of justice conviction later.the government is obligated to do all it can to obtain a direct statement in response to its questioning.the function of the grand jury may be impaired by lax questioning as much,if not more than,an inarticulate or wandering answer.
bronston counsels that,to convict a defendant for violating,the jury must find more than that the witness uttered an evasive or misleading statement at some point during his testimony the natural and probable effect of a single truthful but evasive or misleading statement is merely to prompt questions.given this burden,statement c did not have the natural or probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice,because the government had a duty to clarify any single misleading or evasive statement bonds made.
the supreme court materiality standard reinforces bronston core holding we should not find liability for a single statement that is merely misleading or evasive.the materiality requirement is a primary objective limitation on expansive reach.see united states thomas,cir.this materiality standard necessarily takes into account the context of the charged conduct,evaluating whether the misleading or evasive statement could have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administrative of justice given the entirety of a witness examination.aguilar,us.at internal quotation marks omitted.the government may not isolate a single statement,prove it misleading or evasive,and argue that the statement is material based solely on that fact.
evasive or misleading statements are different from false statements.instead of providing the tribunal with bad information,information that can be evaluated for its capability to influence,a misleading or evasive statement is meant to divert or slow the function in the first instance it does not so much influence an investigation as divert it by depriving the question of its force.in this sense,offering evasive or misleading testimony is closely analogous to the destruction of evidence.see united states rasheed,cir the destruction or concealment of documents can fall within the prohibition of the statute by suppress ing evidence.we should evaluate the materiality of evasive or misleading testimony the same way for its capability to impede the investigative function of the grand jury.
the fifth circuit explanation of the materiality standard in united states griffin is particularly persuasive precedent.a false,misleading,or evasive statement may be material,taken in the context of the entire examination,when it amounts to a flat refusal to testify.united states griffin,cir.evasive or misleading testimony,in this light,can only obstruct the due administration of justice when it completely thwarts the investigative nature of the tribunal when it derails the grand jury as effectively as if the witness refused to answer the question at all.id.the proper question is not whether a statement had the intrinsic capability to influence the grand jury,but whether the statement,viewed in the context of the witness testimony as a whole,closed off entirely the avenue of inquiry being pursued by the grand jury.united states brown,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also united states cohn,cir the blatantly evasive witness achieves th e effect of impeding the gathering of relevant evidence as surely by erecting a screen of feigned forgetfulness as one who burns files or induces a potential witness to absent himself.
applying the materiality standard a single truthful but evasive or misleading statement can never be material.our examination of statement c a single evasive or misleading statement reveals why.no rational juror could have found that statement c amounted to a refusal to testify,such that bonds testimony thwarted the grand jury investigative function.
in summary,the natural and probable effect of a single true but evasive response to the government questioning is not to impede the grand jury but,rather,to prompt questioning.a statement that goes off into the cosmos merely triggers the prosecutor duty to pin the witness down and elicit a clear response.indeed,that is exactly what happened in this case.faced with a rambling response,the prosecutor restated the same question and elicited a direct,unambiguous answer from bonds no.no rational juror could conclude that bonds refused to answer the question it is plain in the record that bonds gave his testimony to the grand jury.further,this is thus not a situation in which a witness testified evasively for so long and with such persistence that the grand jury investigation would likely have been thwarted,as would be required for the testimony to be material.statement c was therefore not material,and bonds conviction must be reversed.
because i concur not only with the per curiam opinion but also with parts of judge kozinski and judge smith opinions while disagreeing with other parts,i offer my separate views regarding what is in a fact a very simple case,as well as my thoughts concerning the proper construction of,the obstruction of justice statute.
my answer to the question with which judge kozinski begins his opinion,can a single answer by a grand jury witness support a conviction for obstruction of justice under.is simple no.my response would be the same regardless of the context in which the answer was given.
i reach the conclusion that bonds statement c was not material and thus could not and did not obstruct justice on different and narrower grounds than does judge kozinksi.i do not agree,for example,with his opinion sweeping statements regarding the scope of the statute or with its intimations that answers that are not later cured by way of direct replies might constitute obstruction of justice.similarly,i would not suggest that there may be a category of or irrelevant answers that could be characterized as evasive or misleading and thus subject to differing treatment from other kinds of answers.
in my opinion,statement c can not be said to have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice.united states aguilar,as judge kozinski himself puts it,it says absolutely nothing pertinent to the subject of the grand jury investigation.kozinski op.at.at most,statement c was,and in no respect could it or did it constitute a criminal act.
i concur with judge kozinski opinion as well as judge smith insofar as they state that statement c could not have been material even if it had been false.a nonresponsive answer that is false is no more likely to impede the investigation than a answer that is true.kozinski op.at see also smith op.at.indeed,even perjured relevant testimony need not necessarily obstruct or halt the judicial process.in re michael,emphasis added explaining that contempt for obstruct ing the administration of justice,under predecessor statute to,required more than a false statement.i also agree heartily with judge kozinski statements that a certain number of or irrelevant statements can be expected as part of the of courtroom discourse,and that we must consider the practicalities of witness examinations when interpreting the statute.kozinski op.at.moreover,in my view the appropriate course in the event of material false testimony is a perjury prosecution,not a prosecution for obstruction of justice.in fact,the prosecutors tried to convict bonds of perjury on several counts in this very proceeding,but had no better luck with the jury in that effort than they have had with this court on today appeal.
unlike judge kozinski,i concur with the part of judge smith opinion that would hold that the natural and probable effect test articulated in united states aguilar constitutes the proper standard for materiality with respect to i also concur with the part of judge smith opinion that would hold that under bronston united states,the natural and probable effect of statement c is merely that counsel will have to ask questions.faced with a statement that is unresponsive on its face,id.at,i t is the responsibility of the lawyer to probe testimonial interrogation is a probing,prying,pressing form of inquiry.if a witness evades,it is the lawyer responsibility to recognize the evasion and to bring the witness back to the mark,to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.id.at.in the instant case,the prosecutors did exactly that they continued to press bonds until he gave a direct answer.
the breadth of judge kozinski opinion,its unwarranted speculation regarding context,and its use of united states thomas,cir,rather than aguilar,at,to define the materiality requirement prevent me from joining more of that opinion than i have.as to judge smith opinion,i find it in several respects more persuasive than judge kozinski,especially in its use of the aguilar standard for materiality and its discussion of bronston.however,in the end,i can not join that opinion either,for several reasons.one,i disagree that a flat refusal to testify may be prosecuted under.two,i do not agree that answers are in any respect closely analogous to the destruction of evidence.smith op.at.in my view,had bonds refused to testify or continued to answer evasively,the appropriate course would have been a contempt proceeding,not an obstruction of justice prosecution.see in re grand jury proceedings,ortloff,cir.three,i do not agree with the unnecessary and,in my view,incorrect discussion of misleading or evasive testimony or with his implicit endorsement of united states griffin,cir,as the proper rule for this circuit.see smith op.at.
many fundamental questions persist regarding the meaning and scope of,notwithstanding our court broad construction of the statute in the past,see generally united states rasheed,cir,and the supreme court indication of a similar view in dictum in aguilar,see generally.both judge kozinski and judge smith opinions have much to commend them.however,neither succeeds in its efforts to answer the critical questions regarding the purpose and role of the statute,in judge smith case at least,partly because of currently conflicting circuit law that he may,understandably,be reluctant to overrule in light of the supreme court dictum in aguilar.see smith op.at.rather than attempting to resolve those problems in this case,however,i would simply hold that bonds answer in no way constitutes a violation of because it is and thus,and that his prosecution for the charged offense was therefore wholly unwarranted under the law.i would leave the rest of the speculation and the unnecessary,if not erroneous,analysis in my colleagues opinions to another time,preferably after the supreme court has spoken.
my own view is that should not be construed as covering testimony of witnesses at court proceedings.i explain my reading of the statute only briefly in light of what appears to me to be the supreme court current view of the law a view that also causes me to refrain from suggesting at this time that we overrule ninth circuit cases that construe overly broadly,see rasheed,at,or that apply it to testimony.see thomas,at.although our court has previously affirmed a conviction based on testimony,see,the supreme court has never done so and has indicated its view only in dictum contained in aguilar.see at.given the history and circumstances of,i would hope that the court would not follow the aguilar dictum when it confronts the issue directly 
the history underlying strongly supports the conclusion that testimony is not a subject of criminal sanctions under that statute.the predecessor to was originally enacted in in response to abuse of the contempt power by a federal district judge who had imprisoned a man for publishing a criticism of one of his opinions.nye united states.in establishing the crime of obstruction of justice,congress created,as nye put it,a geographical divide between the conduct constituting that crime and conduct subject to contempt misbehavior of any person or persons in the presence of said courts,or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice constituted contempt under section of the act of march,whereas persons outside of court who corruptly,or by threats of force,obstruct,or impede,or endeavor to obstruct or impede,the due administration of justice committed the crime of obstruction of justice under section.id.at emphasis added.section survives today as u,the contempt statute,while section became the clause of at issue in this case.thus,the original understanding of the crime of obstruction of justice was that it applied to conduct outside the presence of a court.such was and is the intent of congress,and w e can not by process of interpretation obliterate the distinctions which congress drew.nye,at.
when one considers the other criminal statutes available to punish misbehavior by a witness that is,misconduct during testimony this geographical delineation,id.at,whereby only conduct constitutes obstruction of justice under,makes sense.a false statement made during testimony constitutes perjury.see.a failure to answer a question or a material evasion that the witness refuses to correct during testimony constitutes contempt.i seriously doubt that the obstruction of justice statute was intended to duplicate these crimes.something more than a witness merely lying or being during testimony is required in order to violate.otherwise,the crime of obstruction of justice would be to that extent wholly superfluous.
more important,the argument for coverage of such actions under hinges entirely on the single word corruptly.the other specified means of obstructing justice enumerated in that section by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication when viewed in context dictate the opposite conclusion corruptly does not describe the conduct of a witness,but rather,like those enumerated means,describes the conduct of a third party who seeks to obstruct the proceedings.the specified means necessarily describe the attempts of a third party to affect the judicial proceedings by corrupt means.as judge fletcher explains,the interpretative canon noscitur a sociis literally i t is known from its associates tells us that the meaning of questionable or doubtful words or phrases in a statute may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of other words or phrases associated with it.black law dictionary ed.because obstructing proceedings by threats or force plainly refers to the conduct of persons outside of court who seek to obstruct the proceedings and not to the witness who is testifying in court in the proceedings,corruptly must similarly be understood as referring to the means used by third parties to influence,obstruct,or impede proceedings,and not to testimony by a witness who may well be the object but not the subject of the corrupt tactics.
even if covered conduct,corruptly would,under the noscitur a sociis canon,as well as under any other reasonable means of statutory construction,require a greater magnitude of misconduct than simply giving a false or answer to a question.clearly,a mere lie or evasive answer is not akin to using threats or force to cause another to lie.indeed,the supreme court has on occasion recognized that lies and evasive answers are part and parcel of the process of uncovering the truth through adversarial witness examination.see bronston,at michael,at.the use of threats or force to impede a proceeding,by contrast,is not a customary incident of that process and constitutes a far more serious offense.corruptly in the obstruction of justice statute covers conduct at the same level of obstruction as the use of threats or force and may not properly be interpreted so as to bring a mere lie or evasive answer by a witness within the scope of the statute.although i am not certain that corruptly is limited to bribery as judge fletcher contends,i am wholly confident that it does describe conduct of that magnitude and not a simple lie or evasive answer by a witness during testimony.
for the reasons discussed above,i would hope that the supreme court would revisit its dictum in aguilar and would conclude that does not cover a witness testimony.after all,congress has enacted criminal statutes other than that sufficiently address a witness conduct.the problems created by the misuse of by overeager prosecutors to punish witnesses for what they say in court are all too evident from the facts of this case.it is time for them to cease using that section as a substitute for vigorous or for the criminal statutes that properly apply to testimony.
in short,this case involves nothing more than an irrelevant,rambling statement made by a witness during the course of a grand jury investigation.statement c was not material and could not possibly have interfered with the due administration of justice.i therefore concur in the per curiam opinion and the parts of judge kozinski and judge smith opinions that i have identified above.bonds conviction for obstruction of justice can not stand and he may not be retried on the same charge.
i strongly but respectfully disagree with the rationale advanced by the per curiam opinion and by the principal concurrence.i concur only in the judgment.
the issue before us is the meaning of the federal obstruction of justice statute,a.section a provides,in relevant part 
whoever corruptly,or by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication,endeavors to influence,intimidate,or impede any grand or petit juror,or officer in or of any court of the united states or corruptly or by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication,influences,obstructs,or impedes,or endeavors to influence,obstruct,or impede,the due administration of justice,shall be punished as provided in subsection b.
emphasis added.section a applies to obstruction of justice,as defined by the statute,in both criminal and civil proceedings.section b provides punishments of varying severities,depending on the nature of the act.the most lenient punishment is imprisonment for not more than years,a fine under this title,or both.id.b.
bonds was prosecuted under the second,or omnibus,clause of a,the emphasized portion above.the government and the principal concurrence read the word corruptly at the beginning of the clause to refer to a state of mind,meaning with intent to influence,intimidate,or impede the due administration of justice.they read the clause as criminalizing even entirely truthful statements,so long as those statements are made with such intent.
in the government view,any truthful answer given in the course of civil or criminal litigation,if intended to influence,obstruct,or impede the administration of justice,violates the omnibus clause.at oral argument,the government made terrifyingly clear the result of its reading of the statute.the government contended that the obstruction statute criminalizes a truthful but intentionally evasive or misleading answer to an interrogatory in civil litigation.the government also contended that the statute criminalizes a truthful but intentionally evasive or misleading answer during appellate oral argument 
q i think it a common experience among all of us on the appellate court to ask of the lawyer in front of us in a criminal case that come up on appeal counsel,could you please explain to me what happened at trial and for the lawyer arguing from the attorney office to say,your honor,i was not the trial attorney.now,sometimes that an evasive answer.they may well know the answer,but it true that they were the trial attorney has the lawyer just committed a crime t he answer that i just hypothesized was designed to put me off the track a truthful but evasive answer.
a i think that would be obstructive,your honor.
when asked how many san francisco lawyers it planned to throw in jail,the government declined to specify.
the principal concurrence agrees with the government reading of the statute.but it seeks to limit the scope of its operation,writing,because the statute sweeps so broadly,due process calls for prudential limitations on the government power to prosecute under it.concurrence at.according to the concurrence,due process and prudence dictate that a truthful but intentionally evasive or misleading statement can be prosecuted under the statute only if it was material.id.at.the concurrence defines material as capable of influencing a decisionmaking person or entity.id.at.
applying its definition of materiality,the principal concurrence tells us that bonds wandering and answer was not material and therefore not criminal,even if given with intent to influence,obstruct,or impede.it concludes,statement c,standing alone,did not have the capacity to divert the government from its investigation or influence the grand jury decision whether to indict anyone.id.at.the concurrence contrasts bonds answer with an answer that would have been criminal.bonds was asked,did greg ever give you anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with if bonds had answered i afraid of needles,the concurrence tells us that he could have been successfully prosecuted.id.at.if bonds had given that answer,it would have been plausible to infer an unspoken denial,with the actual words serving as an explanation or elaboration.id.
the principal concurrence prudential narrowing of the government power to prosecute is hardly reassuring.an attorney who provides a truthful but evasive answer to an interrogatory in civil litigation often does so in the hope that his answer will influence the decisionmaking person who receives it.if there is a reasonable chance that the hope will be realized,the attorney is a criminal.an appellate attorney who answers during oral argument,i was not the trial attorney,sometimes knows what happened at trial but gives that answer in the hope that the judge will not pursue the matter.this attorney,too,may be a criminal.
i disagree.the omnibus clause of a is not an provision whose constitutionality we can uphold only by manufacturing a prudential limitation on the government power to prosecute.rather,it is a narrowly targeted provision that had a specific meaning when enacted and whose text has remained substantially unchanged for over years.the key to a proper understanding of the statute is the meaning of the word corruptly.
meaning of corruptly 
as used in a,corruptly does not describe a state of mind.rather,it describes a forbidden means of influencing,obstructing,or impeding the due administration of justice.as used in a,corruptly most likely means by bribery.there are two arguments supporting this reading first,the text of the statute second,a comparison with,the federal perjury statute.
text of the statute 
the predecessor to a was enacted in,in reaction to perceived overreaching by a federal judge who had held a lawyer in contempt for an writing.see walter nelles carol weiss king,contempt by publication in the united states to the federal contempt statute,colum.the statute had two parts.the first described,and set limits on,the contempt power of federal judges.the second,at issue in this case,criminalized conduct that improperly sought to influence judicial proceedings.section a is the successor to the second part.
the statute read,in relevant part 
and be it further enacted,that if any person or persons shall,corruptly,or by threats or force,endeavor to influence,intimidate,or impede any juror,witness,or officer,in any court of the united states,in the discharge of his duty,or shall corruptly,or by threats or force,obstruct or impede,or endeavor to obstruct or impede,the due administration of justice therein,every person or persons,so offending,shall be liable to prosecution therefor 
act of,ch,stat,emphasis added.for convenience,i quote again the corresponding provisions of the modern a 
whoever corruptly,or by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication,endeavors to influence,intimidate,or impede any grand or petit juror,or officer in or of any court of the united states,in the discharge of his duty or corruptly or by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication,influences,obstructs,or impedes,or endeavors to influence,obstruct,or impede,the due administration of justice,shall be punished as provided in subsection b.
a emphasis added.the omnibus clause,highlighted above,is at issue here.
there are three differences between the omnibus clause as originally enacted in and as it appears today.first,in,congress enacted a provision that prohibited obstruction by threatening letters,or any threatening communications,in addition to the prohibitions on obstruction corruptly and by threats or force.act of june,ch,stat.as part of the general revision and codification of the federal criminal code in,congress simplified the statute by replacing any threatening letters,or any threatening communications,with any threatening letter or communication.act of,ch,stat.second,the law prohibited obstructing or impeding the administration of justice.the statute added a prohibition against influencing its administration.act of june,ch,stat.third,as part of the revision,the comma after corruptly was dropped,almost certainly inadvertently.act of,ch,stat.there had been a comma after the word corruptly in both the first and omnibus clauses in the and statutes,and a comma was retained after corruptly in the first clause of the obstruction statute.see act of,ch,stat,act of june,ch,stat,act of,ch,stat.no reason was given in for dropping the comma after the word corruptly in the second,omnibus clause.
as written in,the omnibus clause provided two methods,separated by commas,by which a person could improperly obstruct or impede the due administration of justice.a person could do it corruptly,or he could do it by threats or force.as written in,the clause provided three such methods,again separated by commas,by which a person could improperly influence,obstruct,or impede the due administration of justice.a person could do it corruptly,by threats or force,or by threatening letters,or any threatening communications.finally,as revised and codified in,the clause continued to provide three means,now partially separated by commas,by which a person could influence,obstruct,or impede a person could do it corruptly,by threats or force,or by threatening letter or communication.the omnibus clause has remained essentially unchanged since the general revision and codification.
a commonsensical interpretive principle is that words mean what they conveyed to reasonable people at the time they were written.antonin scalia bryan garner,reading law the interpretation of legal text.the american dictionary of the english language,published three years before the enactment of the original version of a,gave two definitions for corruptly 
in a corrupt manner with corruption viciously wickedly without integrity.we have dealt very corruptly against thee.nehemiah.
by bribery.a judgment was obtained corruptly.
a contemporaneous document,as well as an interpretive canon,show that when it wrote the word corruptly,congress was likely using the narrow and specific second definition.
the national intelligencer,publisher of the register of debates and the predecessor to what later became the congressional record,reported an action of the house of representatives on the senate bill that became the statute.it reported that on wednesday,march,the house amended and then agreed to the senate bill punishing attempts to corrupt or intimidate jurors 
the senate amendments to the act declaratory of the powers of the courts of the united states on the subject of contempts adding a second section for punishing all attempts to corrupt or intimidate jurors,was amended on the suggestion of buchanan,and then agreed to.
twenty first congress,second session,daily national intelligencer,emphasis added.the reference is to the first clause rather than the omnibus clause of the statute,but there is no reason to believe that corruptly had different meanings in the two parallel clauses.the national intelligencer use of the infinitive,to corrupt,in connection with the direct object,jurors,indicates that the prohibition against acting corruptly was a prohibition against a specific act corrupting,or attempting to corrupt,jurors,and thereby obstructing or impeding justice.that is,the prohibition against acting corruptly was a narrow and specific prohibition against bribing jurors,using the second definition.it was not a broad general prohibition against acting wickedly or viciously in obstructing or impeding justice.
the text following the word corruptly in the omnibus clause of a reinforces the conclusion that it means by bribery.in the current version,there are three specific forbidden methods of influencing,obstructing,or impeding the due administration of justice corruptly,by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication.in the version,there were two specific forbidden methods corruptly,or by threats or force.where statutory terms are susceptible of multiple and meanings those meanings are narrowed by the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis which counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.united states williams.the maxim noscitur a sociis,while not an inescapable rule,is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the acts of congress.jarecki searle,see also united states kimsey,cir even when an interpretation is conceivable based on etymology alone,that definition is severely undermined when it is illogical in light of the neighboring statutory terms.
the text of the omnibus clause of a is precisely the kind of text to which the canon applies.several methods of obstructing the administration of justice are listed immediately following the word corruptly by threats,by force,by threatening letter,and by threatening communication.these are not states of mind.they are specific methods of obstructing justice.we can read corruptly as describing a state of mind.or we can read it as describing another specific method of influencing,obstructing,or impeding the due administration of justice.the canon of noscitur a sociis,as well as common sense,instruct us to choose the latter.
read in light of a contemporaneous dictionary meaning of corruptly,in light of the contemporaneous report on the bill that became the predecessor to a,and in light of the noscitur a sociis canon,i conclude that a forbids individuals from obstructing the administration of justice by bribery,by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication.
comparison to perjury 
a comparison of the federal obstruction of justice statute with the federal perjury statute reinforces the conclusion that corruptly means by bribery.the obstruction of justice statute prescribes different ranges of punishment depending on the act.the most lenient is imprisonment for not more than years,a fine under this title,or both.b.the federal perjury statute,by contrast,prescribes only one range of punishment.it provides that someone found guilty of perjury shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
if we accept the principal concurrence reading of the word corruptly,a person who makes a material truthful statement with the intent to influence,obstruct,or impede the due administration of justice may be punished by a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.a person who makes a material untruthful statement with the same intent may be punished by a term of imprisonment of up to only half that.it makes no sense for congress to punish a truthful statement more severely than a lie.if,on the other hand,we accept that corruptly means by bribery in a,the disparity in punishment makes perfect sense.
in bronston united states,the court explained the difference between truthful but misleading statements,on the one hand,and perjurious statements,on the other.the court faced a question related to the question now before us whether a witness may be convicted of perjury for an answer,under oath,that is literally true but not responsive to the question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.id.at.
the government had charged bronston with violating,the federal perjury statute,based on statements he had made at a hearing before a bankruptcy referee.when asked whether he had ever had any bank accounts in swiss banks,bronston replied that his company had an account there for about six months,in zurich.id.at.bronston did not mention that he had previously had a personal bank account in geneva.id.bronston answer was true.his company had indeed had an account in zurich.however,his answer,while true,was designed to mislead the questioner.the united states successfully prosecuted bronston for perjury on the theory that he had testified under oath with literal truthfulness but unresponsively.id.at.the court reversed bronston conviction because the federal perjury statute can not be construed to sustain a conviction based on his answer.id.at.
the court explained,w e perceive no reason why congress would intend the drastic sanction of a perjury prosecution to cure a testimonial mishap that could readily have been reached with a single additional question by counsel alert as every examiner ought to be to the incongruity of bronston unresponsive answer.id.at.if a witness evades,it is the lawyer responsibility to recognize the evasion and to bring the witness back to the mark,to flush out the whole truth with the tools of adversary examination.id.at.this is so even when a witness answers were not guileless but were shrewdly calculated to evade.id.at.
the court rejected the very argument that the government makes in the case now before us 
it is no answer to say that here the jury found that the witness intended to mislead his examiner.a jury should not be permitted to engage in conjecture whether an unresponsive answer,true and complete on its face,was intended to mislead or divert the examiner the state of mind of the witness is relevant only to the extent that it bears on whether he does not believe his answer to be true.to hold otherwise would be to inject a new and confusing element into the adversary testimonial system we know.witnesses would be unsure of the extent of their responsibility for the misunderstandings and inadequacies of examiners,and might well fear having that responsibility tested by a jury under the vague rubric of intent to mislead or perjury by implication.the seminal modern treatment of the history of the offense concludes that one consideration of policy overshadowed all others during the years when perjury first emerged as a offense that the measures taken against the offense must not be so severe as to discourage witnesses from appearing or testifying.
id.at citation omitted.simply put,any special problems arising from the literally true but unresponsive answer are to be remedied through the questioner acuity and not by a federal perjury prosecution.id.at.
the government and the principal concurrence brush bronston aside.that is not so easily done,for the court reasoning is as applicable to this case as to bronston.in either case,a jury should not be permitted to engage in conjecture whether an unresponsive answer,true and complete on its face,was intended to mislead or divert the examiner.id.at.to hold otherwise would be to inject a new and confusing element into the adversary testimonial system we know.id.further,and perhaps more important,if the concurrence is right about the meaning of corruptly in a,the court careful parsing of the perjury statute in bronston was wasted effort.if the concurrence is right,a prosecutor seeking to convict someone who may or may not have testified truthfully will never need to pursue a perjury conviction.the prosecutor can get an obstruction of justice conviction,carrying twice the penalty,for half the effort.
ii.united states aguilar 
supreme court dictum describing a does not change my conclusion.in united states aguilar,the court reversed a conviction of district judge robert aguilar for obstruction of justice in violation of the omnibus clause of a.a grand jury had been investigating a conspiracy to influence another district judge.one of the suspected conspirators,abe chapman,was a distant relation of aguilar.when aguilar learned that chapman had been named in a federal wiretap authorization,aguilar warned him.during a subsequent grand jury investigation,fbi agents questioned aguilar about his knowledge of the wiretap and the underlying conspiracy.aguilar falsely stated that he did not know about either.his false statements provided the basis for his conviction under the omnibus clause.
the supreme court reversed the conviction because t he action taken by the accused must be with an intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings it is not enough that there be an intent to influence some ancillary proceeding,such as an investigation independent of the court or grand jury authority.id.at.in other words,the endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice.id.quotation marks omitted.
in dictum,the court distinguished false statements made to an fbi agent from statements made directly to a grand jury.the court assumed that such statements made to the grand jury would be covered by the omnibus clause.it wrote that aguilar conduct falls on the other side of the statutory line from that of one who delivers false documents or testimony to the grand jury itself.conduct of the latter sort all but assures that the grand jury will consider the material in its deliberations.id.at.
if i were compelled to treat the court dictum as a controlling statement of law,i would not be able to argue consistent with the view of the supreme court,that the word corruptly in a means by bribery.but i do not believe i am so compelled.we do not treat considered dicta from the supreme court lightly,because it serves as a prophecy of what that court might hold.mccalla royal maccabees life ins,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.but the court has instructed that while dictum may be followed if sufficiently persuasive,it ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit.united states montero camargo,cir en banc quoting humphrey executor united states.
i do not believe the court dictum in aguilar was considered in the requisite sense.the question whether false statements made directly to the grand jury violate the omnibus clause was not before the court.in his opposition to certiorari,aguilar had conceded that,as the government notes,the courts have routinely applied section to false testimony to the grand jury.brief in opposition at,aguilar.the government highlighted that concession in its merits brief.brief of petitioner at,aguilar,as respondent has conceded,the courts have routinely applied section to false testimony to the grand jury.in the context of his suit,aguilar concession makes sense,for it enabled him to focus his argument more narrowly,and to argue that even if the omnibus clause covered false statements made to a grand jury,his false statements to an fbi agent were not covered.the court accepted without challenge the strategic concession that false statements to the grand jury were covered,and held that,even so,aguilar conduct fell outside the omnibus clause.the court was thus not asked to consider the question whether false statements were covered by the omnibus clause because that question had been taken off the table.the question presented in the case now before us whether truthful but evasive statements are covered by the omnibus clause was so remote from the contemplation of the parties that there had been no need even to take it off the table.
no argument was made to the court in aguilar about the meaning of corruptly in,when the obstruction of justice statute was enacted.nor was any argument made to the court about the disparity in sentencing between the perjury statute and the obstruction of justice statute.had the government sought a conviction under the omnibus clause based on a true but evasive or misleading statement to a grand jury,and had these arguments been presented to the court,it is not at all clear that the court would have read the statute as broadly as its dictum suggests.
it is possible that i am wrong and that i am required to regard the court dictum in aguilar as controlling.i do not believe that this is so,but if it is i encourage the court to revisit,either in this case or another,the question of the scope of the omnibus clause of a.if the court does revisit the question,i think it likely perhaps very likely that it will conclude,as i do,that the word corruptly,as used in a,means by bribery.
there is no joy in this dissenting judge.the per curiam and concurring opinions have struck out 
strike one the per curiam and concurring opinions the jury verdict rather than deferring to it.
i join the principal concurring opinion in its view that context matters in determining whether sufficient evidence supports the conviction in this case.see kozinski concurring opinion.a vital part of that context is the evidence before the jury.after all,it is that evidence we examine to determine whether any reasonable juror could have convicted the defendant.in doing so,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.see jackson virginia,see also united states whittemore,cir.
barry bonds was convicted of one count of obstruction of justice in violation of.that statute provides for the punishment of w hoever,corruptly influences,obstructs,or impedes,or endeavors to influence,obstruct,or impede the due administration of justice 
at the trial of this matter,the jurors were informed that the charges against bonds stemmed from his appearance before a grand jury investigating steroid use by athletes.the obstruction of justice count alleged that bonds gave material grand jury testimony that was intentionally evasive,false,and misleading.prior to his grand jury testimony,bonds was granted immunity from prosecution if he complied with the immunity order.special agent novitzky read the immunity order to the jury.the order provided in pertinent part 
barry bonds may be called to testify before the grand jury and 
in the judgment of the united states attorney,the testimony and other information to be obtained from barry bonds is necessary to the public interest and 
it is therefore ordered that barry bonds,soon as he may be called,shall testify under oath and provide other information,including documents,in this case and in any further ancillary proceedings.
it is further ordered that the testimony and other information compelled from barry bonds pursuant to this order may not be used against him in any criminal case,except a prosecution for perjury,false declaration,or otherwise failing to comply with this order.
the purpose of immunizing a witness in exchange for his testimony is to ensure that the witness,freed from the specter of prosecution,will provide complete and truthful testimony.see united states thomas,cir observing that t he purpose of the immunity order in the balco case was to compel the witness to testify truthfully and in good faith before the grand jury to assist it in its investigation emphasis in the original.giving evasive testimony is inconsistent with the obligation to provide complete and truthful testimony.see united states griffin,cir a n obstruction of justice results when attempts to gather relevant evidence are frustrated by the use of corrupt or false means.the blatantly evasive witness achieves this effect as surely by erecting a screen of feigned forgetfulness as one who burns files or induces a potential witness to absent himself.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.hence,charges were brought against bonds for obstruction of justice.
at trial,special agent novitsky described the balco laboratories investigation primarily involving the distribution of anabolic steroids.one of the principal targets of the criminal investigation was greg anderson,bonds fitness trainer.according to agent novitsky,execution of search warrants at balco laboratories produced a treasure trove of drugs and documents indicating usage and distribution of anabolic steroids to elite professional athletes.authorities also found physical evidence in terms of drugs that pertained to steroid distribution following a search of anderson residence.specifically,samples from anderson residence were revealed to be a designer anabolic steroid.authorities also recovered from a safe in anderson residence and a bag of syringes in his vehicle.
it was against this backdrop that bonds was immunized and brought before the grand jury to testify,with the grand jury process considered a continuation of the investigation.bonds was not a target of the grand jury.rather,he and other athletes were expected to testify candidly and truthfully to further the investigation into those who were the targets of the grand jury.
agent novitsky testified that the inconsistencies between bonds testimony and other evidence before the grand jury regarding the relationship between the athletes and the steroid distributors,including the evasions,required the investigators to conduct additional inquiries that would not have been necessary had bonds given testimony.we can not say with certainty that no reasonable juror could conclude otherwise.indeed,drawing all inferences in favor of the government,a reasonable juror could reasonably conclude that bonds evasive testimony diverted the investigation,thereby impeding the administration of justice.see id.
from the inception of this nation system of justice,the jury has played an integral role in the administration of justice.see city of morgantown.royal ins,articulating that t rial by jury is a vital and cherished right,integral in our judicial system.we defer to the wisdom of twelve ordinary citizens,selected by the parties,who hear the evidence and follow the instructions given by the judge to reach a verdict.see long johnson,cir although the evidence presented at trial could yield an alternative inference,we must respect the exclusive province of the jury to determine the credibility of witnesses,resolve evidentiary conflicts,and draw reasonable inferences from proven facts citation,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.overturning a jury verdict,particularly on a sufficiency of evidence challenge,is rare,as it should be.see united states nevils,cir en banc.this reviewing court may not ask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,only whether any rational trier of fact could have made that finding.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted first emphasis added.regrettably,little consideration is given in the per curiam and concurring opinions to the entirety of the evidence introduced during bonds trial.indeed,the principal concurring opinion focuses on the instrinsic capabilities of the statement itself,as determined on appeal.kozinski concurring opinion,emphasis in the original.however,as discussed below,this analysis applies to false statements rather than to evasive statements.importing an inapplicable analysis to overturn the jury considered verdict appears to be a means of reach ing the conclusion that seems best to my concurring colleagues.blue cross blue shield rubin,cir citation omitted.we know that the jury deliberated carefully because it convicted bonds on only one of four charged counts.see united states plunk,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states hankey,cir observing that the fact that the jury rendered a mixed verdict suggests that it reviewed the evidence rationally and independently citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.sufficient evidence supports the jury considered verdict,and the verdict warrants deference rather than.see long,at.
when bonds was asked before the grand jury if anderson had ever given him anything that required a syringe to inject himself with a yes or no question,bonds launched into the following rambling soliloquy 
i only had one doctor touch me.and that my only personal doctor.greg,like i said,we do get into each others personal lives.we friends,but i do we do sit around and talk baseball,because he knows i do t come to my house talking baseball.if you want to come to my house and talk about fishing,some other stuff,we be good friends.you come around talking about baseball,you go on.i do talk about his business,you know what i mean 
that what keeps our friendship.you know,i am sorry,but that you know,that i was a celebrity child,not just in baseball by my own instincts.i became a celebrity child with a famous father.i just do get into other people business because of my father situation,you see.
this rambling,answered the following unasked questions 
question how many doctors have touched treated you 
answer i only had one doctor touch me.and that my only personal doctor.
question do you and greg anderson get into each others personal lives 
answer greg,like i said,we do get into each others personal lives.
question do you and anderson get into each others professional lives 
answer we friends,but i do we do sit around and talk baseball,because he knows i do want do come to my house talking baseball.if you want to come to my house and talk about fishing,some other stuff,we be good friends.you come around talking about baseball,you go on.i do talk about his business.
question what keeps your friendship with anderson 
answer that not getting into each other personal or professional lives what keeps our friendship.
question were you a celebrity child 
answer you know,i am sorry,but that you know,that i was a celebrity child,not just in baseball by my own instincts.i became a celebrity child with a famous father.i just do get into other people business because of my father situation,you see.
despite these extended responses to unasked questions,bonds studiously avoided answering the question that was actually asked did anderson ever give you anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with 
the jury pondered bonds response in conjunction with agent novitsky testimony that bonds response required the investigators to search for other evidence that anderson provided steroids to bonds.that evidence included testimony from other athletes who acknowledged receiving steroid injections,and from steve hoskins,bonds childhood best friend and personal assistant,who had discussions with bonds about steroid injections and who heard bonds complain about pain associated with the injections.hoskins also witnessed anderson and bonds enter a bedroom a couple of times at bonds arizona residence,with anderson holding a needle that hoskins believed was for steroid injections.hoskins also recounted an incident when anderson refused to inject bonds and bonds stated that he would give it to himself.hoskins testified that bonds shoe size increased,his glove size changed,and his body got bigger,heavier and a lot more muscular.during hoskins testimony,an audiotape was played that hoskins made of anderson discussing providing steroids to bonds.hoskins was growing increasingly concerned about bonds steroid use and wanted bonds father to intervene.because anderson and bonds denied the use of steroids,hoskins hoped to use the tape to convince bonds father that hoskins concern was justified.the tape was ultimately provided to investigating agents.
a former girlfriend of bonds testified that bonds revealed to her that a lump on bonds elbow was caused by steroid use.she also observed anderson and bonds regularly enter a bedroom in bonds arizona residence with a satchel,locking the door after them and remaining inside for approximately twenty minutes.at the same time,the former girlfriend noted significant physical changes in bonds,including a dramatic increase in size,acne on his upper shoulders and back,rapid hair loss,testicular atrophy,and decreased sexual performance.in addition,bonds became increasingly aggressive,irritable,agitated,very impatient,almost violent.the jury was informed by the chief science officer of the united states anti doping agency that these are typical side effects of anabolic steroid use.
finally,kathy hoskins,sister to steve hoskins,testified that she actually witnessed anderson administer a shot into bonds bellybutton with a syringe,like the doctor with a syringe in the bellybutton.according to kathy hoskins,bonds commented that the injection was a little some some,when i go on the road,you know we ca detect it,you ca catch it.
after hearing this evidence,the jury was instructed that to convict bonds of obstructing justice,the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
the defendant corruptly,that is,for the purpose of obstructing justice,
obstructed,influenced,or impeded,or endeavored to obstruct,influence,or impede the grand jury proceeding in which defendant testified,
by knowingly giving material testimony that was intentionally evasive,false or misleading.
the instruction on materiality informed the jury that 
a statement was material if it had a natural tendency to influence or was capable of influencing a decision of the grand jury.
the government alleges that the underlined portion of the following statements constitute material testimony that was intentionally evasive,false or misleading.in order for the defendant to be found guilty of count,you must all agree that one or more of the following statements was material and intentionally evasive,false or misleading,with all of you unanimously agreeing as to which statement or statements so qualify.
so instructed,the jury reasonably found that bonds rambling statement was evasive.under the sufficiency of evidence standard,we draw all inferences in favor of the government when determining whether any rational juror could have found that bonds evasive testimony materially impeded the grand jury performance of its investigatory function.see griffin,at see also united states browning,cir the ultimate question is not whether the defendant told the truth but whether the defendant obstructed or interfered with the process of truthfinding in an investigation.
evidence may be sufficient to sustain a conviction under even if it does not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or is not wholly inconsistent with every conclusion of guilt because a jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.united states perkins,cir citation,alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the principal concurring opinion acknowledges that the sufficiency of evidence standard of review is a demanding one,but nevertheless elects to apply the standard with some rigor.kozinski concurring opinion.without citation to any precedent supporting the addition of rigor to the governing standard of review,that language sounds suspiciously close to a euphemism for the jury and reach ing the conclusion that seems best to those joining the principal concurrence.rubin,at citation omitted.
as the principal concurring opinion acknowledges,sweeps broadly.see kozinski concurring opinion.applying that broad statute to the facts of this case,we must determine whether there was sufficient evidence before the jury that bonds sought to corruptly impede the work of the grand jury.see id.we are not called upon to determine how far can be prudentially applied.nor need we decide whether attorneys at oral argument could be prosecuted for giving evasive answers to questions from members of the oral argument panel.such a discussion is more akin to resolving a claim that a statute is overbroad,an issue that is not before us in this appeal.in any event,a hypothetical overreach of the statute can not affect bonds conviction for conduct that falls squarely within the statute.see united states jeter,cir concluding that was not vague or overbroad because t he reach of the statute is clearly limited to such constitutionally unprotected and purportedly illicit activity as that undertaken by the defendant.
the jury necessarily found that bonds evasive testimony was material because it was instructed that it had to make that finding before bonds could be convicted of violating.nevertheless,the principal concurring opinion relies upon the proposition that bonds evasive statement did not have the capacity to divert the government from its investigation kozinski concurring opinion.but this conclusion ignores agent novitzky testimony and the jury finding of fact.at a minimum,the jury finding is supported by agent novitsky testimony that bonds evasive responses diverted and impeded the investigation by requiring the investigators to determine whether bonds was being injected with steroids unknowingly,and whether bonds inconsistent testimony compromised the testimony of the other witnesses.see perkins,at noting that marginal evidence is sufficient to support a conviction for obstruction of justice.the jury chose among reasonable constructions of the evidence,and we must respect that choice rather than it as the concurring opinions do.id.at citation omitted.
strike two the per curiam and concurring opinions disregard precedent that supports upholding the jury verdict.
this is not the first time we have considered whether evasive testimony may serve as the basis for an obstruction of justice charge.it may be the first time we have considered the statute as applied to a famous athlete.but that should not be the deciding factor,and there is no other reason to interpret the statute differently in this case.
in united states rasheed,cir,we reiterated that the obstruction of justice statute was designed to proscribe all manner of corrupt methods of obstructing justice citing catrino united states,cir.in rasheed,the defendant had destroyed or concealed subpoenaed documents,and we concluded that the suppression of documentary evidence violated the obstruction of justice statute as much as the suppression of testimonial evidence.see id.at.the defendant argued that when she appeared before the grand jury,she acknowledged that she had not produced all the subpoenaed documents.see id.at.she asserted that the government excused her from any further obligation of production,resulting in a lack of sufficient evidence to support a conviction for obstruction of justice.see id.we disagreed,holding that the obstruction of justice was complete when defendant directed destruction or concealment of the documents.see id.we clarified that the actions of the prosecutor in no way negate d the commission of the crime.at best,the prosecutor relieving the defendant of further production indicates that justice was not,in fact,obstructed.this is not a defense id.emphasis added.we explained that once it was established that the defendant acted with the intent to obstruct justice and endeavored to do so,t his is sufficient for guilt under section id.the same analysis is applicable to bonds evasive testimony.once bonds acted with the intent to evade giving the testimony that was compelled by the immunity order,the obstruction of justice offense was complete.see id.even if bonds eventually ceased his evasive efforts,his prior intent to obstruct was not negated.see id.bonds evasive testimony could and did interfere with the continued balco investigation as reflected in the testimony of agent novitsky.see see also griffin,at observing that justice is obstructed when attempts to gather relevant evidence are frustrated by a blatantly evasive witness citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
other circuits agree.see united states cohn,cir holding that concealing data recorded in one memory through blatant evasion constitutes obstruction of justice see also united states langella,cir describing obviously evasive answers as concealment of evidence within the scope of.in perkins,at,the eleventh circuit similarly characterized the defendant conduct as obstructive when he gave evasive answers before the grand jury.the eleventh circuit described the facts of the case as reflecting that the defendant knew there were irregularities in a certain bank account,that the account was held under a fictitious name,and that the grand jury was seeking to learn the true identity of the account holder.although the court acknowledged that the government could have questioned the defendant more effectively,it nonetheless held that a reasonable jury could have found that the defendant evasive answers were intended to obstruct the grand jury investigation.see id.
ignoring these cases,in my view,creates an unwarranted circuit split and disregards our own precedent without justification.
strike three the concurring opinions rely on precedent more applicable to perjury than to obstruction of justice.
the principal concurring opinion cites this language from bronston united states,under the pressures and tensions of interrogation,it is not uncommon for the most earnest witnesses to give answers that are not entirely responsive.kozinski concurring opinion.however,the cited language does not support a conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to support bonds conviction.in bronston,the united states supreme court addressed the perjury statute,not the obstruction of justice statute,and decided the issue of whether a witness may be convicted of perjury for giving an answer that is literally true,but to the question asked.see id.at.there was absolutely no discussion of evasive testimony or obstruction of justice.
the defendant in bronston answered several questions posed during adversarial bankruptcy proceedings concerning whether he or his company had swiss bank accounts.see id.at.although the defendant denied having swiss bank accounts,there was evidence that the defendant had a personal bank account in a swiss bank for a prior period of five years.see id.it was undisputed that the defendant answers were literally truthful because the defendant did not have a swiss bank account at the time of questioning id.in the context of a prosecution for perjury,the supreme court observed that t he cases support petitioner position that the perjury statute is not to be loosely construed,nor the statute invoked simply because a wily witness succeeds in derailing the questioner so long as the witness speaks the literal truth.the burden is on the questioner to pin the witness down to the specific object of the questioner inquiry.id.at citations omitted emphasis added.
there is a notable statutory distinction between the perjury at issue in bronston and the obstruction of justice at issue in this case.in bronston,the supreme court expressed its unwillingness to expand the perjury statute reach to encompass literally truthful answers beyond the limits established by congress.see id.at.in its current form,the perjury statute,provides 
whoever having taken an oath before a competent tribunal,officer,or person,in any case in which a law of the united states authorizes an oath to be administered,that he will testify,declare,depose,or certify truly,or that any written testimony,declaration,deposition,or certificate by him subscribed,is true,willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true or in any declaration,certificate,verification,or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section of title,united states code,willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true is guilty of perjury 
emphases added.importantly,the perjury statute specifically requires that the defendant have knowledge that the statement itself was not true.see id.the perjury statute is much more forgiving in its knowledge requirement than the elements delineated in for obstruction of justice.notably,does not contain any comparable requirement of known falsity.rather,the obstruction of justice statute merely requires that the defendant endeavor to influence,intimidate,or impede any grand or petit juror a emphasis added.as the supreme court has articulated,the term endeavor makes conduct punishable where the defendant acts with an intent to obstruct justice,and in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,but is foiled in some way united states aguilar.the obstruction of justice statute does not make a distinction between obstructive statements that are false and those that are evasive and not literally false.the statute requires only that the defendant intend his statement to obstruct justice.
it is questionable whether the literal truth underpinnings of bronston apply outside the confines of adversarial proceedings where opposing counsel are expected to continuously hone their questions to require definitive answers,and a judge is present to control unc
