plaintiff appellant james jim brown alleges that defendant appellee electronic arts,ea has violated a of the lanham act,a,through the use of brown likeness in ea madden nfl series of football video games.in relevant part,a provides for a civil cause of action against 
a ny person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person.
a.although claims under a generally relate to the use of trademarks or trade dress to cause consumer confusion over affiliation or endorsement,we have held that claims can also be brought under a relating to the use of a public figure persona,likeness,or other uniquely distinguishing characteristic to cause such confusion 
section a protects the public interest in being free from consumer confusion about affiliations and endorsements,but this protection is limited by the first amendment,particularly if the product involved is an expressive work.recognizing the need to balance the public first amendment interest in free expression against the public interest in being free from consumer confusion about affiliation and endorsement,the second circuit created the rogers test in rogers grimaldi,cir.under the rogers test,a will not be applied to expressive works unless the use of the trademark or other identifying material has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever,or,if it has some artistic relevance,unless the use of trademark or other identifying material explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work.id.at.we adopted the rogers test in mattel,mca records,cir.
applying the rogers test,the district court in this case granted ea motion to dismiss brown lanham act claim,finding that brown had not alleged facts that satisfied either condition that allow a a claim to succeed under the rogers test.brown arts,cv,dist.lexis,at.brown appealed,challenging the applicability of the rogers test,the district court analysis under the rogers test,and the suitability of his case for resolution without additional factfinding.we affirm the district court decision.
jim brown is widely regarded as one of the best professional football players of all time.he starred for the cleveland browns from to and was inducted into the national football league nfl hall of fame after his retirement.after his nfl career,brown also achieved success as an entertainer and public servant.there is no question that he is a public figure whose persona can be deployed for economic benefit.
ea is a manufacturer,distributor and seller of video games and has produced the madden nfl series of football video games since.the madden nfl series allows users of the games to control avatars representing professional football players as those avatars participate in simulated nfl games.in addition to these simulated games,madden nfl also enables users to participate in other aspects of a simulated nfl by,for example,creating and managing a franchise.each version of madden nfl includes the current year nfl teams with the teams current rosters.each avatar on a current team is designed to mirror a real current nfl player,including the player name,jersey number,physical attributes,and physical skills.some versions of the game also include historical and teams.unlike for players on the current nfl teams,no names are used for the players on the historical and teams,but these players are recognizable due to the accuracy of their team affiliations,playing positions,ages,heights,weights,ability levels,and other attributes.although ea enters into licensing agreements with the nfl and nfl players association nflpa for its use of the names and likenesses of current nfl players,brown,as a former player,is not covered by those agreements and has never entered into any other agreement allowing ea to use his likeness in madden nfl.brown asserts that ea has used his likeness in several versions of the game dating back at least to but that he has never been compensated.
brown brought suit in the united states district court for the central district of california,claiming that ea use of his likeness in the madden nfl games violated a of the lanham act.brown also brought claims under california law for invasion of privacy and unfair and unlawful business practices.ea filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the district court applied the rogers test and dismissed brown lanham act claim.brown,dist.lexis,at.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.id.at.brown filed a timely appeal of the dismissal of his lanham act claim we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review the district court dismissal de novo.kahle gonzales,cir.
the legal issues raised by this case are not novel,but their lack of novelty should not be mistaken for lack of difficulty.significant judicial resources,including the resources of this court,have been expended trying to find the appropriate balance between trademark and similar rights,on the one hand,and first amendment rights,on the other.brown suggests that the case law has produced a lack of clarity as to the appropriate legal framework to apply in this case and urges us to consider the likelihood of confusion test and the alternative means test in addition to the rogers test.we are convinced that the rogers test remains the appropriate framework.
a decade ago,in mattel,mca records,we adopted the rogers test as our method for balancing the trademark and similar rights protected by a of the lanham act against first amendment rights in cases involving expressive works.mca,at.although mca concerned the use of a trademark in the title of an expressive work,and the language of the mca opinion did not make it clear that we were adopting the rogers test for cases where the trademark or other identifying material in question was used in the body of a work rather than in the title,we clarified in entertainment,rock star videos,that application of the rogers test was not dependent on the identifying material appearing in the title but also appl ies to the use of a trademark in the body of the work,cir.we have consistently employed the rogers test in a cases involving expressive works since mca,including where the trademark or other identifying material in question was used in the body of a work rather than in the title.see,mattel walking mountain,cir.
the rogers test is reserved for expressive works.even if madden nfl is not the expressive equal of anna karenina or citizen kane,the supreme court has answered with an emphatic yes when faced with the question of whether video games deserve the same protection as more traditional forms of expression.in brown entertainment merchants ass n,the court said that l ike the protected books,plays,and movies that preceded them,video games communicate ideas and even social messages through many familiar literary devices such as characters,dialogue,plot,and music and through features distinctive to the medium such as the player interaction with the virtual world and that these similarities to other expressive mediums suffice to confer first amendment protection.although there may be some work referred to as a video game or referred to as a book,play,or movie for that matter that does not contain enough of the elements contemplated by the supreme court to warrant first amendment protection as an expressive work,no version of madden nfl is such a work.every version of the game features characters players,dialogue between announcers,plot both within a particular simulated game and more broadly,and music.interaction between the virtual world of the game and individuals playing the game is prevalent.even if there is a line to be drawn between expressive video games and video games,and even if courts should at some point be drawing that line,we have no need to draw that line here each version of madden nfl is an expressive work,and our precedents dictate that we apply the rogers test in a cases involving expressive works.brown acknowledges that rogers may apply here,but he argues that the likelihood of confusion test,exemplified by seuss enterprises,penguin books usa,cir,or the alternative means test,exemplified by international olympic committee san francisco arts athletics,cir,reh g en banc denied,cir,aff on other grounds,arts athletics,olympic,are also relevant.we disagree.we have previously rejected the likelihood of confusion test as fail ing to account for the full weight of the public interest in free expression when expressive works are involved.mca,at.the alternative means test was rejected for the same reason in rogers itself,at,a position we approved by adopting the rogers test in mca.the only relevant legal framework for balancing the public right to be free from consumer confusion about brown affiliation with madden nfl and ea first amendment rights in the context of brown a claim is the rogers test.
rogers involved a suit brought by the famous performer ginger rogers against the producers and distributors of ginger and fred,a movie about two fictional italian cabaret performers who imitated rogers and her frequent performing partner fred astaire.rogers,at.among rogers claims was that the use of her name in the title of the movie violated a by creating the false impression that she was involved with the film.id.at.recognizing that enforcing a in this context might constrain free expression in violation of the first amendment,the second circuit asserted that the lanham act should be appl ied to artistic works only where the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression.id.at.the rogers court introduced a twopronged test,under which the lanham act should not be applied to expressive works unless the use of the trademark or other identifying material has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever,or,if it has some artistic relevance,unless the trademark or other identifying material explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work.id.
as we explained in,a case with similar facts to brown case in which we applied the rogers test to a a claim related to the use of the likeness of a los angeles strip club in the video game grand theft auto san andreas,the level of artistic relevance of the trademark or other identifying material to the work merely must be above zero for the trademark or other identifying material to be deemed artistically relevant.at.this rule has the benefit of limiting our need to engage in artistic analysis in this context 
we agree with the district court that the use of brown likeness is artistically relevant to the madden nfl games.as brown points out in trying to undermine the status of the games as expressive works,ea prides itself on the extreme realism of the games.as brown emphasizes in arguing that it is in fact his likeness in the games i t is axiomatic the cleveland browns simply,by definition,can not be the cleveland browns without the players who played for the cleveland browns.this fundamental truth applies especially to that team most famous player,jim brown.given the acknowledged centrality of realism to ea expressive goal,and the importance of including brown likeness to realistically recreate one of the teams in the game,it is obvious that brown likeness has at least some artistic relevance to ea work.the fact that any given version of madden nfl includes likenesses of thousands of different current and former nfl players does not impact this analysis.in,the virtual strip club in question was just one of many virtual structures included by the designers of grand theft auto san andreas in an attempt to simulate the feel of east los angeles,but we nonetheless concluded that the strip club was artistically relevant to the work.at.there is no significant distinction to be made here.
brown questions the artistic relevance of his likeness to madden nfl in part by pointing us to the sixth circuit decision in parks laface records,cir.in parks,civil rights hero rosa parks sued the musical duo outkast under a after outkast released a song called rosa parks.id.at.partially due to the fact that one of the members of outkast had said that the song was not intended to be about rosa parks or the civil rights movement,the sixth circuit concluded that the district court should have at least considered additional evidence before deciding that the use of parks name was artistically relevant to the song.id.at.brown alleges that ea has made similar denials of jim brown relevance to madden nfl,and thus argues that brown likeness is not artistically relevant to the madden nfl games.the court in parks,however,did not rely solely on the band denial that the song was about parks or the civil rights movement in concluding that there was a factual dispute about artistic relevance.the composers did not intend the song to be about rosa parks,and the lyrics are not about rosa parks,the court stated,emphasizing both outkast denials and the court own determination that the song lyrics were unrelated to parks or the civil rights movement.id.at.here,even if ea denials regarding brown are equivalent to outkast denial regarding parks,the content of the madden nfl games the simulation of nfl football is clearly related to jim brown,one of the nfl greatest players.moreover,ea denials are not equivalent to outkast denial.ea has denied using the aspects of brown likeness that may be protected by the lanham act and certain state laws,but such denials are a far cry from outkast outright denial of relevance.in letters to brown attorneys,ea officials have claimed that brown has not appeared in any madden nfl game since,and that brown name and likeness does not appear in madden nfl or any packaging or marketing materials associated with the product.ea has not denied that brown likeness is relevant to madden nfl rather,it has denied that brown has appeared in the madden nfl games released since.if the denials are true that is,if brown likeness does not in fact appear in the games brown has no claim at all under the lanham act.we do not understand this to be brown position.outkast denial did not similarly undermine parks lanham act claim because outkast was not denying the use of parks name.in order to have a valid a claim based on artistic irrelevance,brown needs to show both that his likeness was used and that his likeness was artistically irrelevant to the madden nfl games.if artistic irrelevance can only be proven by accepting the truth of ea denial of the use of brown likeness,brown can not possibly satisfy both of these burdens.moreover,in the context of a motion to dismiss,we accept brown factual allegations as true,and brown alleges that his likeness was used.we must thus assume that ea denials are false,meaning they provide no support for artistic irrelevance 
one of the sixth circuit animating concerns in parks was that a celebrity name could be appropriated solely because of the vastly increased marketing power of a product bearing the name of the celebrity.at.this is a legitimate concern,but the facts in parks specifically,the court determination that the lyrics of outkast song may very well have nothing to do with rosa parks or the civil rights movement made that concern much more realistic in that case than in this one.ea did not produce a game called jim brown presents pinball with no relation to jim brown or football beyond the title it produced a football game featuring likenesses of thousands of current and former nfl players,including brown.comparing this case to parks does not further brown cause.
brown also asserts that our interpretation of the rogers test in to require artistic relevance to merely be above zero,at,has rendered the rogers test described in the rogers opinion itself as seeking to strike a balance between the public interest in free expression and protect ing the pu
