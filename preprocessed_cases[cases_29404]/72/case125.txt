an administrative proceeding conducted under the authority of the california horse racing board the board resulted in an order suspending,for days,plaintiff bob baffert license to race horses in california.while his appeal from the suspension order was pending,plaintiff filed this action under,seeking to enjoin the state proceedings on the ground that the board had failed to preserve evidence to which plaintiff was constitutionally entitled.the board argued that the principles of younger abstention required the district court to decline jurisdiction.the district court nevertheless decided the case.because we agree with the board that younger abstention applies,we reverse and remand with instructions to dismiss.
factual and procedural history 
plaintiff trains thoroughbred racehorses.defendants are the board which is the administrative body charged with overseeing horse racing in california,and its individual members.
on may,nautical look,a horse trained by plaintiff,won the seventh race at the hollywood park racetrack.as california regulations require,the track veterinarian took blood and urine samples from the horse.one half of each sample,the official sample,was sent to a laboratory for testing.the board retained the other half of each sample,known as the split samples,which are kept for the purpose of confirming a positive drug test on the official samples.both the official sample and the split sample of nautical look urine tested positive for trace amounts of morphine.
several months later,a panel of three stewards,appointed by the board,held a formal hearing to consider a complaint against plaintiff arising from the drug testing of nautical look.plaintiff argued that the presence of such a small trace of morphine in the horse urine likely was explained by environmental contamination.environmental contamination is a defense under california regulations,but that defense may be rebutted by evidence that the trainer did not reasonably ensure the horse protection from such contamination.extensive evidence was taken on these issues.
at the hearing,plaintiff learned that the board had tested only the urine samples.the blood samples had been destroyed.the official blood sample was destroyed pursuant to an august policy of destroying of all the blood samples submitted to the laboratory.when no request for testing of the split blood sample was made within the period after the race during which the split sample remained in the board custody,that sample was purged due to its age.
following the hearing,the stewards concluded that plaintiff did not meet the standards of mitigating circumstances as set forth in rule c defense to trainer insurer rule and,thus,that he had violated california horse racing board rules a medication,drugs and other i and trainer to insure condition of horse.the stewards ordered that plaintiff license be suspended for days.plaintiff timely appealed that decision to the board.he also obtained a stay of the suspension pending resolution of the appeal.
while the state administrative appeal was pending,however,plaintiff filed this federal action under against the board and its members in their official capacities.the federal complaint alleges that defendants violated plaintiff due process rights by failing to preserve the blood samples taken from nautical look on may.defendants argued that younger abstention required dismissal.the district court disagreed.the court granted a preliminary injunction and then,on summary judgment,a permanent injunction in favor of plaintiff,and awarded attorney fees to plaintiff.
the board now brings this timely appeal.we reverse and remand with instructions to vacate the award of fees and to dismiss the action.

discussion 
abstention 
younger abstention is a circumscribed exception to mandatory federal jurisdiction,which applies when there is a pending state proceeding that implicates important state interests and provides the federal plaintiff with an opportunity to raise federal claims.green,at.if the circumstances giving rise to younger abstention apply,the district court must dismiss the action.id.at.
as a threshold matter,for younger abstention to apply,the federal relief sought must interfere in some manner with the state litigation.id.at.next,in determining whether abstention is proper,the court must examine 
the nature of the state proceedings in order to determine whether the proceedings implicate important state interests,the timing of the request for federal relief in order to determine whether there are ongoing state proceedings,and the ability of the federal plaintiff to litigate its federal constitutional claims in state proceedings.

here,plaintiff seeks to enjoin state administrative proceedings,so there is no doubt that the federal injunctive relief would interfere directly with those proceedings.green,at.the parties agree that state proceedings were ongoing.we turn,then,to the remaining considerations.
the state proceedings implicate important state interests.
younger abstention applies to actions seeking to enjoin pending state administrative proceedings as well as state court proceedings if an important state interest is involved.ohio civil rights comm dayton christian,d middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.the importance of the interest is measured by considering its significance broadly,rather than by focusing on the state interest in the resolution of an individual case.new orleans pub,council of city of new orleans,d nopsi.

here,the board held an adjudicatory hearing,which is.both sides were represented by counsel.because a license was at issue and could be suspended or revoked,the state proceedings also were.the state interest in administering such proceedings without interference is thus significant.id.indeed,plaintiff does not argue that the state interest in licensing procedures concerning horse racing are less important,or less judicial,than licensing procedures concerning lawyers or doctors.see middlesex,at.applying abstention doctrine in view of pending administrative proceedings to revoke a lawyer license kenneally,at applying abstention doctrine in view of pending administrative proceedings to revoke a physi
