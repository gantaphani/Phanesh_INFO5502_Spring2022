factual and procedural background 
the infomercial deal 
ersoff managed the careers of sugar ray leonard,the former olympic boxing gold medalist and world champion,and billy blanks,a physical trainer who had developed an exercise program called tae bo.in march ersoff entered a written agreement with universal management services,umsi,an infomercial production company,and its president,paul monea,to create an infomercial marketing blanks tae bo program.after leonard gave ersoff a videotaped testimonial for the tae bo tapes,ersoff,purportedly on leonard behalf,signed leonard name to a testimonial release authorizing umsi use of the videotape for the infomercial under certain conditions.under the terms of ersoff own agreement with umsi,ersoff would receive five percent of adjusted gross revenue from the tae bo infomercial.within a few days of ersoff execution of the agreement with monea and umsi,leonard notified umsi that he did not wish the videotaped testimonial or his name to be used in connection with the infomercial.
ersoff retains m a to prosecute his claim in the tae bo litigation 
ersoff became concerned umsi did not intend to honor its agreement to pay him a percentage of the profits generated by the infomercial sales.accordingly,in august ersoff asked m a and,specifically garo mardirossian,the firm named partner,to represent him in an action he wished to file against umsi potentially involving,among other things,breach of contract,fraud and related tort claims.ersoff,a law school graduate,told mardirossian that leonard wished to participate in the action and to sue umsi for the unauthorized use of his name and likeness and to seek a temporary restraining order enjoining the broadcast of the infomercial.ersoff suggested to m a that leonard celebrity status would add value to the action by generating publicity and that a temporary restraining order prohibiting umsi use of leonard name and likeness would help forge a quick settlement,which ersoff repeatedly informed m a was his main objective in bringing the lawsuit.
m a initially declined to take the case,concerned about a number of things,including the solvency of umsi and monea and the difficulty of obtaining any recovery even if ersoff were to prevail.however,at ersoff repeated insistence,m a agreed it would represent ersoff at a percent contingency fee if mardirossian determined,after meeting with leonard,that he could fairly represent both ersoff and leonard in the action.during a personal meeting with leonard,mardirossian advised leonard that leonard involvement would generate publicity with ersoff likely being the main beneficiary.leonard replied he was participating in the action to assist ersoff,he wished to pursue the action and the temporary restraining order primarily to help ersoff and further communications to him about the case should be directed to ersoff.
in november ersoff signed a retainer agreement that provided m a would take the matter on a basis and retain or claim of any and all sums recovered on behalf of client from any defendant insurance company which may be paid or become due in settlement,or by judgment or otherwise.if recovery is not obtained,the attorney will receive no fee.the retainer agreement further provided,the client hereby grants attorney a lien upon the cause of action,and upon any document,records,or papers in connection therewith and upon any sum received to the extent of the foregoing fees and costs incurred or advanced.said lien is based upon the reasonable value of attorney services valued at per hour for garo mardirossian and per hour for other attorneys of m a.or,attorney may elect compensation based upon the agreed contingency for any offer to client to settle the matter prior to the attorney discharge in the event client discharges attorney chooses to terminate the claim,client agrees to compensate attorney pursuant to the hourly fee schedule set forth above for efforts expended by attorney plus all costs advanced by attorney on client behalf.if another attorney assumes responsibility for the file thereafter upon discharge,client agrees to pay attorney upon settlement or verdict the reasonable value of services performed by m a.attorney may elect compensation based upon the agreed contingency for any offer to client received prior to attorney discharge.both ersoff and leonard signed separate documents expressly consenting to m a representation of them notwithstanding any conflicts of interest 
ersoff terminates m a and nine days later settles the tae bo litigation 
on april,after m a had filed a complaint against monea and umsi,worked on the case for seven months and prepared for blanks deposition scheduled for april,and for a mediation scheduled for april,ersoff terminated m a representation and replaced it with the law firm of wood,smith henning berman,where ersoff wife is a partner.at the april,mediation ersoff received his first settlement offer from monea and umsi.ersoff case settled that day,with umsi and monea agreeing to pay ersoff million.
m a complaint against ersoff for attorney fees 
on november,m a filed a lawsuit in the los angeles superior court case no.its operative first amended complaint asserts a single cause of action for quantum meruit seeking at least percent of the million settlement amount 
the bifurcated trial phase one 
in february the trial court granted ersoff motion to bifurcate two issues to be decided by the court prior to a jury trial whether the retainer agreement provided that the reasonable value of m a services in the event of a discharge prior to the receipt of a settlement offer was to be measured solely by multiplying the hours the firm spent on the case by the hourly billing rates of the attorneys who worked on the case for mardirossian and for his associates and whether an actual conflict of interest existed between ersoff and leonard as to which ersoff could not,as a matter of law,give his informed consent and if so,whether m a simultaneous representation of both ersoff and leonard in the underlying action against umsi and monea violated rule of the california rules of professional conduct rule and required forfeiture of any right to attorney fees as a matter of law.see,huskinson brown wolf cal th,d,when attorney violates rules of professional conduct by engaging in simultaneous and conflicting representation without obtaining sufficient informed consent,quantum meruit recovery to collect fees may be prohibited under certain circumstances goldstein lees d.quantum meruit recovery found inappropriate when former corporate counsel labored under a conflict of interest in representing a minority shareholder and director of his former client in a proxy battle in violation of predecessor rule to rule.
following the presentation of testimony and other evidence on the bifurcated issues,the trial court ruled the retainer agreement was unambiguous when,as here,there had been no settlement offer prior to its discharge,the agreement contemplated m a would receive the reasonable value of its services as measured by multiplying a reasonable number of hours spent on the case by the attorneys hourly rates.the court further ruled it was for the jury,as the finder of fact,to determine in the next phase of the proceeding the number of hours mardirossian and his associates actually worked on the matter and whether that number of hours was reasonable 
the trial court rejected ersoff contention that,by simultaneously representing both ersoff and leonard in the underlying litigation against umsi and monea,m a had violated rule and thus forfeited its right to attorney fees as a matter of law.the court concluded there existed,at most,a potential conflict of interest between ersoff and leonard interests in the litigation and the consent form ersoff had executed was sufficient and valid for the potential conflict that existed during the relevant period.the court further found no prejudice to ersoff as a result of the dual representation.
ersoff motion to dismiss m a complaint and the court imposition of sanctions 
after the first phase of the trial had been completed,the court set an april,trial date for phase two.ersoff sought and successfully obtained several continuances of the trial date.on july,days before the trial was scheduled to begin,ersoff sought and obtained an additional continuance to november,based on representations by his counsel,the law firm of riley reiner,that it had a scheduling conflict.m a did not oppose the request.immediately after the hearing,ersoff m a with a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground m a was not a corporation at the time it filed its action and thus lacked standing to prosecute or defend the instant action.
one week later,on july,ersoff replaced his trial counsel,riley reiner,with philip levy,whom riley reiner had associated in as counsel on january.m a opposed the motion to dismiss and requested sanctions against ersoff and levy in the amount of pursuant to code of civil procedure section,arguing the motion to dismiss was frivolous,designed to harass and delay the trial and omitted pertinent case authority.m a also argued the continuance that immediately preceded the motion had been obtained under false pretenses and in violation of the local rules of the superior court.the trial court denied ersoff motion to dismiss and imposed sanctions against ersoff and levy jointly and severally in the amount of.
the trial phase two 
ersoff motions in limine 
ersoff moved in limine pursuant to evidence code sections and to exclude testimony by m a attorneys as to the number of hours each of them had worked on ersoff case.citing mardirossian deposition testimony that,as lawyers,neither he nor his associates kept any memorializing the time spent on each case,ersoff argued the testimony was incompetent and insufficient,m a estimates were false and absurd and admission of the testimony would be unduly burdensome,requiring a minitrial as to the amount of work claimed to have been accomplished by each m a attorney.m a opposed the motion,arguing each attorney that would testify had personal knowledge of the time he or she had spent on the case and could fairly estimate the number of hours each had worked.the court denied the in limine motion.
ersoff also moved in limine to exclude testimony by m a expert witness,contingency fee attorney dana hobart,on the ground that,absent any billing records,m a time estimates were too speculative to provide hobart a basis to opine on whether those estimates were reasonable.he also argued the expert testimony would not assist the trier of fact,as required for admissibility under evidence code section.the court denied the motion.
the trial court granted in part and denied in part ersoff motion in limine to exclude evidence of the settlement amount in ersoff case against monea and umsi,permitting evidence of the settlement amount to be disclosed to the jury only to the extent hobart relied on it in forming his opinion whether the hours m a had spent on the case were reasonable.evidence of the amount of m a prior arbitration award was excluded.
b.the trial testimony of m a attorneys 
at trial mardirossian and three of his associates during the relevant period,joseph barrett,donald conway and kathy mardirossian,testified that,as contingency fee attorneys,they kept no time sheets but could recall the number of hours they worked in total during the relevant period and could fairly estimate the percentage of their work time spent on ersoff case.each testified as to the work he or she specifically accomplished for ersoff 
barrett testified that,between august and april,ersoff case was the major matter in the office and barrett primary case for that time period.he met or spoke with ersoff almost daily and explained there were a number of difficult issues in the case that he had to research and resolve including umsi rescission claims based on allegations of ersoff fraud,umsi solvency,receivership issues and difficulty tracking sales from the infomercial.he testified he worked hours per week for mardirossian during the period august to april,and estimated percent of that time was spent on ersoff case.he also testified that,in late april,he began preparing a written summary of the work he had performed on the case at the request of ersoff new firm,but stopped when it appeared an agreement had been reached.the page summary,which details,week by week,the work barrett states he performed for ersoff but does not include a reference to the hours spent,was admitted into evidence without objection.
conway explained the ersoff case was also the primary matter that occupied his time from september until the middle of april and that he and barrett worked closely together on every matter in the case.he,like barrett,was personally involved in drafting or assisting on every one of the pleadings and the unsuccessful attempt to obtain a temporary restraining order against umsi.conway also testified at length as to the receivership issues he worked on with associated counsel and explained that additional work was required when it came to light that ersoff had made representations to umsi that he did not disclose to m a until well into the litigation.according to conway estimates,he worked to hours a week from august to april,and spent of that time working on ersoff case in and one half of that time working on ersoff case in,for a total of approximately hours.
kathy mardirossian testified she worked five to six hours a week for approximately weeks participating in every meeting and strategy session and assisting in drafting pleadings and discovery in the action.she explained this was a conservative estimate and that she took pains to review the file and to discuss the work she performed on the case with the other associates and with mardirossian to ensure there was no duplication of effort.
garo mardirossian testified he worked hours a week from august to april,and spent approximately percent of that time on ersoff case in various capacities,less the four weeks he worked exclusively on another trial.he explained he participated in every meeting,met with ersoff and his associates and reviewed every pleading and all correspondence that was drafted in regard to the case.
expert testimony 
expert testimony as to whether the number of hours claimed by m a was reasonable was also presented by both m a and ersoff.testifying as an expert for m a,hobart explained,based on his review of the files in the underlying case,as well as all of the pleadings and deposition testimony in the instant case and the multimillion dollar settlement amount,it was reasonable for m a to have worked approximately hours on the matter.he explained that,because contingency fee lawyers fees depend on the outcome,they often spend many more hours than an hourly attorney would on a case,unconcerned about the mounting hours because the client will not be billed.he also explained the number of hours can not be determined solely from looking at the tangible work product in the file,such as the pleadings and discovery.in light of the million settlement,achieved just days after m a was substituted out of the case,with little or no additional work accomplished by the firm that substituted in for m a and the complexity and number of issues involved in the case,hobart opined that it was not unreasonable for m a to have put in hours worth of work leading up to the eventual settlement in the action.
alan jay weil,an attorney who does not take cases on contingency,testified as an expert for ersoff.weil opined that it was preposterous for any firm to have spent hours on this case.based upon the work product in the file in the underlying case,weil opined that,at most,a reasonable attorney would have spent no more than hours preparing the case from august to april.
d.the jury verdict and entry of judgment 
in its special verdict the jury found m a had reasonably spent hours on ersoff case mardirossian had reasonably spent hours on ersoff case and m a associates conway,barrett and kathy mardirossian had reasonably spent hours,hours and hours,respectively.in accordance with the court instructions to multiply the hours by each attorney hourly rate,the jury awarded m a.following the jury verdict,the court ordered statutory prejudgment interest be added to the verdict amount from the date the complaint had been filed november,until the date the amount is paid.judgment was entered on april.
contentions 
ersoff contends the trial court erred in denying his motions in limine to exclude evidence of the number of hours the m a attorneys worked on ersoff case and expert testimony as to whether the claimed hours were reasonable there is no substantial evidence to support the jury verdict prejudgment interest is improper in a quantum meruit action the jury instructions and special verdict forms were erroneous and resulted in a miscarriage of justice the court erred in denying ersoff motion to dismiss m a action for lack of standing and the court erred in imposing monetary sanctions against him.ersoff counsel,philip levy,also challenges the sanctions order against him.
discussion 
the court did not err in denying ersoff motions in limine governing law and standard of review 
the usual purpose of motions in limine is to preclude the presentation of evidence deemed inadmissible and prejudicial by the moving party.kelly new west federal savings th,d kelly.although in limine motions are typically brought at the beginning of trial,they may also be brought during trial when evidentiary issues are anticipated by the parties.ibid.as rulings on the admissibility of evidence,they are subject to review on appeal for abuse of discretion.people alvarez cal th,d,appellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as to the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion kb home superior court th,d.
b.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying ersoff motion in limine to prohibit m a attorneys from testifying as to the hours they spent on ersoff case 
ersoff contends that,because none of the attorneys kept contemporaneous time records,evidence of their time estimates was without foundational support and should have been excluded.contrary to ersoff contention,there is no legal requirement that an attorney supply billing statements to support a claim for attorney fees.as this court has held,an attorney testimony as to the number of hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees,even in the absence of detailed time records.steiny california electric supply th,d see also martino denevi d.martino same.of course,the attorney testimony must be based on the attorney personal knowledge of the time spent and fees incurred,subd.a the testimony of a witness concerning a particular matter is inadmissible unless he has personal knowledge of the matter.still,precise calculations are not required fair approximations based on personal knowledge will suffice t he general rule is that while a plaintiff must show with reasonable certainty that he has suffered damages by reason of the wrongful act of defendant,once the cause and existence of damages have been so established,recovery will not be denied because the damages are difficult of ascertainment.stott johnston cal d,see ibid.proof of lost profits need not be exact but may be estimated based on past volume of business and other provable data relevant to the probable future sales see also ghk associates mayer group,d.where the fact of damages is certain,the amount of damages need not be calculated with absolute certainty.citations.the law requires only that some reasonable basis of computation of damages be used,and the damages may be computed even if the result reached is an approximation.
although none of m a contingency fee lawyers kept billing records,each planned to testify that he or she could recall the amount of time spent in total on ersoff case,albeit not the amount of time spent preparing each piece of correspondence,discovery or pleading.citing ajaxo e trade group th,d ajaxo and martino,supra,d,ersoff insists the trial court should have excluded this testimony as legally insufficient to recover fees.both cases are inapposite.
in ajaxo the prevailing party ajaxo in a breach of contract action sought to recover attorneys fees paid to his former counsel prior to trial pursuant to civil code section.ajaxo submitted declarations from its current counsel detailing its work on the case but no evidence from ajaxo former attorneys as to the work they had accomplished for ajaxo no declarations,no billing records,nothing to support why the court should award in excess of to these attorneys,who,according to the declarations provided by ajaxo current counsel,did not even correctly prepare the case for trial.ajaxo,supra,th at,d.considering the absence of any evidence presented by ajaxo former counsel,the trial court conclusion there was no evidence to support ajaxo request for pretrial attorney fees paid to its former counsel was well within its discretion.ibid.
martino is likewise distinguishable.in martino,a case involving the dissolution of a partnership,an accounting and damages,the trial court awarded in attorney fees to the prevailing party based solely on the attorney request for a flat fee for services rendered.no documents,such as billing or time records,were submitted to the court,nor was an y attempt made to explain,in more than general terms,the extent of services rendered to the client.martino,supra,d at.the court of appeal reversed the attorney fee award.acknowledging that i n california,an attorney need not submit contemporaneous time records in order to recover fees id.at,the court concluded the evidence mere request for a flat fee for services insufficient to support an award.further hindering the court review of the award was the trial court failure to explain the basis for its decision.the case was remanded for a rehearing of the attorney fee issue.ibid.
unlike in ajaxo,supra,th,d and martino,supra,d,each attorney in the instant case had personal knowledge of the legal services he or she had performed for ersoff.notwithstanding the absence of billing records,each testified at length concerning the work he or she performed,the complexity of the issues and the extent of the work that was required.there was nothing presented in the motions in limine to suggest to the trial court that such testimony,plainly relevant see glendora community redevelopment agency demeter d.martino,supra,d.ajaxo,at,d,should be excluded.
ersoff suggests mardirossian deposition testimony that any reconstruction of the hours spent would not be exact or accurate should have foreclosed m a from offering its estimates of the number of hours expended.although mardirossian did testify he could not recreate time sheets six years after the fact with any precision,he also testified later in his deposition that he and his associates could review the file and use their own personal knowledge of the time worked to provide fair estimates of the hours spent on the case.his deposition testimony is not inconsistent with his trial testimony on that point but,even if it were,the trial court properly concluded such inconsistency was to be evaluated by the trier of fact.kelly,supra,th at,d.as our division four colleagues recognized in kelly,although a party may be precluded from introducing evidence contrary to its response in a request for admission code civ,subd.a,deposition testimony does not serve the same purpose as a request for admission,which is aimed primarily at setting at rest a triable issue so that it will not have to be tried.kelly,at,d.accordingly,i t is a misuse of a motion in limine to attempt to compel a witness or a party to conform his or her trial testimony to his or her deposition testimony.trial testimony may be impeached by inconsistent deposition testimony,but absent an abuse of the discovery process,such testimony should not be precluded.id.at,d.
ersoff also argues that the testimony of the m a attorneys should have been excluded under evidence code section because it would,and did,lead to a virtual as to each attorney assessment of the hours worked.the court determined that such a was especially appropriate in this case in which a jury was asked to decide the number of hours each attorney spent on the case and whether that number of hours was reasonable.that determination was well within the court discretion.see people rodrigues cal th,d,trial court ruling excluding evidence under evidence code section,reviewed for abuse of discretion,may be reversed only when it is shown the ruling was arbitrary,capricious or patently absurd resulting in a manifest miscarriage of justice isaacs huntington memorial hospital cal d.
c.the court did not abuse its discretion in denying ersoff motion to exclude expert testimony on the reasonableness of the hours expended 
ersoff also contends the court erred in denying his motion in limine to exclude hobart expert testimony that the number of hours m a claimed to have spent on the case was reasonable.he asserts hobart testimony was inadmissible because it was grounded in speculative testimony about the hours worked and did not assist the jury in its fact finding process.see,subd.a expert testimony authorized when subject is sufficiently beyond common experience that opinion of expert would assist trier of fact people mcalpin cal d.
it is well settled that a contingency fee lawyer discharged prior to settlement may recover in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of services rendered up to the time of discharge.fracasse brent cal d.the most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.this calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer services.the party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimed.hensley eckerhart,d.however,providing evidence as to the number of hours worked and rates claimed is not the end of the analysis in such a quantum meruit action.the party seeking fees must also show the total fees incurred were reasonable.factors relevant to that determination include t he nature of the litigation,its difficulty,the amount involved,the skill required in its handling,the skill employed,the attention given,the success or failure of the attorney efforts,the attorney skill and learning,including his or her age and experience in the particular type of work demanded.los angeles los farms,cited with approval in fracasse,at,see also plcm group,drexler cal th,d,citing same factors in considering whether fees to the prevailing party under,were reasonable.because evidence and analysis of all these factors can be a formidable undertaking cazares saenz d,expert testimony in a quantum meruit action for attorney fees is appropriate to assist the fact finder.matthiesen smith d.
the trial court determination that hobart testimony would assist the trier of fact in this action was,therefore,well within its discretion.people mcalpin,supra,cal d at,trial court decision to admit expert testimony will not be disturbed on appeal unless a manifest abuse of discretion is shown.hobart opined on the inherent differences in approach between contingency fee lawyers and hourly lawyers.he explained contrary to the testimony provided by ersoff expert the case involved much more work than the work product reflected in the file,provided some insight as to the complexity of the issues involved and concluded,based on his review of the file in the underlying case and in this case that,in light of the value of the settlement and the handful of hours that had elapsed between m a termination and the settlement of the case,hours was unquestionably reasonable.hobart testimony was plainly relevant and likely to assist the jury in evaluating all the factors related to the issue of reasonableness.ersoff objection to it,both here and in the trial court,and his contention hobart conclusions are preposterous and unbelievable when compared to weil testimony that the total case should have taken only hours,relate to hobart credibility as an expert and the appropriate weight to be given to the opinion he provided,matters properly resolved by the jury,not an appellate court.williams volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft d.credibility of expert witness is a matter for the jury.
substantial evidence supports the jury verdict as to the number of hours expended 
although ersoff frames his argument on appeal as a challenge to the trial court rulings on the motions in limine,his appellate brief cites to testimony actually provided during phase two of the trial.in effect,ersoff challenge to the in limine rulings is really one of insufficient evidence to support the court judgment.as such,it fails since all hours allegedly worked by counsel for which no time records were available were attested to by the attorneys under oath.the problem then becomes one of fact finding margolin regional planning com.d.considering reasonable attorney fee award under private attorney general statute,code civ,and accordingly,for this reviewing court,whether the fact finder conclusions are supported by substantial evidence 
although ersoff suggests the attorneys time estimates amounted to nothing more than guesses without any present recollection by the m a attorneys of the hours spent,the record shows otherwise.each of the m a attorneys who worked on ersoff case testified in detail as to the work he or she had performed for ersoff.although the attorneys explained they could not remember six years after the fact the amount of time spent on each item for which they had labored on ersoff behalf,the attorneys explained they remembered the amount of work accomplished during the period and could provide fair weekly estimates of their time by recalling the percentage of their work week spent on ersoff case.each provided specific testimony on the work he or she performed individually for ersoff,discussed the complexity of the issues in a dollar case and explained the obstacles faced and the hours spent in preparing the matter for trial.ersoff counsel vigorously each witness as to the items he or she had worked on and argued to the jury the estimates were inexact and totally disproportionate to the amount of work product created for the case.expert witnesses on both sides testified concerning the reasonableness of the time spent in light of the nature of the case and the complexity of the issues presented.there was also evidence presented to the jury that the law firm that replaced m a itself spent a total of to hours in the nine days leading up to the mediation simply to become familiar with the issues in the is,without performing any additional work.the jury found that m a did spend a great deal of time on the far less less than than the approximately hours testified to by the m a attorneys.based on the testimony at trial,the jury verdict is amply supported by substantial evidence 
neither the challenged jury instruction nor the special verdict was improper 
a.the challenged jury instruction 
the jury was instructed,the plaintiff law firm was not required to maintain time records,nor to bill the client monthly or at all for the legal services rendered to defendant seth ersoff.ersoff contends,even if evidence of billing records is not required to support a claim for attorney fees,business and professions code section,subdivision b,mandates they be maintained.he insists the instruction suggesting otherwise was erroneous.
as ersoff contends,business and professions code section,subdivision b,provides,all bills rendered by an attorney to a client shall clearly state the basis thereof.bills for the fee portion of the bill shall include the amount,rate,basis for calculation,or other method of determination of the attorney fees and costs.however,subdivision a of section,which ersoff fails to cite,states its provisions do not apply to any case coming within business and professions code section,pertaining to contingency fee agreements.section,in turn,requires a statement of the contingency fee rate,but does not require contingency fee lawyers to maintain billing records in addition,ersoff argument omits reference to subdivision c of section,which makes clear that,even when the section applies and has been violated,an attorney is still entitled to collect a reasonable fee.see bus,subds.b,c see also flannery prentice cal th,d,when bus,subd.b,is violated,attorney still entitled to collect reasonable fee as provided in subdivision c of that section.
we find no error in the instruction given to the jury.nor,in light of m a entitlement to a reasonable fee notwithstanding any violation of business and professions code section,subdivision a see bus,subd.c,has ersoff demonstrated the instruction was prejudicial.code civ,no judgment decision or decree shall be reversed absent showing error prejudicial pool city of oakland cal d,city of oakland public employees retirement system th,d prejudice will not be presumed burden rests with party claiming error to demonstrate not only error,but also a resulting miscarriage of justice.in any event,ersoff failure to object to the instruction results in a forfeiture of the challenge to the instruction on appeal.suman bmw of north america,th,d when trial court gives jury instruction that is correct as far as it goes but which appellant argues is too general or is incomplete for the state of the evidence,a failure to request an additional or a qualifying instruction will waive a party right to later complain on appeal about the instruction which was given mock michigan millers mutual ins.th,d.
special verdict form 
the special verdict form submitted to the jury inquired whether m a was entitled to damages,whether the lawyers reasonably spent time to provide legal services to ersoff and,if so,the number of hours each attorney reasonably spent working on ersoff case.ersoff asserts the form was misleading and incomplete because it did not identify a beginning and ending date for the time spent on ersoff case.
although ersoff objected at trial to the special verdict form,he did so only on the ground it should have included the question whether m a had proved the number of hours it spent on ersoff case.he did not challenge the special verdict form for omitting the period m a represented him nor did he include in his own proposed special verdict form the temporal inquiry he now says was unfairly omitted.because ersoff did not challenge the special verdict form on this ground below,we do not consider it for the first time on appeal.see jones wagner th,d a s a general rule issue not raised in the trial court can not be raised for the first time on appeal.see also lynch birdwell cal d,where defendants did not object at trial to error in verdict form,it appears to be the settled rule that they have waived their right to complain as to its form jensen bmw of north america,th,d bmw waived any objection to the special verdict form by failing to object before the court discharged the jury.
the trial court did not err in awarding prejudgment interest 
the trial court did not commit prejudicial error in phase one when it found m a was not prohibited from recovering fees in quantum meruit 
rule c prohibits an attorney from simultaneously representing more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially or actually conflict in the absence of the clients informed written consent ersoff contends m a violated rule when it simultaneously represented ersoff and leonard in their action against umsi and monea.according to ersoff,a conflict existed at the inception of the dual representation because ersoff had signed leonard name to the testimonial release authorizing umsi use of leonard testimonial for the infomercial,but ersoff and leonard apparently claimed in the litigation that ersoff did not have the authority to sign leonard name.also,leonard sought albeit unsuccessfully a temporary restraining order that,if granted,would have interfered with ersoff interest in having the infomercial broadcast.as a result of these egregious conflicts and the failure to obtain sufficient informed consent,ersoff argues the trial court erred in ruling m a had not forfeited its right to recover attorney fees.
in certain circumstances,a violation of the rules of professional conduct may result in a forfeiture of an attorney right to fees.see huskinson brown wolf,supra,cal th at,d,when attorney violates rule of professional conduct by engaging in simultaneously conflicting representation without sufficient informed consent,quantum meruit recovery to collect fees may be prohibited see also cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d,fn.the rule that an attorney who engages in conflicting representation without obtaining informed consent is not entitled to compensation is not based on the premise that the attorney must pay a penalty so much as the principle that payment is not due for services not properly performed.although the breach of a rule of professional conduct may warrant a forfeiture of fees,forfeiture is not automatic but depends on the egregiousness of the violation.pringle la chapelle th,d neither the bus.nor the rules of conduct provide for deprivation of fees whenever rule of professional conduct is violated whether forfeiture of the right to collect fees is required depends on the egregious nature of the violation.
we review the trial court determination as to the existence of an actual or potential conflict and whether such conflicts are sufficiently egregious to require forfeiture of fees for abuse of discretion and the court factual findings in that context for substantial evidence.sullivan dorsa th,d t he owners fail to show that any violation of the rules governing representation of adverse interests was serious enough to compel a forfeiture of fees.insofar as these questions were entrusted either to the trial court discretion or its factfinding powers,we can not substitute our judgment for the trial court except on a clear showing that those powers were abused.
in the instant case,after hearing extensive testimony and finding leonard objective was not to prohibit the use of his image but to be paid for it and to assist ersoff own action,the trial court concluded that,at most,a potential conflict of interest existed between the two men.it concluded the written consent informing ersoff a conflict might exist,in which ersoff expressly acknowledged the opportunity to consult outside counsel concerning the issue,was sufficient to comply with rule.in any event,the court ruled,any violation of rule was not sufficiently egregious under the circumstance to justify a total forfeiture of fees.the court rejected ersoff analysis,namely,that as the person who signed leonard name to the release,there existed at the inception of the litigation an actual conflict of interest between leonard and ersoff,finding ersoff had withheld this information from his attorney.the court explained,if i were to excuse the requirement that ersoff pay,i would be rewarding ersoff for hiding conflicting information from his attorney.and it would be,i believe,a bizarre result.the court further concluded that,in light of m a work on ersoff behalf up until the mediation,there would be an unjust enrichment of ersoff if i would excuse the payment of attorney fees.
ersoff does not challenge these factual findings on substantial evidence grounds.instead,he asserts that rule was violated because,even if the conflict were potential rather than actual,the written consent did not detail the conflicts at issue.as a result,he asserts,the consent is inadequate and m a should be denied any fees.yet,the adequacy of the written disclosure and consent is not dispositive.as the court observed,even if rule were violated in this instance,ersoff has not shown the violation was particularly egregious or that he was in any way prejudiced by it.under the circumstances,we can not say the trial court abused its discretion in concluding it would be inequitable and an an unjust enrichment if ersoff attorney fee obligation were to be excused.sullivan dorsa,supra,th at,d pringle la chapelle,supra,th at,d where
