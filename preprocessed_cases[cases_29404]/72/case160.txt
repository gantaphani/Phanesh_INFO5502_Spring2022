code of civil procedure section hereafter section requires that an order granting a new trial specify not only the ground for the order but also the court reason or reasons for granting the new trial upon each ground stated.here,the trial court granted plaintiff the oakland raiders motion for a new trial on the ground of jury misconduct,but the court failed to set out the required specification of reasons for granting a new trial based on jury misconduct.
although ordinarily an order granting a new trial is reviewed only for abuse of discretion,the court of appeal held that an order lacking an adequate specification of reasons is subject to independent review.under that standard of that gives no deference to the trial court court of appeal overturned the order granting a new trial and consequently affirmed the verdict and judgment against the raiders.we agree with the analysis and conclusion of the court of appeal,and therefore we affirm the judgment of that court.
factual and procedural background 
facts leading to the raiders move from los angeles 
the oakland raiders is a professional football team owned by al davis,with a membership in the national football league nfl,which is an unincorporated association governed by its own constitution and bylaws.after the raiders relocated to los angeles from oakland in,they played their home games at the los angeles memorial coliseum until.unlike newer stadiums,the coliseum facilities did not permit the team to derive revenues from items such as luxury suites,club seats,naming rights,or other sponsorships.
throughout the end of and the first half of,the raiders negotiated with individuals representing hollywood park,a racetrack,for the construction of a new,stadium in inglewood in southern california.in march,the parties reached an agreement that required the raiders to secure from the nfl a contribution of million and a commitment that at least two super bowl games would be played in the new stadium at hollywood park between and.the nfl,however,offered only to schedule one super bowl at hollywood park during the period in question.the nfl proposed to invest some money in the project,but less than the raiders had requested.it offered to provide additional assistance on the condition that a second nfl team be permitted to play at the stadium for several years.
in may,the nfl adopted resolution,which,among other things,awarded two super bowls to the planned hollywood park stadium conditioned on two nfl teams playing there,and created a committee to negotiate with both the raiders and hollywood park concerning a second nfl team.the new committee developed terms to permit a second nfl team to play in the los angeles region,but those terms were inconsistent with the raiders goals,and the raiders perceived them as favoring the second team.as a result,the raiders entered into an agreement with the city of oakland in june to move to the renovated oakland coliseum.the agreement included an million payment to the raiders and immediately enhanced revenue streams.al davis,the raiders owner,testified that oakland officials assured him that personal seat licenses and game tickets would sell out.
pleadings and trial 
in march,the raiders brought an action for damages against the nfl and other defendants on march,jury trial commenced on five of the six causes of action that had survived motions for summary adjudication.the first through third causes of action involved the raiders claim that,by moving to oakland,they left the nfl with an opportunity to put another team in los angeles and that the nfl constitution and bylaws implicitly required that the raiders be compensated for providing the nfl with that opportunity.the fifth and sixth causes of action addressed the nfl failure to offer the raiders more support for the development of the hollywood park stadium.the fourth cause of action,for declaratory relief,was tried later without a jury.
the jury deliberated for days.it began deliberations anew on the fifth day after one juror was excused because of a scheduling conflict.it returned a verdict in favor of the nfl.later,after a bench trial,the court entered its statement of decision on the remaining cause of action,denying the raiders request for declaratory relief.
posttrial motions 
on july,the trial court entered judgment on all matters tried before the jury and the court.that same day,the raiders moved for a new trial on the ground,among others,of juror misconduct.the motion asserted that juror joseph was biased against the raiders and concealed that bias during voir dire.it further asserted that another juror,attorney linda,dominated jury deliberations,infected the deliberations with her own view of the law,and engaged in private deliberations with another juror.finally,the raiders suggested that a third juror,lagrimas,had difficulty understanding english.on appeal,however,the raiders abandoned their claim that lagrimas language difficulty was an independent ground for granting a new trial.
to demonstrate the misconduct of jurors joseph and linda,the raiders submitted declarations from five jurors.according to those declarations,juror joseph stated several times during deliberations that he hated the raiders and their owner,al davis,and that he would never find for the raiders or award them any money.juror alice declared joseph stated to the group that he hated the raiders and raiders owner al davis.he also said to us that the raiders were always starting lawsuits with the nfl,and that he would never award the raiders any money or find for the raiders in this case.i confronted joseph,along with several other jurors,saying that it was improper for him to make such a statement and to act that way.i also told him that he had filled out a questionnaire,and he had a duty to express his hostility in the questionnaire.joseph responded to me this is america that he had a right to express how he felt that the questionnaire only asked him what his favorite team was,which he said was the new york jets or giants,and that the questionnaire did not ask which team he disliked.jurors wayman and william both told joseph,in the presence of other jurors,that this act of concealing his bias could cause a mistrial.joseph did not attempt to explain his dislike for the raiders in terms of any evidence he had heard during the trial rather,his references to other lawsuits between the raiders and the nfl and his other comments to the jury made clear to me that his bias against the raiders existed prior to this trial.
jurors william and alfredo submitted declarations that supported juror alice declaration in all particulars.jurors angelo and richard also mentioned joseph hostility to the raiders and al davis.richard said joseph did not hide the fact that he was biased against the raiders.the deliberations were held with these statements hanging over everyone.
the raiders also charged jury misconduct by juror linda h.the declaration by juror william stated that linda told the other jurors that the raiders lawyer did not want her on the jury,and that she would make them pay.the declaration of juror angelo stated that juror linda,a lawyer,exercised an unofficial leadership position,dominated the deliberations,and instructed the jurors on the law.she told the jury that if they voted one way on one of the claims,they had to vote the same way on another claim,because that was the law.she also wrote out statements of the law and taped them to the jury room walls her statements were not quotations from the jury instructions but were her own words of what she claimed the law was.she also told the other jurors that resolution could not be a contract and that there could be no fiduciary relationship between the nfl and the raiders as a matter of law.
the nfl submitted seven juror declarations in opposition to the raiders motion for a new trial.juror joseph stated at no time did i have or conceal any hostility,bias,or ill will toward the raiders or davis after we had been deliberating for many days,at a moment when everyone seemed to be tense,i said jokingly that i hated the raiders because i had lost my bet.i mentioned that years earlier,i had gone to las vegas and placed a small,legal bet on the raiders in a playoff game,which they lost.the part about hating the raiders was an obvious joke,no one confronted me about it,and i still can not believe that anyone took my comment seriously.i made my comment as a joke to relieve the tension in the room.
according to jurors william and alice,wayman,the first jury foreman,was among the jurors who confronted joseph a.but wayman declaration in support of the nfl stated i did not hear any words by any juror that reflected a preexisting bias or prejudice for or against any party.he did not recall any incident in which he confronted joseph a.other jurors stated that joseph did not give them any reason to believe that he harbored a preexisting bias against the raiders.
juror linda denied any bias against the raiders,denied dominating the deliberations,stated that she told her fellow jurors to follow the court instructions and did not tell the jury what the law was,and explained that she wrote out the jury instructions verbatim,except for an inadvertent error when she wrote fiduciary duty instead of fiduciary relationship.
in response to two jurors assertions that juror linda stated what evidence could and could not be considered,linda declared that she neither used her position as an attorney to make pronouncements about the evidence nor opine d whether certain facts were or were not in evidence as a matter of law.she also denied the assertion of three jurors that she told the jury that resolution could not be a contract and that there could be no fiduciary relationship between the nfl and the raiders as a matter of law.other jurors recalled that linda said the jury should get written clarification from the trial court concerning this issue and that,as a result,the jury sent a written question to the court.
the raiders filed their reply,together with six reply declarations,on september.the nfl moved to strike the declarations on the ground they were untimely filed.the trial court did not rule on the nfl motion to strike.
on september,the trial court heard argument on the raiders motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and it took the matters under submission.on september,it issued a minute order granting the motion for a new trial and denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.in ruling on the motion for a new trial,the trial court stated only the motion for new trial is granted.the court finds that the objectively ascertainable acts of juror misconduct were prejudicial to the oakland raiders right to a fair trial.the court did not specify any reasons for its conclusion.with respect to the other grounds raised by the motion,the court stated while some of the objections in the motion for new trial premised on erroneous prejudicial jury instructions raise serious questions concerning their use,and hav e given the court some pause,having granted the motion for new trial on other grounds,we have not reached these issues.
the nfl appealed from the order granting a new trial,and the raiders appealed from the judgment.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court orders granting the nfl motion for summary judgment on the issue of hollywood park fiduciary duty and denying the raiders request for declaratory relief.it held,however,that the trial court order granting the raiders a new trial failed to comply with section because it lacked a statement of reasons for granting a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct.it concluded that,in view of the sharp conflict in the juror declarations,the raiders had failed to meet their burden of showing that the trial court should have granted the motion on the ground of juror misconduct.the court of appeal further rejected the raiders contention that the new trial order could be sustained on the ground of instructional error.it reversed the trial court order granting the raiders a new trial,and it directed the trial court to enter judgment in accordance with the jury verdict in favor of the nfl.
we granted the raiders petition for review,which raised only the issue of the appropriate standard of review on appeal when an order granting a new trial on the ground of jury misconduct lacks the statutorily required statement of reasons for granting a new trial on that ground.
ii.analysis 
the authority of a trial court in this state to grant a new trial is established and circumscribed by statute.see diamond superior court cal.section sets out seven grounds for such a motion irregularity in the proceedings misconduct of the jury accident or surprise newly discovered evidence excessive or inadequate damages insufficiency of the evidence and error in law.
before,section only required the trial court to specify whether it was granting the new trial motion on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.see stats,ch,stats,ch.amendments enacted in modified slightly in require the trial court to state not only the ground upon which the motion is granted but also the reasons for granting the motion on that ground.section now provides when a new trial is granted,on all or part of the issues,the court shall specify the ground or grounds upon which it is granted and the court reason or reasons for granting the new trial upon each ground stated.i f the motion is granted the order must state the ground or grounds relied upon by the court,and may contain the specification of reasons.if an order granting such motion does not contain such specification of reasons,the court must,within days after filing such order,prepare,sign and file such specification of reasons in writing with the clerk.the court shall not direct the attorney for a party to prepare either or both said order and said specification of reasons,as amended by stats,ch,and stats,ch.
as this court explained in mercer perez cal d,mercer,the first case to construe the amended statute,it is apparent that in the context of this statute the words ground and reason have different meanings.id.at.the word ground refers to any of the seven grounds listed in section.mercer,supra,at.a statement of grounds that reasonably approximates the statutory language is sufficient.see treber superior court cal d,treber.the statement of reasons,on the other hand,should be specific enough to facilitate appellate review and avoid any need for the appellate court to rely on inference or speculation.see scala jerry witt sons,cal d,scala mercer,supra,cal d at,meiner ford motor d.
finally,section provides on appeal from an order granting a new trial the order shall be affirmed if it should have been granted upon any ground stated in the motion,whether or not specified in the order or specification of reasons there are two exceptions orders may not be affirmed on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence or on the ground of excessive or inadequate damages unless that ground is specified in the order.neither applies here.
california courts have consistently required strict compliance with section.its requirement that the statement of reasons be filed no later than days after the order granting a new trial is jurisdictional,and a statement of reasons filed more than days after the order is ineffective.la manna stewart cal d,mercer,supra,cal d at,hand electronics,snowline joint unified school dist.th,d hand electronics.substantial compliance with the statute is not sufficient.la manna stewart,supra,at,oral statement of reasons set down in reporter transcript does not comply with statute see malkasian irwin cal d,malkasian trial court orally stated the ground for granting a new trial,but the clerk mistakenly failed to specify the ground in the written order stewart truck ins.exchange th,d steinhart south coast area transit d.minute order referring to oral statement insufficient.the statement of reasons must refer to evidence,not ultimate facts.scala,supra,cal d at.and the appellate court can not remand the case to permit the trial court to correct an insufficient statement of reasons.mercer,supra,at,see fry young d.
the courts strict interpretation of section has been criticized as creating a procedural minefield for trial judges who issue new trial orders.thompson friendly hills regional medical center th,d,fn.thompson,quoting bank of america cal d,dis.opn.of kaus.this court has also noted the unfairness to the successful moving party when the trial court failure to file an adequate statement of reasons renders the order defective,supra,at,fn.but to this criticism the response has been the power of the legislature in specifying procedural steps for new trials is exclusive and unlimited.citations.the wisdom of or necessity for certain requirements are matters for legislative and not judicial consideration mercer,supra,cal d at,see la manna stewart,supra,cal d at,fn.
judicial review of orders granting a new trial 
although many issues were raised in the court of appeal,the raiders petition for review in this court raises only one whether the trial court order granting the raiders motion for a new trial should be sustained on the ground of jury misconduct.the parties here do not contest that the only possibly viable ground for a new trial was jury misconduct that the trial court adequately specified that ground as a basis for granting the motion and that the trial court did not state its reasons for granting a new trial on that ground.thus,we address a single,narrow issue the standard of abuse of discretion or independent,as here,a trial court grants a new trial on the ground of jury misconduct and properly specifies the ground for granting the motion but does not provide a statement of the reasons for granting the new trial on that ground.
section provides for the situation in which an order granting a new trial is not supported by a specification of reasons.as noted earlier,section states on appeal from an order granting a new trial the order shall be affirmed if it should have been granted upon any ground stated in the motion,whether or not specified in the order or specification of reasons consequently,when as here an order granting a new trial states the ground as jury misconduct,but the trial court fails to specify the reasons for that conclusion,the order is not void.see,supra,cal d at,hand electronics,supra,th at,d.the order may still be sustained if a new trial should have been granted upon any ground set out in section except the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence or inadequate or excessive damages,supra,at.
when the trial court provides a statement of reasons as required by section,the appropriate standard of judicial review is one that defers to the trial court resolution of conflicts in the evidence and inquires only whether the court decision was an abuse of discretion.see,lane hughes aircraft cal th,d,in re marriage of beilock d.but when there is no statement of reasons,an appellate court use of an abuse of discretion standard of review would subvert the purposes that this court has identified as underlying section statement of reasons requirement.
in mercer,supra,cal d,we described those purposes as twofold.one is to promote judicial deliberation before judicial action.id.at.the statute serves that purpose by requiring a statement of reasons drafted by the court,not by the prevailing party.id.at.the other purpose is to make the right to appeal from the order more meaningful.id.at,see stewart truck ins.exchange,supra,th at,d bigboy county of san diego d.we explained in mercer that before the legislature amendments to section,i t often occurred that the notice of motion was predicated on all or most of the statutory grounds,and the subsequent order specified neither the ground or grounds found applicable nor the reasons therefor in that event,the appellant was left in the dark as to which aspect of the trial to defend,and quite understandably struck out blindly in several directions at once.mercer,supra,at.mercer went on to state the new statute seeks to correct this inefficient and often frustrating procedure t he appellant need only address himself to those asserted deficiencies in the proof which are specified as reasons for the order id.at.
our decisions have frequently overturned orders granting a new trial based on a conclusion that to do otherwise would frustrate the purposes of section requirements.
in scala,supra,cal d,for example,we held that a statement of reasons in the form of a finding of ultimate facts rather than evidentiary facts frustrates rather than promotes the legislative purpose of facilitating meaningful appellate review of the order granting a new trial,and hence is inadequate to comply with the mandate of code of civil procedure section.id.at,fn.omitted.we therefore reversed the order granting a new trial,observing the order was made almost a full year after our ruling in mercer,which prescribed in as much detail as feasible the duty of a trial court to comply with section.today decision is no new departure in the law,but simply reiterates the mercer construction of the statutory intent and the manner of translating that intent into action.scala,supra,at.
in la manna stewart,supra,cal d,the trial court stated its reasons for granting a new trial orally,specifying the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.id.at,fn.it later filed a written statement of reasons after the statutory period had run.id.at.rejecting the argument that the trial court had substantially complied with section,we reversed the order granting the new trial because the statement of reasons did not conform to the specific requirements of section.la manna stewart,supra,at.
miller los angeles county flood control dist.cal d,was a wrongful death and personal injury suit in which the plaintiffs alleged that the flood control district had negligently maintained a flood control basin,thereby creating a dangerous condition of public property.id.at.during a rainstorm,water and debris flowed over the basin and demolished the plaintiffs house,causing the death of one resident and injuries to another.ibid.after the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs,the trial court granted the flood control district motion for a new trial on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.id.at.the court statement of reasons stated only that the defendant completely and adequate discharged its obligations,without any further explanation.ibid.we reversed the order granting a new trial,holding that the trial court statement of reasons was inadequate because we could not determine whether the trial court found that a hazardous condition never existed or that it had been remedied before the date of the plaintiffs injuries.t he amendments to section,we said,were intended to preclude just this type of guesswork.id.at,fn,see la manna stewart,supra,cal d at.
in,supra,cal d,the trial court order specifying insufficiency of the evidence as the ground for granting a new trial was not filed until after the trial court had lost jurisdiction.id.at.consequently,under the terms of section,the new trial order could not be sustained on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence,excessive damages,or inadequate damages,supra,at.we observed,however,that if the motion states any other ground for a new trial,an order granting the motion will be affirmed if any such other ground legally requires a new trial,original italics.
the moving party in argued that the order granting a new trial should be affirmed on the ground that the verdict was against law.in this context,a verdict is against law only if it was unsupported by substantial evidence,supra,cal d at.we therefore reviewed the record in the case,but in doing so,we did not defer to the decision of the trial court granting the new trial motion.to the contrary,we examined the record in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,and we concluded that substantial evidence supported the verdict.id.at.
finally,we note the decision of the court of appeal in thompson,supra,th,d.there,the plaintiff sued for breach of an employment contract.id.at,d.the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff,but the trial court granted the defendant motion for a new trial on the ground of excessive damages.id.at,d.the trial court adopted a statement of reasons that the defendant had clear violation of section,which requires the court itself to prepare the statement of reasons.thomps
