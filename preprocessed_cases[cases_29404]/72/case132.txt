this is an appeal of a grant of summary judgment in favor of major league baseball players association mlbpa with respect to appellant claims of tortious interference with contractual relations,libel and prima facie tort,and the entry of final judgment in appellee favor.
the dispute began in when appellant cardtoons cardtoons was formed to produce and market parody trading cards of active major league baseball players.in,cardtoons contracted with champs marketing,champs to print and distribute the cards.mlbpa,as the exclusive group licensing agent for active major league baseball players,sent cardtoons and champs each a letter on june,threatening legal action if the cards were printed.
on june,cardtoons initiated an action seeking a declaration that the cards did not violate mlbpa publicity rights and also seeking damages for tortious interference with contractual relations.the district court bifurcated the claims.with respect to the declaratory judgment request,the court initially entered judgment in favor of mlbpa,finding that the cards violated mlbpa publicity rights.following the supreme court decision in campbell music,d,in which the court first recognized fair use protection under the first amendment for commercial parody speech,the district court amended its judgment and entered declaratory judgment in favor of cardtoons.cardtoons,major league baseball players ass n.cardtoons i.this court affirmed that decision in cardtoons,major league baseball players ass n,cir cardtoons ii.
the case then returned to the district court where cardtoons pursued its claims for damages.cardtoons amended its complaint to include claims for libel,prima facie tort,and negligence.mlbpa moved for summary judgment,arguing that its threats of litigation were immune from liability under the doctrine.see mine workers pennington,d eastern railroad presidents conference noerr motor freight,d.the district court agreed with mlbpa and granted summary judgment on all of cardtoons claims.cardtoons,major league baseball players ass n,cardtoons iii.at.a panel of this court affirmed the district court,holding that the doctrine applied to threats of litigation as well as actual litigation.cardtoons,major league baseball players ass n,cir cardtoons iv.
after rehearing en banc,this court vacated the panel decision in cardtoons iv and remanded the case for further proceedings.cardtoons,major league baseball players ass n,cir cardtoons v.the en banc court held that did not apply and that prelitigation communications between private parties were not immunized by the right to petition the government guaranteed by the first amendment because there was no petition addressed to the government.
on remand,mlbpa filed another motion for summary judgment,seeking a judgment as a matter of law on the remaining tort claims.the district court granted mlbpa motion for summary judgment and issued a final order for mlbpa and against cardtoons.cardtoons,major league baseball players ass n,cardtoons vi.cardtoons has appealed the grant of summary judgment with respect to the claims of tortious interference,libel and prima facie tort.
we must determine whether,on these facts,a genuine issue of fact remains with respect to any of cardtoons claims.all three claims arise from the sending of the letter to champs.cardtoons alleges that the letter to champs contains libelous statements by sending the letter,mlbpa tortiously interfered with the contractual relationship between cardtoons and champs and mlbpa conduct in sending the letter was generally culpable and not justified under the circumstances.we examine each claim in turn.
in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we must determine whether,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the party,there exist any genuine issues of material fact.simms oklahoma ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir wolf prudential ins.of america,cir.to prevail on a claim of tortious interference with a contractual relationship,oklahoma law requires that a plaintiff prove 
that it had a business or contractual right with which there was interference.
that the interference was malicious and wrongful,and that such interference was neither justified,privileged nor excusable.
that damage was proximately sustained as a result of the interference.
morrow dev.american bank and trust.the oklahoma supreme court has further explained that 
o ne who,by asserting in good faith a legally protected interest of his own or threatening in good faith to protect the interest by appropriate means,intentionally causes a third person not to perform an existing contract does not interfere improperly with the other relation if the actor believes that his interest may otherwise be impaired or destroyed by the performance of the contract or transaction.
id.citation and quotation omitted.our inquiry,therefore,turns on whether mlbpa acted in good faith in threatening to initiate legal action to protect its publication rights if champs printed the cards.
we are not the first to consider this issue in this case.on remand,after the first appeal,the district court in cardtoons iii stated 
here,the case history establishes objective reasonableness.the report and recommendation of the magistrate,the initial ruling of this court and the conclusions of the appellate court all acknowledge the reasonableness of mlbpa position and the fact that the issue presented a close call.
cardtoons iii at.at.similarly,the panel in cardtoons iv held that mlbpa had probable cause to threaten champs with legal action.cardtoons iv at.the district court,in its most recent opinion,also held that cardtoons could not show that the interference was malicious and wrongful,and that such interference was neither justified,privileged nor excusable.cardtoons vi at.at quoting cardtoons v.nevertheless,because the en banc court vacated the decision in cardtoons iv,we are not bound by that panel determination that mlbpa had probable cause to threaten legal action.furthermore,we must review the most recent grant of summary judgment de novo and determine whether factual issues remain with respect to the reasonableness of mlbpa threats of legal action.
cardtoons contention is that the threat of legal action was made in bad faith since mlbpa was aware that cardtoons would assert a amendment defense and would therefore be immune from liability.however,at the time the letter was sent,courts were split on whether parody was protected under the fair use doctrine of the first amendment.in fact,when the district court first ruled on the issue,it held that cardtoons was not protected by the parody defense.it was not until march,when the supreme court issued its opinion in campbell music,d,that the law became somewhat settled.it was that ruling by the supreme court which caused the district court to vacate its original grant of summary judgment in favor of mlbpa and hold in favor of cardtoons.see cardtoons furthermore,cardtoons conceded this point in its brief in cardtoons iv when it stated that cardtoons readily recognizes that at this stage of the dispute,before this court issued its ruling on the right of publicity and first amendment issues,the law in this area was unclear.aple.at.
having conceded that the law with respect to the amendment defense was unclear,cardtoons attempts to make a distinction between mlbpa threats of legal action against cardtoons and the threats against champs.cardtoons points out that,while mlbpa attorneys spent approximately forty hours researching potential claims against cardtoons,they spent little or no time researching potential claims against champs before sending champs a letter.the facts,as alleged by cardtoons,indicate that upon learning of cardtoons plans to produce parody cards,mlbpa instructed its lawyers to research the issue and proceed if there was a likelihood of success.as cardtoons alleges,the lawyers research likely focused primarily,or even exclusively,on the potential liability of cardtoons and the potential success of a parody defense.it is unlikely that they spent much,if any,time researching the potential liability of champs.after conducting the research,the lawyers informe
