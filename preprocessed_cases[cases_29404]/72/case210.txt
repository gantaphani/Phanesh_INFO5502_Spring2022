defendants,the national collegiate athletic association the ncaa and the march madness athletic association,the mmaa,appeal from the order of the circuit court of cook county entering a declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiff intersport.specifically,the circuit court found that intersport license from the mmaa to use the trademark term march madness to advertise,promote,and sell videos of certain sports programming encompassed the right to distribute content to wireless communications devices on demand.on appeal,defendants now contend that the circuit court erred in interpreting the term videos as including material transmitted to sprint pcs cell phone customers on demand the circuit court impermissibly rewrote the language of intersport license agreement and the circuit court had an insufficient factual basis to enter judgment on intersport declaratory judgment claim.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.
the record discloses that intersport filed an amended verified complaint for declaratory relief alleging the following facts relevant to this appeal.intersport produces programming for broadcast in a range of media,including television programming featuring college basketball coaches discussing and analyzing the ncaa men division i college basketball tournament the coaches shows.intersport coaches shows have been broadcast on espn,fox sports network,and elsewhere.
intersport has been using the term march madness in connection with its programming since.in,intersport registered the term march madness as a service mark with the united states patent and trademark office.the registration was for the purpose of using the term in connection with intersport business.
however,in,the illinois high school association the ihsa sought to register the mark,claiming that it had used the term march madness in connection with its state high school basketball championships since the.the ihsa discovered intersport registration,and a dispute ensued.ultimately,the ihsa and intersport agreed to resolve any dispute regarding the ownership of the mark by pooling their trademark rights into a new entity,march madness.this arrangement continued until,when the ihsa became involved in a dispute with the ncaa over the use of the term.at that time,intersport assigned its rights in the march madness mark to the ihsa in exchange for,inter alia,royalties and an exclusive,perpetual license to use the mark in connection with its coaches shows.the license agreement specifically provided that 
section grant 
ihsa hereby grants intersport an exclusive,license to use the march madness mark in the following manner 
a in connection with entertainment services,namely the presentation of athletic and entertainment personalities in a panel forum and 
b to advertise,promote,and sell publications,videos,and media broadcasts in connection with section a.
the license agreement further provided that intersport could not use the mark in any manner inconsistent with the above license grant.the agreement also provided that t he term of this agreement shall be perpetual.the parties also simultaneously entered into a perpetual marketing and representation agreement,under which intersport agreed to use all reasonable efforts to promote and further the licensing and use of the march madness marks in a manner consistent with this agreement.
the ncaa claimed that its rights in the march madness mark began in,when cbs announcer brent musburger described the ncaa men division i basketball tournament as march madness.litigation between the ncaa and the illinois state high school association continued from until,when they agreed to pool their rights in the mark and form the march madness athletic association the mmaa.the written agreement between the ihsa and the ncaa forming the mmaa specifically provided that the ihsa thereby assigned the intersport license agreement,exactly as written,to the mmaa.
in march,intersport entered into an agreement with sprint,under which intersport would provide sprint with a variety of original programming to be disseminated to sprint customers via sprint mobile wireless media network.intersport would also provide edited segments of its coaches show programming for dissemination over sprint mobile wireless media network.
the day after intersport and sprint announced their agreement,the ncaa sent intersport and sprint a letter asserting that if intersport were to provide the coaches shows to sprint for distribution to mobile communications subscribers,intersport will have violated the license agreement.the ncaa also took the position that the term media broadcast as used in the license agreement should be interpreted in accordance with the definition of broadcast in the federal communications act,which defines broadcasting as a distribution to the public via television or radio,and the federal regulations concerning personal communications services,which prohibit personal communications service providers from broadcasting as defined in the federal communications act.
intersport asserted that the language of its license agreement with the mmaa did grant it the authority to contract with sprint to disseminate coaches show programming to mobile communications customers.thus,intersport sought a declaratory judgment proclaiming that intersport was within its rights to use the mark in connection with the coaches shows and to advertise,promote,and sell videos or media broadcasts of the coaches shows to be distributed via any broadcast media,including mobile wireless communications devices.
intersport attached several items to its complaint,including the license agreement,the perpetual marketing and representation agreement,a letter from the ncaa dated november,indicating that the ncaa and the mmaa would honor intersport agreements with the ihsa,and another letter from the ncaa dated march,warning intersport that it considered intersport agreement with sprint to be a violation of the license agreement.attached to the march,letter was a sprint press release,which announced that sprint would be delivering exclusive,collegiate hoops programming to its customers.the press release quoted the of marketing for sprint as saying,mobile phones offer so much more than just voice applications today.among the programming or video segments offered to sprint customers would be installments of the march madness coaches preview.this programming would be provided by intersport,which the release described as an emmy creator,producer and distributor of original sports programming content and an industry leader in sports hospitality and event marketing.the press release further explained that the majority of this content is free to sprint vision and power vision subscribers.the sprint subscribers would be able to enjoy this content on demand.
in their answer,defendants admitted that intersport had been granted the license as alleged,but denied that the language of the license agreement encompassed distribution of the coaches shows for viewing on mobile communications devices.defendants also raised two affirmative defenses and several counterclaims.the affirmative defenses were that intersport had materially breached the license agreement by granting rights to use the mark to sprint,which was prohibited by the agreement,and that intersport admitted and continued efforts to license the mark to third parties constituted a further material breach of the license agreement.
in their counterclaims,defendants asserted that intersport actions in intentionally allowing sprint to use the mark constituted a breach of contract as well as contributory and direct trademark infringement in violation of section of the trademark act of.defendants also alleged that intersport actions improperly gave sprint the appearance of having been sanctioned or endorsed by the ncaa,allowing sprint to be unjustly enriched.as such,intersport actions constituted contributory and direct unfair competition in violation of section a of the trademark act of a,deceptive trade practices in violation of the uniform deceptive trade practices act ilcs et.west,and unfair competition in violation of illinois common law.accordingly,defendants requested that the court deny intersport the relief it had requested,enter a finding that intersport actions constituted a breach of the license agreement and trademark infringement,award the ncaa and the mmaa monetary damages,and permanently enjoin intersport from using the mark.intersport responded to these counterclaims by denying any liability.
thereafter,defendants moved for partial summary judgment on intersport declaratory judgment claim and on their own breach of contract claim.therein,they claimed that the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms used in the license agreement did not give intersport the authority to stream content to consumers through a personal wireless communication system.in addition,defendants pointed out that the license agreement did not contain a technology clause.intersport responded to defendants motion for partial summary judgment asserting that it did not make sense to interpret its perpetual,exclusive,broadly worded license to broadcast the coaches shows as being limited to only the technology available in.
following a hearing,the court found that the license agreement was unambiguous and that the term videos encompassed any recorded visual production.the court further found the term videos not to be limited to a particular type of distribution,in contrast to media broadcasts,which according to federal law governing the television industry,required distribution to the general public by television or radio.thus,the court denied defendants motion for partial summary judgment.
thereafter,intersport filed a motion for the entry of judgment based upon the grounds articulated by the court in its ruling on defendants motion for partial summary judgment.the court granted the motion and entered a final judgment,reiterating 
intersport has the exclusive right under the intersport license agreement to use the march madness trademark as defined therein in connection with entertainment services,namely the presentation of athletic and entertainment personalities in a panel forum herein coaches shows and to advertise,promote,and sell videos defined as recorded visual presentations that could be distributed for the benefit and enjoyment of a viewer of the coaches shows which may be distributed to the public in any manner,including but not limited to distribution to mobile wireless media devices.
defendants subsequently filed this timely appeal from that order.
defendants now contend that the transmission of intersport coaches shows to sprint subscribers does not constitute selling videos within the meaning of the license agreement.specifically,defendants claim that the plain and ordinary meaning of videos in implies that there is a physical object in the hands of the end user.defendants also claim that the narrow language of the license agreement does not include technology.
we must initially note that intersport motion for the entry of judgment was,in essence,a motion for judgment on the pleadings because the facts contained therein were not in dispute,the issue to be decided was a matter of law,and intersport did not file a motion for summary judgment.see,kim state farm fire casualty,d,in which the circuit court granted judgment on the pleadings interpreting an insurance contract in a declaratory judgment action.section e of the code of civil procedure ilcs e west provides that a ny party may seasonably move for judgment on the pleadings.judgment on the pleadings is proper where the pleadings disclose no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.gillen state farm mutual automobile insurance.a motion for judgment on the pleadings is akin to a motion for summary judgment limited to the pleadings.kim,d at,at.in ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,the court will consider only those facts apparent from the face of the pleadings,matters subject to judicial notice,and judicial admissions in the record.gillen,at,at.on review,we must examine the pleadings to determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists and,if not,whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.kim,d at,at.we review a circuit court order granting judgment on the pleadings de novo.kim,d at,at.
we now turn to the merits of the appeal.a license to use a trademark is a contract,and disputes over the language of a trademark license are governed by the rules of contract interpretation.mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,at ed.see,mcdonald mazur,d.the construction of a contract is an issue of law to be determined by the court.avery state farm mutual auto.insurance.the court primary objective in construing a contract is to ascertain and to give effect to the intent of the parties,so long as it does not conflict with any rule of law or public policy.gallagher lenart,united states trust of new york jones,see also lord,williston on contracts,at ed.
