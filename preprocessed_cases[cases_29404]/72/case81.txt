this case is before us on remand from the supreme court.brentwood academy,a private school and member of the tennessee secondary school athletic association tssaa,sued tssaa pursuant to for the alleged violation of its first amendment rights.specifically,brentwood challenges the constitutionality of tssaa recruiting rule,which prohibits member schools from exerting undue influence to secure or retain a student for athletic purposes.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of brentwood,holding that the recruiting rule violates the school first amendment rights.
tssaa appealed,arguing that it is not a state actor for the purposes of and,in any event,that the recruiting rule does not run afoul of the first amendment.we reversed the decision of the district court on the basis that tssaa is not a state actor,and therefore not subject to suit under.the supreme court granted certiorari and disagreed with our opinion,holding that tssaa is in fact a state actor.it then remanded the case back to us for further proceedings consistent with the court opinion.
we now turn to the merits of tssaa appeal.after considering the parties supplemental briefs and hearing oral arguments regarding the recruiting rule,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of brentwood.for the reasons set forth below,we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
brentwood is a private school located in brentwood,tennessee that has historically placed a strong emphasis on athletics.in particular,the football team has been nationally ranked by usa today and has won at least seven tssaa state championships.brentwood basketball team is also well known in athletic circles.
tssaa is an association comprised of public,independent,and parochial secondary schools from across the state of tennessee,whose purpose is to stimulate and regulate the athletic relations of the secondary schools in tennessee.to that end,tssaa has enacted a recruiting rule designed to place limits on the recruiting practices of secondary schools in soliciting middle school student athletes to participate in secondary school athletics.the recruiting rule is found in article ii,section of the tssaa bylaws,and reads as follows 
section.the use of undue influence on a student with or without an athletic record,his or her parents or guardians of a student by any person connected,or not connected,with the school to secure or to retain a student for athletic purposes shall be a violation of the recruiting rule.
section is comprised of not only the recruiting rule itself,but also the equivalent of two full pages of questions,answers,and guidelines that provide explanations,details,and examples of the types of conduct the recruiting rule prohibits.this commentary sets forth principles that aid the member schools in complying with the recruiting rule.for example,the first question provides the following information on what the term undue influence means 
q.how is undue influence interpreted in the recruiting rule 
a.a person or persons exceeding what is appropriate or normal and offering an incentive or inducement to a student with or without an athletic record.
the third question explicitly prohibits coaches from initiating contact with students prior to their enrollment in a secondary school 
is it permissible for a coach to contact a student or his or her parents prior to his enrollment in the school 
no,a coach may not contact a student or his or her parents prior to his enrollment in the school.this shall apply to all students whether or not they have an athletic record.
the fourth question asks what are some of the guides used in determining whether there has been undue influence used which would result in a violation of the recruiting rule it then provides seven examples.the third example reiterates that the recruiting rule prohibits a ny initial contact or prearranged contact by a member of the coaching staff or representative of the school and a prospective enrolled in any member school except where there is a definite feeder pattern.the seventh example specifically prohibits a dmitting students to athletic contests free of charge where there is an admission being charged at the contest except where there is a definite feeder pattern involved with the school.the exemption is not applicable to brentwood,because it has no feeder pattern with any school.
several representatives of brentwood met with ronnie carter,the executive director of tssaa,on february.this meeting was held at the request of brentwood for the purpose of clarifying what types of recruiting practices would be acceptable under the recruiting rule.michael peek,a lawyer for brentwood,followed up with a letter on february,that was intended to confirm brentwood understanding of the numerous ways in which brentwood could communicate with prospective students about its athletic programs without violating the recruiting rule.
in,several coaches at other member schools complained to tssaa that brentwood had violated various tssaa rules.carter conducted an investigation of the complaints.on july,carter wrote a letter to brentwood outlining six alleged violations of tssaa rules.five violations related to the recruiting rule and one to the rule.only the recruiting rule violations are at issue in this appeal.
the alleged recruiting rule violations arose from two incidents.the first incident occurred when brentwood then athletic director and head football coach,carlton flatt,provided free tickets to a middle school coach for a brentwood football game.these tickets were then used by the middle school coach to take several of his students to attend the game.the second incident arose when coach flatt sent letters and made followup telephone calls in the spring of to students from other schools who had contractually agreed to attend brentwood in the fall of,but who had not themselves solicited any information regarding brentwood athletic program.carter,on behalf of tssaa,imposed a number of penalties on brentwood for these violations.
brentwood appealed the sanctions according to the process set forth in the tssaa bylaws.carter presided at the first step and reduced the sanctions as a consequence of the appeal.brentwood next appealed to the full board of control of tssaa,which at the time consisted only of public high school principals.a hearing was held on august.the board of control found that brentwood had violated the recruiting rule by admitting student athletes free of charge to an athletic contest and by contacting middle school students while they were enrolled in other schools.as punishment,the board fined brentwood,placed its athletic program on probation for four years,and suspended brentwood from participating in tournaments and conducting certain types of practice for two years.
procedural history 
brentwood filed suit against tssaa in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee on december.it alleged that tssaa was a state actor and that tssaa enforcement of the recruiting rule violated its first and fourteenth amendment rights.brentwood also sought an injunction against tssaa enforcement of the recruiting rule.faced with for summary judgment,the district court granted brentwood motion for summary judgment on its first amendment claim and enjoined tssaa from enforcing the recruiting rule.
tssaa appealed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of brentwood,arguing that tssaa is not a state actor,thereby rendering it immune from constitutional scrutiny,and the recruiting rule in any case does not violate brentwood first amendment rights.our prior opinion did not reach the merits of tssaa challenge to the district court first amendment ruling because we concluded that tssaa was not a state actor.see brentwood acad.secondary sch.athletic ass n,cir.brentwood sought review of our decision by the supreme court,which granted certiorari.see brentwood acad.secondary sch.athletic ass n,d.the supreme court reversed our decision,holding that tssaa is a state actor,and remanded the case to us for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.see brentwood acad.secondary sch.athletic ass n,d.before us now are the merits of tssaa appeal regarding the constitutionality of the recruiting rule.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see,holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the judge is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.a genuine issue for trial exists only when there is sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at.
brentwood has not waived its right to challenge the constitutionality of the recruiting rule 
tssaa now recognizes,as it must under the supreme court ruling,that it is a state actor subject to constitutional challenges.it nevertheless argues that brentwood has waived its right to question the constitutionality of the recruiting rule because,by voluntarily choosing to be a member of tssaa,it has agreed to abide by the rules of the organization.tssaa thus contends that brentwood is faced with the choice between joining tssaa and complying with the rules or competing in interscholastic athletics as a of tssaa.
the five cases that tssaa cites to support its argument,however,are distinguishable from the case at hand.see town of newton rumery,d holding that a criminal defendant can waive important constitutional rights by entering into a plea bargain overmyer frick,d holding that where there is no unequal bargaining power or overreaching,debtors can voluntarily,intelligently,and knowingly waive due process rights by signing a cognovit note,which is an agreement by which a debtor consents in advance to a holder obtaining a judgment without notice or hearing irving trust,cir concluding that when a party knowingly,voluntarily,and intentionally signs a jury waiver provision in a civil case,that party has waived its right to a jury trial international union dana,cir holding that a settlement agreement between dana and the union rendered an appeal moot,even though the agreement effectively prevented dana from communicating with its employees regarding a union campaign at one of dana subsidiaries lake james cmty.volunteer fire dep t burke county,cir concluding that an agreement between a volunteer fire department and the county that prohibited the fire department from suing the county was enforceable,even though it waived the fire department constitutional right to petition the government.
the common legal thread among the above five cases is that they all involve parties that actually waived their right to sue.there is no comparable tssaa provision prohibiting members from challenging the constitutionality of the recruiting rule.moreover,brentwood points out that what was once called the doctrine has been replaced with the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.in the words of the supreme court 
recognizing that constitutional violations may arise from the deterrent,or chilling,effect of governmental efforts that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of first amendment rights our modern unconstitutional conditions doctrine holds that the government may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.
bd.of county comm rs umbehr,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted alterations in original.
umbehr involved a claim for unlawful retaliation brought against the county governing body by an independent contractor who provided trash collection services to the county.the court held that the contractor had stated a cause of action based on the allegation that his contract was terminated in retaliation for his criticism of the county commission.umbehr is an extension of the protections provided to public employees under the first amendment.see pickering bd.of,d holding that the board of education violated a school teacher first amendment rights by dismissing him because he had criticized the board in a letter to the local newspaper.we believe that the supreme court rulings that parties do not give up first amendment rights by contracting with,or being employed by,a public agency forecloses tssaa argument that brentwood gave up its right to challenge the constitutionality of the recruiting rule because it voluntarily joined tssaa.
tssaa argues,however,that the first amendment protection afforded by umbehr and pickering applies only when the content of a contractor or employee speech involves a matter of public concern.umbehr,at.see also pickering,at.it claims that the recruiting rule does not implicate a matter of public concern,and is therefore unworthy of first amendment scrutiny.but tssaa can not have it both ways.as set forth in part.below,tssaa will have to establish that the recruiting rule embodies substantial governmental interests as a necessary element of the rule enforceability.these substantial interests will by definition implicate a matter of public concern.see pickering,at.holding that issues involving the local board of education were matters of public importance.
we therefore conclude that brentwood has not waived its right to challenge the constitutionality of the recruiting rule by voluntarily joining tssaa.this means that we must now reach the merits of the district court first amendment analysis of the recruiting rule.
c.the district court erred in holding that the recruiting rule is a regulation for the purposes of first amendment analysis 
tssaa appeal broadly challenges the analytical framework that the district court used to determine the constitutionality of the recruiting rule.the primary contention of tssaa is that the district court erred in concluding that the recruiting rule is a regulation that fails strict scrutiny review.we agree.
a fundamental premise of first amendment jurisprudence is that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.rosenberger rector visitors of of virginia,d.such regulations are subject to the most exacting scrutiny,turner broad,fcc,d,which means that the state actor must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.arkansas writers project,ragland,d.on the other hand,regulations that simply restrict the time,place,and manner of speech are subject to intermediate scrutiny.see watchtower bible tract soc y of,village of stratton,ohio,cir citing clark cmty.for creative,d.under that analysis,regulations must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest that leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.ward rock against racism,d.
the supreme court has recognized that d eciding whether a particular regulation is content based or content neutral is not always a simple task.turner,at.in this instance,the district court concluded that the recruiting rule is because the interests asserted by tssaa to support the ban focus on the content of the message and the effect of the message on the listener.we respectfully disagree.
in our opinion,the recruiting rule does not impose a total ban,or a berlin wall as brentwood calls it,on communications between secondary schools and middle school athletes regarding high school athletics.rather,the recruiting rule prohibits secondary schools from exerting an undue influence on students with the goal of secur ing or retain ing a student for athletic purposes.we do not see how the recruiting rule,as defined by the questions,answers,and guidelines contained within the tssaa bylaws,bans the substantive content of any particular message.it is clear to us that the greatest restriction imposed by the recruiting rule is the prohibition on coaches,coaching staff,and school representatives from initiating contact with middle school students for the purpose of recruiting student athletes.
in our view,prohibiting coaches from initiating contact with students or their parents prior to enrollment in the school is a limitation on the manner in which secondary schools can communicate with students about their athletic programs.it does not mean,however,that brentwood has no other outlet for providing such information to prospective students,or that middle school students have no way of finding out this information or learning about their educational options.
perhaps the strongest evidence in the record that supports our view that the recruiting rule does not constitute a total ban on communications between secondary schools and prospective students regarding athletic programs is the letter that brentwood attorney michael peek wrote to ronnie carter following their meeting in february of.the letter details numerous ways in which brentwood can get its message about athletics out to prospective students.examples of conduct that peek claims were explicitly approved by carter on behalf of tssaa include the following admissions officers and representatives of brentwood can supply information that real estate agents may give to new families moving to the community brentwood can respond to direct inquiries from students or their families that have contacted it for information brentwood can advertise in any publication it chooses and brentwood can contact and graders in any school regardless of their extracurricular activities and interests if such contact is made in the context of a letter or other communication directed to members of the class as a whole.we believe that this range of options,which is not exclusive,acknowledges that brentwood has multiple ways of communicating with middle school students to provide them with information about the academic,athletic,and spiritual aspects of the educational experience at brentwood.
we fail to see how the recruiting rule effectively drive s certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.simon schuster,members of state crime victims,d.but brentwood maintains that the recruiting rule constitutes a regulation of speech in at least three ways.first,it argues that the recruiting rule prohibits independent schools and their representatives from discuss ing an entire topic.consol.edison pub.serv.comm n,d.second,brentwood claims that the rule prevents prospective students and their parents from learning about independent educational options.finally,it maintains that tssaa enacted the recruiting rule to prevent prospective students from learning about athletic programs at independent secondary schools.
brentwood three contentions,however,are not persuasive.as described above,the prohibitions of the recruiting rule do not prevent representatives of brentwood from discussing the entire topic of its athletic programs.prospective students and their parents also have a wide range of available means to receive information about the athletic and educational opportunities that brentwood provides.nor is there evidentiary support for brentwood position that the recruiting rule is a regulation designed by tssaa out of fear of what prospective students would learn about the athletic programs at independent secondary schools.if tssaa had been motivated by a fear of the impact that information regarding athletic programs would have on students,it would presumably have banned recruiting and communications altogether.this it did not do.
finally,we reject brentwood contention that the recruiting rule is unconstitutional because it controls who can speak for brentwood.the recruiting rule is not an unconstitutional regulation that dictat es the speakers who may address a public issue.first bank of boston bellotti,d holding that a state statute prohibiting expenditures by banks and business corporations for the purpose of influencing the vote on any question other than one materially affecting the business interests of the corporation unconstitutionally infringed on their first amendment rights.although the rule emphasizes that coaches and members of the coach staff must refrain from exerting undue influence by initiating contact with prospective students,the rule does not ban these persons from communicating with students who themselves initiate contact.
in sum,we conclude that the district court erred in holding that the recruiting rule is a regulation subject to analysis under the most exacting scrutiny.turner broad.fcc,d.we therefore turn to an analysis of the rule as a regulation.
d.the recruiting rule is a regulation subject to intermediate scrutiny 
we are of the opinion that the recruiting rule is a regulation analogous to certain zoning ordinances that have been deemed to contain reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions.in city of renton playtime theatres,d,for example,an ordinance provided specific zoning requirements for adult theaters.the supreme court found that the renton ordinance was aimed not at the content of the films shown at adult motion picture theatres,but rather at the secondary effects of such theaters on the surrounding community.id.at.emphasis in original.as long as the zoning ordinance did not ban the existence of these theaters outright,the supreme court found it to be content neutral.see id.at.the renton ordinance does not ban adult theaters altogether,but merely provides that such theaters may not be located within feet of any residential zone,single or dwelling,church,park,or school.similarly,the recruiting rule does not completely ban all communications between coaches and prospective students,but does keep them at a distance by prohibiting the coaches and those acting on their behalf from initiating the contact.
other examples of regulations that have been upheld against first amendment challenges despite limiting the time,place,and manner of the targeted activities include madsen women health,d upholding a state court injunction that restricted the use of sound amplification equipment and other noise created by protesters to certain hours and days members of city council taxpayers for vincent,d upholding an ordinance that prohibited the posting of signs on public property based on the government interest in promoting aesthetics heffron int l soc.for krishna consciousness,d upholding a state regulation requiring a religious organization that desired to distribute religious materials and solicit donations at a state fair to do so only at a rental booth in the designated area.
the supreme court has recognized that regulations can have a dampening effect on the substance of the protected speech,but that such limitations are constitutionally permissible.a regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral,even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.ward rock against racism,d upholding the regulation of noise levels at musical performances in a public park to avoid undue intrusion on the tranquility of the surrounding public and residential areas.assuming that tssaa is able to successfully establish that it has substantial governmental interests in support of the recruiting rule see part.below,we can not say that the rule incidental effect of preventing members of high school coaching staffs from initiating contact with middle school students is fatal to content neutrality.see united states playboy entm t group,d when the government restricts speech,the government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.
based on our conclusion that the recruiting rule is content neutral,it is subject to an intermediate scrutiny standard of review.see watchtower bible tract soc y of,village of stratton,ohio,cir.c time,place,and manner regulations are acceptable so long as they are designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.city of renton,at.see also ward,at.the time,place,or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government legitim
