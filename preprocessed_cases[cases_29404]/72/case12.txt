we conclude that the term establishment for purposes of the amusement or recreational establishment exemption to the flsa means a distinct,physical place of business,agree with the district court that the exemption applies to fanfest,and do not reach the question of whether chen was an employee.

defendants staffed the all star week events primarily with volunteers some two thousand in total.the volunteers carried out a range of duties including greeting customers,answering questions and providing directions,taking tickets,checking credentials,staffing activities,and distributing gifts.chen alleges that although these individuals were identified as volunteers,they expected and received compensation in the form of free admission to events and benefits such as,caps,drawstring backpacks,fanny packs,water bottles,baseballs,lanyards,free admission to fanfest for each volunteer and a guest,and a chance to win a pair of tickets to the all star game 
chen worked three shifts,totaling approximately fourteen hours,at fanfest between july and july.during his shifts,chen stamped the wrists of fanfest attendees,handed out bags of baseball paraphernalia,placed paper flyers in bags,directed attendees to the exits,alphabetized liability waivers,and worked at a fielding station instructing attendees to deposit the balls they fielded into buckets.prior to fanfest chen also attended three hours of mandatory information and orientation sessions in june and july,at citi field,the site of the all star game,and at the javits center.chen received no wages for the shift work or training sessions but was provided a,cap,drawstring backpack,water bottle,and baseball.

discussion 
this appeal centers principally on the meaning of the word establishment as it is used in section a of the flsa,which exempts seasonal amusement and recreational establishments from the flsa minimum wage requirements.see a.chen contends that because the district court held that establishment meant a distinct,physical place of business,it erroneously concluded that fanfest was the relevant establishment and was covered by the exemption.chen argues instead that fanfest and major league baseball,which defendants concede is not covered by the exemption,are a single establishment for purposes of the flsa.the district court,in chen view,should have applied the department of labor dol test for determining whether a business unit is a separate establishment.this approach looks not just to physical separation but also to whether the unit operates separately and whether employees are shared between units both inquiries likely not resolvable from the face of the complaint.
as this circuit has not previously addressed the amusement or recreational establishment exemption,we must determine,as a threshold matter,the meaning of the term establishment for purposes of section a.we then turn to the question of whether,at the motion to dismiss stage,the district court properly determined on the facts alleged that fanfest,as the relevant establishment,is covered by the exemption.

b.the meaning of establishment for purposes of a 
when construing a statute,we begin with its language and proceed under the assumption that the statutory language,unless otherwise defined,carries its plain meaning therefore,we consider the ordinary,meaning of the words used in the statute.united states duaray,cir.a bsent ambiguity,interpretation of the statute will generally end there.collazos united states,cir.however,where a statute is ambiguous,we may look to legislative history to discern the legislature intent.gordon softech,cir.
the flsa was enacted to eliminate labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,efficiency,and general of workers.a.in that vein,the flsa mandates employers pay covered employees a minimum wage.id.as we have noted,the flsa is a remedial statute,written in the broadest possible terms so that the minimum wage provisions would have the widest possible impact in the national economy.carter dutchess cmty,cir.however,congress also supplied certain exemptions,among these,that the minimum wage provisions shall not apply with respect to any employee employed by an establishment which is an amusement or recreational establishment if a it does not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year.a.the term establishment is not defined in the flsa.because the language of the statute does not itself plainly convey the meaning congress intended that term to impart,we turn to the legislative history.
the amusement and recreational establishment exemption was originally enacted in as an expansion of the exemption for certain retail and service establishments under section a of the flsa,stat,the senate committee report describing the exemption reads 
c amusement and recreational establishments operating on a seasonal basis.a similar exemption,without regard to the annual sales volume of the enterprise,is provided for employees of amusement and recreational establishments operating on a seasonal basis.these establishments are typically those operated by concessionaires at amusement parks and beaches and are in operation for months or less than a year.
reprinted in cong.admin.news at.in the exemption for amusement and recreational establishments was removed from section a and a revised exemption was created at section a,where it remains today in amended form,title ii,stat,sess.reprinted in cong.admin.news.prior to the amendment,employees of an amusement or recreational establishment operating on a seasonal basis were exempt only if the establishment was also a retail or service establishment with more than half its sales occurring in intrastate commerce.a ii repealed by,c,stat.the amended wording seems to have been intended to establish criteria for seasonality,and by eliminating the retail and service language to make plain that employees of seasonal amusement or recreational companies generally are exempt.marshall new hampshire jockey club,cir.this rather limited legislative history little aids our interpretation of establishment.
however,the supreme court considered the meaning of establishment under the now repealed section a exemption.in phillips,walling,the court found that congress used the word establishment as it is normally used in business and in government as meaning a distinct physical place of business,footnote omitted see mitchell bekins van storage,in so doing,the court rejected the contention that the respondent chain of grocery stores together with its separate warehouse and central office serving those stores constituted a single retail establishment within the meaning of the exemption.see phillips,at.each of these physically separate business units was held to be a distinct establishment within the meaning of the flsa.
while the supreme court construed establishment for purposes of the retail establishment exemption in phillips,we perceive no basis to conclude that congress intended a different meaning under the amusement or recreational establishment exemption,in particular as the latter provision was originally enacted as part of the former.see,stat.in addition,a house committee report discussing the amendment indicates that congress understood establishment to have the same meaning with respect to the flsa more generally.see,treating construction activities as enterprises since t he committee believe d that difficulty could arise in applying the concept of establishment,as contained in the bill as introduced,with respect to the proposed coverage of the construction industry,which performs its work at many different job sites.
additionally,the currently applicable dol regulations define establishment for the purposes of section a as a distinct physical place of business,as opposed to an entire business or enterprise which may include several separate places of business.this definition adopts the meaning of the term as it is normally used in business and in government,is judicially settled,and has been recognized in the congress in the course of enactment of amendatory legislation.id.citing phillips,mitchell,cong.rec.the regulations also specifically distinguish establishment from a business enterprise the term establishment means a distinct physical place of business rather than an entire business or enterprise.id.in contrast,an enterprise may consist of a single establishment which may be operated by one or more employers or it may be composed of a number of establishments which may be operated by one or more employers.id.internal citations omitted.thus,a multiunit business or enterprise may consist of one company that conducts its single business in a number of establishments.id.b see id.the term establishment is not synonymous with the words business or enterprise when those terms are used to describe multiunit operations.the dol provides as an example 
a manufacturer may operate a plant for production of its goods,a separate warehouse for storage and distribution,and several stores from which its products are sold.each such physically separate place of business is a separate establishment.in the case of chain store systems,branch stores,groups of independent stores organized to carry on business in a manner similar to chain store systems,and retail outlets operated by manufacturing or distributing concerns,each separate place of business ordinarily is a separate establishment.
id.at.the dol regulations are,as the district court found,internally consistent,and generally consistent with judicial interpretations of the exemption,chen,d at,and,as such,supply a persuasive interpretation of the statute 
based on the foregoing,we conclude that congress used the term establishment for purposes of the exemption at section a,a,to mean a distinct,physical place of business as opposed to an integrated multiunit business or enterprise.see brennan yellowstone park lines,cir concluding that establishment as used in a is to be judged in the same light as that term is judged under a.
chen acknowledges that this definition of establishment applies generally to flsa exemptions.appellant br.at.however,he argues that this meaning was intended for retail establishments only and that the dol applies an alternative,test for seasonal exemptions.we find neither of these arguments availing.
the dol regulations defining establishment plainly are not limited to retail endeavors.although the relevant dol regulations contained in are entitled the fair labor standards act as applied to retailers of goods or services,section affirmatively states that it provides the meaning of the term as used in section a as a whole and is not restricted to any particular exemption.as the dol has noted,section a of the amended act does not require that the amusement or recreational establishment be a retail or service establishment as was required under section a ii of the prior act.dep of labor,opinion letter,flsa,dolwh lexis june.our sister circuits also looked to the regulations contained in in the context of amusement and recreational establishments not primarily engaged in the sale of goods or services.see,chessin keystone resort,cir ski resorts marshall,at track.
nor do we find merit in chen contention that applies a test to determine the relevant establishment for exemptions based on the seasonality of operations.that regulation describes the test for distinguishing whether two or more physically separated portions of a business though located on the same premises may constitute more than one establishment for purposes of the exemptions.id.to be considered a separate establishment the business unit seeking an exemption must be physically separated from the other activities performed at the same location,be functionally operated as a separate unit having separate records,and separate bookkeeping,and undertake no interchange of employees between the units.id.neither the explanatory text of the regulation nor its title,s eparate establishments on the same premises,indicates any relationship to the seasonal exemption at issue here.
the agency opinion letters chen cites do not establish that the dol applies this test to amusement or recreational establishments because of their seasonality.dol letters applying do so because the parties seeking agency guidance concerning the section a exemption had multiple business units operating at the same premises.see,dep of labor,opinion letter,flsa,wl,analyzing w
