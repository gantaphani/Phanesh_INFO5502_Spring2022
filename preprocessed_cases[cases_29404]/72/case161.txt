in knight jewett cal th,d,knight,we considered the duty of care that should govern the liability of sports participants.we recognized that careless conduct by coparticipants is an inherent risk in many sports,and that holding participants liable for resulting injuries would discourage vigorous competition.accordingly,those involved in a sporting activity do not have a duty to reduce the risk of harm that is inherent in the sport itself.they do,however,have a duty not to increase that inherent risk.see avila citrus community college dist.cal th,d.thus,sports participants have a limited duty of care to their coparticipants,breached only if they intentionally injure them or engage in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.knight,at,d,fn.omitted.this application of the primary assumption of risk doctrine recognizes that by choosing to participate,individuals assume that level of risk inherent in the sport.
this case represents the next generation of our knight jurisprudence.knight,supra,cal th,d,involved touch football.we expressly left open the question whether the primary assumption of risk doctrine should apply to noncontact sports,such as golf.id.at,fn,d.we address that question here.we hold that the primary assumption of risk doctrine does apply to golf and that being struck by a carelessly hit ball is an inherent risk of the sport.as we explain,whether defendant breached the limited duty of care he owed other golfers by engaging in conduct that was so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in golf id.at,d,depends on resolution of disputed material facts.thus,defendant summary judgment motion was properly denied.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff and defendant were playing golf with jeffrey frost at the rancho park golf course in los angeles.defendant,the first of the threesome to complete the hole,went to the tee box plaintiff and frost then finished putting and followed him.frost took the cart path to the tee box,which placed him perpendicular to,or slightly behind,defendant and to his right.plaintiff took a shortcut,which placed him in front of defendant and to his left.plaintiff stopped there to get a bottle of water out of his golf bag and to check his cell phone for messages.he did so even though he knew that he was in front of the tee box,that defendant was preparing to tee off,and that he should stand behind a player who was teeing off.defendant inadvertently pulled his tee shot to the left,hitting plaintiff in the temple.when struck,plaintiff was to feet from defendant,at a to angle from the intended path of the ball.plaintiff claims his injuries were disabling,serious,and permanent 
the parties dispute whether defendant knew where plaintiff was standing when he teed off.plaintiff alleged that he and defendant made eye contact before defendant hit his shot.however,his accounts of just when that eye contact occurred were inconsistent.in his deposition,plaintiff testified that we made eye contact as i was cutting up the hill toward the tee box.italics added.on the other hand,in his declaration,plaintiff stated that he made eye contact with defendant after he reached the location where he was struck.p rior to anyone teeing off on the hole,i made eye contact with d efendant ahn as he saw me standing in front of him in close proximity to his left.
in his declaration,defendant stated during the practice swing i looked to see if the area directly ahead of me where i was aiming was clear.i did not see anyone.i then stepped forward and focused on the golf ball for to seconds while settling into my stance and then i hit the ball.in his deposition,defendant testified he did not know where plaintiff was,either when he took his practice swing or when he actually teed off.
in his declaration,plaintiff expert stated that golf etiquette requires that a player ensure that no one is in a position to be struck when he or she hits the ball.see usga,the rules of golf,supra,etiquette.if defendant knew plaintiff was in jeopardy,he should have shouted a warning before teeing off.ibid.
when plaintiff sued for negligence,defendant sought summary judgment,relying on the primary assumption of risk doctrine.the trial court initially agreed that the doctrine applied,found no triable issue of material fact,and granted summary judgment.however,the trial court later reversed itself,concluding that triable issues remained.
the court of appeal affirmed,holding that the primary assumption of risk doctrine did not apply.this holding was contrary to that in dilger moyles th,d dilger,in which a different district of the court of appeal held that being struck by a ball is a risk inherent in golf and that the primary assumption of risk doctrine applied to the case of a defendant whose errant shot struck another golfer playing a different hole.the court of appeal in this case distinguished dilger on the ground that the golfer whose ball struck the plaintiff in that case was playing in a different group.here,plaintiff and defendant were playing together.the court of appeal applied general negligence principles and concluded that defendant breached a general duty of care owed to a member of his own playing group by failing to ascertain where he was before teeing off.because it also determined that plaintiff conduct raised issues of comparative negligence,it remanded the matter for trial on apportionment of fault.
we reject the duty analysis of the court of appeal and conclude that the primary assumption of risk doctrine regulates the duty a golfer owes both to playing partners and to other golfers on the course.defendant summary judgment motion was,however,properly denied.material questions of fact remain bearing on whether defendant breached his limited duty of care to plaintiff by engaging in conduct that was so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in golf.see knight,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.discussion 
generally,one owes a duty of ordinary care not to cause an unreasonable risk of harm to others,subd.a rowland christian cal d.the existence of a duty is not an immutable fact of nature,but rather an expression of policy considerations providing legal protection.parsons crown disposal cal th,d.thus,the existence and scope of a defendant duty is a question for the court resolution.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d,kahn.when a sports participant is injured,the considerations of policy and duty necessarily become intertwined with the question of whether the injured person can be said to have assumed the risk.avila,supra,cal th at,d.
california abandonment of the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of comparative negligence li yellow cab cal d,li led this court to revisit the assumption of risk doctrine in knight,supra,cal th,d.
knight and its progeny in this court 
in knight,supra,cal th,d,the plurality noted that there are two types of assumption of risk primary and secondary.id.at,d,plur.opn.of george.under the primary assumption of risk doctrine,the defendant owes no duty to protect a plaintiff from particular harms arising from ordinary,or simple negligence.ibid.in a sports context,the doctrine bars liability because the plaintiff is said to have assumed the particular risks inherent in a sport by choosing to participate.id.at,d.thus,a court need not ask what risks a particular plaintiff subjectively knew of and chose to encounter,but instead must evaluate the fundamental nature of the sport and the defendant role in or relationship to that sport in order to determine whether the defendant owes a duty to protect a plaintiff from the particular risk of harm.knight,supra,cal th at,d.avila,supra,cal th at,d.
the knight court used baseball as an example.in baseball,a batter is not supposed to carelessly throw the bat after getting a hit and starting to run to first base.however,the primary assumption of risk doctrine recognizes that vigorous bat deployment is an integral part of the sport and a risk players assume when they choose to participate.especially in the heat of competition,and in an effort to get to first base quickly,a batter may be careless in freeing himself or herself from the bat encumbrance.thus,under the doctrine,a batter does not have a duty to another player to avoid carelessly throwing the bat after getting a hit.
in knight,supra,cal th,d,we stressed the chilling effect that would flow from imposing liability on touch football players for ordinary careless conduct.e ven when a participant conduct violates a rule of the game and may subject the violator to internal sanctions prescribed by the sport itself,imposition of legal liability for such conduct might well alter fundamentally the nature of the sport by deterring participants from vigorously engaging in activity id.at,d,italics omitted.accordingly,we concluded that coparticipants limited duty of care is to refrain from intentionally injuring one another or engaging in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
a majority of this court has since extended knight application of the primary assumption of risk doctrine to other sports.see avila,supra,cal th at,d,kahn,supra,cal th at,d,cheong antablin cal th,d,cheong.
cheong,supra,cal th,d,involved skiing.one skier sued another for injuries he suffered when the other skier turned and unintentionally ran into him.we concluded that,under the applicable common law principles,a skier owes a duty to fellow skiers not to injure them intentionally or to act recklessly,but a skier may not sue another for simple negligence id.at,d.because there was no evidence that the defendant acted recklessly or intentionally injured the plaintiff,we concluded that the defendant motion for summary judgment was properly granted.ibid.
in kahn,supra,cal th,d,the plaintiff was a novice on a school swim team.she broke her neck during a meet when she executed a practice dive into a shallow racing pool located on school property.she sued the school district,alleging that the injury was caused in part by the failure of her coach,a district employee,to give her any instruction in how to safely dive into a shallow pool.she also sued the coach as an individual for failing to adequately supervise her and for insisting that she dive or risk dismissal.id.at,d.
we applied the primary assumption of risk doctrine based on the coach relationship to the sport.although,the individual defendant was the swimmer coach,rather than an active competitor,he had a direct relationship to the competition.t he relationship of a sports instructor or coach to a student or athlete is different from the relationship between coparticipants in a sport.but because a significant part of an instructor or coach role is to challenge or push a student or athlete to advance in his or her skill level and to undertake more difficult tasks,and because the fulfillment of such a role could be improperly chilled by too stringent a standard of potential legal liability,we conclude that the same general standard should apply in cases in which an instructor alleged liability rests primarily on a claim that he or she challenged the player to perform beyond his or her capacity or failed to provide adequate instruction or supervision before directing or permitting a student to perform a particular maneuver that has resulted in injury to the student.a sports instructor may be found to have breached a duty of care to a student or athlete only if the instructor intentionally injures the student or engages in conduct that is reckless in the sense that it is totally outside the range of the ordinary activity citation involved in teaching or coaching the sport.kahn,supra,cal th at,d.
applying that standard,we concluded the defendants summary judgment motion was granted in error.we noted evidence of defendant coach failure to provide plaintiff with training in diving,his awareness of plaintiff intense fear of diving into shallow water,his conduct in lulling plaintiff into a false sense of security by promising that she would not be required to dive at competitions,his breach of this promise in the heat of a competition,and his threat to remove her from competition or at least from the meet if she refused to dive.plaintiff evidence supports the conclusion that the maneuver of diving into a shallow racing pool,if not done correctly,poses a significant risk of extremely serious injury,and that there is a mode of instruction for teaching a student to perform this maneuver safely.the declarations before the trial court raise a disputed issue of fact as to whether defendant coach provided any instruction at all to plaintiff with regard to the safe performance of such a maneuver,as well as to the existence and nature of the coach promises and threats.under these circumstances,the question whether the coach conduct was reckless in that it fell totally outside the range of ordinary activity involved in teaching or coaching this sport can not properly be resolved on summary judgment.kahn,supra,cal th at,d.
avila,supra,cal th,d,involved intercollegiate baseball.a pitcher on the rio hondo community college team rio hondo hit a batter on the citrus community college team citrus.the next inning the citrus pitcher allegedly retaliated by hitting a rio hondo batter with a beanball.the rio hondo player sued the citrus community college district for negligence.we held the suit was barred by the primary assumption of risk doctrine it is against the rules of baseball to intentionally throw at a batter.id.at,d.nevertheless,being intentionally thrown at is a fundamental part and inherent risk of the sport of baseball.it is not the function of tort law to police such conduct,fn.omitted.
plaintiff urges us to repudiate the primary assumption of risk doctrine.he relies upon arguments made against it by the authors of the separate opinions in knight,supra,cal th,d.continuing to find those arguments unpersuasive,we reaffirm the doctrine,as we did in cheong,supra,cal th,d,kahn,supra,cal th,footnote,d,and avila,supra,cal th,d.
court of appeal cases applying knight to golf 
in knight,supra,cal th,d,we expressly left open the question whether the primary assumption of risk doctrine should be applied to sports like golf.id.at,fn,d.subsequently,courts of appeal have grappled with the issue.
as noted,in dilger,supra,th,d,the plaintiff was playing one hole when she was struck by a ball hit from another.dilger sued the other golfer,in whose favor the trial court entered summary judgment.
the court of appeal affirmed,holding that the primary assumption of risk doctrine applied.t he court reasoning in knight,supra,cal th,d,in limiting active sports participants liability applies equally as well to the sport of golf.
while golf may not be as physically demanding as basketball or football,risk is nonetheless inherent in the sport.hitting a golf ball at a high rate of speed involves the very real possibility that the ball will take flight in an unintended direction.if every ball behaved as the golfer wished,there would be little sport in the sport of golf.that shots go awry is a risk that all golfers,even the professionals,assume when they play.
holding participants liable for missed hits would only encourage lawsuits and deter players from enjoying the sport.golf offers many healthful advantages to both the golfer and the community.the physical exercise in the fresh air with the smell of the pines and eucalyptus renews the spirit and refreshes the body.the sport offers an opportunity for recreation with friends and the chance to meet other citizens with like interests.a foursome can be a very social event,relieving each golfer of the stresses of business and everyday urban life.neighborhoods benefit by the scenic green belts golf brings to their communities,and wild life enjoy and flourish in a friendly habitat.social policy dictates that the law should not discourage participation in such an activity whose benefits to the individual player and to the community at large are so great.dilger,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
in american golf superior court th,d,a golfer shot ricocheted off a wooden yardage marker and injured his companion.the companion sued the golf course for negligent design and placement of the marker.the court of appeal,relying upon dilger,supra,th,d,applied the primary assumption of risk doctrine.american golf,at,d.it granted the golf course petition for writ of mandate directing the trial court to grant its motion for summary judgment.id.at,d.we hold golf is an active sport,errant shots are an inherent risk of golf,yardage markers are an integral part of the sport,and the golf course as recreation provider did not increase the risk of injury by its design and placement of the yardage marker.ibid.
the court in hemady long beach unified school dist.th,d considered the question of inherent risk in a different context.there,one student inadvertently hit another with a golf club during a seventh grade physical education class.the injured student sued the school district and the instructor for negligence.the trial court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.applying the primary assumption of risk doctrine,it concluded that plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendants conduct was extraordinarily reckless within the meaning of knight,supra,cal th at page,d.hemady,at,d.the court of appeal reversed.noting that the primary assumption of the risk doctrine bars liability for those injuries arising from the particular risks that are inherent in a sport knight,supra,cal th at,d,the court of appeal concluded that being hit on the head by a club is not an inherent risk in golf.thus a conventional duty analysis was called for.hemady,at,d.
c.the court of appeal inappropriate limitation of dilger 
the court of appeal here concluded that golf is an active sport in which participants run the risk of being hit by an errant ball.nevertheless,it declined to apply the primary assumption of risk doctrine.it distinguished dilger,supra,th,d,on the ground that the plaintiff there was struck by a ball hit from another hole,whereas shin was struck by a ball hit by a member of his own threesome.
in support of its conclusion,the court of appeal reached back to and outside california authority to the louisiana case of allen pinewood country club,so d allen pinewood.
in allen pinewood,supra,so d,the plaintiff and the defendant were golfers in the same foursome.after all of the players hit their tee shots,they walked to their respective balls.the defendant had topped his tee shot,landing far behind the plaintiff.the defendant shouted fore and hit his second shot.the plaintiff,hearing the shout,turned around and was struck in the face by the ball.id.at.
the louisiana court described the pivotal issue as whether plaintiff was guilty of negligence barring his recovery by proceeding ahead of a member of plaintiff own party whom plaintiff knew,or had reason to know,would hit his shot next.allen pinewood,supra,so d at.the court held the defendant was liable under a proximate cause analysis.if the plaintiff was negligent in proceeding ahead of the defendant,his negligence was only a remote cause of his injury,whereas the defendant negligence,in making his shot without ensuring the plaintiff had heard his warning,was the proximate cause.id.at.
allen pinewood,supra,so d,was a slender reed upon which to lean.the intermediate appellate court in louisiana decided the case almost two decades before this court issued its opinion in knight,supra,cal th,d.thus,it applied a conventional negligence analysis.it did not consider the primary assumption of risk doctrine or whether that doctrine should apply to golf.certainly it did not address whether,in applying the doctrine to golf,a distinction should be drawn among defendants based on whether they are members of the plaintiff playing group.
we are not persuaded that a case should turn on whether a defendant is playing with the plaintiff,or in another group.the question of duty involves the relationship of the parties to the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d.coparticipants have the same relationship to the sport whether they are in the same playing group or not.this analysis is consistent with our conclusion in cheong,supra,cal th,d.there the parties were not competing against each other.they were coparticipants,however,because they were both engaged in the same sport,at the same time,using a common venue.the golfers both here and in dilger,supra,th,d,were sharing the same course,just as the skiers in cheong were using the same ski run.
the first court to apply the reckless disregard or intentional conduct standard to golf appears to have been the supreme court of ohio in thompson mcneill ohio,thompson.schick ferolito,schick.in thompson,at page,the defendant shanked a shot.the plaintiff,a member of the defendant foursome,was standing at a angle to the intended path of a ball that struck her.the ohio supreme court held that only injuries caused by intentional conduct,or in some instances reckless misconduct,may give rise to a cause of action by one golfer against another.thompson,at.
applying that standard,the thompson court affirmed a grant of summary judgment in the defendant favor.shanking the ball is a foreseeable and not uncommon occurrence in the game of golf.the same is true of hooking,slicing,pushing,or pulling a golf shot.we would stress that i t is well known that not every shot played by a golfer goes to the point where he intends it to go.if such were the case,every player would be perfect and the whole pleasure of the sport would be lost.it is common knowledge,at least among players,that many bad shots must result although every stroke is delivered with the best possible intention and without any negligence whatsoever.benjamin nernberg.thompson,supra,at.
in schick,supra,the new jersey supreme court followed thompson,supra,ohio,as well as dilger,supra,th,d.in schick,at page the defendant hit a second tee shot,or mulligan,striking a member of his foursome.the new jersey supreme court applied the reckless or intentional misconduct standard.we perceive no persuasive reason to apply an artificial distinction between contact and noncontact sports.in fact,only a minority of courts do so.citations.id.at.the new jersey supreme court went on to hold that the trial court erred in granting the defendant motion for summary judgment because the facts would have supported a verdict of recklessness.the court pointed to defendant own testimony that he perceived plaintiff to be in the line of fire and that he waved plaintiff off in an effort to induce plaintiff to move from his location.id.at.plaintiff did not move.the defendant did not wait for him to do so and hit his shot anyway.the court held,t hat scenario presents a set of facts that a jury could find constitutes reckless conduct because it may reflect a conscious choice of a course of action with knowledge or reason to know that the action will create serious danger to others.ibid.
in gray giroux,the massachusetts appeals court held that the wilful,wanton,or reckless standard of conduct,and not ordinary negligence is the appropriate standard of care in noncontact sports such as golf.id.at.applying that standard,the appeals court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant,a member of the plaintiff playing group.here,the undisputed facts demonstrate that the plaintiff was standing at the edge of the woods on the left side of the fairway about to fifty yards in front of the defendant,whose ball was in the rough on the same side.because the hole was a dogleg to the right,and the plaintiff and the defendant were both on the left side of the fairway,the defendant obviously was not aiming his shot toward the edge of the woods where the plaintiff was standing instead,he was trying to place the ball on the green to the right.thus,the plaintiff was not within the intended path of the defendant shot.moreover,it is undisputed that the defendant did not see the plaintiff before he took his shot.in these circumstances,the fact that the defendant shot did not follow its intended path does not amount to wilful,wanton,or reckless conduct,fns.omitted.
in allen donath,the plaintiff was struck by a mulligan hit by a member of his threesome.it was disputed whether th
