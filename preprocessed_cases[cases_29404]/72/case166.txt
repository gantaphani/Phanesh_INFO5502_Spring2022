introduction 
the national collegiate athletic association the ncaa unsuccessfully moved the trial court to seal pages of the record in a lawsuit brought against it by plaintiff,todd mcnair,a former assistant football coach at the university of southern california usc.the ncaa specially moved to strike plaintiff complaint on the ground the action was a strategic lawsuit against public participation code civ,and moved the trial court to seal certain records.although the trial court denied the ncaa motion to seal,it conditionally sealed the documents at issue pending appellate review.in connection with its appeal from the denial of its special motion to strike,the ncaa moved this court to seal the same documents lodged as part of the appellate record.we do not decide the substantive merits of the appeal we address only the interim motion to seal.
recognizing the public first amendment right of access to documents used at trial or as a basis of adjudication and a presumption of openness of substantive court proceedings in ordinary cases,our supreme court in nbc subsidiary knbc tv,superior court cal th nbc subsidiary set forth the findings that both the trial and appellate courts must expressly make to seal a record.id.at,fn.courts must find that there is an overriding interest supporting sealing records there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent sealing the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.id.at.we conclude the ncaa failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that its interest in the confidentiality of its enforcement proceedings overrides the constitutional right of access and the presumption of openness,or how this interest in confidentiality would be prejudiced if the documents at issue were disclosed.therefore,we deny the ncaa motion to seal the appellate record lodged conditionally under seal.
factual and procedural background 
the ncaa is a private,voluntary organization composed of approximately colleges,universities,and other educational institutions throughout the united states.its purpose is to maintain intercollegiate athletics as an integral part of the educational program and the athlete as an integral part of the student body,and by so doing,retain a clear line of demarcation between college athletics and professional sports.toward that end,the ncaa adopted a constitution,bylaws,and regulations.one of the ways it accomplishes its purpose is by enforcing its rules and regulations.member institutions,their employees,student athletes,and alumni agree to comply with the rules and regulations and to submit to the ncaa process.because the ncaa does not have subpoena power,however,the enforcement staff relies on the cooperation of witnesses.
in connection with its investigation into whether former usc running back reggie bush had received improper benefits while a student,the ncaa interviewed plaintiff and others.the ncaa then issued its committee on infractions coi final report.
plaintiff filed his complaint against the ncaa for damages for breach of contract,defamation,and other torts.the ncaa countered with a special motion to strike arguing that plaintiff lawsuit should be dismissed as a strategic lawsuit against public participation.
plaintiff applied to lift the automatic stay of discovery imposed as the result of the ncaa special motion to strike,subd.g.he sought to take the depositions of the lead investigator,coi chairman,and coi director,and obtain copies of transcripts from the coi and appeals committee hearings,the entire investigative file,and drafts of the coi report,including all notes,and other writings discussing or referring to the drafts,and within the custody and control of the ncaa,by or to members of the coi or appeals committee staff that mentioned or related to plaintiff.
the trial court granted plaintiff motion,subject to a protective order and the court supervision,determining that plaintiff had made a showing of good cause for the discovery,subd.g.the ncaa unsuccessfully challenged the discovery order in a petition for writ of mandate and then produced the enumerated documents.
after the parties signed the protective order,the ncaa moved the trial court to seal unredacted versions of plaintiff opposition to the ncaa special motion to strike,his memorandum of points and authorities in support thereof,the declarations of plaintiff and his counsel,and specified exhibits attached thereto,including the coi report,the ncaa case summary provided to the coi,memoranda drafted by members of the coi concerning the allegations,excerpts of witness interviews,telephone records,the notice of allegations,excerpts of the deposition testimony of ncaa officials describing the ncaa investigative and adjudicative process,between coi members while adjudicating the allegations,excerpts of the coi hearing transcripts,plaintiff response to the notice of allegations,and his appeal to the ncaa appeals committee.the ncaa argued that its bylaws require it to keep its investigations strictly confidential.ncaa investigators rely on confidential sources for much of the information they gather,and promise confidentiality to witnesses to obtain needed facts.if the requested documents were not sealed,it argued,its enforcement proceedings would be made public,thereby prejudicing its enforcement abilities and embarrassing witnesses who had relied on confidentiality.the parties lodged the relevant documents conditionally under seal.
the trial court ruled that the ncaa failed to make a sufficient factual showing to seal the documents.thus,the court denied the ncaa motion to seal but stayed enforcement of its ruling and ordered the documents at issue to remain conditionally lodged under seal pending appellate review.
after it filed its notice of appeal from the denial of its special motion to strike,the ncaa moved this court to seal the portion of the appellate record that had been conditionally sealed in the trial court.we ordered the enumerated documents in the record on appeal conditionally sealed pending resolution of this motion 
discussion 
a.in california,court records are presumed to be open.
the public has a first amendment right of access to civil litigation documents filed in court and used at trial or submitted as a basis for adjudication.citation.substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases,and the transcripts and records pertaining to these proceedings,are presumptively open.citation.savaglio wal mart stores,th.as nbc subsidiary explained,the public has an interest,in all civil cases,in observing and assessing the performance of its public judicial system,and that interest strongly supports a general right of access in ordinary civil cases.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at.if public court business is conducted in private,it becomes impossible to expose corruption,incompetence,inefficiency,prejudice,and favoritism.for this reason traditional anglo american jurisprudence distrusts secrecy in judicial proceedings and favors a policy of maximum public access to proceedings and records of judicial tribunals.citation.id.at,fn,quoting from estate of hearst d.
openness is a presumption it is not an absolute.the presumption of openness can be overcome upon a proper showing compatible with the constitutional standards.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at.accordingly,as explained,before a trial court may order a record to be sealed,it must hold a hearing and expressly make findings that there is an overriding interest supporting sealing of the records there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent sealing the sealing order is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and there is no less restrictive means of meeting that interest.id.at.
these constitutionally required findings are embodied in the california rules of court rules through apply to the trial court.a record may not be sealed without a court order.rule a.the party seeking to have a record filed under seal must lodge it with the court,which will hold it conditionally under seal pending decision on the motion.rules b a lodged record is a record that is temporarily placed or deposited with the court,but not filed b fuller doe th.the trial court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it makes nbc subsidiary enumerated findings expressly.rule d,italics added.if the court denies the motion to seal the record,the court must not place it in the case file unless the moving party notifies the clerk in writing within days that the record is to be filed.rule b.
as the trial court did not grant the ncaa motion to seal below,the record was not filed in that court.rule b.a record not filed in the trial court may be filed under seal in the reviewing court only by order of the reviewing court it must not be filed under seal solely by stipulation or agreement of the parties.rule d.this matter is not an appeal from the trial court order denying a motion to seal.rather,the matter comes to us on a motion by the ncaa to seal the record in this court.the ncaa motion asked this court to determine whether certain aspects of our records should be sealed,or whether they should be open to the public.fuller doe,supra,th at.as the party seeking an order sealing appellate court records,the ncaa has the burden to justify the sealing.rule d.when we are concerned only with whether records in our own files should be sealed fuller doe,supra,at,we must make our own findings pursuant to rule d e.rules a d.we are required to broadly construe a court rule if it furthers the people right of access and to narrowly construe the court rule if it limits the right of access.cal,art.i,subd.b.if this court denies the sealing motion,the conditionally lodged documents must be returned to the moving party by this court clerk.rule d f d.
b.the ncaa failed to carry its burden to show an overriding interest justifying a sealing order.
turning to the first of the nbc subsidiary findings,in footnote nbc subsidiary listed examples of various interests that courts have identified as potentially constituting an overriding interest to justify closure of courtroom proceedings and by inference sealing otherwise open court documents.they include an accused interest in a fair trial a civil litigant right to a fair trial protection of minor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment privacy interests of a prospective juror during individual voir dire protection of witnesses from embarrassment or intimidation so extreme that it would traumatize them or render them unable to testify protection of trade secrets protection of information within the privilege enforcement of binding contractual obligations not to disclose safeguarding national security ensuring the anonymity of juvenile offenders in juvenile court ensuring the fair administration of justice and preservation of confidential investigative information.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn.
the ncaa contends its interest in the confidentiality of its enforcement proceedings overrides the public right of access to documents used as a basis for adjudication.it argues that enforcement is key to assuring some of its basic principles of promoting amateurism and protecting student athletes from exploitation.confidentiality is an essential enforcement tool,the ncaa argues,as it lacks the power to subpoena.assurances of confidentiality are critical to obtaining the cooperation of witnesses and the voluntary testimony of institutional representatives,coaches,and athletes.the ncaa cites its bylaws and contractual agreements as overriding interests.as shall be explained,these do not satisfy the nbc subsidiary test.
no overriding interest based on the ncaa bylaws 
the ncaa argues its bylaws requiring confidentiality justify a sealing order.plaintiff and the witnesses interviewed in connection with the usc enforcement proceeding all signed confidentiality statements 
the first bylaw the ncaa cites is section,which reads,the committee on infractions,the infractions appeals committee and the enforcement staff shall treat all cases before them as confidential until they have been announced in accordance with the proscribed procedures.in addition,an institution and any individual subject to ncaa rules involved in a case shall treat that case under inquiry by the enforcement staff as confidential until the case has been announced in accordance with prescribed procedures.italics added.this bylaw makes confidentiality ephemeral it only lasts until the case has been announced.the announcement has already been made and so bylaw does not elevate the ncaa asserted need for confidentiality during the enforcement proceeding to the status of an overriding interest now.nor is our conclusion altered by the fact that the ncaa reports only identify witnesses by position or classification,and not by name when a case is announced.as interveners observe,the public already knows that plaintiff is the assistant coach named in the coi and most of the witnesses names are already known.
the second bylaw the ncaa cites is,which involves the interview record.thereunder,copies of recorded interviews and unrecorded interview summaries and any report prepared by the enforcement staff are designated as confidential and may only be provided to interviewees as set forth in the bylaws.bylaws.under bylaw individuals and institutions are required to sign a statement of confidentiality and agree not to release transcripts to a third party.those failing to sign such an agreement may not record or transcribe the interview.
bylaws and do not justify sealing all of the documents the ncaa seeks to keep confidential.some of the information identified in bylaw was disclosed by the ncaa itself in the coi report,which discusses witness testimony.nor does this bylaw encompass many of the documents at issue in the ncaa motion to seal such as emails and other communications between committee members,case summaries,memoranda drafted by coi members deposition transcripts describing the investigative and adjudicative process transcripts of the coi hearings and plaintiff appeal to the ncaa appeals committee many of which documents do not involve witnesses whose cooperation the ncaa seeks to encourage with a promise of confidentiality.there is no connection between these internal documents and the ncaa promises of confidentiality to third party witnesses.for its part,bylaw clearly applies only to interviewees and their institutional representatives,and does not bind the courts.in short,one bylaw the ncaa cites as its overriding interest in confidentiality is temporally limited,and the other bylaws are restricted to witnesses,institutional representatives,and reports of witness interviews.none of the bylaws relied on by the ncaa provides the cloak of confidentiality it seeks here.
once parties file documents in court for adjudication in ordinary civil cases,the records become public.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at.documents may be sealed under the rules of court only upon a proper showing of nbc subsidiary four factors.but,the ncaa can not make the showing of an overriding interest to justify sealing merely because its internal bylaws say so by designating certain documents as confidential.
no overriding interest based on contractual agreement for confidentiality 
the ncaa also argues that a contractual agreement to treat cases as confidential should be recognized as an overriding interest.the ncaa relies on universal city studios,superior court th universal,where the petitioner argued that a contractual obligation not to disclose could give rise to a right to seal a settlement agreement containing a confidentiality clause.in rejecting this argument,universal discussed publicker industries,cohen cir,a third circuit case referred to in nbc subsidiary footnote for the proposition that an overriding interest may be present when there is a contractual obligation not to disclose the contents of documents.
universal concluded,however,that more than a mere agreement of the parties to seal documents filed in a public courtroom is needed.universal,supra,th at.there must be a specific showing of serious injury.citations.id.at.s pecificity is essential.citation.broad allegations of ha
