fabian luna,through his guardian ad litem,appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of edilberto vela in luna action for personal injuries suffered when luna tripped over a net line and fractured his elbow while participating in a recreational volleyball game in vela front yard.luna contends the trial court improperly applied the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk to bar his recovery.we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
the accident 
luna was invited to join vela summer evening game of volleyball in july.vela had created a volleyball court in his front yard,using a volleyball set he had purchased consisting of a net,net poles,tie lines to hold up the poles and yellow stakes to secure the tie lines in the ground he set up the equipment for family and friends who were at his house that evening luna,who lived with his family across the street from vela,joined the game approximately minutes after it started 
about minutes after play had resumed,a ball was hit and into the street.the sidewalk was being used as one of the lines for the court.luna went to retrieve the ball,tripped on one of the lines used to support the poles for the volleyball net and fell,hitting his arm on the street and fracturing his right elbow.the tie line,which was the same color and made from the same material as the volleyball net itself,was stretched across the sidewalk and anchored by one of the yellow stakes next to a tree in the narrow grass parkway between the sidewalk and the street.according to luna father,william luna,when vela told him his son had been injured,vela said he had tripped on the invisible string used to hold up the volleyball net.the tie line is elsewhere described as a thin pinkish colored string or wire.
luna complaint and vela motion for summary judgment 
luna filed an unverified form complaint for personal injuries against vela,alleging causes of action for general negligence and premises liability and seeking hospital and medical expenses,future medical expenses and general damages according to proof.vela answered with a general denial and asserted affirmative defenses,including assumption of the risk.
following discovery,including the deposition of luna,vela moved for summary judgment on the ground any recovery was barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk.vela argued being injured by tripping over a volleyball net pole line is a risk inherent in a front yard volleyball game.luna opposed the motion,contending vela had unreasonably increased the risk of injury inherent in the sport by his negligent placement of the net pole lines and by his use of nearly invisible string or wire,unmarked by flags or distinctive coloring,to secure the net poles.luna disputed,among other things,that photographs submitted by vela in support of the motion accurately depicted the net and supporting lines as assembled on the date of the accident the photographs show the line attached to a stake on vela front yard just inside the sidewalk luna father testified the line stretched across the sidewalk and was anchored in the parkway next to a tree.
the trial court order granting summary judgment 
the trial court granted the motion.citing to and quoting from the supreme court landmark decision in knight jewett cal th,d,knight and several court of appeal decisions,the court ruled luna action was barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk generally,a defendant has no duty to protect a plaintiff against risks inherent in the sport,but does have a duty to use care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those which are inherent in the sport here,plaintiff theory is that defendant placement of the net increased the risk of the informal volleyball game.in opposition to the motion,he proffers evidence which would create a triable issue of material fact with respect to the question of whether defendant negligently placed the tie lines for the net taking into account the dispute as to where the tie lines were placed,the court must look to the nature of the sport in question and the parties relationship to the activity to determine whether defendant conduct increased the risks.citation.that determination is a question of law.citation.from the evidence presented,the court finds that even taking plaintiff version of the events as true,defendant did nothing to increase the risks inherent in an informal volleyball game.the net was set up in defendant front yard and the location at which to place net poles and tie ropes was limited.even if one could find negligence in defendant placement of the tie ropes,attaching liability would chill the participation in common,casual recreational activities.citation.plaintiff failed to proffer any evidence to support his argument that defendant increased the inherent risk of volleyball,which includes tripping over the structures necessary to hold up the net.

knight and its progeny and the principles governing the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk 
in knight,supra,cal th,d,in a plurality decision written by chief justice george and subsequently accepted by all members of the court except justice kennard see,shin ahn cal th,d,id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard,the supreme court explained in a sports setting,under the primary assumption of the risk doctrine,the plaintiff is said to have assumed the particular risks inherent in a sport by choosing to participate and the defendant generally owes no duty to protect the plaintiff from those risks.a court need not ask what risks a particular plaintiff subjectively knew of and chose to encounter,but instead must evaluate the fundamental nature of the sport and the defendant role in or relationship to that sport in order to determine whether the defendant owes a duty to protect a plaintiff from the particular risk of harm.avila citrus community college dist.cal th,d,avila.
as applied to the potential liability of sports participants themselves,careless conduct alone is not enough a participant owes no duty to protect a coparticipant from particular harms arising from ordinary or simple negligence.knight,supra,cal th at,d,avila,supra,cal th at,d.rather,coparticipants limited duty of care is to refrain from intentionally injuring one another or engaging in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.shin ahn,supra,cal th at,d.this limited duty analysis grounded in the primary assumption of the risk doctrine applies to a wide variety of active example,touch football knight,at,d,skiing cheong antablin cal th,d,competitive swimming kahn,supra,cal th at,d,and baseball avila,at,d,as well as less active,noncontact sports such as golf.shin,at,d.
although acknowledging that one generally owes a duty of ordinary care not to cause an unreasonable risk of harm to others,in these sports liability cases the supreme court has held the policy considerations involved in determining the existence and scope of a defendant duty necessarily become intertwined with an evaluation of the nature of the activity involved and the relationship of the parties to that activity.see,knight,supra,cal th at,d,kahn,supra,cal th at,d,shin ahn,supra,cal th at,d.central to the court evaluation of duty is avoiding rules of liability that will alter the fundamental nature of the sport or chill the fervor of athletic competition.a s a matter of policy,it would not be appropriate to recognize a duty of care when to do so would require that an integral part of the sport be abandoned,or would discourage vigorous participation in sporting events.accordingly,defendants generally do not have a duty to protect the plaintiff from the risks inherent in the sport,or to eliminate risk from the sport,although they generally do have a duty not to increase the risk of harm beyond what is inherent in the sport.kahn,supra,cal th at,d,accord,shin,at,d,in knight the supreme court stressed the chilling effect that would flow from imposing liability on touch football players for ordinary careless conduct.e ven when a participant conduct violates a rule of the game and may subject the violator to internal sanctions prescribed by the sport itself,imposition of legal liability for such conduct might well alter fundamentally the nature of the sport by deterring participants from vigorously engaging in activity cheong antablin,supra,cal th at,d,b y eliminating liability for unintended accidents,the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk ensures that the fervor of athletic competition will not be chilled by the constant threat of litigation from every misstep,sharp turn and sudden stop.
the supreme court,however,has repeatedly emphasized the question of duty in the sports context depends not only on the nature of the activity but also on the role of the defendant whose conduct is at issue in a given case.kahn,supra,cal th at,d,quoting knight,supra,cal th at,d.duties with respect to the same risk may vary according to the role played by particular defendants involved in the sport.see avila,supra,cal th at,d,we have also noted in dicta that those responsible for maintaining athletic facilities have a similar duty not to increase the inherent risks,albeit in the context of businesses selling recreational opportunities.as an example of this distinction,the court,first in knight and then again in kahn,has explained a batter in baseball has no duty to avoid carelessly throwing a bat after hitting the conduct being an inherent risk of the a stadium owner,because of his or her different relationship to the sport,may have a duty to take reasonable measures to protect spectators from carelessly thrown bats.for the stadium owner,reasonable steps may minimize the risk without altering the nature of the sport.kahn,at,d,see knight,at,d,see also shin ahn,supra,cal th at,d.
the significance of the defendant role in the sporting is,whether the defendant is an organizer of the activity or someone who has provided or maintained the facilities and equipment used,rather than simply a been illustrated in a number of court of appeal decisions applying the primary assumption of the risk doctrine.thus,in morgan fuji country usa,th,d the court reversed summary judgment in favor of a golf course owner,concluding,even if being struck by a misguided golf ball is an inherent risk of the sport,the defendant had a duty to design its course,for example by the way the tees,fairways and greens are aligned or separated,that did not increase this risk of harm.id.at,d.i f the relationship between the parties was one of coparticipants,if the defendant here were the golfer who hit the errant ball the defendant would have no liability towards morgan because there is an inherent risk that the defendant would hit an errant ball.morgan,however,is not suing the other player he is suing the owner and operator of the golf course.fuji,as owner and operator of the castle creek course owes a different duty to morgan and other golfers.id.at,d.
similarly,in solis kirkwood resort th,d,the third district reversed the trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant ski resort in a personal injury lawsuit brought by a skier who alleged,while skiing,and without warning,he entered an area of the resort that had recently been altered to accommodate a ski race and contained hazardous jumps that increased the risk of harm to skiers and caused him to fall and injure himself.id.at,d.the court of appeal agreed with the trial court that falling is an inherent risk of skiing and a ski resort has no duty to eliminate or mitigate the inherent risks of skiing lest the thrill of the sport be sapped.id.at,d.nonetheless,the court held a resort can not increase the risks associated with skiing without incurring a duty of care toward its patrons.ibid.
applying the same fundamental primary assumption of the risk analysis,the court in saffro elite racing,th,d,reversed summary judgment in favor of the organizer of a marathon race,holding the organizer owed a duty to participants to arrange and conduct a reasonably safe event by providing sufficient water and electrolyte replacement drinks,which minimize d the risks without altering the nature of the sport.other courts have likewise reversed summary judgments on the ground owners and operators of sports facilities,as well as providers of services and materials,owe a duty of care to participants not to design or operate sports facilities or provide services in a manner that increases the risk of harm to them beyond that inherent in the sport.see,giardino brown th,d provider of horses to children camp had a duty to at least not knowingly or without due care provide horses inappropriate for beginning riders van dyke th,d reversing grant of summary judgment in favor of ski resort owner when a ski area puts signs in a ski run it has a duty to mark the signs so they are plainly visible from all angles to skiers who are skiing on the run branco kearny moto park,th,d motocross operator owed duty to bicycle racer not to design jumps in such a way to create an extreme risk of injury such dangerously designed jumps are not inherently required in the sport.
the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law vela arguably negligent use and placement of nearly invisible net pole lines did not increase the risks inherent in playing volleyball 
we do not doubt tripping over a tie line used to secure the net poles while retrieving a ball hit out of bounds is a risk inherent in a front yard volleyball game.the possibility of such an accident,as vela argues and the trial court ruled in granting summary judgment,if not common knowledge,would at least seem to be a matter of common sense.compare staten superior court th,d t he determinant of duty,inherent risk,is to be decided solely as a question of law and is necessarily reached from the common knowledge of judges,and not the opinions of experts and towns davidson th,d t he nature and risks of downhill skiing are commonly understood with zipusch la workout,th,d common sense dictates that negligent inspection and maintenance of exercise equipment is not inherent risk of exercising at health club and yancey superior court th,d requiring discus participants to check target area before launching throw is common sense precaution that will not alter or destroy the inherent nature of the activity itself.although a large number of volleyball courts in southern schools,playgrounds and the net poles embedded in the ground,many casual games are played with temporary courts set up for the specific occasion,just as vela did for his family and friends the evening of luna accident.
notwithstanding our agreement with the trial court that tripping over the net pole tie lines is an inherent risk of volleyball,as discussed,under knight and its progeny vela had a duty not to increase that particular risk of harm beyond what is inherent in the sport itself.see,kahn,supra,cal th at,d,knight,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the inherent risk in baseball that a pitcher will be hit by a line drive does not preclude a determination that the design and use of a particular type of aluminum bat unreasonably increased the inherent risk of injury to the pitcher see sanchez hillerich bradsby th,d the inherent risk of being hit by a misguided golf shot does not prevent a finding the owner of a golf course unreasonably exposed golfers to that risk by its poor design of the course see morgan fuji country usa,supra,th at,d and the inherent risk of colliding with obstacles while skiing for example,a directional signpost on the ski slope does not mean recovery for all skiing injuries is barred by the doctrine of assumption of the risk notwithstanding evidence that the operator of the ski run increased the risk of harm by placing the signpost wh
