state law prohibits the importation into or sale within california of products made from kangaroo.defendant adidas promotional retail operations,concedes it imports into and sells in california athletic shoes made from kangaroo hide,but argues penal code section is preempted because it conflicts with federal policies intended to influence australian kangaroo management practices.as section poses no obstacle to any current federal policy,we conclude it is not preempted,and we reverse the court of appeal contrary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the material facts are undisputed.defendants adidas promotional retail operations,sport chalet,and offside soccer collectively adidas are california retailers that sell athletic shoes made from kangaroo leather imported from australia.specifically,adidas sells athletic shoes made from the hides of three kangaroo species the red kangaroo macropus rufus,the eastern grey kangaroo macropus giganteus,and the western grey kangaroo macropus fuliginosus.kangaroos are indigenous to australia and new guinea the three species at issue here exist only in australia 
plaintiff viva international voice for animals is an international nonprofit organization devoted to protecting animals.plaintiff jerold friedman is a resident of los angeles county.plaintiffs collectively viva sued adidas for engaging in an unlawful business practice by importing and selling athletic shoes made from kangaroo leather.bus.viva alleged the importation and sale of adidas shoes violated penal code section,which regulates trade in various animal species,including kangaroos.
both sides sought summary judgment the trial court denied viva motion and granted adidas motion.it agreed with adidas that penal code section was preempted by the endangered species act of et because it undermined federal actions taken under the act to influence the australian state and federal governments to preserve threatened kangaroo species.
the court of appeal affirmed.while acknowledging the preemption question was close,it agreed with the trial court that the statute as applied to defendants in this case conflicts with federal law and with substantial federal objectives of persuading australian federal and state governments to impose kangaroo population management programs,in exchange for allowing the importation of kangaroo products.
we granted review to resolve this important preemption question.
discussion 
we begin by noting what we are not called upon to decide.the commonwealth of australia is free to manage its indigenous wildlife populations in any manner it sees fit,subject to international treaty obligations.likewise,california is free to regulate within its own borders unless federal law or the united states constitution requires otherwise.it is not our role to judge the wisdom of australia wildlife management practices,which adidas and amicus curiae the government of the commonwealth of australia defend and viva and amicus curiae the animal legal defense fund criticize,nor the wisdom of california wildlife rules or the federal government statutes and regulations.the only question before us is whether california rules can coexist with federal law.
preemption principles 
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution establishes a constitutional rule,makes federal law paramount,and vests congress with the power to preempt state law,art.vi,cl.cipollone liggett group,d jevne superior court cal th,d.there are four species of federal preemption express,conflict,obstacle,and field.see bronco wine jolly cal th,d.
first,express preemption arises when congress define s explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,citation,and when congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.english general electric,supra,at.accord,jevne superior court,supra,cal th at,d.second,conflict preemption will be found when simultaneous compliance with both state and federal directives is impossible.hillsborough county automated medical labs,d olszewski scripps health cal th,d.third,obstacle preemption arises when under the circumstances of a particular case,the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.crosby national foreign trade council,supra,at,quoting hines davidowitz.accord,bronco wine jolly,supra,cal th at,d.finally,field preemption,congress intent to all state law in a particular area,applies where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for supplementary state regulation.hillsborough county,at,quoting rice santa fe elevator.

we consider in turn the state and federal law at issue.
ii.penal code section and preemption presumptions 
penal code section was enacted in and expanded to include kangaroos in.stats,ch,stats,ch.subdivision a of section provides in relevant part it is unlawful to import into this state for commercial purposes,to possess with intent to sell,or to sell within the state,the dead body,or any part or product thereof,of any polar bear,leopard,ocelot,tiger,cheetah,jaguar,sable antelope,wolf canis lupus,zebra,whale,cobra,python,sea turtle,colobus monkey,kangaroo,vicuna,sea otter,feral horse,dolphin or porpoise delphinidae,spanish lynx,or elephant.italics added.section was passed to prevent the extinction of species the legislature deemed threatened.people sakai d.
in the trial court and court of appeal,adidas argued unsuccessfully that penal code section should be construed as applying only to those species currently federally listed as endangered.each court concluded section plain language dictated a contrary result,as the statute applies to any kangaroo product,without qualification for federal endangered species status.instead,the statute rests on a legislative judgment that the species listed merit special state concern,without regard to their federal status.like the court of appeal,we agree the plain language of the statute extends its scope to all kangaroos and does not depend on the vicissitudes of federal protection.
penal code section addresses an area typically regulated by,and historically within the traditional police powers of,the management notwithstanding adidas contrary argument,the scope of this power has long been recognized as extending even to regulation of foreign species a state may constitutionally conserve wildlife elsewhere by refusing to accept local complicity in its destruction.the states authority to establish local prohibitions with respect to wildlife has,since the late,been recognized by the courts.cresenzi bird importers,state of,see maine taylor,d upholding import restrictions on fish as valid exercise of state police powers nettleton company diamond,supra,at upholding new york regulation of crocodiles.this broad power is justified in part by an increased understanding of the deep interconnectedness of the global ecosystem,because i t is now generally recognized that the destruction or disturbance of vital life cycles or of the balance of a species of wildlife,even though initiated in one part of the world,may have a profound effect upon the health and welfare of people in other distant parts.people sakai,supra,d at.upholding california regulation of whales,quoting palladio,diamond,affd.cir.
there is a presumption against federal preemption in those areas traditionally regulated by the states w e start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.rice santa fe elevator,supra,at.accord,bates dow agrosciences llc,d bronco wine jolly,supra,cal th at,d,in areas of traditional state regulation,a strong presumption against preemption applies and state law will not be displaced unless it is clear and manifest that congress intended to preempt state law olszewski scripps health,supra,cal th at,d,presumption against preemption provides assurance that the balance citation will not be disturbed unintentionally by congress or unnecessarily by the courts.
however,penal code section and the endangered species act of also touch on matters implicating foreign affairs.as previously noted,the entire wild kangaroo population is confined to the commonwealth of australia and papua new guinea,and the three species at issue here exist only in australia.additionally,as we shall discuss,the act itself was passed in part to ensure the united states could meet its international conservation treaty obligations.see a,b.
in crosby national foreign trade council,supra,d,the united states supreme court addressed an exercise of a state traditional powers its spending power in a manner that touched on foreign affairs.it concluded massachusetts policy of not purchasing goods and services from persons doing business with myanmar burma was preempted by a federal act imposing its own sanctions on burma.in doing so,the high court elected to leave for another day a consideration in this context of a presumption against preemption.citation.assuming,arguendo,that some presumption against preemption is appropriate,the court nevertheless concluded the state act presents a sufficient obstacle to the full accomplishment of congress objectives under the federal act to find it preempted.id.at,fn.crosby thus left open the possibility that either no presumption,or a substantially weakened presumption,should apply in such instances.
in american ins.garamendi,d,the united states supreme court returned to foreign affairs preemption,this time in the context of a putative conflict between executive agreements reached with various foreign nations and a california law regulating insurers that had issued insurance policies.the court concluded that under either a field or obstacle preemption analysis the law was preempted.id.at.in the course of its preemption analysis,it neither referenced nor applied any presumptions,instead concluding under neutral analytical principles there was a clear conflict between state law and federal policy.id.at.
taking the most conservative course,we read crosby national foreign trade council,supra,d,and american ins.garamendi,supra,d,as implying that,where a traditional state exercise of the police power implicates foreign affairs concerns,no particular presumption applies instead,we turn to the language of the endangered species act of and allow the statute text to guide us under ordinary principles of interpretation.see goldsmith,statutory foreign affairs preemption,when a foreign relations statute touches on traditional state prerogatives,both canons are implicated,and both lose coherence.the prudent course is for courts to apply ordinary principles of preemption without any presumption in favor of state or federal law,even when they think the statute concerns foreign affairs.
in every preemption analysis,congressional intent is the ultimate touchstone medtronic,lohr,d jevne superior court,supra,cal th at,d,and the statutory text the best indicator of that intent sprietsma mercury marine,d.as a majority of the current united states supreme court has agreed at one time or another,analysis is not a freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension with federal objectives,gade national solid wastes management,supra,at.conc.opn.of kennedy,but an inquiry into whether the ordinary meanings of state and federal law conflict.bates dow agrosciences llc,supra,at.conc.dis.opn.of thomas,joined by scalia,accord,geier american honda motor,d dis.opn.of stevens,joined by souter,thomas,ginsburg,in my view,however,preemption analysis is,or at least should be,a matter of precise statutory or regulatory construction rather than an exercise in judicial policymaking.
iii.the endangered species act of 
responding to rising national and international concern over the impact of humans on other species,congress passed the endangered species act of et act,at the time the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation.tva hill,d.congress found that various species of fish,wildlife,and plants in the united states had been rendered extinct or threatened with extinction.a.it identified as the purposes of the act to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved,to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species,and to effectuate various international conservation treaties and conventions.b.the plain intent of congress in enacting the act was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction,whatever the cost.tva,at.
states were to play an essential role in species preservation.congress declared that encouraging the states through federal financial assistance and a system of incentives,to develop and maintain conservation programs which meet national and international standards is a key to meeting the nation international commitments and to better safeguarding,for the benefit of all citizens,the nation heritage in fish,wildlife,and plants.a.in section of the act and its subparts,congress defined precisely the respective roles of the federal and state governments in carrying out these policies.it directed the secretary of the interior to cooperate to the maximum extent practicable with the states,a.it further authorized management agreements,pursuant to which the state and federal governments would manage conservation areas,b,and cooperative agreements,pursuant to which the federal government would assist states in implementing conservation programs,c.
the act legislative history confirms this vision of a joint cooperative approach to wildlife preservation.the senate believed that a federal wildlife program should not preempt similar state regulation.the committee responsible for the senate bill reported that w hile the federal government should protect such species where states have failed to meet minimum federal standards,it should not preempt efficient programs.instead,it should encourage these,and aid in the extension or establishment of others,to facilitate management by granting regulatory authority and making available financial assistance to approved schemes.cresenzi bird importers,state of,supra.at,quoting,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news,see also,supra,note,federal preemption of state commerce bans under the endangered species act stan,analyzing language and legislative history of the act and concluding it expressly anticipates and authorizes concurrent state regulation as a key element of the overall regulatory scheme.
with that background in mind,we turn to the act key provision for our purposes,section f of the act,codified at section f hereafter section f which expressly spells out the intended preemptive scope of the act any state law or regulation which applies with respect to the importation or exportation of,or interstate or foreign commerce in,endangered species or threatened species is void to the extent that it may effectively permit what is prohibited by this chapter or by any regulation which implements this chapter,or prohibit what is authorized pursuant to an exemption or permit provided for in this chapter or in any regulation which implements this chapter.f,italics added.the second half of section f is a savings clause this chapter shall not otherwise be construed to void any state law or regulation which is intended to conserve migratory,resident,or introduced fish or wildlife,or to permit or prohibit sale of such fish or wildlife.any state law or regulation respecting the taking of an endangered species or threatened species may be more restrictive than the exemptions or permits provided for in this chapter or in any regulation which implements this chapter but not less restrictive than the prohibitions so defined.
various aspects of the express preemption clause and savings clause are significant.first,these provisions continue the cooperative framework established elsewhere in the act,under which federal and state regulation should be allowed to coexist to the extent practicable.where congress establishes a regime of dual regulation,analysis must be applied sensitively so as to prevent the diminution of the role congress reserved to the states while at the same time preserving the federal role.northwest cent.pipeline.comm,d see also new york of social services dublino,d where coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework,and in the pursuit of common purposes,the case for federal becomes a less persuasive one.
second,section f demonstrates a congressional intent to preempt only narrowly.man hing ivory and imports,deukmejian cir,f allows full implementation of penal code section so long as the state statute does not prohibit what the federal statute or its implementing regulations permit cresenzi bird importers,state of,supra.at f evince s a clear congressional intent to preempt state wildlife conservation laws only to a very limited extent.while federal law establishes a regulatory floor for listed,endangered or threatened species,a ny state law or regulation respecting the taking of an endangered species or threatened species may be more restrictive than the exemptions or permits provided for in this chapter or in any regulation which implements this chapter.f,italics added see also man hing ivory and imports,at,fn.the act was rewritten to make it clear that the states would and should be free to adopt legislation or regulations that might be more restrictive than that of the federal government and to enforce the legislation,quoting,supra,cresenzi bird importers,at s tate law is not,but is merely subject to the federal floor of regulations under the act,quoting,supra.
third,with respect to unlisted species,section f leaves undisturbed the states broad traditional regulatory authority.the text of the section savings clause preserves state power to enact more stringent regulations even with respect to threatened and endangered species,those species for which federal concern is greatest.neither section f preemption clause nor its savings clause mentions any impact on state power over unlisted species by inference,that power is at least as great or greater than over federally regulated endangered or threatened species.
the legislative history confirms as much.discussing the effect of section f,the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries explained existing state endangered species programs would,for example,be in a position to include species which were not on the federal list l aws already passed in states such as new york,california and hawaii,which list additional species or prohibit such activities as sales within their jurisdiction,would be unaffected,supra,italics added id.at with one exception,the state powers to regulate in a more restrictive fashion or to include additional species remain unimpaired italics added.
the federal courts that have interpreted the act agree.thus,in justin sons,deukmejian cir,a boot manufacturer sought preemption of penal code section with respect to two unlisted species,including the wallaby kangaroo,and one listed species.the ninth circuit found no preemption of section as it applied to unlisted species because the species were neither endangered nor threatened,section f of the act has no application to state regulations restricting or prohibiting trade in those species.justin sons,at see also man hing ivory and imports,deukmejian,supra,at,fn.t he legislative history of the act unequivocally shows that congress meant for federal law to preempt state law pursuant to the first sentence of section f only where the species was listed as endangered on the federal list id.at,fn.the state is free to prohibit entirely trade in unlisted species cresenzi bird importers,state of,supra.at.
the only exception to this preservation of state power is for activities specifically authorized by a federal exemption or permit.f state may not prohibit what is authorized pursuant to an exemption or permit,supra,the only exception to unfettered state power over unlisted species is contained in the language which expressly prohibits the state from voiding actions specifically permitted by federal agencies man hing ivory and imports,deukmejian,supra,at see authorizing issuance of federal permits and exemptions.
section f does not expressly preempt penal code section the act does not occupy the field of kangaroo import and sales regulation see jevne superior court,supra,cal th at,d,inclusion of savings clause in a statute negates field preemption and there is no conflict preemption,as simultaneous compliance with both federal law,which as a floor matter allows kangaroo trade,and state law,which imposes a higher standard and prohibits it,is not a physical impossibility hillsborough county automated medical,supra,at,quoting florida avocado growers paul,d.thus,we consider the interplay of section f and the act implementing regulations with penal code section solely in the context of an assertion of obstacle preemption.
iv.obstacle preemption 
a.the role of an express preemption provision in implied preemption analysis 
we begin with a point overlooked by the court of appeal the central role of the act express preemption provision even in implied preemption analysis.
a majority of the united states supreme court once suggested that where congress had enacted an express preemption provision,that provision was the exclusive and final statement of congressional preemptive intent and thus obviated any consideration of implied preemption doctrines.cipollone liggett group,supra,at.id.at.conc.dis.opn.of blackmun,see also medtronic,lohr,supra,at.t he language of the statute means that we need not go beyond that language to determine whether congress intended the statute to at least some state law.
a slightly more tempered view of the force of express preemption provisions has since prevailed.in freightliner myrick,d,the court clarified the relation between express preemption clauses and implied preemption doctrines,explaining that an express definition of the reach of a statute implies,supports a reasonable congress did not intend to other matters,but the express clause does not entirely foreclose any possibility of implied.id.at.see also id.at.cipollone supports an inference that an express clause forecloses implied it does not establish a rule.this inference is a simple corollary of ordinary statutory interpretation principles and in particular a variant of the familiar principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius congress enactment of a provision defining the reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not.cipollone liggett group,supra,at.the freightliner view is now well established.see sprietsma mercury marine,supra,at.lorillard tobacco reilly,d in these cases our task is to identify the domain expressly,citation,because an express definition of the reach of a statute supports a reasonable inference that congress did not intend to other matters bronco wine jolly,supra,cal th at,d,relying on and applying the inference.
the freightliner inference applies here.congress has expressly identified the scope of the state law it intends to preempt hence,we infer congress intended to preempt no more than that absent sound contrary evidence.neither freightliner nor any subsequent case has spelled out precisely what force to accord this inference,and we need not do so here.as we shall discuss,adidas evidence is insufficient to contradict the inference under any standard 
preemption by nonregulation 
here,adidas asserts preemption by nonregulation.in the absence of any positive statutory provision or regulation governing kangaroos,adidas relies on the history of the federal government involvement with australian kangaroo management practices.
the united states supreme court has recognized that even the absence of federal regulation may give rise to implied preemption.sprietsma mercury marine,supra,at.freightliner myrick,supra,at.arkansas coop.public serv.comm,d.however,preemption in such circumstances is confined to situations where failure of federal officials affirmatively to exercise their full authority takes on the character of a ruling that no such regulation is appropriate or approved pursuant to the policy of the statute.ray atlantic richfield,d,quoting bethlehem steel state board.in essence,congress or federal authorities may preempt without regulating,but only by affirmatively deciding no state regulation is permitted.
congress certainly has not done so.instead,adidas argues,and the court of appeal agreed,that the united states fish and wildlife service fish and wildlife historical treatment of red,eastern grey,and western grey kangaroos demonstrates an affirmative intent to create,with respect to these three species,a zone free from state regulation.according to adidas,that history shows fish and wildlife has adopted a carrot and stick approach,offering the threat of a ban on imports as a stick and access to united states markets as a carrot to induce australian state and federal governments to conserve kangaroos.thus,adidas reasons,penal code section ban stands as an obstacle to federal policy by diminishing the size of the carrot fish and wildlife can offer.
we examine the regulatory history mindful of the fact this is an area where congress expressly contemplated a cooperative system of state and federal regulation,and where preemption analysis must remain sensitive to preserving the respective state and federal roles.northwest cent.pipeline.comm n,supra,at.as well,we are especially reluctant to infer obstacle preemption based on agency actions as opposed to statute.bronco wine jolly,supra,cal th at,d.thus,adidas must show in the history it relies on an authoritative message of a federal policy against state regulation sprietsma mercury marine,supra,at.and clear evidence of a conflict between state and federal goals geier american honda motor,supra,at.
federal kangaroos 
the parties do not dispute the outline of fish and wildlife treatment of kangaroos as recited by the court of appeal and reflected in the federal register.we draw from these sources in describing that history.
in the century,a commercial market developed in australia for kangaroo hides and meat.by the early,the kangaroo population had dropped to the point that the australian state and federal governments instituted protective measures such as a ban on exports and quotas on the killing of kangaroos for commercial use.june.
in april,fish and wildlife proposed listing the red,eastern grey,and western grey kangaroo as endangered species under the act.june.in december,after receiving public input and further considering the act criteria,fish and wildlife instead listed these three species as threatened.june.such a listing carries with it a prohibition on importation of the species,subject to exemptions or permits issued under the act,b,a.fish and wildlife thereafter formally banned commercial importation of the three species,as well as their body parts and products made from the bodies of the species.june.the ban was to remain in place until those australian states commercially harvesting the three species could assure the united states that they had effective management plans for the kangaroos,and that taking would not be detrimental to the survival of kangaroos,see d authorizing special species regulations b,a import restrictions apply absent special regulation.
in,consistent with a provision of the act requiring periodic reappraisal c,fish and wildlife revisited the listing of these kangaroo species.june.it found all three remained threatened because of the susceptibility of these animals to overexploitation and because of the difficulty in predicting the severity and damage that might be caused by natural or factors affecting them,but concluded the four states commercially harvesting,new south wales,south australia,and western adopted effective management plans and commercial killing within the limits the plans established would not be detrimental to the survival of the species.ibid.on that basis,in april fish and wildlife issued a special final rule,subject to reevaluation after two years,lifting the ban on commercial importation into the united states of products made from the red,eastern grey,and western grey kangaroo.former a i b repealed.
in,fish and wildlife reviewed the situation and elected to continue allowing commercial importation.it also proposed delisting the three kangaroo species.subsequently,however,new data from the australian government showed the severe drought of the summer of had significantly depleted kangaroo populations.as a result,fish and wildlife withdrew its proposal to delist the species.
in december,greenpeace usa,with support from other groups,petitioned fish and wildlife to reinstate the ban on importing the three kangaroo species and their body parts and products.the petitioners argued that australia kangaroo management was inherently flawed and that australian states did not have adequate and effective conservation programs that ensured the protection of the threatened species.in response,fish and wildlife sent representatives to australia to evaluate both population levels and the australian states implementation of their management programs and to prepare a report the nichols report.
fish and wildlife thereafter published a notice announcing receipt of greenpeace usa petition and the availability of the nichols report and seeking public comment.the wildlife legislative fund of america fund petitioned fish and wildlife to remove the three kangaroo species from the act list of threatened species.relying on the nichols report,the fund stressed two grounds to delist the species by conservative estimates the population of the three species totaled almost million and kangaroo conservation programs exist within individual range states.
after soliciting further comment,fish and wildlife published a proposed rule delisting the three kangaroo species.fish and wildlife found the four australian states had developed and implemented adequate and effective conservation programs that ensured the protection of these species,kangaroo populations were high,the three species were protected by appropriate legislation,they had their populations regularly monitored by direct and indirect procedures,and they were managed by a complex licensing system which regulated the extent of the legal harvest.
in march,fish and wildlife removed the three kangaroo species from the act list of endangered or threatened species.it delist ed these three species of kangaroos on the basis of their successful recovery because the best scientific and commercial information available indicates the species are now not likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant part of their range,see d authorizing delisting where a species has recovered.it characterized the red,eastern grey,and western grey populations as abundant.it simultaneously rescinded the special rule allowing kangaroo importation former a i b,repealed,and dismissed greenpeace usa petition on procedural grounds as fish and wildlife explained,it had no mechanism to reimpose an import ban on these,species.as required by the act,fish and wildlife also indicated it would monitor species populations for at least five years.id.at see g.
today,the australian government permits the commercial use of kangaroos and the exportation of kangaroo leather and meat,subject to quotas and other government regulation.according to amicus curiae the government of the commonwealth of australia,the population of red,eastern grey,and western grey kangaroos was just under million.the australian government still considers some species threatened or endangered,but not the species at issue here 
the parties agree that since the three species have been delisted under the act,their importation into the united states is not prohibited by federal law.see a a b,a import ban applies to listed species.
this history does not establish any authoritative policy against state regulation.fish and wildlife listed the red,eastern grey,and western grey kangaroo i
