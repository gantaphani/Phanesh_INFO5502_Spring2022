hudson defended all authentic in the nfl action,incurring defense costs in excess of.the nfl action ultimately settled.in november,hudson initiated this action against colony for equitable contribution for of its defense fees and costs incurred in the defense of all authentic hudson complaint argues that colony should have defended all authentic in the nfl action because b ased on the allegations in the nfl action,all authentic faced potentially covered liability for trade dress infringement and slogan infringement in all authentic advertisements.the district court granted hudson motion for partial summary judgment,concluding that by alleging that the insured infringed steel curtain,the nfl complaint set forth a claim for slogan infringement that was potentially covered by the colony policy.colony appeals this ruling.

an action for equitable contribution allows an insurer to sue for pro rata reimbursement from another insurance company when it has defended a mutually insured party without participation by the other insurance company.see monticello ins.essex ins,d.hudson argues that colony was obligated under its insurance policy with all authentic to defend all authentic in the nfl action.colony disagrees,arguing that an essential element for the duty to defend was not met namely that hudson has not shown that nfl property allegations created a potential for liability under one of the covered offenses.see hameid fire ins.of hartford,cal.
if a potential cause of action is shown for one covered claim,colony had a duty to defend all authentic as to all claims in the nfl action,regardless of whether the other claims were covered under the policy.see cna cas.of cal.seaboard sur.colony concedes that its policy covered slogan infringement therefore,if slogan infringement was potentially alleged in the nfl complaint,hudson will be entitled to equitable contribution for its whole defense 
colony faces an uphill battle from the beginning because the duty to defend in california is extensive.a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity t he carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.montrose chem.of cal.superior court,p d,cal citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.any ambiguity in the insurance policy,including in the exclusions,must be resolved in favor of finding coverage.see id.at cna.at.where there is doubt as to whether the duty to defend exists,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the insured and against the insurer.see cna.at.because the duty to defend is so broad,we hold that colony three arguments against its duty to defend are without merit.
colony first argues that the district court should be reversed because n o such claim of slogan infringement was made in the complaint and california law precludes a court or insured from speculating about unpled claims to manufacture a potential for coverage.this argument fails because under california law the insurer duty is not measured by the technical legal cause of action pleaded in the underlying third party complaint,but rather by the potential for liability under the policy coverage as revealed by the facts alleged in the complaint or otherwise known to the insurer.cna.at.
colony argues that the gunderson line of narrow speculation cases supports its argument that the nfl complaint did not potentially state a cause of action for slogan infringement.these cases do not support colony argument.these cases concluded that there was no potential for coverage,not because the complaint did not list a particular legal cause of action,but because the complaint did not allege any facts supporting a covered cause of action 
the lead speculation case,gunderson fire insurance exchange,d,is illustrative.in gunderson,the insureds sued their insurance company,arguing that the company wrongly failed to defend them in a dispute over an easement.id.at.the insureds argued that the action was covered under their policy because the plaintiff could have sued them for the property damage they caused to the plaintiff fenc
