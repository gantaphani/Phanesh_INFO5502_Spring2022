this case is a companion to our decision today in commercial union insurance swiss reinsurance america,wl cir.both involve reinsurance and the same reinsurance america corporation swiss re and related cedents the cedent being the insurance company that is reinsured.the cedent in is commercial union in this case it is american employers insurance company american,which is now affiliated with commercial union.one of the two questions presented in this case overlaps with that in commercial union the other differs.
we begin with the facts and litigation history.american provided excess insurance coverage to pennsalt chemical company pursuant to three umbrella insurance policies together covering the period january,through january,the policies covered liability for bodily injury and property damage that might be incurred by pennsalt,over and above coverage provided by a primary insurer who plays no role in the present litigation.
american own liability to pennsalt was subject to limits set forth in the american policies million for each occurrence under the first two american policies and million per occurrence under the third.all three policies stated that the limit is the total limit of the company liability under this policy for ultimate net loss as a result of any one occurrence.all three policies,with minor variations,defined occurrence to mean 
a an accident,or b an event,or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which unexpectedly results in personal injury,property damage,or advertising liability during the policy period a ll personal injury and property damage arising out of one event or continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises location shall be deemed to be one occurrence.
for the period to,a second insurance company provided additional excess coverage to pennsalt,under the policies,triggered only when the policy limits of the policies were exceeded.the coverage was less generous to the insured because it paid only a percentage of the insured excess liability.by the time the present controversy arose,pennsalt rights as the insured belonged to a successor atochem north america elf and american was responsible for payments under the policies.
when it issued the policies,american had reinsured with swiss re by securing three reinsurance certificates corresponding to each of american umbrella policies covering pennsalt.each certificate was skeletal in form,see ostrager vyskocil,modern reinsurance law practice,comprising one page and a few attached endorsements.the front page described the contract generally swiss re d oes hereby reinsure american with respect to american policy hereinafter described,in consideration of the payment of the premium,and subject to the terms,conditions and amount of liability set forth herein.
the certificate then identified the relevant american policy being reinsured,stating its limits,each occurrence and in the aggregate,in excess of underlying limits,and then stating the reinsurance accepted,the portion of american payout that swiss re would indemnify.in the first two certificates this field read for the third certificate,it read each occurrence which is quota share part of which in turn is excess of underlying limits.
each certificate contained on the back side several standard conditions.these included a clause 
the liability of swiss re specified in item of this certificate shall follow that of american,and except as otherwise specifically provided herein,shall be subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of american policy.
such clauses are designed to make the terms of coverage under an excess policy or reinsurance policy here swiss re certificate to certain the coverage provided by an underlying policy here,american excess policies.aetna cas.sur.home ins,where a following form clause is found a policy of reinsurance will be construed as offering the same terms,conditions and scope of coverage as exist in the reinsured policy ostrager vyskocil,supra,a,at see also associated int l ins.blythe,cir.
the certificates also contained provisions,often described as provisions.they preclude the reinsurer from challenging a cedent decision to settle so long as the settlement is reasonably within the terms of the cedent policy,even if not technically covered by it and so long as the cedent has acted in good faith.see ostrager vyskocil,supra,travelers cas.sur.certain underwriters at lloyd of london.the clauses here read 
all claims involving this reinsurance,when settled by american,shall be binding on swiss re,which shall be bound to pay its proportion of such settlements promptly following receipt of proof of loss.
in the early,elf began to notify american of potential hazardous waste losses involving property damage and bodily injury caused by pollution at various sites.on august,american filed a declaratory judgment action in new jersey superior court against elf in response to elf demand for indemnification of property and injury claims arising out of pollution at a bryan,texas,site.the case soon expanded to involve additional insurers,parties,issues,and property and injury claims at sites.
discovery over the next four years focused on the bryan,texas,site.in april,elf presented american with a american did not settle many of its claims against american at sites for million.an underlying premise of elf calculations not explicitly stated but clear from the figures in the document was that the limit in the american policies applied once per policy period to continuous or repeated exposures like the pollution damage at issue here.
most courts read such language in such a manner,see commercial union,at.new jersey law arguably has adopted an annualization approach that for these kinds of continuing or recurring losses applies limits to each year of a policy.see,benjamin moore aetna cas.sur.such an approach would ordinarily enlarge the insured coverage and increase the insurer liability.id.at.
in june,american coverage outside law a status report to american reinsurers.it said inter alia that american would argue against annualization of the limits but noted certain factors that might support an annualization reading of the reading which elf had not urged in settlement but which elf was free to argue in the event the matter had to be litigated.in substance,coverage counsel assumed annualization as a possibility because,as an american representative said later,the aim was to tell the reinsurers what the exposure could potentially be.
one of the issues throughout the litigation and settlement negotiations was which jurisdiction law would be taken to apply to the construction of the policies as to individual waste sites and to allocation issues where more than one policy would cover the losses at a site for example,when several successive policies of one or more insurers covered various years.in a conference in march,the judge presiding in the new jersey case indicated that the law of the situs state would govern the case as to that site,although he later obliquely suggested that allocation would occur pursuant to owen,a reference to a leading new jersey allocation case.see,united ins.
for most of,mediation progressed under the auspices of the new jersey court.efforts initially focused on what the parties deemed to be the most important of the relevant sites.elf furnished information as to remediation costs at these sites,and american hired an expert environmental consulting firm to make its own assessment of the total damages.the environmental consultant work ultimately produced much lower estimates of remediation costs than elf did.
in june,elf presented another settlement demand seeking million from american for the sites its spreadsheet calculations assumed high remediation costs but no annualization of the limits.on this premise,some of the policy limits were exceeded,but this fact did not terminate american liability there instead,some of the alleged liability flowed over to the policies.
in october,american coverage counsel offered american its own analysis supporting an estimated exposure of million.a detailed analysis of the top sites employed the much lower estimates derived from the environmental consultant work,assumed annualization of the limits based on the same factors described in the june status report,and applied an additional blanket discount of percent to allow for the possible success of american policy defenses,the insured failure to provide prompt notice and its awareness of the harmful nature of the chemicals present at the sites.the total estimated exposure for the top sites was million.
the settlement analysis included a brief description of the remaining sites secondary sites identified by elf to which elf had ascribed liability for american of only million.the analysis said as we have no information on these sites and are thus unable to assess their alleged damages,as well as the possible impact on american coverage,we have calculated an reduction of the liability from elf figures.accordingly,the analysis assigned an expected additional liability of million to the secondary sites.
at a mediation session in november,elf again demanded million.elf this time explicitly stated that its approach assumed one limit for each policy.american countered with an offer of million.during the session the parties offers converged somewhat to million and million but the parties differed on the scope of the release.during a break,the american team met privately it was noted that given american liability to elf under the policies for excess coverage where the policies left off,there was little difference between elf approach and american annualized approach as far as the final liability number was concerned.
in another session in december,the parties demands and offers further converged to million and million,respectively,and in january,the parties agreed in principle on a settlement of million to be paid in two installments.a final agreement was signed in april.the agreement,which contained no mention of annualization,stated that the agreement was not an admission with respect to insurance policy interpretation or application or an admission by any party regarding the duties,rights or obligations arising out of the policies.
thereafter,american billed swiss re million for what american claimed was swiss re share of the settlement under the three reinsurance certificates.american allocation of the settlement among american in turn implicated reinsurer somewhat complicated,but it basically followed the methodology laid out in the october settlement analysis.in any event,both sides agree that american allocation of liability to swiss re was premised on the use of annualized limits and that swiss re liability would be less if the limits were applied,site by site,on a basis.
swiss re resisted american billing on the ground that a approach should be used and also on the ground that american allocated part of the settlement payment to the secondary sites swiss re position on the latter issue was that american had no information as to the secondary sites and therefore assigning any value to them was unreasonable or not made in good faith,thus,swiss re said it did not have to indemnify american for any share of the claimed liability as to these sites.
eventually,american brought suit against swiss re in the federal district court in massachusetts to recover the full amount it had allocated to swiss re.swiss re then made a partial payment but insisted that its liability was limited for the two reasons set forth above.on its calculation,its liability was reduced by million attributable to annualization and million attributable to the secondary sites.
discovery was followed by for summary judgment.on august,the district court entered a decision holding for swiss re on both disputed issues.see american employers ins.swiss reinsurance am,d.following the earlier district court decision in commercial union by a different district judge,the district court in the present case said that the certificates language precluded annualization.as for swiss re liability for the secondary sites,the court found that american settlement made without investigation of those sites was not in good faith.american has now appealed to this court.
review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo.commercial union ins.walbrook ins,cir.the district court found and the parties do not dispute that the reinsurance certificates are governed by the substantive law of either new york or massachusetts in both states,contract least absent extrinsic a question of law for the court what law governs the underlying american policies held by pennsalt is different states laws apply for losses at different sites.
we start,as in the commercial union case,with the cedent liability to its own insured under the cedent policies,for the reinsurer is only liable for losses legitimately incurred by the insured.taken alone,the term occurrence is arguably ambiguous as to whether limits should be annualized but in the policies quoted above,further swiss that repeated exposures at a site constitute one occurrence and that exposures comprising the same general conditions conceivably,even different pollutants from the same manufacturing operation are also one occurrence.
to thus define occurrence does not automatically defeat an annualization approach that approach might still be defended as reflecting actual intention or extrinsic policy.but the broader the definition of occurrence,the easier it is to think of disparate leaks or spills over the policy period as comprising a single event and in fact the policy refers to injuries occurring during the policy period.anyway,american does not point to evidence of intent or develop policy arguments to offset language.instead it relies upon the settlement with elf.
american says that it settled elf claims against it by a settlement based on annualization that this was a good faith,reasonable settlement and that swiss re is bound by its own clauses to accept the settlement as the basis for american liability to therefore swiss re to american,subject only to possible defenses contained in the swiss re certificates.
swiss re first response is to deny the premise that the american settlement with elf is based on annualization.unlike commercial union,where the insured initial demand was based on annualization,slip op.at,here elf did not rely on annualization when it proffered its demands.nevertheless,elf would have been free to assert annualization if the case had been litigated and american,in framing its own counteroffer,could take this into consideration.
more important,the settlement american actually paid was based on a calculation of its own liability that did assume annualization.american coverage counsel analysis,positing an expected liability figure of million,reduced other figures,elf claimed remediation costs but stated elf would prevail as to annualization.american ultimate payment of million was very close to this expected figure,and american approved this level of payment partly because of the earlier projection 
if the case had been litigated,elf would not have had the benefit of the primary policy language available to the insured in commercial union but american did face a easy to assess on the present in litigation the new jersey courts might choose to apply new jersey law,which is arguably.whether the risk was sufficiently small to make the settlement unreasonable is a different issue which swiss re is free to litigate on remand.
it is perhaps of more concern that american own liability may not have been much affected by whether annualization were employed or not because of its own liability based on the policies.but there is no law that says that insurer and reinsurer interests have to be perfectly aligned to trigger a clause,and it remains open to swiss re to challenge american good faith on remand if it has evidence to support such a claim.
although the issue may be close,american characterization of the settlement is supportable.there is no case law directly in point and arguments both ways can be made,but american did calculate its ultimate obligation using annualization and the settlement roughly matched this is not a characterization or a unilatera
