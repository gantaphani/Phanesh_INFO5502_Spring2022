khalid ibrahimi,a tunisian native and citizen,petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia to deny him a waiver of the spousal requirement for the removal of the conditions on his status.he claims that the bia improperly allocated the burden of proof and erroneously determined that he did not merit removal of the conditions regardless of the burden.he further argues that the immigration judge ij acted as a biased arbitrator and erred in admitting certain evidence in violation of his rights.the government argues that because the ultimate decision to grant the petition to waive the requirement is discretionary,we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal.the government further contends that because there is no liberty interest in discretionary relief from removal,we have no jurisdiction to consider ibrahimi claim.we deny the petition for review.

khalid ibrahimi entered the united states as a visitor for pleasure in may.ibrahimi married a citizen,nicole kohring,on january.four months later,he applied for adjustment of status to that of a legal permanent resident based on his marriage.uscis granted ibrahimi conditional permanent residence as kohring spouse in may.in april,however,kohring and ibrahimi divorced,and within the month,uscis notified ibrahimi of its intent to terminate his conditional status because of the divorce.ibrahimi filed a petition seeking to waive the requirement and have the conditions removed.uscis denied the petition and terminated his conditional status in august.the agency then initiated removal proceedings against him.during those proceedings,the ij found ibrahimi removable under a d i because uscis had terminated his conditional status after the divorce.
following the ij removability determination,ibrahimi renewed his petition for a waiver under c.the ij continued the hearing to allow the parties to gather evidence.during that proceeding,the ij heard lengthy testimony on the nature of ibrahimi relationship with kohring in order to determine whether he had entered into his marriage with her in good faith.ibrahimi kohring ibrahimi former girlfriend,stacey urgento two of ibrahimi and a uscis agent were witnesses during the proceeding adjudicating ibrahimi waiver petition.during these proceedings,the ij explicitly found urgento testimony credible but called into question kohring credibility by referring to portions of her testimony as outlandish.the ij,however,never made an explicit credibility finding as to ibrahimi testimony.in the absence of an explicit adverse credibility finding,we are obligated to accept as true a witness testimony.mohamed gonzales,cir an implicit credibility finding made in passing does not suffice.accord nguyen mukasey,cir per curiam.thus,to the extent that ibrahimi testimony does not conflict with urgento statements,the evidence in the administrative record indicates the following.
upon his arrival in the united states in,ibrahimi began dating urgento,a citizen.they were in a relationship for more than a year,eventually cohabitating in washington.while the two discussed marriage at various points during their relationship,often at ibrahimi urging,urgento ended their relationship in december following a holiday visit with her family.urgento admitted that her family did not approve of her relationship with ibrahimi and noted that fact as part of the reason they separated.during her testimony about her relationship with ibrahimi,she said that,at various points during their courtship,he had threatened to leave her and marry another women if she refused to marry him.
three days after ibrahimi and urgento,on december,ibrahimi met kohring at a bar.they had consensual sexual relations that evening.within two days,kohring and ibrahimi decided to move in with one another,and they began discussing marriage immediately.less than one month later,on january,they were married in a civil ceremony at a courthouse.ibrahimi testified that he married kohring out of love and that they had fallen in crazy love instantly.ibrahimi denied marrying kohring for immigration benefits,citing the fact that at the time of his marriage to kohring,his employer had submitted a labor certification for him that would have made him eligible for adjustment of status on those grounds.ibrahimi testified that he believed that he would be allowed to stay in the country based on his employment.
immediately after the wedding,kohring and ibrahimi lived together with other roommates.once kohring lease ended,in april,ibrahimi and kohring cosigned a lease and moved into their own apartment.kohring became pregnant with their child and moved from washington,to louis to be closer to her family in november.ibrahimi followed two weeks later.in louis,they again lived together as husband and wife,establishing a joint bank account into which they deposited both of their paychecks.kohring listed ibrahimi as her dependent.
on may,uscis adjusted ibrahimi status to that of a conditional resident.ibrahimi and kohring relationship was rocky,however,and they separated in july,a few months after their son was born and two months following ibrahimi adjustment of status.kohring moved out of their marital residence,and their divorce became final on april.in all,kohring and ibrahimi were married approximately two years and two months,and they were separated for almost eleven months during that period.
the ij relied extensively on urgento testimony and found it incredulous that the circumstances surrounding ibrahimi marriage to kohring could support a determination that he had entered into his marriage in good faith.in addition to details about her relationship with ibrahimi,urgento had testified that ibrahimi had called her a week before his wedding to kohring and had attempted to reconcile their relationship,seeking to marry urgento instead.despite the fact that ibrahimi was involved in a relationship with urgento immediately prior to meeting kohring,kohring was unaware of that relationship until after ibrahimi and kohring had separated.ibrahimi claimed that he had kept the relationship a secret so that kohring would not become jealous and leave him.urgento had known about ibrahimi marriage to kohring,however.in fact,urgento had heard about it from ibrahimi family in february when they erroneously called to congratulate her on her marriage to ibrahimi.after this phone call,urgento sent a facsimile to uscis informing the agency that ibrahimi was in the country illegally.
the bia did not explicitly adopt the ij decision but affirmed its finding that the marriage was not a marriage and its denial of a waiver of the requirement.as support for its conclusion,the bia cited to the timing of ibrahimi with urgento and his marriage to kohring,the fact that ibrahimi had threatened to leave urgento if she did not marry him,and the phone call that ibrahimi made to urgento just prior to the wedding seeking reconciliation.the bia noted that the evidence of t
