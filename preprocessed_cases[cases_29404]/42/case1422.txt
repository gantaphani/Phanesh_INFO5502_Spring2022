petitioner,lorraine fiadjoe,petitions for review of orders of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture and denying her motion for reconsideration.with the exception of an eleven year interval,from,when fiadjoe was seven years of age,until her flight from her native ghana to the united states in march,fiadjoe was held as a slave of her father,a priest of the trokosi sect,who,in accordance with the tenets of the sect,forced his daughter to work for him and abused her physically and sexually.fiadjoe sought asylum and other relief on the ground that if she were returned to ghana she,as one of the women subject to the practices of the trokosi sect,would likely once again become subject to her father bondage and abuse,a consequence that ghanian government authorities were unable or unwilling to prevent.
both the immigration judge ij and the bia found that fiadjoe testimony was not credible,and the bia found that fiadjoe failed to establish that the government of ghana was either unwilling or unable to control her father sexual abuse.we conclude that these findings are not supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.we will grant the petition and remand the case for a new hearing and development of the record before a different ij.
procedural background 
on march,using a passport bearing the name of another person,petitioner,lorraine fiadjoe,entered the united states.she is a member of the ewe tribe and a native and citizen of ghana.she was detained as an arriving alien and interviewed.upon her refusal to be sent back to ghana,the immigration authorities transferred her to the york county pennsylvania prison.
on march asylum officer james reaves conducted an asylum interview of fiadjoe,after which he found that she had established a significant possibility of a claim for asylum based on her membership in a particular social group unmarried women over in ghana.he also found that fiadjoe had established a credible fear of persecution or torture.
on the same day the immigration and naturalization service ins charged fiadjoe with removability under a c i and a a i i of the ina,a c i,a a i i and issued a notice to appear.at a june,hearing before an ij fiadjoe conceded that she was removable under a a i i of the ina for being an intending immigrant not in possession of a valid visa or other entry document.
fiadjoe filed applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture,article of the convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,res,annex gaor supp,at,doc.cat.the ij,donald vincent ferlise,held an evidentiary hearing on april,after which he denied fiadjoe application for relief and ordered her removed to ghana.
fiadjoe filed a timely appeal with the bia.on june,the bia dismissed the appeal.fiadjoe filed a timely petition for review of the bia decision in this court and subsequently filed a motion with the bia seeking reconsideration of the bia june order.on february,the bia denied the motion to reconsider.fiadjoe filed a petition for review of the bia february decision.that petition has been consolidated with the first petition.
ii.petitioner evidence 
fiadjoe claims for relief stem from her assertion that from age seven until she fled from ghana,with an eleven year interval from until,her father held her as a slave,subject to physical beatings and frequent rape,pursuant to the tenets of the trokosi religion,of which her father was a priest.
the nature and existence of the trokosi practices are described in a number of documents that are in the record.the united states department of state country report on human rights practices in ghana released in february the state department report or the report is one example.in a summary statement the report states,violence against women is a serious problem.traditional practices,including a localized form of ritual servitude trokosi practiced in some rural areas,still result in considerable abuse and discrimination against women and children.the report further noted that v iolence against women,including rape and domestic violence,remains a significant problem.a study revealed that particularly in,sections of greater accra,at least percent of women have been assaulted in recent years,and that w omen,especially in rural areas,remain subject to burdensome labor conditions and traditional male dominance.
the state department report described in some detail trokosi practices 
although the constitution prohibits slavery,it exists on a limited scale.trokosi,a traditional practice found among the ewe ethnic group and in part of the volta region,is an especially severe human rights abuse and an extremely serious violation of children and women rights.it is a system in which a young girl,sometimes under the age of,is made a slave to a fetish shrine for offenses allegedly committed by a member of the girl family.in rare instances,boys are offered.the belief is that,if someone in that family has committed a crime,such as stealing,members of the family may begin to die in large numbers unless a young girl is given to the local fetish shrine to atone for the offense.the girl becomes the property of the fetish priest,must work on the priest farm,and perform other labors for him.because they are the sexual property of the priests,most trokosi slaves have children by the priests.although the girls families must provide for their needs such as food,most are unable to do so.there are at least girls and women bound to various shrines in the trokosi system,a figure that does not include the slaves children.even when freed by her fetish priest from the more onerous aspects of her bondage,whether voluntarily or as a result of intervention by activists,a trokosi women generally has few marketable skills and little hope of marriage and typically remains bound to the shrine for life by psychological and social pressure arising from a traditional belief that misfortune may befall a trokosi woman family or village if she abandons her obligations to the shrine.when a fetish slave dies,her family is expected to replace her with another young girl,thus perpetuating the bondage to the fetish shrine from generation to generation.
in ghana parliament passed legislation that,among other provisions designed to protect women,banned the practice of customary servitude known as trokosi.after passage of this legislation,the report states,t he chraj and international needs have had some success in approaching village authorities and fetish priests at over of the major and minor shrines,winning the release of trokosi slaves to date and retraining them for new professions.however,as of the time of the report,t here are at least girls and women bound to various shrines in the trokosi system,a figure that does not include the slaves children.
despite the legislation,as of the year,t he government has not prosecuted any practitioners of trokosi,and in august,a presidential aide criticized activists for being insensitive to indigenous cultural and religious practices.the statement department report recites at great length the terrible abuses committed by ghana police,noting that i n recent years,the police service in particular has come under severe criticism following incidents of police brutality,corruption,and negligence.with respect to the police and their reaction to violence against women,the report recites v iolence against women,including rape and domestic violence,remains a significant problem a total of percent of the victims of domestic violence are women,according to data gathered by the fida.these abuses generally go unreported and seldom come before the courts.the police tend not to intervene in domestic disputes.
it is against this background that fiadjoe account of her own experiences unfolds.these events are described in her affidavit in support of her asylum application form and in her april,hearing testimony.they are described in the report of the psychologist who treated her for the trauma these events caused.
fiadjoe was born a member of the ewe tribe on march,in accra,ghana.when she was a young child her parents separated.she was too young at that time to remember her parents living together.her mother remarried and remained in accra.her father,a farmer,also remarried and lived in a village called veku outside of anloga,a remote area of rural ghana.fiadjoe was sent to live with her father.
the father was a trokosi priest,maintaining a shrine in his home where he and other members of the trokosi cult conducted trokosi rituals.in when fiadjoe was seven years of age,her father,pursuant to trokosi practices,sought to make her his slave,working for him and the shrine and submitting to him sexually.during an approximately three months period the father sexually abused fiadjoe as part of the trokosi tenets.fortunately for fiadjoe,her father sister,aunt dela,objected to this abuse and took fiadjoe to live with her family in accra.there fiadjoe no longer saw her father and was able to attend school and live the life of an independent young woman.she was a christian,of the baptist persuasion.
sadly,in aunt dela was killed in an automobile accident.her husband remarried and directed fiadjoe to leave his house.she had nowhere else to go except to return to her father in veku.there she once again became her father slave subject to beatings and rape.approximately a year after her return she described to her grandmother the torments to which she was being subjected.the grandmother reported the beatings to the police but did not mention the rapes because of the disgrace that such a revelation would bring upon the family.the police refused to intervene on the ground that only a domestic dispute was involved.
fiadjoe attempted to escape from these conditions.she went to work selling fish in order to accumulate some money.when she had saved enough she moved out of her father house and rented a room of her own.however,after returning to her room one evening her landlord returned her rent and told her she could not stay.he had been threatened by her father.fiadjoe sought to escape through marriage and dated two men of her village,first titi and then agol,each of whom wanted to marry her.her father would not allow a marriage and scared off each of these men.
in fiadjoe met a muslim man,ahmed kublano who lived with his parents in anloga.his brother rasheed lived nearby.fiadjoe and ahmed fell in love and wanted to marry.in order to persuade the father to consent ahmed brought him gifts,but he could not bring his family because they were muslims and opposed the marriage.fiadjoe had informed ahmed about the beatings but had not told him that her father periodically raped her.ahmed persuaded her to leave her home and go with him to stay with his cousin in nigeria.
the two fled to nigeria and stayed with the cousin.they stayed there a week,but the cousin started to approach fiadjoe sexually and they had to leave.having no money it was necessary that they return to ghana.fiadjoe had no place to go other than her father house.as she explained at her asylum hearing,she had to go back because we she and ahmed are not married and in ghana before you can be free from your father,your father have to accept your marriage.
the father resumed beating fiadjoe and poured boiling water over her because she had disobeyed him.the sexual abuse continued.she and ahmed continued to see each other and still wanted to marry.it was a relationship.as fiadjoe stated in her affidavit my father hated ahmed because he did not want me to be with anyone but him,and because ahmed was a muslim.my father was opposed to the marriage and he said that i ca marry ahmed because i am a christian.ahmed family did not approve of me and did not want us to marry because i am a christian.
fiadjoe became pregnant by ahmed and hoped that this would persuade her father to agree to her marriage.when she told her father of her pregnancy he beat her until she miscarried.ahmed continued to visit fiadjoe.he did so on march,waiting in her bedroom before they went out together.fiadjoe testified that at that point i went to the shower to take a bath and then,when i came back,when i was coming out,i saw my father coming out of my room,but i knew ahmed was in the room,so when i went there ahmed was lying in blood i hold his hand and he did talk to me,he was just lying in the blood and he did do anything,so to me i was thinking he dead.
fiadjoe started shouting and her father told her that if she did shut up he would kill her.she took the money she had saved and left the house.she proceeded to ahmed brother,rasheed,to tell him what had happened.she then went to the roadside and took a car to accra.there she went to her mother house and told her what had happened.the mother did not want fiadjoe to stay with her because she knew the father was dangerous.fiadjoe then sought refuge with her aunt dela husband,who did not even want her to sit down,or enter the house because he was afraid of the father.
next fiadjoe went to a person she had known for many years named alfred who,for fear that the father would suspect that fiadjoe was with him,took her to his girlfriend house.as fiadjoe testified when he took me to his girlfriend house,he told me you ca stay here with this problem,you ca stay here,so,he took me to town,took passport size picture and then he gave me some clothes,i stayed there for about five days,i stayed with them for about five days,he gave me passport to just leave the passport he gave to me,i going to canada,if i go to canada,i will meet somebody at the airport,they will be holding my name.
fiadjoe gave five hundred thousand ghanian cedis to alfred and received from him dollars and the passport which bore her photograph and the name mercy.alfred drove her to the airport on march.she flew to jfk airport in new york city,arriving on march.there she was taken into custody by ins officials.
ins officials questioned fiadjoe that day and completed a handwritten record of sworn statement in proceeding under section b of the act.her answers made very little sense.in response to the question why did you leave your home country or country of last residence,she responded,i want to look after my mother.in response to the question do you have any fear or concern about being returned to your home country or being removed from the united states she replied,yes.i can not look after my sisters and brothers.in response to the question would you be harmed if you are returned to your home country or country of last residence,she responded yes i ca stand the responsibilities.
after the ins transferred fiadjoe to york county prison,officer reaves administered an asylum interview on march.contrary to the facts as she later recounted them,fiadjoe informed officer reaves that her father beatings began three years ago,that her father tried to have sex with her but that she never allowed it.
in due course fiadjoe was released from detention and took up residence at international friendship house.she had great difficulty adjusting to her environment and neighborhood.her then attorney referred her to kathleen jansen,a psychologist and adult therapist associated with the victim assistance center of york,pennsylvania,who first saw fiadjoe on may.at the outset jansen found that fiadjoe was withdrawn and highly anxious,made almost no eye contact,kept her head down,spoke very softly and frequently dissociated.
jansen recital of the events of fiadjoe prior life coincided virtually identically with events as later described in fiadjoe asylum affidavit,which she executed on july,and her april,testimony.in three respects jansen report became a basis of the ij and the bia credibility determinations.first,it is apparent that she had no understanding of the trokosi sect and its relationship to the torments to which fiadjoe was subjected.in this regard jansen wrote,fiadjoe describes her father as having a religious fetish which i have come to believe refers to what we would call an addiction.second,referring to ahmed,jansen wrote,h e was aware of the sexual assaults by her father,but was powerless to stop them.third,she described the death of ahmed as if he had been shot,writing on the night before she left her father home for the last time,she reports being in the shower room when she heard noises.when she emerged,she found her boyfriend lying shot on the floor.he was still alive when she reached him,and died in her arms.emphasis added.
jansen described fiadjoe emotional status 
work with fiadjoe has been complicated by the long history of multiple traumas and the underlying fear of being returned home.as with many incest survivors,she has learned to endure trauma by dissociating,emotionally removing herself from her surroundings until the pain has subsided.
each time i met with fiadjoe,i see dramatic improvements.she has established eating and sleeping habits that are within normal limits.her communication abilities have improved,although she continues to occasionally dissociate when discussing emotionally painful events.she is able to maintain reasonable eye contact and has a significantly greater range of affect.she is able to discuss many more difficult subjects without dissociating or breaking down.she remains extremely fearful of her father finding out where she is and of being sent back to ghana and forced to return to his home.
jansen report thus described fiadjoe somewhat fragile emotional state as she proceeded towards her asylum hearing continuing to occasionally dissociate when discussing emotionally painful events.
iii.april,hearing and initial oral decision 
fiadjoe asylum hearing on april,posed a challenge to her ability to discuss the difficult subjects of rape and incest without dissociating or breaking down.her attorney,piver,commenced by questioning her about her early years,her religion,trokosi practices and the start of her father sexual abuse when she was seven.
while fiadjoe testified about the initial sexual abuse at age seven,the cessation of the abuse while she was in accra with her aunt dela and its resumption eleven years later,the ij,donald ferlise,appeared unable to comprehend this sequence of events and the following interchange between him and the witness took place 
q well,how long,how long did this go on,that you were being raped and beaten 
judge to pyver sic 
a we getting to that 
q well,i getting to it now.
judge to fiadjoe 
q how did this go on 
a it,when i left to accra it stopped,but when i came back to my father again then,at the age of it continued from there.
q all right,indiscernible at age seven,did your father beat or rape you at age seven 
q for how long of period of time did that go on 
a for,til i was seven,i know my father was raping me.
q,you not making any 
a for it went 
q,you,you can cry,that fine,but your not making any sense,and the tears do not do away with the fact that your not making any sense to me.now,rather than crying,just answer the question.you said,your father raped you at age seven and he would beat you,correct 
a yes,but i did tell anybody.
q i do care if you did or not.at age seven,how long did this go on that he was raping you and beating you 
a in fact,he was doing that to me when i cried to my auntie,i want to 
q,i do like it when someone beats around the bush,okay,when they do answer me.another thing i do like is when somebody makes sounds as if their crying and their eyes stay dry,all right.it a form of histrionics,stage indiscernible,i do like that.i want straight answers and i want straight answers right now.you said,your father beat you and raped you at age seven,how long did that go on while you were age seven 
a in fact,it went until age seven and i left.
although it had been established that fiadjoe had been born in,that her father sexual molestation began when she was seven in,that she left for aunt dela home that year and returned to her father eleven years later when aunt dela died,the ij hounded fiadjoe because after the ij previous brow beating she could not testify as to the year when she returned to her father.this exchange ensued 
pyver sic to ms fiadjoe 
q okay,did you,when you went back to live with your father,had you,did,strike that,when you went back to live with your father,how was your treatment at that time 
a.he tried to beat me and rape me again.
q okay,how long did that start after you returned to his home 
a after a year.
q after a year.
judge to fiadjoe 
q all right,when did you return to your father,what year 
a no audible response.
q madam,please answer my question 
a i do remember the year,but i knew i was years,i do remember the year.
q you do know what year it occurred in 
pyver sic to fiadjoe 
q no,how,what year were you in 
a wait a minute,please 
judge to fiadjoe 
q do you know what year it,it occurred in 
a indiscernible.
q you know the question,please do do this,do beat around the bush,it aggravating,you know the question,what year did you return to your father 
a no audible response.
judge for the record 
all right,i find the respondent is non responsive to the question.
the ij challenged fiadjoe testimony that her father maintained a room in his house which contained idols 
judge to fiadjoe 
q did you ever go into the room 
q how do you know what was inside the room if you were never in there 
a because i go there once a month.
q well,how do you know 
a to perform,in there performing,i see them performing rituals.
q were you in the room or not 
q well then how did you know what was in the room if you were never in there 
a there indiscernible,i do know,i know there is idols.
q how do you know that if you never went in 
a because they have some of them outside,outside,they have some of them outside.
q how can you tell me what in the room if you were never there,explain that to me 
a i not allowed there because,i not part of them and i see some of the idols inside and outside the room,so that it is why i saying their idols.and they indiscernible in there particular days and they indiscernible,they go there to perform rituals.
q so,it because there idols outside the room,you think there idols inside the room,although you never seen them 
a yes,because they prepare food and a lot of them outside,they take into the room.
the ij pursued with extreme insensitivity a subject that must have been particularly painful to murder of ahmed 
judge to fiadjoe 
q you told me,that you never told ahmed,that your father had sexually assaulted you,but apparently,you told jansen,that you told ahmed about the sexual assaults,why is that 
a in fact,i told,jansen,that i let ahmed know that abuse,but i did clarify it today.
q well,she stating here,that ahmed was aware of the sexual assaults by your father,that pretty clear to me.
a but,i did not tell her about the assault,the beatings and all,i did clarify it to,jansen.
q well,is she,she a fortune teller,she can read your mind without you telling her,it clear here,she says that ahmed was aware of the sexual assaults by your father,so,you must have told her.that not what you told me today though,why is that,why is there a difference between what,jansen,writes in her letter and what you told me 
a because,jansen,is the one who let me know it okay to tell,but i did not explain that,i did not tell this part and this part,i just say,abuse and say indiscernible,i did explain,clarify that to her,but she let me know that it okay to tell somebody so that you can,i can feel okay,i can be healed indiscernible.
q yes,but your double talking me,it says that,just answer my question,the letter from jansen says,that ahmed knew about the sexual assaults by your father,you told me that ahmed did not know,so tell me why jansen telling me one thing,and why you telling me something else 
a no audible response.
q i waiting for your answer.
a please,i do know,i do have answer for that.
the concluding portions of the hearing further demonstrated the ij continuing hostility towards the obviously distraught fiadjoe and his abusive treatment of her throughout the hearing.he had succeeded in returning her to the condition which jansen had enabled her to overcome after repeated therapy sessions,breaking down and dissociating.as reflected in the transcript 
judge for the record 
all right,let me go off the record and we l sic decision.
off the record 
on the record judge renders oral decisionjudge to fiadjoe 
q fiadjoe,you heard my decision,you heard what i just said 
a no audible response.
q oh,you were sleeping there,you fell asleep did you 
a no audible response.
q you fell asleep during my decision 
a no,i feeling headache.
q did you hear what i said or were you asleep 
a i was asleep.
q did you hear what i said 
a i thought that you indiscernible,so i did.
q okay,all right,well,what i said was,that first of all,i do believe your testimony,i think that you were making up your testimony as you were going along.your testimony is contradicted by,much of it is contradicted by your own witness,jansen,her,her the letter that she wrote,your testimony generally does make any sense.i further found,and i denied it,basically because of that,i further found that if i had found that you were credible,that you were telling me the truth,i do not find that 
off the record 
on the record judge to fiadjoe 
q i do find that you have been persecuted and on one of the five statutory grounds.i do find,first of all,there are relatively few women involved in this movement,all right,sexual slaves.they number by,now you described it as,as a sexual slave,i read from the state department it seems there,there some sexual slavery involved with it,but it has a lot to do with idiolatry and voodoo and fears and just a lot of nonsense.i do find that a group of plus or minus women would be particular social group,it small group and it only in a certain section of,of ghana,around the indiscernible region.even if i found that it was a particular social group,the government is not persecuting anyone,all right,and the government is not allowing this to continue,they passed a law in and they had,there trying to abolish trokosi and apparently according to the state department,they think that it will be abolished in the,in the near future.so,even if it were a particular social group,that these women,a small group of women,i do find that they been persecuted pursuant to definition of persecution.and for that reason,i denied your application,do you understand,now 
q okay,the answer is yes.
iv.the sanitized oral decision 
on the hearing date the ij also delivered a sanitized version of his original crude and cruel oral decision.it will be referred to as the ij decision.
having found that fiadjoe was inadmissible for presenting a bogus passport to the immigration authorities and also under section a c i fraud on an immigration official,the ij set forth general legal principles applicable to applications for asylum and for restriction on removal.
turning to the circumstances about which fiadjoe testified,the ij rejected the evidence that trokosi was a form of religion,finding that it does not appear to the court that this is a religion,it is rather a cult.
the bulk of the opinion was devoted to the reasons why the ij found fiadjoe totally incredible.as he stated in his original oral decision i do believe your testimony.i think that you were making up your testimony as you went along.the first reason for this finding was fiadjoe inability to specify the year in which she returned to her father after spending eleven years with aunt dela.the ij wrote 
the respondent was asked when she returned to her father and she was unable to tell the court when it occurred.if indeed this had transpired in the respondent life and if indeed she was living safely with her aunt for years,it is abundantly clear to the court that the respondent would be able to tell me when she returned home to that situation that she feared so much.
the second reason that the ij gave for rejecting fiadjoe testimony was the inconsistency he perceived between her testimony that she had never been in the room in which her father and other participants performed rituals and her testimony that there were idols in that room 
the respondent father told her that he wanted her to be a trokosi slave,she stated that the father had a room inside his house in which she was not permitted to enter,in which there were idols.the court asked the respondent if she had never entered that room,how she knew there was idols inside and her answer was that she presumed they were idols inside the room that she had never entered since they were idols outside the room.this line of thought on the respondent part is not particularly persuasive.
the ij found reason to doubt fiadjoe testimony in the fact that she returned to her father house after returning with ahmed from nigeria 
ahmed and the respondent in april of,traveled to nigeria by bus to live with ahmed cousin.the cousin of ahmed apparently made sexual advances to the respondent,so that after three weeks,she and ahmed returned to ghana and the respondent returned to her father home.the respondent was asked why,if she had been beaten and raped at her father home,did she return there.she states that she returned there since she did not want her father to be angered by the fact that she was with ahmed.this absolutely is totally implausible and totally nonsensical to the court,insofar as the respondent was returning to a situation where she knew she was going to be raped and beaten.and i do believe that she would have any fear that her father would be angered and if she did have a fear,that fear would be a lesser fear than the rape and the beatings that she knew awaited her.as it turned out,when the respondent did return,her father not only beat her but poured hot water on her as a form of punishment.
the ij relied upon perceived inconsistencies between fiadjoe testimony and her statements to jansen as reflected in jansen report.he found that jansen report cast doubt upon fiadjoe testimony that her abusive father was part of the trokosi sect or that she was a trokosi slave 
the respondent submitted to the court a from social worker kathleen jansen,which is found at exhibit,tab.a careful examination of jansen letter reflects nothing to the effect that the respondent father was a member of the trokosi cult,nor that the respondent herself was a trokosi slave.the respondent was not able to explain why what she told the court,was not told to the social worker.
the ij found that fiadjoe testimony that she only told her grandmother about her father sexual abuse is contradicted by jansen report which recites that fiadjoe also told her mother about the sexual abuse.the ij found contradiction of fiadjoe testimony that she never told ahmed about the sexual nature of her father abuse in the statement in jansen letter that ahmed was aware of the sexual assaults by her father,but was powerless to stop them.further,the ij notes an inconsistency between fiadjoe statement that she does not know how her father killed ahmed and the statement in jansen report that w hen she emerged from the shower,she found her boyfriend lying shot on the floor.
the ij also based his credibility evaluation on statements that fiadjoe made to immigration officials when she was initially processed after her detention.at the airport she did not disclose her reason for fleeing ghana and told the immigration officer a rather benign reason for coming here,the fact that she was not able to financially provide for her siblings.the ij referred to the asylum prescreening interview document 
that document reflects on page,that the respondent told the immigration officer that her father started beating her three years ago.that is three years ago prior to march of,consequently that would be march of however,the respondent told the court that she was years of age when the beatings began.thus,again we have a diametric difference between what the respondent told this court and what the respondent told the immigration officer during the asylum interview.
even more interesting is the fact that,again according to this interview,the respondent told the immigration officer that her father never had sex with her.this totally undermines the entire case in chief,since her entire case in chief is based on her father using her as a sex slave.whenever the court sees such a diametric difference between the testimony that the respondent has given to the court and the testimony that the respondent has given another member of the immigration service,the credibility of the respondent and the case in chief gravely suffer.
the ij emphasized that t he credibility of the respondent is of extreme importance in assessing the respondent claim the court concludes that the respondent is making up her testimony as she is going along,she making up these scenarios and she is fabricating her testimony to the court the court again states for the record that this was a frivolous application and that the respondent intentionally lied to this court.
the ij provided alternative grounds for denying fiadjoe applications for relief.he quoted the state department report describing the trokosi cult,including the practice of its priests of maintaining sex slaves at trokosi shrines.the ij then held 
the court finds that being a trokosi slave or a member of the cult,is being a member of a relatively small group.according to the state department,it numbers approximately people in a small area,in the southeast portion of ghana.the court will not find that a trokosi slave constitutes a particular social group,insofar as it is rather a minuscule part of the general population of ghana.
had he found trokosi slaves to be a particular social group,the ij held that he would not find that the respondent is being persecuted as being a member of that social group and does not qualify for asylum,insofar as i find that this practice is being stamped out by the government,according to the state department reports and that it can be eradicated by the government within a short period of time,with the passage of a law which occurred in.
a rather confusing observation followed in support of the ij finding that fiadjoe had not established a fear of persecution.the ij appeared to believe that fiadjoe was alleging that she was being persecuted because she was a member of the trokosi sect,when in fact she was asserting that with the acquiescence of governmental officials,the trokosi sect was persecuting her,forcing her into practices totally contrary to her christian faith.the ij observed 
the government does not condone this slavery.it is perpetuated by a rather small number of people following an ideology,some type of voodoo religion or voodoo following,and the court does not find that it constitutes a persecution of this group of women,even if these women should be classified as a particular social group.the court considers the trokosi as an isolated aberration of the small segment of the society in ghana,but i do not find that it is a ground for asylum.i do not find that members of that group are being persecuted for one of the five statutory grounds for a grant of such relief.
consequently,for all of these reasons,the court finds that the respondent has not established fear of persecution as defined,if she were returned to ghana.accordingly her application for asylum will be denied.
based on the foregoing,the ij determined i it was unnecessary to consider whether fiadjoe merited relief as a matter of discretion ii because fiadjoe failed to establish eligibility for asylum,she failed to meet the higher standard of proof necessary for restriction on removal to ghana and iii fiadjoe does not qualify for relief under the cat because she did not establish that she is more likely than not to be tortured if she returns to ghana.
the ij entered orders denying fiadjoe request for asylum,for restriction on removal to ghana and for withholding removal under the cat.he ordered that she be removed from the united states to ghana.
proceeding before the bia 
on appeal from the ij decision the bia relied heavily upon the ij credibility determination in denying the respondent applications for relief,the immigration judge found that the respondent was not credible ij at.we agree.the bia advanced two grounds for its credibility perceived inconsistencies in her testimony at the hearing before the ij and ii inconsistencies in her statement at her asylum interview.
with respect to fiadjoe testimony,the bia noted that fiadjoe made conflicting claims as to the age when her trokosi ritual sexual abuse by her father began,referring to the following inconsistencies or supposed inconsistencies i in her asylum application and during her testimony fiadjoe claimed that her father began to abuse her sexually and attempted to rape her when she was seven years old ii in further testimony she asserted that her father had in fact raped her when she was seven iii in her statement given at her asylum interview she stated that the abuse began approximately three years prior to her march interviews and claimed that she did not allow her father to have sex with her,in contrast to later claims of rape.the bia concluded that b ecause we have found that the respondent testimony can not be accepted as credible,it follows that the respondent has failed to satisfy her burden of proof and persuasion.
further,the bia held that fiadjoe claims must be denied for failure to establish that the government of ghana was either unwilling or unable to control her father ritual abuse.in support of this conclusion the bia noted i fiadjoe did not seek help of the ghanian authorities ii the grandmother when reporting the father abuse to the police did not mention the sexual aspect of the abuse iii the government outlawed trokosi practices and ritual bondage in and a organization had success in liberating,counseling,and rehabilitating past victims of such bondage.
the bia found that fiadjoe implicitly admitted that she could escape her father abuse by moving to an urban area,citing as support i fiadjoe escape when she fled to nigeria ii her move into an apartment and iii her unconvincing testimony about being impelled to return to the father home after the abortive flight to nigeria.the bia concluded the respondent failure to pursue internal relocation would likely be a negative discretionary factor even if we had found that she had suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground.
because the bia had found that fiadjoe had not testified credibly and that she had failed to demonstrate that the government of ghana would be unwilling or unable to protect her,it did not reach the issue of whether bondage as a trokosi slave would meet the definition of persecution on account of membership in a particular social group or the issue whether fiadjoe,even if credible,had established that she was,in fact,a trokosi slave.
finding that fiadjoe had failed to establish the lower burden of proof required for asylum,the bia held that she had failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal and that she had failed to establish that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured upon her return to ghana,thus requiring that her request for relief under the cat be denied.
with one member,juan osuna,dissenting,the bia dismissed the appeal on june.fiadjoe filed in this court a timely petition for review of the bia decision.fiadjoe also moved for reconsideration of the bia decision.one of the grounds for the motion to reconsider was the failure of the bia to consider certain evidence which was not before the ij but which fiadjoe submitted in support of her appeal.in particular she submitted an october,letter of jansen which explained why certain of the statements made in her earlier letter on which the ij relied to find that fiadjoe lacked credibility constituted jansen mistakes or misunderstanding.jansen october,letter also spelled out in considerable detail the nature and consequence of the stress from which fiadjoe suffered from her father abuse and the effect this stress had with respect to fiadjoe responses to questions concerning sexual abuse matters.the following are a few of jansen observations concerning fiadjoe emotional state 
it is my professional opinion that posttraumatic stress disorder,fiadjoe own mannerisms,and the immigration judge lack of awareness of ghanian culture contributed to fiadjoe responses to questioning by opposing counsel and,in particular,to the judge.it is extraordinarily difficult for sexual abuse victims to discuss specifics of their abuse experiences.given the extreme shame that surrounds these issues in general they are difficult for both men and women to discuss.with the addition of the cultural factors surrounding fiadjoe experiences in particular,it should be of no surprise at all that she would be reluctant to discuss these issues with anyone,most specifically with a male or in the presence of several males.it is very typical of victims of sexual abuse to not be able to accurately recall dates,ages,number of abuse occurrences and time lines in general.in addition,i believe cultural factors played a role.in many cultures the specifics of dates,time,and ages are not valued as significantly as they are in western,industrialized cultures.the combination of cultural factors and traumatic stress reactions would be expected to impede one memory of dates,times and ages.
i believe i also communicated in my initial letter that because of her history of severe abuse,under situations of duress she tends to dissociate.this means that if she feels threatened or or will withdraw from the situation,become confused,frightened,hesitant,and may appear to have a blank look on her face.this is a natural consequence of the posttraumatic stress disorder from which she suffers.
the immigration judge believed that fiadjoe was fabricating her account of rape by her father because he found inconsistencies.these inconsistencies are not evidence of dishonesty in fiadjoe are evidence of severe posttraumatic stress disorder.it is also noteworthy that at the time of this hearing,fiadjoe was approximately seven months postpartum and,by history,suffered a significant bout of postpartum depression for approximately nine months after the birth of her daughter.this condition would,as well,affect both her memory and her communication style.similarly it does not at all surprise me that upon initial questioning by ins agents fiadjoe would reference her father attempting sexual abuse but deny that he had had intercourse with her.fear and shame would more than explain that circumstance.please note that she did disclose the sexual assaults to her grandmother who immediately told her it was shameful for her to discuss those matters.although the grandmother was willing to report the physical abuse to the police,she refused to report or permit fiadjoe to report the sexual violence.i can vehemently affirm that once a sense of safety and a tentative working relationship was established with fiadjoe she consistently and clearly disclosed multiple incidents of violent rape by her father during our counseling sessions.it is also important to note that fiadjoe recounting of her experiences in her father custody never wavered during our work together.as an expert in assessing traumatic stress,and an experienced provider of services to victims of sexual violence i never saw any indication that fiadjoe was less than truthful with me or that she was fabricating any of her experiences.
in addition to describing fiadjoe emotional state,jansen took responsibility for creating what appeared to be inconsistencies between statements contained in her original letter,which was in evidence before the ij,and fiadjoe testimony.jansen explained her failure to use the term trokosi in her report,limiting her description of the father behavior as being a fetish 
one of the shortcomings of my work with fiadjoe falls to my lack of understanding at that time about the trokosi religion and the definition of a fetish priest.she spoke often of her father fetish practices and interpreting her words and their meaning was very difficult.she did state on many occasions that her father would be intoxicated just prior to him raping her,and based on my own cultural background i connected the term fetish to her father abuse of alcohol.i did not at that time investigate the religious practices of fetish priests and was unaware of the specifics of the trokosi religion.since that time,i have learned more about that religion and its practices and it fits precisely with the experiences she was relating to me.again,my focus was on her immediate physical and psychological well being and i failed to investigate the cultural implications fully.
addressing the statement in her original letter that fiadjoe had informed ahmed of the father sexual abuse,jansen wrote 
there was some controversy over whether fiadjoe discussed these matters with her fiancé,ahmed.in reviewing my notes,i make reference to the fact that ahmed was aware of the abuse by her father.when consulting my notes to prepare the initial letter,i interpreted them to mean both the physical and sexual abuse.i can not now independently recall whether i specifically referred to the physical and sexual abuse when discussing this matter with fiadjoe.it would not at all surprise me that she would have told him about the physical abuse but not the sexual abuse.indeed,noting the cultural taboos and shame involved,it is very likely that she would not tell ahmed of the multiple violent rapes she endured at the hands of her father.
addressing the subject of the manner of ahmed death,jansen explains that she merely inferred that he had been shot and does not recall that fiadjoe informed her that he had been shot 
there appeared to be additional controversy over fiadjoe knowledge of the manner of ahmed death.again,in reviewing my notes,i documented that while in the shower room fiadjoe heard a loud noise and upon entering her bedroom,found ahmed dying on the floor.i believe that it was my interpretation of events that ahmed had been shot.i apologize for the confusion that interpretation caused.i have no independent recollection of fiadjoe specifically stating the manner of death.recall,please,that the purpose of my services was not an investigative one.when i began seeing fiadjoe she was not able to eat properly,was not sleeping consistently,was experiencing severe flashbacks and distressing nightmares,and was attempting to adjust to an extremely foreign environment.it was my purpose to alleviate the immediate psychological pain and suffering and to assist her in adjusting to her new environment.the exact manner of her fiancé murder was inconsequential to the critical task at hand.
apart from the failure of the bia to consider this additional evidence,fiadjoe advanced four other grounds for reconsideration i the bia reliance upon fiadjoe statements to an ins officer upon arrival as a basis for a negative credibility finding ii its finding that fiadjoe had failed to carry her burden that the government of ghana was unable or unwilling to assist her iii its finding that fiadjoe could have relocated to another part of ghana and iv the bia failure to consider fiadjoe persecution on account of her religion as a christian opposed to trokosi and her feminist political opinion that women should be educated and not subjugated to men.
the bia denied the motion for reconsideration stating that fiadjoe had not identified any change of law,new legal argument or error in the bia previous analysis that would move it to reconsider its decision.it noted that the inconsistent statements to an immigration officer upon which it relied to support its credibility finding were not made at the airport immediately after landing but were made some weeks later during a fair and thoughtful interview,thus rendering fiadjoe reliance upon the cases cited in support of the motion misplaced.
fiadjoe filed in this court a petition for review of the denial of the motion for reconsideration.that petition has been consolidated with the original petition for review.
vi.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review we have jurisdiction to review final orders of the bia under a of the immigration and nationality act,a.
both the ij and the bia made an adverse credibility determination.the final order that we review is the decision of the bia,and normally we review the decision of the bia,not the ij,gao ashcroft,cir abdulai ashcroft,cir.there are exceptions to this rule.if,for instance,the bia affirms the ij decision for the reasons set forth in that decision,the ij opinion effectively becomes the bia,and,accordingly,a court must review the ij decision.korytnyuk ashcroft,cir.
in the present case the bia stated at the outset that it agreed with the ij finding that fiadjoe was not credible.it then set forth a single paragraph devoted to the credibility issue,listing two of the inconsistencies upon which the ij had relied.thus,as in xie ashcroft,cir,we address the circumstance in which the bia both adopted the ij adverse credibility determination and discussed some,but not all,of the underlying bases for the ij adverse credibility determination,at.in the present case,in light of its expression of agreement with the ij credibility finding and its own sketchy credibility analysis,the bia must have relied upon the adverse credibility finding of the ij.we thus have jurisdiction to review both the bia and ij opinions,at see also,miah ashcroft,cir senathirajah ins,cir.there is an additional reason to review the ins decision and the hearing from which the decision derived.any adverse credibility determinations based on the testimony must be viewed with great caution in view of the abusive nature of the hearing.
adverse credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.under this standard,the bia adverse credibility determination must be upheld on review unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.minor inconsistencies do not provide an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.xie,at.
apart from its adverse credibility determination,the bia found that fiadjoe failed to establish that the government of ghana was either unable or unwilling to control her father ritual sexual abuse.we must uphold this factual finding if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d.we should find substantial evidence lacking only where the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.id.at.see also b b abdille ashcroft,cir.
b.the ij hearing and credibility finding prior to the commencement of testimony before the ij on april,the ij identified the record in his possession.it included fiadjoe july,asylum affidavit form which recited in full detail the circumstances that led to her commencement of her father sexual abuse at age seven,the resumption of her life as a trokosi slave at age eighteen and the continuing beatings and periodic rape committed by her father.it recited her attempts to escape from her father house,her flight to nigeria,her return,her father murder of the man whom she loved and hoped to marry,and her second flight and inability to find someone in accra who would take her in.
also in the record which the ij possessed was jansen june,letter describing her therapy sessions with fiadjoe and fiadjoe emotional state.jansen recounted how fiadjoe emotional condition improved markedly after sessions of counseling and that although h er communication abilities have improved,she nevertheless continues to occasionally dissociate when discussing emotionally painful events.it was,of course,necessary to testify about emotionally painful events at the april,hearing.
the ins guidelines entitled consideration for asylum officers adjudicating asylum claims from women describe in general terms the phenomena that jansen observed in fiadjoe.the guidelines are as applicable to an ij credibility determination as they are to an asylum officer credibility determination,
women who have been raped or otherwise sexually abused may be seriously stigmatized and ostracized in their societies.they may also be subject to additional violence,abuse or discrimination because they are viewed as having brought shame and dishonor on themselves,their families,and their communities.
women who have been subject to domestic or sexual abuse may be psychologically traumatized.trauma can be suffered by any applicant,regardless,of gender,and may have a significant impact on the ability to present testimony.
the demeanor of traumatized applicants can vary.they may appear numb or show emotional passivity when recounting past events of mistreatment.some applicants may give recitations of serious instances of mistreatment.trauma may also cause memory loss or distortion,and may cause other applicants to block certain experiences from their minds in order not to relive their horror by the retelling.
in cultures,people who avert their gaze when answering a question,or seem nervous,are perceived as untruthful.in other cultures,however,body language does not convey the same message.in certain asian cultures,for example,people will avert their eyes when speaking to an authority figure as a sign of respect.this is a product of culture,not necessarily of credibility.
it bears reiteration that the foregoing considerations of demeanor can be the products of trauma or culture,not credibility.poor interview skills may cause faulty negative credibility findings.
from the outset of the april,hearing the ij took over much of the questioning of fiadjoe,both on direct and on by the government.his tone was hostile and at times became extraordinarily abusive.if not by design,in effect,he produced the very atmosphere that jansen and the ins guidelines anticipated would cause memory loss,blocking,dissociating and breakdown.
examining fiadjoe concerning the highly sensitive subject of her father sexual abuse at age seven,the ij questioning reduced her to tears see transcript excerpt at,supra.
at that point in the proceedings fiadjoe began having difficulty responding to the ij.she had been born in.in response to her attorney questions she testified that she went to live with her aunt dela in accra when she was seven,in,thus bringing the sexual abuse to a temporary halt.she further testified that she remained with aunt dela eleven years and was years of age when she returned to her father home upon the death of aunt dela.a rather simple calculation would have placed this in the year,but under the ij harsh questioning fiadjoe was unable to recall the year and was reduced to an inability to respond see transcript excerpt at,supra.
the bullying nature of the ij questioning was further evident in his interrogation of fiadjoe about her knowledge that her father kept idols in the room in which he worshiped when she testified that she had never been in the room.ignoring the obvious point that fiadjoe made,that she could see into the room without entering it,the ij continued to badger her see transcript excerpt at supra.
dealing with a subject that can only have been extremely painful to fiadjoe,her father murder of her fiancé ahmed,the ij pursued an apparent inconsistency between fiadjoe testimony and jansen report concerning whether fiadjoe had told ahmed about the sexual aspect of the abuse she had suffered.the ij reduced fiadjoe to an inability to respond to his questions see transcript excerpt at supra.
these are examples of the manner in which the ij treated fiadjoe throughout the hearing.an examination of the entire transcript discloses other instances of his extreme insensitivity towards the witness and his failure to take into account the abuses to which she had been subjected in ghana.the ij own concluding questions and remarks demonstrate that he had reduced her to the emotional state against which jansen and the ins guidelines had warned 
judge to fiadjoe 
q fiadjoe,you heard my decision,you heard what i just said 
a no audible response.
q oh,you were sleeping there,you fell asleep did you 
a no audible response.
q you fell asleep during my decision 
a no,i feeling headache.
q did you hear what i said or were you asleep 
a i was asleep.
q did you hear what i said 
a i thought that you indiscernible,so i did.
q okay,all right,well,what i said was,that first of all,i do believe your testimony,i think that you were making up your testimony as you were going along.your testimony is contradicted by,much of it is contradicted by your own witness,jansen,her,her,the letter that she wrote,your testimony generally does make sense.i further found,and i denied it,basically because of that,i further found that if i had found that you were credible,that you were telling me the truth,i do not find that 
off the record 
as the ins guidelines stated,p oor interview skills may cause faulty negative credibility findings.they most certainly did so in this case.
the conduct of the ij by itself would require a rejection of his credibility finding.apart from that consideration,the formal reasons he gave for finding that the respondent is making up her testimony as she is going along,she making up these scenarios and she is fabricating her testimony to the court do not withstand examination.
first,the ij relied upon fiadjoe inability to state the year when she returned from aunt dela to her father house.it is true that fiadjoe,after being subjected to the ij brow beating,could not recall the year of her return.however,she testified that she was born in,left for aunt dela home when she was seven and returned after eleven years when she was eighteen years of age.the inability to recall during the stress of the hearing that the year of return was does not affect credibility.
the ij found that fiadjoe testimony that her father kept idols in the shrine room in his home was inconsistent with her testimony that she never entered the room.in spite of the badgering nature of the ij questioning,fiadjoe fully explained that without entering she could see into the room,that idols were also kept outside the room,and that she observed other trokosi adherents enter the room to bring food to the idols and later leave.there was no inconsistency in her testimony.
referring to fiadjoe testimony about her return to her father home after her and ahmed abortive attempt to establish a residence in nigeria,the ij attributes to fiadjoe the statement that she returned there since she did not want her father to be angered by the fact that she was with ahmed.the ij found that t his absolutely is totally implausible and totally nonsensical to the court,insofar as the respondent was returning to a situation where she knew she was going to be raped and beaten.the ij subsequent observations make no sense and i do believe that she would have any fear that her father would be angered and if she did have a fear,that fear would be a lesser fear than the rape and the beatings that she knew awaited her.as it turned out,when the respondent did return,her father not only beat her but poured hot water on her as a form of punishment.in the first place the ij does not give an accurate recital of fiadjoe testimony.she did not want her father to attack ahmed but the reason she gave for returning to her father was that i do,my father,i do have anybody to go to,a fact that,as will be discussed in connection with the bia credibility finding,is fully supported by the record.
next,the ij found fiadjoe lacked credibility because jansen letter reflects nothing to the effect that respondent father was a member of the trokosi cult,nor that the respondent herself was a trokosi slave.the respondent was not able to explain why what she told the court,was not told to the social worker.the ij premise that fiadjoe did not tell jansen about the trokosi sect is totally wrong,even if reference is made only to the letter in evidence before the ij.repeatedly throughout the asylum proceedings fiadjoe referred to her father trokosi practices as his fetish.in her june,letter jansen writes,fiadjoe describes her father as having a religious fetish.jansen at that time did not understand what fiadjoe was telling her,a misunderstanding which she later overcame,as explained in her october,letter,which will be discussed further in connection with the bia credibility determination.in any event,the ij was simply in error when he stated that jansen letter reflects nothing to the effect that fiadjoe father was a member of the trokosi cult.
the ij perceived two other inconsistencies between fiadjoe testimony and what appeared in jansen june,letter.he assumed fiadjoe told jansen what was stated in the letter.first,fiadjoe testified that she never told ahmed about the sexual assaults upon her,whereas the letter states ahmed was aware of the sexual assaults by her father,but was powerless to stop them.second,fiadjoe testified that,not having seen her father kill ahmed,she did not know how he was killed,whereas the letter states w hen she emerged,she found her boyfriend lying shot on the floor.emphasis added.as disclosed in jansen october,letter which was not before the ij,these inconsistencies resulted from jansen erroneous assumptions,not from misstatements of fiadjoe.even if there were such inconsistencies which there were not,they were minor in nature.in the entire flow of events that afflicted fiadjoe from age seven until she fled from ghana,it was immaterial whether ahmed knew of the sexual abuse as well as the other forms of abuse perpetrated by the father and whether the father shot or stabbed ahmed,the only likely other means of killing him.
the ij relied upon statements that fiadjoe made to immigration officers upon her arrival in the united states and upon the occasion of her asylum interview on march,which are inconsistent with her asylum affidavit,the information she provided jansen and her testimony.for reasons that will be set forth in the discussion of the bia credibility determination,these statements do not constitute substantial evidence that would permit a finding that fiadjoe lacked credibility.
as the ij expressed it,t he credibility of the respondent is of extreme importance in assessing respondent claim.no adverse credibility assessment derived from a hearing conducted under the circumstances and in the manner that the ij conducted the april,hearing could survive review.further,even if the hearing were conducted in an,fair manner,the reasons that the ij gave for his finding of lack of credibility are not supported by substantial evidence.
c.the bia credibility finding of necessity the bia had before it the transcript of the ij hearing and the documentary record.fiadjoe asylum application,her recital of events during her counseling with jansen and her testimony at the hearing were consistent in their detailed description of the extended series of horrifying events that occurred in her life from age seven until her flight from ghana after the murder of ahmed.despite the ij conclusion that she was making up her testimony as she was going along,it is highly improbable that anyone could consistently recount these events in detail on each of these three occasions.
the bia,apart from its general agreement with the ij adverse credibility determination,relied upon two grounds for its own adverse credibility determination i a purported inconsistency in fiadjoe testimony concerning the nature of the sexual abuse that her father perpetrated upon her at age seven,and ii the inconsistencies in her sworn statement before an asylum officer given approximately nineteen days after she was taken into custody at the airport.despite the critical nature of the issue and the extensiveness of the record,the bia devoted a mere twelve lines of its opinion to set forth the reasons for its credibility finding.
as to the sexual abuse at age,the bia decision stated 
she claimed in her written asylum application and during her testimony in immigration court that her father began to abuse her sexually and attempted to rape her when she was years old exh.at tr.at.shortly thereafter,she modified her testimony somewhat and claimed that her father had in fact raped her when she was tr.at.
in her asylum application exh.at fiadjoe stated,a fter my parent sic separation,i lived with my father and he began to sexually abuse me.this started when i was years old.at her hearing tr.at fiadjoe testified,a t the age of seven,he tried to rape me and abuse me and beat me up and want me to be part of trokosi,trokosi.at the point in the hearing when the ij had reduced fiadjoe to tears and berated her for crying and beating around bush he asked her how long her father beat or raped her tr.at,to which she responded before dissolving into tears f or,till i was seven,i know my father was raping me.there is no necessary inconsistency in these statements.sexual abuse during a three months period could plausibly include both attempted rape and rape.moreover,it is unreasonable to expect a person to remember whether the repeated sexual abuse she suffered at age seven constituted attempted rape or actual rape.in the present case,in light of what followed in the ensuing years,any imprecision in this regard can not rationally be a basis for an adverse credibility finding.
as to the inconsistencies in the statement before the asylum officer,the bia decision stated 
however,the respondent stated in a sworn statement before an asylum officer with the immigration and naturalization service now the department of homeland security,dhs that the abuse began approximately years prior to her interview in exh.at,when she would have been or.in fact,she claimed in that interview that she never allowed her father to have sex with her id,in stark contrast to her later claims of rape tr.at.
on march,asylum officer james reaves conducted an asylum interview.there can be no criticism of the manner in which he conducted the interview.he ensured that fiadjoe had an interpreter in the twi language.his questions were concise.there is every reason to believe that he,unlike the ij,followed the ins memorandum on considerations for asylum officers adjudicating asylum claims from women,dated may.
with one exception,the answers fiadjoe gave to him were fully consistent with her subsequent asylum application,her statements to jansen and her hearing testimony.they included information about her family,her father beatings,her flight from home,the murder of her fiancé,and her inability thereafter to find refuge with aunt dela husband,her mother and stepfather and the friend in accra.fiadjoe statement before officer reaves departed from her asylum application,the information she gave to jansen and her hearing testimony in the following respect 
q have you ever been harmed in your country by anyone 
a yes,by my father.
q what did your father do to you 
a he abused me by beating me.
q when did this happen 
a he started doing this about years ago.
q did you live with him at that time 
a yes,i was staying at home.
q how long did this continue 
a this continued for years,sometimes he tried to have sex with me.
q did you ever have sex with your father 
a no,i never allowed it.
q when did this happen 
a it happened many times during the three years.when someone came to the house to marry me he would reject them.
q when did this end 
a it never ended until i ran away from home.he wanted me to marry an old man,i told him no.a friend came over to my house.i went to take a shower and when i returned the friend was dead.i think my father killed my boyfriend.he was years old.
q did your father kill this young man 
a i was in the shower,when i came out my father was coming out of my room.i do know what he used to kill him.
to determine whether this discrepancy constitutes substantial evidence to support the ij and the bia adverse credibility determinations,it is necessary to examine the circumstances in which the statement was given.only nineteen days previously,march,fiadjoe had arrived in this country traumatized by years of sexual oppression,the march murder of her fiancé and a desperate but futile effort to find refuge from her father in accra.on her arrival at the airport she was questioned by an ins officer and gave nonsensical answers.for example,when asked why she left her home country she responded i want to look after my mother.
it is established in this circuit that inconsistencies between an airport statement and an asylum seeker testimony before an ij is not sufficient,standing alone,to support a bia finding that the petitioner was not credible.balasubramanrim ins,cir.such an interview is likely to be hurried language difficulties arise the results may be inaccurately recorded,and an arriving alien who has suffered abuse in his home country may be reluctant to reveal full information in his or her first meeting with the government,at.as we stated in senathirajah ins,
by placing too much reliance on an airport interview under the circumstances here,and ignoring more detailed accounts in form as well as testimony at an asylum hearing,the ins seriously undermined the reliability of the administrative process.
the asylum officer interview of fiadjoe was not conducted at the airport shortly after her arrival it was conducted on march,approximately nineteen days later,at the york county prison.yet conditions similar to,and in many ways worse than,those at an airport interview prevailed.fiadjoe was still in a state of shock resulting from the devastating experiences prior to march.jansen described fiadjoe emotional state which existed at the time of the asylum officer interview and thereafter until she had undergone counseling with jansen 
in the aftermath of her fiancee murder,fiadjoe was in a state of shock.she reports symptoms that are textbook acute psychological trauma.without significant training in trauma psychology,she would be very unlikely to falsely report those symptoms much less describe them in the details as she and i have discussed them.
finding herself in a strange place before a male officer it is not surprising that fiadjoe would be unable to discuss the shameful and taboo incidents of incestuous rape.in both her letters jansen described fiadjoe emotional state when she first saw her and recounted that it was not until fiadjoe had engaged in a number of therapy sessions that she was able to discuss fully,even with her,sexual abuses which her father had committed.completely consistent with the ins memorandum concerning considerations for adjudicating claims of women,jansen wrote in her october,letter 
it is extraordinarily difficult for sexual abuse victims to discuss specifics of their abuse experiences.given the extreme shame that surrounds these issues in general they are difficult for both men and women to discuss.with the addition of the cultural factors surrounding fiadjoe experiences in particular,it should be of no surprise at all that she would be reluctant to discuss these issues with anyone,most specifically with a male or in the presence of several males.
asked on cross examination why she had not informed the ins officer about what had happened,fiadjoe responded,about sexual aspects,my father sleeping with me,i do feel comfortable telling people the bia considered none of these factors when rendering its decision.
as discussed above,the inconsistency in fiadjoe statement to the asylum officer is all that is left that reflects on fiadjoe credibility.none of the other reasons given by either the ij or the bia support an adverse credibility determination.by placing reliance on this interview under the circumstances in which it was taken and ignoring more detailed accounts in form as well as testimony at an asylum hearing,the ins seriously undermined the reliability of the administrative process.senathirajah,at.neither the ij nor the bia adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.
government protection under b,the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee within the meaning of a.generally speaking,an applicant must show that he or she 
is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of such person nationality or in which such a person last habitually resided,because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
a a.a showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution.b.
to establish persecution,an alien must show past or potential harm rising to the level of persecution on account of a statutorily enumerated ground that is committed by the government or by forces the government is unable or unwilling to control.see gao ashcroft,cir.
the bia found that fiadjoe claim for asylum must be denied for failure to establish that the government of ghana was either unable or unwilling to control her father ritual sexual abuse.the bia evidential support for this finding is set forth in its entirety in a bare six lines of its decision 
the respondent never sought the help of the authorities in ghana tr.at.the respondent claimed that her grandmother told the police of the respondent being beaten but that she declined to tell the authorities about the ritual sex abuse due to shame tr.at.the respondent submitted evidence that the government of ghana outlawed trokosi practice and ritual bondage in and that a organization has had success in liberating,counseling,and rehabilitating past victims of such bondage.exh.
in the context of the record viewed in its entirety,these two snippets of information,both of them inadequately stated,do not constitute substantial evidence to support the bia finding that fiadjoe has failed to establish that the government of ghana was either unable or unwilling to control her father ritual sexual abuse.the bia totally ignored the evidence in the record that establishes the deep hold that the trokosi religion has upon substantial elements of the ghanian people.for example 
appalled by the practice,some ghanians have broken the fearful silence which surrounds trokosi.but their calls for it to be banned have had little impact on the centuries old tradition which has the blessing of some of ghana most powerful man.jerry rawlings,the country charismatic if not exactly democratic,an spoken of trokosi as an important part of ghana cultural heritage.
booker,slave of the fetish,the june.
nor is it easy to escape from trokosi slavery.speaking of his slaves,one trokosi priest stated,their families would take them back.they too afraid of angering the fetish.
the bia was incorrect when it stated that t he respondent never sought the help of the authorities in ghana.fiadjoe did seek such help through her grandmother who twice sought assistance from the police.it is true,as the bia states,that the grandmother was too ashamed to mention the sexual aspect of the abuse,but the record is replete with evidence that the police would have done nothing even if they had been informed of that aspect of the abuse.
the most recent state department report covering ghana shows how futile resort to the police would have been.multiple pages are devoted to the brutality and corruption of the police and their refusal to prosecute sensitive crime,as trokosi sexual practices certainly were,particularly in a village inhabited by believers in the sect.the report notes that v iolence against women,including rape and domestic violence remains a significant problem.a study revealed that particularly in,sections of greater accra,at least percent of women have been assaulted in recent years.a total of percent of the victims of domestic violence are women according to data gathered by the fida.these abuses generally go unreported and seldom come before the courts.the police tend not to intervene in domestic disputes.
fiadjoe own experiences demonstrate that where a trokosi slave is involved the police will not intervene.she had to flee to another country to escape from her father,where,unfortunately she was unable to stay.when she obtained her own room from a landlord in her neighborhood,her father so terrorized the landlord that he turned her out.surely if the landlord had thought he could have obtained appropriate protection for himself and his tenant he would have turned to the public authorities.similarly,when fiadjoe fled to accra after ahmed murder,her own mother did not dare to take her in,nor did her aunt dela husband,nor did an old friend.the old friend was so frightened that the father would suspect that fiadjoe had come to him that he removed her to a girlfriend house,of which the father was presumably unaware,and assisted her in obtaining a false passport for flight out of the country.if the authorities were willing or able to protect this trokosi slave none of this flight and fear would have been necessary.
the bia selected two facts set forth in the state department report i the government of ghana outlawed trokosi practice and ritual bondage in and ii a organization has had success in liberating,counseling,and rehabilitating past victims of such bondage.emphasis added.this selective use of the state department report is misleading and does not constitute substantial evidence.
in the first place,the bia ignored other evidence in the record demonstrating continuation of trokosi slavery and the government unwillingness and inability to end it.the state department report itself confirms this continuation despite the legislation that banned customary servitude known as trokosi.
the ghanian constitution had for a long time prohibited such practices.every person has a right to personal liberty.no person shall be held in slavery and servitude or be required to perform forced labor.these provisions had had no effect on the trokosi cult.similarly the legislation outlawing trokosi has not succeeded in eliminating trokosi slavery.while it is true that certain organizations have succeeded in liberating and retraining approximately trokosi slaves,the state department report confirms that the practice remains very much alive 
trokosi,a traditional practice found among the ewe ethnic group and in part of the volta region,is an especially severe human rights abuse and an extremely serious violation of children and women rights.it is a system in which a young girl,sometimes under the age of,is made a slave to a fetish shrine for offenses allegedly committed by a member of the girl family.in rare instances,boys are offered.the belief is that,if someone in that family has committed a crime,such as stealing,members of the family may begin to die in large numbers unless a young girl is given to the local fetish shrine to atone for the offense.the girl becomes the property of the fetish priest,must work on the priest farm,and perform other labors for him.because they are the sexual property of the priests,most trokosi slaves have children by the priests.although the girls families must provide for their needs such as food,most are unable to do so.there are at least girls and women bound to various shrines in the trokosi system,a figure that does not include the slaves children.even when freed by her fetish priest from the more onerous aspects of her bondage,whether voluntarily or as a result of intervention by activists,a trokosi woman generally has few marketable skills and little hope of marriage and typically remains bound to the shrine for life by psychological and social pressure arising from a traditional belief that misfortune may befall a trokosi woman family or village if she abandons her obligations to the shrine.when a fetish slave dies,her family is expected to replace her with another young girl,thus perpetuating the bondage to the fetish shrine from generation to generation.
human rights organization are hopeful that ultimately trokosi practices can be stamped out,but they persist,and fiadjoe has to live in the present,not in a more hopeful future.pertinent to the fact that she can expect no help from the government authorities is the following observation contained in the state department report but not addressed by the bia the government has not prosecuted any practitioners of trokosi,and in august,a presidential aide criticized activists for being insensitive to indigenous cultural and religious beliefs and practices.
in light of fiadjoe own experiences and the documentary evidence in the record,we conclude that the bia finding that fiadjoe failed to establish that the government of ghana was either unwilling or unable to control her father sexual abuse is not supported by substantial evidence.
vii.conclusion 
the adverse credibility determinations of the ij and of the bia are not supported by substantial evidence,nor is the bia finding that fiadjoe failed to establish that the government of ghana was either unwilling or unable to control her father sexual abuse supported by substantial evidence.
we will grant the petition for review and remand the case to the bia for further remand to a different ij for a new hearing at which there may be received in evidence the documents that accompanied fiadjoe motion before the bia for reconsideration of its june,decision and evidence,if available,of continuing trokosi practices and governmental attempts to eradicate them and to protect trokosi victims.
while i would like to conclude otherwise,the majority approach to its review of the bia findings concerning government protection in ghana is,in my view,inconsistent with the deferential approach we are required to take in these cases.accordingly,i must dissent.
fiajdoe is a tragic story.she does not present the typical claim for asylum,in which a refugee seeks protection from her native government or from forces acting on the government behalf.instead,she recounts a history of physical and sexual abuse suffered at the hands of her father,allegedly in connection with her father activities as a traditional trokosi priest.though the grant of asylum has traditionally been used to protect immigrants fleeing government persecution,our laws are sensitive to the plight of individuals such as fiadjoe.as the majority explains,a private incident that rises to the level of persecution can create eligibility for asylum when it is committed by forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.gao ashcroft,cir.my difficulty with this case is that,try as i might,i can not the law requires us to say if we are to reverse the any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude that the ghanaian government is unable or unwilling to control her father.i can not say that here because there is what i consider to be ample evidence in the record to support the bia conclusion that,if the government had been informed of what fiadjoe claims her father did,it would have been willing and able to control him.the majority sidesteps this evidence in favor of other information that may cast doubt on the efficacy of ghana efforts,and holds that the presence of such evidence compels an opposite conclusion than that reached by the bia.it is simply not our charge to do that 
to establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past persecution,an applicant must show an incident,or incidents,that rise to the level of persecution that is on account of one of the statutorily protected grounds and is committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.gao ashcroft,cir emphasis added.whether an applicant has demonstrated past persecution or a fear of future persecution is a factual determination reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.see id.where an applicant seeks asylum based on private violence,whether the applicant native government is willing and able to control the alleged persecutors is a component of the broader persecution inquiry.thus,we must review the bia finding that fiadjoe failed to show that the government of ghana was unable or unwilling to control her father abuse in order to determine if that finding is supported by substantial evidence.
in dia ashcroft,cir en banc,we elaborated on the nature of substantial evidence review of an asylum claim 
thus,the question whether an agency determination is supported by substantial evidence is the same as the question whether a reasonable fact finder could make such a determination based upon the administrative record.if a reasonable fact finder could make a particular finding on the administrative record,then the finding is supported by substantial evidence.conversely,if no reasonable fact finder could make that finding on the administrative record,the finding is not supported by substantial evidence.
dia,at.we emphasized that our deference to the agency findings is conditioned upon support in the record,and we indicated that if the agency conclusion is not based on a specific,cogent reason,but instead,is based on speculation,conjecture,or an otherwise unsupported personal opinion,we will not uphold it because it will not have been supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would find adequate.in other words,it will not have been supported by substantial evidence.id.at.
the law requires applicants such as fiadjoe to bear the burden of proof of establishing her eligibility for asylum.see gao,at abdille ashcroft,cir.the bia found that fiadjoe failed to carry this burden with respect to a critical element of her claim,namely,that she had experienced persecution by forces the government of ghana was either unwilling or unable to control.
our task in reviewing the bia finding is not to determine whether we would have reached the same conclusion in the first instance.to the contrary,the substantial evidence standard of review is extremely deferential,setting a high hurdle by permitting the reversal of factual findings only when the record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.chen ashcroft,cir.we have further explained that for a petitioner to prevail on a challenge to the bia factual findings under the immigration and nationality act ina,the evidence on the issue in question must be so strong in the petitioner favor that in a civil trial the petitioner would be entitled to judgment on the issue as a matter of law.see chen,at citing ins,d.
under this standard,i believe that the majority has failed to accord proper deference to the bia findings on the issue of government protection in ghana.in concluding that fiadjoe had not met her burden of proof,the bia stated 
the respondent never sought the help of the authorities in ghana.the respondent claimed that her grandmother told the police of the respondent being beaten but that she declined to tell the authorities about the ritual sexual abuse due to shame.the respondent submitted evidence that the government of ghana outlawed trokosi practice and ritual bondage in and that a organization has had success in liberating,counseling,and rehabilitating past victims of such bondage.therefore,the respondent has not shown that the government of ghana would be unwilling or unable to protect her.
ar.the majority disagrees with the bia conclusions,but in so doing it fails adequately to address the record evidence supporting the bia findings and places disproportionate emphasis on anecdotal statements culled from various portions of the record.
the majority quotes the description of trokosi practices contained in the state department country report on human rights practices in ghana,which was also part of the record before the bia.the paragraph immediately following the excerpt quoted by the majority details ghana efforts 
in parliament passed legislation that banned the practice of trokosi in comprehensive legislation to protect women and children rights.human rights activists believe that the goal of eradicating the trokosi practice is achievable with the new law.ngo such as international needs,and government agencies like the chraj,have been campaigning against trokosi for several years and are familiar with the locations of the fetish shrines and the numbers of women and children enslaved.activists know the community leaders and fetish priests and,thus,know with whom to negotiate.the chraj and international needs have had some success in approaching village authorities and fetish priests at over of the major and minor shrines,winning the release of trokosi slaves to date and retraining them for new professions.the organizations continue to work for additional releases.the government has not prosecuted any practitioners of trokosi and in august,a presidential aide criticized activists for being insensitive to indigenous cultural and religious beliefs and practices.a local group,calling itself the troxovi institutional council troxovi is an alternate spelling for trokosi declared that trokosi,as defined by chraj and other human rights groups to be a form of ritual servitude,does not exist in the country.the group claimed that the practice of troxovi does exist but neither enslaves nor exploits anyone.the council also listed genuine troxovi shrines in ghana,describing them as educational institutions and as part of the afrikania religion.these claims were widely refuted by chiefs,the press,and ngos.
in light of this discussion,it is unclear to me how the majority can hold that no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the government of ghana would be willing and able to help fiadjoe.the fact that the parliament passed comprehensive legislation to protect women and children rights,and that the practice of trokosi was banned pursuant to this legislation,certainly provides evidence that the ghanaian authorities recognized the existence and nature of trokosi and were willing to take steps to combat it.the report statement that human rights organizations believe that the goal of eradicating trokosi is achievable with the new law also provides support for the bia conclusion that invoking the aid of ghanaian authorities would not have been futile.there is no basis in the record to believe that these human rights organizations were offering anything less than an honest assessment of the situation,and if as of they reasonably believed trokosi could be eradicated,then it is not for this court to suggest that the bia acted unreasonably in giving weight to their views.
the state department report also recounts empirical evidence in support of the view that the ghanaian government efforts were having significant success.specifically,ghana commission for human rights and administrative justice chraj,working with an ngo,had secured the release of approximately trokosi slaves and retrained them for new professions.according to the state department report,the chraj is an autonomous government commission established pursuant to the ghanaian constitution.thus,contrary to the implications of the majority opinion,the state department report indicates that ghana efforts were being implemented by a government agency acting in partnership with various ngos.according to that report,this collaborative effort relied heavily upon negotiation rather than direct confrontation as a means of aiding the victims of trokosi practices.by ignoring the chraj initiative,the majority dismisses the bia findings concerning ghana efforts,and wrongly equates the absence of criminal prosecution with an absence of effective aid for women threatened by trokosi practices.
the majority also challenges the significance of the state department description of ghana efforts by quoting a portion of the report that addresses in a more general sense the problem of violence against women in ghana.however,the concluding sentences of the paragraph quoted by the majority provide further support for the bia conclusion that fiadjoe had not shown that the government of ghana was unwilling or unable to protect her.the report states that legislation doubled the mandatory sentence for rape,and that in late 
the police administration established a women and juvenile unit to handle cases involving domestic violence,child abuse,and juvenile offenses.located in accra and kumasi,the unit works closely with the department of social welfare,fida,and the legal aid board.during the year,the accra branch of this unit recorded over cases,including defilement cases,rapes,cases of incest,indecent assaults,instances of assault and wife battery,abductions,and neglect cases.
ar.the majority does not recite this evidence,although it was part of the record before the bia.it reinforces my view that under the deferential substantial evidence standard,the record as a whole contains adequate support for the bia findings concerning the issue of government protection in ghana 
the majority also argues that fiadjoe own testimony shows that the government of ghana would have been unwilling or unable to help fiadjoe.i do not believe fiadjoe testimony concerning her grandmother can bear the weight the majority places upon it.fiadjoe affidavit and testimony are vague concerning what fiadjoe grandmother told the police,and the details that were allegedly provided could have left the police believing that fiadjoe situation involved a family dispute concerning excessive corporal punishment.
fiajdoe hearing testimony regarding this issue consists of the following exchange 
okay,did you ever try to go to the police yourself to tell them what was happening to you 
because of how they were telling my grandmother.
judge to fiadjoe 
because of what,
because they always tell my grandmother that he discipline and my grandmother,i full of shame to tell anybody my father is sleeping with me.
ar.fiadjoe affidavit submitted in support of her asylum application contains slightly more detail 
my grandmother told the police about these beatings.my grandmother told me the police only said that your father is just trying to discipline you.
in my grandmother went to the police after my father had poured boiling water on me when i refused to take his abuse.again,the police said this was a father right to discipline his children.
my grand mother did not tell the police that my father was sexually abusing me.it would shame our family and she could not do that.
in my view,particularly in light of the record evidence of ghana efforts,the limited information contained in fiadjoe affidavit and hearing testimony can not reasonably be relied upon as determinative of what the ghanaian authorities would have done had they been informed of fiadjoe father abuse.the majority acknowledges that the ghanaian authorities were never informed of the sexual aspect of the abuse,but fails to acknowledge the significance of this fact.the most that can be extracted from fiadjoe affidavit and testimony is that the local police failed to investigate when her grandmother twice told them that fiadjoe was being physically abused by her father.however,fiadjoe has not sought asylum simply because she was a victim of child abuse.fiadjoe brief,consistent with the requirements of the ina,argues that she was persecuted on account of her membership in a particular social group,which she defines as ghanaian women from the ewe tribe in the volta region who have been subjected to or face being subjected to the practice of trokosi and who oppose this practice.see a a.thus,it is specifically the sexual aspect of her father abuse,combined with its ostensibly religious motivation,that has permitted fiadjoe to seek asylum as one who has suffered persecution on account of a protected ground.it seems anomalous to hold,as the majority does,that fiadjoe native government would not protect her from persecution inflicted on account of her social group,when the ghanaian government was not informed of fiadjoe membership in this social group or of the nature and extent of the abuse that has given rise to her claim for asylum 
notwithstanding any shortcomings in fiadjoe testimony,i am willing to assume arguendo that a reasonable factfinder could rely on this testimony to conclude that fiadjoe had shown that the government of ghana was unwilling or unable to protect her.the majority,however,holds that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to take this approach.based on all of the record evidence discussed above,i simply can not agree,and thus i believe it is inappropriate to invoke fiadjoe testimony as the basis for displacing the bia judgment with our own 
fiadjoe account rightfully evokes our sympathies,and i would be less concerned with the majority approach if we had the luxury of deciding each case based solely on our own assessment of the facts underlying a petitioner claim.however,that is not an approach we are permitted to take as an appellate court reviewing agency action,and i am concerned by the implications of the majority approach for future immigration appeals.our court has little precedential authority evaluating asylum claims based upon alleged private persecution that a foreign government is purportedly unwilling or unable to control.i fear the majority approach sets us down the wrong path for reviewing these difficult issues.by emphasizing only what it finds in the record to cast doubt on the effectiveness of ghana efforts,the majority overlooks or discounts the record evidence to the contrary.this approach risks a deluge of claims from applicants who have faced private violence and who can argue that a lack of resources constrains the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts in their native countries.it also raises the troubling specter of frequent judicial pronouncements condemning the law enforcement practices of foreign governments,an outcome our highly deferential standard o
