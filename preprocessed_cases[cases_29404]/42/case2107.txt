in a consolidated appeal,petitioner selma alizoti appeals both the denial of her motion to reopen by the board of immigration appeals bia and the denial of her motion to reconsider by the bia.this is another difficult immigration case in which we must resist the temptation to impose our own sense of justice as if this were a de novo review.we affirm the bia on both matters.
petitioner is a native citizen of albania and was admitted to the united states on a nonimmigrant visa in august.petitioner overstayed her visa and was served with a notice to appear in september.she conceded removability but filed for asylum,protection under the convention against torture,withholding of removal,and voluntary departure in the alternative.an immigration judge ij denied these claims on january,the bia affirmed that decision on may,but granted days voluntary departure.in the meantime,petitioner married citizen robert king on november,and king filed a petition for alien relative with the department of homeland security dhs on behalf of appellant based on their marriage.dhs took no immediate action on the.after the filing of the and on december,petitioner filed a application to adjust status to a permanent resident with dhs.the should have been filed with the bia as part of a motion to reopen because she was in immigration proceedings,which petitioner discovered during a meeting with dhs on may,regarding her.on that basis,the was denied.
on june,petitioner timely filed a motion to reopen with the bia,requesting that her case be reopened and remanded to the ij for any further proceedings.significantly,attached to her motion were the dhs notification regarding her may interview with dhs,a copy of her denied,and a copy of her showing her legal entry into the united states.on june,petitioner filed with the bia a sworn affidavit reciting the facts of her marriage and the mistaken filing of the with the dhs,and stating as fact that her had been approved.petitioner evidently believed that her had been approved because dhs had conducted an interview with her regarding her,which would be unusual if the underlying had not yet been approved.after being contacted by petitioner counsel,dhs approved king on october.
on october,the bia denied the motion to reopen because there had been no prima facie showing of eligibility for the relief sought because no approval of the had been attached to the motion to reopen.petitioner appeals that decision.significantly,during the bia proceedings on the motion to reopen,dhs offered evidence that at least one of the statements made by petitioner in her sworn affidavit was untrue her had in fact not been approved at the time she swore out and filed her affidavit.
on november,petitioner moved for the bia to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen,arguing her affidavit and attached were sufficient to entitle her to relief and that dhs had now found that her marriage was valid by approving the.the bia denied the motion to reconsider on december,stating that the approval notice of the was new evidence which could not be considered in a motion to reconsider and that even if appellant motion were styled a motion to reopen with new evidence,that motion would be denied because it is a second motion to reopen,which is barred by statute and regulation.petitioner also appeals that decision.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,which authorizes this court to review final orders of removal.however,this court lacks jurisdiction to review any issues that have not been raised and administratively exhausted below.see d ramani ashcroft,cir.this court reviews the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.abudu,d daneshvar ashcroft,cir.the court also reviews the bia denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.sswajje ashcroft,cir.the bia abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily,irrationally,or contrary to law.babai,cir.the supreme court has made clear that reopening is discretionary with the bia and that the bia retains broad discretion to grant or deny such motions.doherty,d.because the bia has such broad discretion,a party seeking reopening or reconsideration bears a heavy burden.id.
petitioner first challenges the bia denial of her motion to reopen.the bia found that the evidence she presented in her motion to reopen failed to establish a prima facie case of her statutory eligibility for adjustment of status.a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief is required in motions to reopen.see c yousif,cir a motion to reopen should not be granted unless the petitioner makes a prima facie showing that the statutory requirements for the underlying relief have been met.prima facie evidence,according the bia,is evidence that reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied.matter of,i n,bia.according to c,a petitioner filing a motion to reopen for adjudication of her adjustment of status application must submit a completed application and all supporting documentation.see also konstantinova,cir stating that a completed application for the relief being sought through a motion to reopen is required,alongside all supporting documentation.
here,petitioner presented evidence that raised questions about whether she could establish a prima facie case of eligibility for relief.she submitted the dhs notification regarding her may interview with dhs,a copy of her denied,a copy of her showing her legal entry into the united states,and a sworn affidavit reciting the facts of her marriage.however,she failed to include a variety of documentary evidence the bia could have considered on the motion to reopen any documentary evidence that her husband was a united states citizen,any documentary evidence that petitioner and king were married,or any documentary evidence that the visa petition had been filed,much less approved.furthermore,dhs presented evidence that at least one portion of petitioner sworn affidavit was untrue where she stated unequivocally that her had been approved.on this record,we can not conclude that the bia abused its discretion when it found that petitioner failed to present a prima facie case for relief in her motion to reopen.
petitioner next challenges the denial of her motion to reconsider.as part of her motion to reconsider,petitioner included the notice of approval of her.section of the immigration and nationality act ina states that motions to reconsider shall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.c c.the purpose of a motion to reconsider is not to present new evidence,but rather to provide an opportunity for the petitioner to argue that the ij or bia erred as a matter of law or fact.see,cir.
however,when new evidence is submitted as part of a motion to reconsider,the bia construes such motions as motions to reopen.see matter of cerna,i n,bia noting that when a motion seeks the opportunity to submit evidence that was not previously a matter of the record,it is properly construed as a motion to reopen,whereas when a motion alleges specific errors in the previous decision,it is properly construed as a motion to reconsider.if the bia were to consider new evidence as part of petitioner motion to reconsider,petitioner motion would be a second motion to reopen,which is barred by statute and regulation.see c a an alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section emphasis added c.as it turns out,when the bia denied petitioner motion to reopen,it may have been incorrect in presuming that petitioner marriage was invalid and that she was guilty of an intentional misstatement of fact when she indicated that her had been approved,but that error could be corrected in this case only by the consideration of new evidence,the notice of approval of the,which is not allowed as part of a motion to reconsider.
petitioner further argues that the bia should have considered her motion to reconsider as a supplement to her initial motion to reopen.such an approach may have been reasonable and within the bia discretion.however,that discretion vests firmly with the bia in these circumstances,and our review is limite
