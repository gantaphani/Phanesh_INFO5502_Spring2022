boutros chafic habchy,a native and citizen of lebanon,petitions this court for review of two decisions of the board of immigration appeals the board denying him relief under this country asylum laws.first,he argues that the board erred in affirming the denial of his motion to reconsider a decision of the immigration judge ij,in which the ij refused to reopen a removal order on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.second,he argues that the board erred in refusing to reopen his case on the basis of changed country conditions in lebanon between and.we deny the petition for review.
background 
habchy entered the united states at the miami international airport in.he lacked proper documentation,and he immediately requested asylum.habchy claimed that he had suffered past persecution at the hands of hizballah,who detained him and accused him of aiding israel.habchy also claimed that he feared future persecution on the basis of his religion christianity and his political beliefs,whether real or imputed.after a venue transfer,his case was set for a hearing before an ij in louis on november.
habchy counsel attended the hearing,but habchy did not.habchy counsel moved for a continuance to locate him,but the ij denied the motion and ordered habchy removed in absentia under c.one month later,habchy made a pro se motion to reopen his proceedings with the ij.he claimed lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel because his lawyer had failed to provide him with notice of the hearing.while there was no question that his lawyer had received notice of the hearing,thus satisfying the regulatory requirements under c,habchy argued that the lawyer had not relayed the notice to him.according to habchy,she sent him a letter regarding his case that did not provide the hearing date,and she failed to mention it when habchy was in her office the day before the hearing was scheduled to take place.
the ij denied the motion on procedural grounds,noting that habchy failed to satisfy two of the three requirements for motions to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel as described by the board in matter of lozada,wl.in particular,habchy failed to attach an affidavit setting forth relevant facts and the scope and terms of his representation with his former counsel,and he failed to make a formal complaint regarding her ineffective assistance with the appropriate bar association,or at least to explain why he had not taken such action.habchy did fully satisfy one lozada requirement by informing his lawyer of the allegations and giving her an opportunity to respond,as evidenced by the attachment of her affidavit to his motion.
habchy did not appeal this ruling to the board.instead,he obtained legal counsel and filed another motion with the ij,which he styled as a motion to reconsider the denial of his initial motion to reopen.he filed it days after his removal in absentia,days after filing his pro se motion to reopen,and days after the ij ruled on his motion to reopen.in this second motion,habchy purported to cure the defects in his pro se motion to reopen with materials that would satisfy the lozada requirements,including a copy of a letter he filed with the missouri bar association describing the events,an affidavit setting forth the terms of the representation,and an affidavit of his former counsel.the ij denied his motion on three alternative grounds it was untimely,given the limit on filing motions to reconsider,even if it was timely,it alleged no error of fact or law as required by motions to reconsider,and even if the ij were to construe it as a proper second motion to reopen,which he would have to do in order to consider the new evidentiary materials,it was not clear whether the letter that habchy sent to the state bar constituted a complaint within the meaning of lozada.id.at.
habchy appealed this ruling to the board,and it affirmed on march,solely on the ground that his second motion was untimely.shortly thereafter,habchy filed a motion to reopen before the board,alleging that country conditions in lebanon had materially changed between and.the board denied this motion on the merits,finding that habchy had failed to make an adequate showing of changed conditions during that time period.
habchy filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri on may,same day that president bush signed the real id act of into the district court transferred the case to this court pursuant to the act.real id act of,stat,c codified at note.
ii.discussion 
we review decisions of the board denying motions to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion.gonzales,cir de jimenez ashcroft,cir this court may find an abuse of discretion where a decision is without rational explanation,departs from established policies,invidiously discriminates against a particular race or group,or where the agency fails to consider all factors presented by the alien or distorts important aspects of the claim,at quotation omitted.we review constitutional challenges to immigration proceedings de novo.shoaira ashcroft,cir.
habchy makes three broad claims on this appeal.first,he argues that the board abused its discretion in failing to reopen his case because his counsel failure to notify him of the hearing was an exceptional circumstance that warranted rescission of his in absentia removal order under b c,e.habchy also argues that these same facts rendered his removal proceedings fundamentally unfair,and thus deprived him of due process.finally,he argues that the board abused its discretion in denying his later motion to reopen on the basis of changed country conditions.we examine each of these claims in turn.
abuse of discretion in denying habchy motion to reconsider 
habchy first argues that the board erred in upholding the ij denial of his motion to reconsider the ij refusal to reopen his case on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.with regard to removal orders entered in absentia,aliens are allowed to file one motion to reopen removal proceedings within days of the order of removal.b ii.they are also allowed to file one motion to reconsider within thirty days of a final order of removal.b.motions to reopen must state new,material facts motions to reconsider must specify the errors of fact or law in the immigration judge prior decision.b.ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of an in absentia removal order.see in re,wl see also b c i,e authorizing the rescission of an in absentia removal order when exceptional circumstances caused the alien failure to appear asaba ashcroft,cir recognizing that the board interpretation of exceptional circumstances includes ineffective assistance of counsel reyes ashcroft,cir same.this does not excuse aliens from following proper procedures for proving these exceptional circumstances,however,and the ij retains the discretion to refuse to reopen the case.b asaba,at.
in lozada,as noted above,the board specified the three procedural requirements for motions to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.first,the movant must support his claim with an affidavit alleging facts relevant to the ineffective assistance.lozada,at.second,the movant must inform the former counsel of the allegation and give her an opportunity to respond.id.finally,if the ineffective assistance would amount to a violation of legal or ethical responsibilities,the movant must show whether he has filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation,and if not,why not.id.the board considers these further requirements for such motions necessary if we are to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before the board.id.we have upheld the board application of lozada to these motions.see,at.
habchy initial motion to reopen was timely,and included the new,material facts of his counsel allegedly ineffective assistance.it did not,however,meet the requirements of lozada as the ij noted,habchy did not include an affidavit relating the relevant facts or any evidence that habchy had filed a complaint with bar authorities,nor any explanation as to why he had not.his motion to reconsider the decision regarding the motion to reopen was untimely in that he filed it days after the ij denied the motion to reopen,well beyond the time limit for motions to reconsider.
habchy acknowledges these facts and applicable law,but nonetheless argues that the board erred in rejecting his motion to reconsider as untimely.specifically,he argues that the lack of notice due to his counsel ineffective assistance deprived him of an opportunity to present his case,the ij should not have applied the board allegedly byzantine procedural requirements to his initial motion to reopen considering that he filed it pro se,and the ij should have considered his motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen.under this argument,habchy contends that the ij should have handled his claim in one of four ways.first,he could have relaxed the lozada requirements for habchy initial motion to reopen and granted it on the basis of substantial compliance.second,the ij could have construed habchy motion to reconsider as a supplement to his original,motion to reopen.third,he could have found that the two motions combined to form a single lozada compliant motion to reopen on the date that habchy filed the second motion,which would have been timely filed if the ij tolled the period between the filing of habchy initial motion to reopen and the ij ruling that this initial motion did not comply with lozada.fourth,the ij could have simply found that habchy filed two motions to reopen and applied equitable tolling to both the time and numerical limitations on his second motion.the ij failure to follow any of these options,according to habchy,constituted an abuse of discretion.we address habchy four proposed courses of action below.
application of lozada to habchy initial motion to reopen 
habchy makes a reasonable argument that the ij should not have applied lozada mechanistically,and some courts agree.see,ins,cir t he lozada requirements are not sacrosanct.our circuit has not ruled on whether a strict application of those requirements could constitute an abuse of discretion in certain circumstances,and we need not do so here.at the very least,an ij does not abuse his discretion in requiring substantial compliance with the lozada requirements when it is necessary to serve the overall purposes of is,to discourag e baseless allegations and provide a basis for determining the merits of an claim when those merits are not evident from the record.lozada,at ins,cir noting that the lozada factors are not rigidly applied when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance,at refusing to require lozada compliance when t he hearing record and briefing make it perfectly clear that an alien received ineffective assistance of counsel.
here,the hearing record is ambiguous.the mere fact that habchy was absent does not present a prima facie case of ineffective assistance,especially because habchy lawyer appeared and actually asked for a continuance to locate him.habchy motion to reopen makes a prima facie case,but it also leaves some doubt as to where the blame for his lack of notice lies.in particular,there is some question as to whether the lawyer included a copy of the notice with the rest of the documents she sent to habchy prior to his hearing as she alleges she ordered her secretary to do and habchy simply misplaced or ignored it,or whether the lawyer or her secretary failed to send the notice,as habchy alleges.substantial compliance with lozada under these circumstances would have included some evidence that habchy lodged a formal complaint against the lawyer,or at least some explanation why habchy did not take such action,because it would have added strength to his allegations that the lack of notice was attributable to his lawyer negligence rather than his own.thus,we find that the ij did not abuse his discretion in denying habchy initial motion to reopen for failure to comply with lozada.
characterization of the motion to reconsider 
we also reject habchy proposition that the ij abused his discretion in failing to characterize his motion to reconsider as a mere supplement to his timely but deficient motion to reopen.the ij was free to interpret it in that fashion,of course,and either he or the attorney general could have reopened habchy immigration proceedings on their own motion at any time.b.that may have been the most appropriate course of action in this case.but that discretion lies with the government,and the asylum regulations gave habchy no explicit right to supplement his motion.even if we were to imply one,the ij was well within his discretion to refuse to allow habchy to supplement that motion when his purported attempt to do so came more than six months after filing the motion to reopen and more than four months after the ij made his decision on that motion.
equitable tolling 
habchy arguments for equitable for tolling of time limitations alone if the ij should have construed both motions as a single,lozada compliant motion to reopen at the time he filed the latter motion or for tolling of both time and numerical limitations if the ij should have construed his motion to reconsider as a second motion to reopen raise a number of issues of first impression for this circuit.for example,habchy would have this court decide whether the board may err in construing a motion in the same manner as the movant titled it,whether the board must apply equitable tolling of time and numerical limitations upon motions to reopen in some situations,and whether an alien choice to proceed pro se dictates the stringency with which the board may apply its procedural requirements.we need not reach those issues here because habchy claim fails in any event the facts of his case would not warrant equitable tolling.
in those circuits that recognize the sparingly invoked doctrine of equitable tolling for claims,jobe ins,cir en banc quotation omitted,aliens must exercise due diligence in discovering the deception,fraud,or error giving rise to the ineffective assistance of counsel.iturribarria ins,cir.in cases where the argument has prevailed,a court has excused an alien tardy motion to reopen because of his attorneys fraud and misrepresentations regarding the status of his case during the time in which he could have filed such a motion,borges gonzales,cir,or the attorneys active concealment of their own ineffectiveness.iturribarria,at.habchy case presents a much different fact pattern.here,habchy clearly knew of the allegedly ineffective assistance of his counsel almost immediately after the ij ordered him removed in absentia he filed his initial motion to reopen within a month afterward.he thus can not argue that the time limitations to file motions to reopen should not apply here.he actually filed a motion to reopen well within those limits.
the crux of habchy argument,then,is that he lost an opportunity to reopen his case because of his own ineffectiveness when proceeding pro se,which led to his initial failure to file a motion to reopen.thus,habchy essentially contends that we should toll the time and numerical limitations upon motions to reopen from the time of the removal order until the time he abandoned his pro se strategy and obtained new counsel.the ninth circuit has allowed tolling of time and numerical limits even after an alien files a motion,at.in that case,however,the court noted that the alien received ineffective assistance of counsel for both his initial claim and in filing his first motion.id.thus,because ineffective assistance had resulted both in an order of removal and in the waste of his one permissible motion,and because the alien could not have reasonably discovered the ineffective assistance until after a motion to reopen would be both,the court required the board to apply equitable tolling.id.
here,by contrast,habchy does not contend that he received ineffective assistance in filing his motion to reopen indeed,he opted to waive his statutory right to counsel and claims to have received no assistance at all.we sympath
