raul quijada coronado petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision finding him inadmissible and denying his application for cancellation of removal.coronado argues that the bia erred in concluding that he had suffered two prior convictions for possession of a controlled substance prohibited under the federal controlled substances act csa.see a a i ii.coronado further argues that the bia erred in failing to address his constitutional claims.
we hold that the statute under which coronado was convicted,california health safety code a,is a divisible statute,and thus,we apply the modified categorical approach in analyzing coronado prior convictions.see descamps united states,stating that the modified categorical approach applies only to prior convictions under a divisible statute,one that sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.under that approach,the government satisfied its burden of proving that coronado was twice convicted of possessing methamphetamine,a controlled substance listed in the csa.therefore,the bia did not err in finding coronado inadmissible based on his prior convictions.
however,because the bia failed to address coronado due process claims,which allege ineffective assistance of counsel and bias by the immigration judge ij,we remand to the bia for consideration of these claims in the first instance.we dismiss coronado unexhausted equal protection claim for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
coronado,a native and citizen of mexico,became a legal permanent resident of the united states in.in,he was charged in state court with possession of methamphetamine in violation of california health safety code a.according to the state court certified electronic docket in case,he pleaded guilty to count,the only charge in the criminal complaint.in december,the court entered judgment against coronado as to count the conviction.
on september,coronado applied for admission to the united states after making a trip to mexico.upon checking his criminal records,border patrol officers learned of the conviction.on that same day,coronado was paroled into the united states,and the department of homeland security dhs served him with a notice to appear.in may,dhs served him with a form i,which alleged,among other things,that coronado was subject to removal due to his conviction in for possession of methamphetamine.
in december,while in removal proceedings,coronado was again charged in state court with possession of methamphetamine in violation of california health safety code a.according to the court minutes in case no,on march,coronado pleaded guilty to count a,the only charge in the criminal complaint the conviction.
during his removal proceedings,coronado denied having been convicted of methamphetamine possession.to prove the conviction,the government submitted the criminal complaint and the certified electronic docket of that case.further,to prove the conviction,the government submitted documents that included the criminal complaint and the court minutes of that case.
the ij found coronado inadmissible under a a i ii due to his convictions for possession of a controlled substance listed in the csa.further,after weighing the relevant factors,the ij denied coronado application for cancellation of removal.
appearing pro se,coronado appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij finding that coronado was inadmissible based on his prior drug convictions.the bia also affirmed the ij denial of cancellation of removal on the ground that coronado undesirability as a permanent resident outweighed the positive equities.coronado timely petitioned for review.
in his opening brief to this court,coronado did not challenge the use of the modified categorical approach with regard to his prior convictions.instead,he argued that the bia erred because the charging papers alone were insufficient to prove that he was convicted of possessing a controlled substance listed in the csa.
while coronado petition for review was pending,the supreme court issued a decision in descamps united states,which clarified the circumstances in which the modified categorical approach may be applied.the parties filed letters pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure j,taking contrary positions as to the applicability of the modified categorical approach to coronado state court convictions.the government argued that a is a divisible statute,whereas coronado contended that the statute is not necessarily divisible.

discussion 
under a a i ii,any alien convicted of,or who admits to having committed ii a violation of or conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,is inadmissible.here,coronado challenges the bia finding of inadmissibility based on his two prior convictions for possessing methamphetamine,in violation of california health safety code a.thus,pursuant to a a i ii,the government had the burden of proving that coronado criminal conviction was for possession of a substance that is listed under california law and the csa schedules.see ruiz vidal gonzales,cir.if the full range of conduct covered by a falls within the csa schedules,then coronado conviction is categorically a removable offense and our inquiry is over.alanis alvarado holder,cir.
california health safety code a provides 
except as authorized by law every person who possesses any controlled substances which is classified in schedule iii,iv,or v,and which is not a narcotic drug,specified in subdivision d of section,except paragraphs,and of subdivision d,specified in paragraph of subdivision c of section,specified in paragraph or of subdivision f of section,or specified in subdivision d,e,or f of section shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for a period of not more than one year or pursuant to subdivision h of section of the penal code.
by comparison,the csa defines a controlled substance as a drug or other substance,or immediate precursor,included in schedule i,ii,iii,iv,or v of part b of this subchapter.in turn,the schedules are codified in and revised annually in et.see,a.
the text of the relevant statutes is not particularly helpful here because both a and the csa define offenses by reference to other statutes.nevertheless,as laid out in appendix,the substances barred by a and the csa are nearly identical.indeed,khat catha edulis is one of the only substances that violates a but not the csa see cal.health safety code a prohibiting substances specified in california health safety code d,e,or f cal.health safety code d prohibiting k hat,which includes all parts of the plant classified botanically as catha edulis see also,united states hassan,cir khat itself is not a controlled substance under united states law.united states caseer,cir n either the nor the code of federal regulations refers to catha edulis,commonly known as khat.
this one difference is sufficient because the full range of conduct covered by california health safety code a does not fall within the csa schedules,and as such,coronado conviction is not a categorically removable offense accordingly,we must consider whether we may use the modified categorical approach to determine whether coronado was convicted of a removable offense under a a i ii.cheuk fung s yong,at.
in descamps,the supreme court resolved a circuit split regarding whether the modified categorical approach is appropriate when the indivisible elements of a statute target a broader swath of conduct than a corresponding generic offense.at.the supreme court answered in the negative,clarifying that the modified categorical appr
