petitioners appeal the board of immigration appeals bia reversal of an immigration judge decision to grant asylum.the immigration judge found that the petitioners were credible and subject to past persecution in their home country of peru.the immigration judge further found that evidence of changed country conditions did not overcome the presumption of a fear of future persecution.the bia,however,concluded that the immigration judge failed to determine if the past persecution occurred due to a protected statutory basis.the bia proceeded to determine that any past persecution occurred due to the petitioners wealth rather than a protected statutory basis such as political opinion.the bia also made an alternative finding that,even if persecution occurred due to a statutory basis,changed country conditions removed any objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.
regarding the issue of past persecution,we reverse.the administrative record compels the conclusion that the petitioners suffered persecution due at least in part to a statutory basis,namely,imputed political opinion.further,in reaching its alternative finding on the issue of changed country conditions,the bia failed to place the burden of proof on the immigration and naturalization service ins now the department of homeland security,dhs to show that changed country conditions overcame the presumption of a fear of future persecution.accordingly,we remand to the bia for reconsideration on the issue of changed country conditions.
the immigration judge specifically found the petitioners credible.he based his decision to grant asylum,in part,on his credibility determination.although the bia reversed the immigration judge ultimate conclusions,it did not reject his credibility findings.accordingly,we review the record and set forth our detailed recitation of the facts in a light that reflects these credibility findings.
lead petitioner thays xinia guerrero de brenner de brenner was born in and comes from a peruvian family of eight that was wealthy by local standards.her mother was a professor of nursing,and her family owned a cocoa plantation and local shoe store in the city of ayacucho.they also owned a hotel in the nearby coastal city of ica.
in,guerrillas with a marxist,revolutionary,terrorist group known as sendero luminoso shining path targeted her family.the shining path originated near ayacucho around.de brenner described the shining path as a group whose goal was to take from the rich and give to the poor.from until as late as,de brenner family received direct threats,some of which were extortionate demands,from shining path guerrillas.some of the threats were notes signed by abimael guzman,leader of the shining path.strangers followed and monitored the family,and the threats described the family activities and movements with great detail.in the demands,the guerrillas sought financial and material assistance food,medicine,shoes.for a time,the family complied.when the family refused to comply,the guerillas threatened to disappear the family children.de brenner mother resigned from her position as a nursing professor because of the threats.in some of the threats the shining path guerillas mentioned de brenner,the oldest daughter of the family,by name.in other threats,they claimed the family was associated with the party in peru.
also in,the guerrillas published de brenner parents names along with the names of approximately thirty other business or property owners on a blacklist posted throughout ayacucho.according to de brenner,the blacklist stated death to the traitors and death to those who do cooperate.in addition,the blacklist stated that the shining path deemed the persons on the list to be not advancing the lives of the masses or merely as being uncooperative.
even before the guerillas published the blacklist,they had murdered numerous people in ayacucho.after de brenner family saw the list,they were afraid to leave their home.they frequently sought,and sometimes received,police protection.police protection was often unavailable,however,because the police were occupied fighting the shining path guerrillas.eventually,shining path guerrillas infiltrated the ranks of the army and the police and confusion reigned.the guerrillas murdered some of the people named on the blacklist.in,the guerrillas published another blacklist that contained de brenner parents names.de brenner name was not on either the or blacklists.
although the guerrillas did not physically harm de brenner or her immediate family,they burned her family cocoa plantation and turned it into a cocaine plantation,destroyed a lumber business that her family had tried to develop,tortured and killed her mother cousins,and tortured,raped and killed a number of family friends and acquaintances in and around ayacucho.in the affidavit that accompanied her application for asylum,de brenner reported the details surrounding much of the shining path savagery towards her family and friends in ayacucho.she described the torture,castration,and murder by skinning of prominent ayacucho citizens in front of their families as well as crucifixions and less dramatic assassinations.
in,de brenner left the family home in ayacucho because of the threats and violence and moved to arequipa,peru,to live with other relatives for five months.when the situation temporarily settled down in ayacucho,she returned home.after three months,however,because of escalating violence,she moved to lima to live with family friends.eventually,all members of the family moved away from ayacucho.the threats continued,however,as the shining path movement expanded from ayacucho to encompass more of peru.
while in lima,de brenner maintained a low profile and met few people.she did,however,meet and marry roberto leonardo,a close friend of the family that hosted her in lima.de brenner and brenner had their first child,romina mariana romina brenner does not claim that he received any threats from shining path guerrillas before he married de brenner.he did lose a job when a that he worked for suffered a loss of business due to shining path threats and bomb scares.he later worked as a sales representative for pepsico.for pepsico,he had to travel with police protection to areas of peru that the government labeled red zones based on high levels of shining path activity.he stated that shining path guerrillas targeted employees of pepsico,because it was a corporation with ties outside peru,and the shining path was opposed to corporations with ties outside peru.
while still in lima,de brenner began work as a secretary in a bank.she eventually became the executive secretary to the general manager.the general manager was an active,senior member of the apra,the party in power.the apra opposed the shining path.shining path guerrillas targeted bank employees and members of the apra in particular.
de brenner claimed that the frequency and tenor of the threats escalated because of my career with the bank,banco minero de peru,and my husband career with pepsico,an imperialist corporation.she claimed that,after she began her work at the bank and brenner began his work at pepsico,the shining path guerillas more frequently directed their threats towards her and her husband rather than her parents.she stated in her affidavit 
sendero luminoso threats stated that they knew where i was working,what position i held.they stated that i was working for the apra aprista,the party in power.they spoke badly about the government and wrote that roberto and i were guilty of the same misdeeds as the government exploiting the poor and promoting a capitalist,imperialistic society.
sendero luminoso also insisted that i was actually working for the party as the personal secretary to the apra member and banco minero de peru general manger rivas.they went so far as to charge that i was appointed to my job because of my social standing.i was his secretary but of the bank,not his personal secretary and not a secretary for the party.
in,de brenner,brenner,and romina left peru and came to the united states under visas that listed them as nonimmigrant visitors for pleasure.their visas authorized a stay in the united states.they joined brenner cousin,who lived in minneapolis.after de brenner,brenner,and romina arrived in the united states,they remained until the present time with no departures.de brenner and brenner had a second child in,daniel,who was born in the united states.
the ins instituted removal proceedings against the.de brenner,brenner and december.the petitioners conceded removability,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.an immigration judge received extensive documentation regarding the country conditions in peru and affidavits from the adult petitioners.in addition,the immigration judge held an evidentiary hearing on april.de brenner provided extensive and detailed testimony,brenner testified,and the attorney for the ins chose not to either witness.
de brenner explained that some members of her family still live in peru,and have received no threats since approximately.in the last threat,shining path guerrillas sought aid,but her family ignored the request with no adverse consequences.other members of her family left peru and sought asylum in other countries.
as noted above,the immigration judge found de brenner and brenner credible.he stated 
the court has no real reason to dispute the credibility of the respondents.their testimony throughout their dealings with the immigration service and this court has been consistent.the bulk of the testimony comes from the female respondent,detailing her own family history of problems starting in ayacucho in the early and continuing up to the time that the family left peru in.the court finds this testimony credible,based on the observation of the witnesses,and also based on the consistency of the respondents stories with the conditions in peru.the court will accordingly find the witnesses credible 
her testimony is clear that her family was wealthy by peruvian standards.as a result of the family being and owning several businesses,they were targeted for threats of violence by the shining path.the court feels that the evidence is overwhelming that the shining path is one of the most violent terrorist organizations in the world in the last years.the fact that the respondent family was targeted because of their wealth and business activities is not surprising in light of the documented activities of shining path.shining path was a marxist revolutionary organization seeking to overthrow the government and economy of peru to replace it with a revolutionary peasant states sic.it is very credible that the respondent and her family would have received the threats she describes.
the immigration judge went on to find that the family experienced past persecution and therefore,held a fear of future persecution.he also found that country conditions were not sufficiently changed to rebut the presumption of a fear of future persecution that arises from a showing of past persecution.the immigration judge discussed changed country conditions at length.
the record before the immigration judge included material from a human rights watch world report,a state department country profile on peru,a state department country report on peru,a state department country report on peru and various other articles and reports dated through april.the immigration judge noted that these sources agreed generally that the peruvian government under president fujimori had captured abimael guzman,leader of the shining path,and greatly reduced the ranks of shining path rebels.in fact,president fujimori campaign against the shining path resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of emergency or red zones and a partially successful containment of remaining shining path members in rural areas.the immigration judge found,however,that the documentary evidence still showed substantial shining path activity as well as uncertainty surrounding ongoing presidential elections that raised the possibility of instability and a renewal of power for the shining path.the immigration judge noted in particular several murders by shining path guerrillas in,an attack by a group of forty rebels in,and the assassination of low level community officials and leaders of social movements in the first half of.the immigration judge noted that some attacks occurred in the month before he rendered his opinion.
because the immigration judge ultimately determined that the petitioners held a fear of future persecution based on their past persecution and insufficiently changed country conditions,he granted asylum.he did not address the alternative forms of relief of withholding removal or relief under article iii of the convention against torture.
the ins appealed to the bia.the bia accepted the immigration judge findings regarding credibility and regarding the petitioners unrebutted assertions about the acts of past persecution.the bia found,however,that the immigration judge finding of past persecution was based on wealth rather than a statutorily protected basis such as imputed political opinion.the bia also determined in the alternative that changed country conditions overcame the presumption of an objectively reasonable,fear of future persecution.
in reaching this conclusion regarding changed country conditions,the bia noted several factors.first,the bia emphasized that several members of de brenner family remained in peru and were not harmed by the shining path.second,the bia emphasized that the last threat members of de brenner family received in peru was a threat and demand letter from the shining path.this threat resulted in no harm to the family even after the family refused to comply with the demands.third,the bia emphasized the general success that president fujimori regime enjoyed in its fight against the shining path.finally,the bia explained that president fujimori regime diminished remaining shining path forces to such an extent that ongoing acts of violence were limited to attacks on persons considered key targets or attacks in remote areas of the country.
the petitioners filed a motion to reconsider in which they asked the bia to reopen the case and reconsider its position.the petitioners argued that the bia committed legal error when it failed to apply a analysis and consider the possibility that shining path guerrillas persecuted the petitioners due to both their wealth and their imputed political opinions.the petitioners also urged the bia to examine additional evidence regarding changed country conditions.the bia considered the new evidence but rejected the motion,stating,e ven though the shining path members may have believed that the respondent was affiliated with the party in peru,we believe that the impetus for her difficulties with the guerrillas was her alleged wealth,as we stated in our opinion.this appeal followed.
to be eligible for asylum,an applicant must show that he or she is a refugee.a refugee is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to her country of origin because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.where there has been persecution on account of political opinion,it does not matter if the applicant actually holds the political opinion that the persecutor attributes to her.rather,we consider the political views the persecutor rightly or in error attributes to a victim.if the persecutor attributed a political opinion to the victim,and acted upon the attribution,this imputed view becomes the applicant political opinion as required under the act.sangha ins,cir see also,ins,cir finding that shining path guerillas imputed a political opinion to a leader of a street vendors association and based their persecution of the street vendor on this imputed opinion ravindran ins,cir an imputed political opinion,whether correctly or incorrectly attributed,may constitute a reason for political persecution within the meaning of the act.
further,persecution due to a statutorily protected ground may provide a basis for a finding of refugee status even though other,nonprotected criteria might have provided additional motivation for the persecutor actions.see tarubac ins,cir
