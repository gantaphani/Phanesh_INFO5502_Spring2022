fernandez taveras,a native and citizen of the dominican republic,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in february.he was one year old at the time,and has since left the country only twice once at age five and again at age thirteen.in december,he married a united states citizen.he also is a father of two children who are united states citizens a daughter from a prior relationship,and a daughter with his wife.additionally,he has other family ties in the united states,including his mother,siblings,aunts,and cousins,who are citizens or lawful permanent residents of the united states.
the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against fernandez taveras in based upon his conviction under new york state law for criminal possession of a controlled substance,specifically,crack cocaine the drug conviction.the dhs sought to remove fernandez taveras as an alien deportable for a controlled substance violation,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,pursuant to ina a b i,a b i.fernandez taveras sought cancellation of removal under ina a,a,which provides relief from removal for certain permanent residents who can demonstrate a lengthy physical presence and substantial ties in the united states,and have not committed an aggravated felony.ina a,a the immigration judge u granted his application for cancellation of removal in,which terminated the removal proceedings.
over five years later,in january,the dhs instituted a second removal proceeding against fernandez taveras.this time,the notice to appear charged fernandez taveras with removability under ina a a ii,a a ii,as an alien deportable for committing two or more crimes involving moral turpitude cimt.specifically,fernandez taveras removal proceedings arose from two convictions in and for petit larceny under new york state law.
fernandez taveras admitted the factual allegations in the notice to appear,and conceded that he was removable as charged.fernandez taveras then sought relief from removal by filing an application for adjustment of status under ina a,a,and an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h,h 
the ij issued an oral decision finding that fernandez taveras was removable as an alien deportable for committing two cimt as defined in the statute.however,the ij granted fernandez taveras a h waiver and granted his application for adjustment of status.because fernandez taveras drug conviction had been the basis for the prior proceedings,which resulted in the cancellation of removal,the ij accepted fernandez taveras argument that he had essentially received a waiver of that conviction such that he could no longer be found inadmissible for that offense under ina a a i ii,a a i ii,or ineligible for h waiver 
the ij rejected the contrary view of the fifth circuit court of appeals in de hoyos mukasey,cir,finding it distinguishable,in part,because,in the ij view,it did not account for the ina statutory scheme,particularly a c v,a c v.as we discuss below,this provision governs matters concerning whether lawful permanent residents reentering the united states are seeking admission.the ij,however,read a c v to apply to an alien seeking adjustment of status,and to suggest that once a waiver is granted for an offense under section a of the ina,that that alien will not be subsequently inadmissible for that offense.app.at.accordingly,the ij concluded,fernandez taveras was statutorily eligible to apply for adjusting of status and for a waiver under section h of the ina,notwithstanding his drug conviction,which would otherwise render him inadmissible under section a of the ina for a drug offense that can not be waived under section h of the ina.id.
the dhs appealed the ij decision,and the bia agreed with the dhs that fernandez taveras was ineligible to adjust his status and receive a h waiver due to his drug conviction.the bia concluded that the ij had erred in his interpretation of the law by determining that a grant of cancellation of removal in prior removal proceedings precluded consideration of his drug possession conviction in connection with fernandez taveras application for adjustment of status.app.at.this determination,the bia concluded,was at odds with the board controlling precedent,particularly,matter of balderas,bia,which,the bia explained,instructs that a waiver of inadmissibility or deportability waives only the ground charged,but not the underlying basis for removability.app.at.under balderas rationale,fernandez taveras prior drug conviction could statutorily constitute an underlying basis for inadmissibility and render him ineligible for a h waiver.id the bia also rejected the notion that that the enactment of a c somehow affected balderas longstanding principle,instead,concluding that it applied to an entirely different procedural situation,as we discuss below.id.
considering fernandez taveras applications for adjustment of status and h waiver in light of his drug conviction,the bia concluded that his drug possession conviction clearly renders him inadmissible under section a a i ii of the act,so he is not statutorily eligible for adjustment of status nor eligible for a section h waiver.id.the bia sustained the dhs appeal,vacated the ij decision,and ordered fernandez taveras removal from the united states to the dominican republic.
fernandez taveras timely filed this petition for review of the bia order.
we have general jurisdiction under a to review a final order of removal against an alien.generally,we lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who has been convicted of certain criminal offenses.a c.however,we retain jurisdiction under a d to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review,and apply de novo review,subject to applicable canons of deference.santos reyes att y,cir.
as illustrated by the divergent rulings of the ij and bia,whether fernandez taveras qualifies for relief from removal hinges on whether his drug conviction continues to constitute grounds of ineligibility for adjustment of status and h waiver,notwithstanding the earlier grant of a cancellation of removal.fernandez taveras can not meet the statutory requirements for adjustment of status and h waiver if we conclude that the drug conviction was appropriately considered.the drug conviction would be a basis for fernandez taveras inadmissibility under a a i ii for having violated a law relating to a controlled substance.a a i ii.similarly,a h waiver could not apply to waive the application of subparagraph a i ii because the drug conviction did not relate to a single offense of simple possession of grams or less of marijuana.h.and,without the availability of a h waiver,his inadmissibility would render him ineligible for adjustment of status and thus relief from removal.see a mandating as a prerequisite for adjustment of status that an alien is admissible to the united states for permanent residence 
fernandez taveras argues that the ij correctly excluded his drug conviction from his second removal proceeding because he had received a cancellation of removal under a in a previous proceeding based on that conviction.fernandez ta
