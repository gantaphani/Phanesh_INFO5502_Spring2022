son duc tran petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia ordering him deported as an aggravated felon.tran pled guilty in a pennsylvania court to the crime of reckless burning or exploding,which the board found was a crime of violence under b,and therefore an aggravated felony supporting removal.tran argues that,because this crime required only a reckless mens rea,and involved no risk that he would intentionally use force in the commission of the crime,it was not a crime of violence under b.
our review of the language of b,and of the cases interpreting it,leaves little doubt that a crime whose mens rea is pure recklessness is not a crime of violence for immigration purposes.section b requires a substantial risk that physical force will be used against the person or property of another.such a risk is not synonymous with recklessness the substantial risk required in b is a risk of the use of force,not a risk of injury to persons or damage to property.as the use of force requires intent,and as tran ran no risk of intentionally using force in committing his crime,he did not commit a crime of violence under b.we will therefore grant the petition for review.
tran is a native and citizen of vietnam.he came to the united states as a refugee in february,fleeing mortal danger in his homeland.he became a lawful permanent resident in february,and earned a bachelor degree from western michigan university in,where he remained to pursue a in chemistry.his parents,sisters,and all live in michigan,and he does not appear to have any immediate family in vietnam.
in january of,tran received a call from a friend,who had saved his life when they were fleeing persecution in vietnam,asking for his help with an unspecified matter.the friend was in michigan,and tran,who also lived in michigan,was temporarily in boston at the time.tran agreed to drive the friend brother back to michigan to help the friend.when they arrived in michigan,the friend told tran that he had killed another man in a fight over a woman.the immigration judge ij describes the events that followed 
t he friend wanted to dispose of the body in a way that made it look like the person was killed in an automobile accident.the respondent tran did not want to be involved and said that his only involvement would be to drive the man brother back to boston,if that should be necessary.they ended up going in a car and the man brother drove the car of the victim which had the body in it and set it on fire on the way from michigan to boston in erie,pennsylvania.the respondent had already gone ahead,not knowing that this is exactly where the body was going to be disposed of and he looked back and saw the car on fire and the brother of the perpetrator running to the respondent car.they drove on then to boston.
a few days later,tran returned to his family in michigan.the police questioned him about the murder,and he confessed to his involvement.he cooperated fully with the police and testified against his friend in a michigan murder trial.he was not prosecuted in michigan,and seems to have been granted immunity in exchange for his testimony.
some two years later,tran was told that he was wanted in pennsylvania on charges related to the destruction of the body.he went to pennsylvania,was set free on bond,and appeared for court proceedings.in october,he pled guilty to several crimes,including conspiracy to commit reckless burning,and was sentenced to to months imprisonment.he served six months at waymart state correctional institution,and was paroled in.
in november,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued a notice to appear charging tran with removability as an aggravated felon pursuant to a a iii.tran contested removability and applied for withholding of removal under b a.he presented letters of support from the pennsylvania judge who convicted and sentenced him the superintendent of the prison where he served his sentence,and from clergy,professors,family,and friends.
the ij found that tran crimes did not constitute aggravated felonies under the immigration laws,and therefore held that he was not removable.the government appealed to the board of immigration appeals.the bia reversed,finding that the ij had misapplied the law in finding that the conspiracy to commit reckless burning was not an aggravated felony.it also denied tran petition for withholding of removal,finding insufficient evidence that he faced serious risks in returning to vietnam.
tran filed a timely petition for review challenging the bia decision that he is an aggravated felon.
the government contends that tran is removable under a a iii,which classifies as removable a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.the term aggravated felony is defined by a the term includes a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f.the government contends that tran pennsylvania crime was a crime of violence under,and thus qualifies as an aggravated felony.
we have jurisdiction over tran petition for review pursuant to a.the recent real id act clarifies that our jurisdiction extends to questions of law raised upon a petition for review,including petitions for review of removal orders based on aggravated felony convictions.see real id act a a iii,stat,to be codified at a d.we are thus free to consider tran purely legal claim that his crime was not,in fact,an aggravated felony under the relevant law.see papageorgiou gonzales,wl,cir.june,
in singh ashcroft,cir,we canvassed our precedents to determine the deference due to the bia interpretation and application of the aggravated felony statute.see at.while there we expressly reserve d decision on whether some bia interpretations of a are entitled to deference,id.at,the parties here are in agreement that no deference is due,and that our review is de novo.we will conduct such a de novo review,mindful that the statute at issue here is not the immigration and naturalization act,but rather the criminal provisions of title of the united states code.the interpretation of criminal statutes is a task outside the bia special competence and congressional delegation,while it is very much a part of this court competence.see francis reno,cir.
tran pled guilty to three crimes hindering apprehension,abusing a corpse,and criminal conspiracy to commit reckless burning or exploding.
hindering apprehension is prohibited by,which defines the crime to include harboring,concealing,or aiding another person with intent to hinder the apprehension,prosecution,conviction or punishment of another for a crime.the ins argued before the immigration judge that this crime constitutes an offense relating to obstruction of justice,which is an aggravated felony under a s.the ij rejected this argument,citing in re,wl bia,for the proposition that obstruction of justice offenses must interfere with ongoing judicial proceedings.the bia declined to address this issue on appeal,and the government does not raise it here.
similarly,tran plea to abusing a corpse,in violation of,is not before us.the ij found that it was not an aggravated felony,and the bia did not disturb this finding on appeal.
the only crime that is before us is tran conviction for conspiracy to commit reckless burning or exploding.criminal conspiracy is defined by,a traditional conspiracy statute reckless burning or exploding is prohibited by,a section entitled arson and related offenses and comprising several distinct crimes.the crime to which tran pled is defined as follows 
d reckless burning or person commits a felony of the third degree if he intentionally starts a fire or causes an explosion,or if he aids,counsels,pays or agrees to pay another to cause a fire or explosion,whether on his own property or on that of another,and thereby recklessly 
places an uninhabited building or unoccupied structure of another in danger of damage or destruction or 
places any personal property of another having a value that exceeds or if the property is an automobile,airplane,motorcycle,motorboat or other vehicle in danger of damage or destruction.
the government contends that this definition describes a crime of violence.for federal immigration purposes,a crime of violence is 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
the government,as it must,argues that section d,on its face,constitutes a crime of that tran conduct,as proved by extrinsic evidence,falls under strictures.that is because the language of requires us to look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction,rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner crime.leocal ashcroft,d.we have referred to this requirement as the formal categorical approach of taylor united states,d.see singh,at 
our question,then,is simply whether the pennsylvania crime of reckless burning or exploding is categorically a crime of violence under.
neither party now contends that reckless burning falls under a,which requires the use of physical force against the person or property of another.the reckless burning statute criminalizes the act of intentionally starting a fire with a reckless mens rea regarding damage to the property of another.d.the first element of the crime,intentionally starting a fire on one own property or that of another,does not in itself necessitate the use of physical force against the property of another.
one might make the argument that recklessly damaging or risking damage to the property of another,the second element of section,constitutes using force against the property of another,and thus qualifies as a crime of violence under a.in leocal,supra,the supreme court reserved judgment on this question,deciding only that t he key phrase in a the use of physical force against the person or property of another most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.at.this language leaves open the door for an argument that reckless conduct qualifies as the use of force.but neither the bia decision nor the government argument before us raised this relied instead on b and we consider it waived.
that said,we must nonetheless address the issue because its resolution is essential to our discussion of b.our own court has stated unequivocally that the use of physical force under a requires specific intent recklessness will not suffice.use of physical force is an intentional act,and therefore the first prong of requires specific intent to use force.united states parson,cir.the bia held,and the government now argues,that parson is not controlling here because its holding concerned the united states sentencing guidelines and not.we acknowledge that other courts have referred to our discussion of in parson as dicta,see united states,cir park ins,cir.indeed,our own court may have implied as much in francis reno,cir.
as we explain in the margin,we are not convinced that parson s interpretation of is dictum at all events,we need not decide that question,because we are satisfied that parson s requirement of specific intent under a is correct and that use of physical force is an intentional act.parson,at.
the verb use means t o make use of to convert to one service to employ to avail oneself of to utilize to carry out a purpose or action by means of to put into action or service,especially to attain an end.black law dictionary ed.the oxford english dictionary defines the verb to mean,in its most common usages,t o make use of some immaterial thing as a means or instrument to employ for a certain end or purpose,t o employ or make use of an article,esp.for a profitable end or purpose to utilize,turn to account,or t o work,employ,or manage an implement,instrument,to manipulate,operate,or handle,esp.to some useful or desired end.oxford english dictionary compact ed use,definitions.these definitions show an obvious commonality the use of force means more than the mere occurrence of force it requires the intentional employment of that force,generally to obtain some end.
the plain language of the statute therefore compels the conclusion that the use of force requires specific intent to employ force,and not mere recklessness as to causing harm.in united states,cir,the ninth circuit cited similar definitions of the word use to conclude that the word contain s a volitional requirement.it thus excluded the possibility of negligent use of force,but nonetheless held that is,conscious disregard of a risk of a harm that the defendant is aware of,id.at this volitional requirement we respectfully disagree.as the supreme court said in leocal,use requires active employment.at emphasis added.the active employment of force,generally to achieve some end,corresponds closely to the concept of intent,not recklessness.intent means a a state of mind in which a person seeks to accomplish a given result through a course of action.black law dictionary ed.the idea of purposeful action,of actively employing a means to achieve an end,is an essential component of both use and intent,and is absent from the concept of recklessness.we therefore hold that the use of force in a requires specific intent to use force 
once we conclude that the use of physical force in a requires specific intent,our interpretation of b is determined by the language of the statute and by our precedents.section b covers any felony that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.given the definition of use of physical force reached above,we can only conclude that b crimes are those raising a substantial risk that the actor will intentionally use force in the furtherance of the offense.
parson is explicit on this point 
use of physical force is an intentional act,and therefore a requires specific intent to use force.as to b,a defendant commission of a crime that,by its nature,is likely to require force similarly suggests a willingness to risk having to commit a crime of specific intent.for example,a burglar of a dwelling risks having to use force if the occupants are home and hear the burglar.in such a case,the burglar has a mens rea legally nearly as bad as a specific intent to use force,for he or she recklessly risks having to commit a specific intent crime.
at.in parson,we went on to contrast the requirement of b,in which the actor runs a risk of intentionally using force,with the lower mens rea that we characterized as pure recklessness.id.we noted that crimes like reckless endangering and drunk driving,though they involve a serious risk of injuring others,do not involve any risk of intentional harm or use of force.id 
our conclusion in parson gains support from the supreme court recent decision in leocal.the court discussed b in terms that echo our discussion in parson 
section b simply covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.the reckless disregard in relates not to the general conduct or to the possibility that harm will result from a person conduct,but to the risk that the use of physical force against another might be required in committing a crime.the classic example is burglary.a burglary would be covered under b not because the offense can be committed in a generally reckless way or because someone may be injured,but because burglary,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.
at footnote omitted.in a footnote,the court was even more explicit that t he substantial risk in b relates to the use of force,not to the possible effect of a person conduct,and drew the same distinction that we did in parson between the risk of use of force in b and the distinct risk of injury in united states sentencing guidelines a.leocal.at see also parson,at.
three other courts of appeals have followed the approach of parson,which w
