as fighting raged between sri lankan security forces and the separatist tamil tigers,suganthan pathmakanthan petitioner found himself caught in the middle.petitioner is an ethnic tamil who lived in an area of sri lanka controlled by the tigers.although he was not personally involved with the tigers,he was subject to repeated stops and questioning by the sri lankan forces.between and,he was subjected to some arrests,after which he was detained,questioned and promptly released each time.at one point,petitioner traveled to india and returned to sri lanka without fleeing or seeking asylum.sometime after that return,though,he was arrested and threatened with death.he was released without harm after hours.petitioner subsequently fled sri lanka and,using false indian identification,boarded a plane that arrived at chicago airport on august.
petitioner applied for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the united nations convention against torture cat.after all three were denied by the immigration judge ij and the board of immigration appeals bia,he moved to reopen based on changed circumstances in sri lanka namely the reported breakdown of the between sri lankan security forces and the tamil rebels.the motion to reopen was denied.pathmakanthan now petitions for review of these decisions.
notwithstanding the many difficult experiences that he endured,petitioner has not shown that he had been the subject of persecution.further,despite the poor conditions in sri lanka,petitioner has not shown that he faces a fear of future persecution.moreover,the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reopen.for these reasons,and the ones that follow,we deny the consolidated petition for review.
background 
petitioner is an ethnic tamil from the northern province of sri lanka who is in his late.since he was a child,his homeland has been the scene of an armed conflict between the sri lankan government and the liberation tigers of the tamil eelam ltte,a rebel group that regularly committed atrocities,which resulted in its being designated a terrorist organization by the state department.
as a young,ethnic tamil male,petitioner was the subject of attention,stops and questioning by the sri lankan forces.in,petitioner and his parents were detained at a refugee camp for four months and were released only after his uncle posted a bond.between and,he was arrested and detained during of tamils in his area over times.in each of these incidents,the police both questioned him and presented him to masked informants in order to determine whether he was a tiger militant or supporter.each time they released him after a short detention.he was never beaten or physically injured.
in,when petitioner began working for the german ngo,sewalanka,as a monitoring officer overseeing villages,he traveled extensively in the region.he was stopped by security forces daily and detained for up to two hours while he assured them that he was not a supporter or member of the ltte.in the course of his duties with the ngo,petitioner traveled to india for training.india admitted him based on a group visa and sri lanka readmitted him based on his own identification.while in india,petitioner did not seek or formally inquire about asylum.in august,petitioner quit the ngo due to harassment and threats from the authorities and personal fears for his safety.he began working for his father construction business.
in,the sri lankan department arrested petitioner,took him into custody and brought him to a camp.there they interrogated him again about his ties to the ltte and threatened to kill him.petitioner stated that he believes he was not killed at the time because his family knew of his arrest and pleaded for his release.
in august,petitioner obtained false indian documentation and fled sri lanka via malaysia and japan,arriving at chicago airport.
under the immigration and nationality act ina,the department of homeland security dhs charged petitioner with removal based on his inadmissibility under section a c i entering the united states through fraud or misrepresentation of material fact and section a a i i an immigrant not in possession of a valid visa.initially petitioner conceded to his removability on both charges,but was later allowed to withdraw his concession of the fraud charge.petitioner immediately requested withholding of removal pursuant to section b of the ina,asylum in the united states pursuant to section of the ina and relief under the cat.see et.
on january,the ij issued a decision denying petitioner asylum request on the merits.petitioner timely appealed to the bia,which adopted and affirmed the ij decision on june.pathmakanthan petitions this court for review of that order.docket.on september,petitioner filed a motion with the bia,requesting that the board reopen the earlier matter due to a change in country conditions.on october,the bia denied this request,citing the petitioner failure either to file within days of the prior decision or to provide sufficient evidence that the circumstances had changed in sri lanka.see c ii.pathmakanthan also petitions for review of the bia refusal to reopen the matter.docket.we have consolidated both matters.
ii.discussion 
under,the attorney general or secretary of homeland security may grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees as defined in a.in order to qualify as a refugee,an alien needs to demonstrate two things.first,he must show that he has been the victim of past persecution or has a fear of future persecution.a.second,he must show that the persecution is on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group or political opinion.id.under the cat,an alien may be withheld from removal if she establishes that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.the cat standard is more stringent than the one for asylum.see selimi ashcroft,cir.
we treat the bia adoption of the ij decision as a final agency decision,and we reverse only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to another conclusion.ursachi ins,cir pop ins,cir.where,as here,the bia merely supplements the ij opinion,that opinion,as supplemented by the board,forms the basis for review.see moab gonzales,cir.in conducting our review,we will inquire only whether the board decision has the support of reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.toptchev ins,cir quoting ins eliaszacarias.we review the bia denial of the motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.ins abudu.we review matters of law,including claims of denial of due process,de novo.shmyhelskyy gonzales,cir.
substantial evidence supports the ij determination that petitioner did not suffer past persecution 
petitioner life story is compelling.police and military forces have detained him,interrogated him and even once threatened him with death while he was merely trying to go about his business.he tells of his family going into hiding and giving up their business after a threat,and of his entire family being detained for months in a refugee camp,only to be released when his uncle posted a bond 
a determinative definition of persecution has proven elusive.there is no statutory definition nor has the bia provided one.see,chen gonzales,cir.however,we have characterized persecution as punishment or the infliction of harm for political,religious,or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.boci gonzales,cir quoting dandan ashcroft,cir.persecution includes threats to life or freedom as well as other violence or abuse,yet it need not necessarily be.see firmansjah gonzales,cir mitev ins,cir.but p ersecution involves harms that go beyond mere harassment it results from more than simply unpleasant or even dangerous conditions in the applicant home country.ahmed gonzales,cir quoting nakibuka gonzales,cir.
petitioner certainly suffered harassment when the police rounded him up with others some times in years and subjected him to interrogation and detention.each time,and quite understandably,he worried that the masked informant whose job it was to identify tiger rebels would
