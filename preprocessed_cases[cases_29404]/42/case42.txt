moisés enrique lima lima petitioned this court for review of a final removal order entered by the board of immigration appeals bia.as lima challenge to the underlying discretionary denial of relief under section of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara,pub,stat,as amended by pub,b,stat,fails to raise a colorable legal or constitutional claim,we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
a native of el salvador now fifty years old,lima entered the united states via california on or about either september,or october.he filed an application for asylum with the immigration and naturalization service ins in,which he subsequently withdrew.lima was arrested on various charges in,and.a arrest led to charges of armed burglary,indecent assault and battery,and attempted rape and resulted in a conviction for assault and battery following a bench trial.after his arrest,lima was charged with assault with intent to commit murder,assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,assault and battery,and threat to commit a crime he pleaded guilty to the latter three charges,receiving probation,which terminated in june.
lima applied to the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis,successor to the ins,for permanent residence in december under the special rule cancellation of removal provision of section of nacara.in,uscis denied his application on the basis of his criminal record.
lima was placed in removal proceedings in via a notice to appear charging him as removable under the immigration and nationality act,a a i.an immigration judge ij rejected his application for nacara special rule cancellation of removal in october,citing his conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and the bia dismissed lima appeal in october.in november,lima filed a petition for review and request for stay of removal with this court and a motion to vacate convictions with the framingham district court in massachusetts,arguing that his counsel did not adequately advise him as to the immigration consequences of his guilty plea and thus claiming ineffective assistance of counsel under padilla kentucky.the state court vacated his convictions,and in february the charges were dismissed for failure to prosecute.lima then filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss his case before this court,and we dismissed his initial petition in march.
a february motion to reopen bia proceedings was rejected as untimely and,regarding the evidence of the convictions vacation,inadequate.a subsequent june motion for reconsideration that included lima motion to vacate the convictions,however,succeeded in persuading the bia to vacate its prior decision and remand lima case to the ij for reconsideration.after two continuances,lima testified before the ij in august.at the hearing,lima account of the events leading to the subsequently vacated conviction for assault with a deadly weapon differed substantially from police reports from that night.for example,lima testified that he was not intoxicated,had not been drinking any alcohol,and could not think of a reason that he would have smelled of alcohol or acted intoxicated.in contrast,the police reports indicated that lima was highly intoxicated and that the victim of his assault,rosaura gonzález,his partner and the mother of his daughter,told an officer that he was drunk.lima offered no explanation for why police would have misrepresented his state of sobriety.lima also denied holding a knife to gonzález throat or making contact with her,further contradicting the police reports and interview with lima.
the ij acknowledged,as the parties had agreed,that lima was eligible for relief from removal under section of nacara,but noted that such relief is discretionary and that,under the real id act of,pub,d,stat,lima had to show he merited a favorable exercise of discretion.the ij found the police reports to be probative and reliable.he discounted an affidavit from gonzález stating that she would not testify to the facts contained in the police reports because gonzález did not appear in person,nor offer an explanation for why she did not appear,and the police reports contradicted her affidavit.the ij found lima testified incredibly in several respects,most significantly regarding the incident,undermining his credibility altogether.the ij reviewed both positive and negative factors at length,noting that lima has one child who is a lawful permanent resident and another who is a citizen that neither child testified for lima the length of lima residence in the united states his lack of credibility as a witness discrete instances of negative conduct,contacts with law enforcement,and criminal history,as well as recidivism and refusal to admit culpability his age at the time of entry and at the time he committed negative conduct and that one of his children,then eight years old,was nearby during the conduct leading to lima conviction for assault and battery.finding that the positive factors for lima were limited by his lack of credibility and that the negative factors far outweigh ed the positive,the ij declined to grant lima relief.
the bia reviewed the ij factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo.it found no clear error in the ij credibility determination,a factual finding,based on the inconsistencies between the police reports and lima testimony,and affirmed the ij decision not to grant discretionary relief.
when the bia adopts the ij opinion and discusses some of the bases for the ij decision,we review both the ij and the bia opinions.ouk gonzales,cir.however,r eview of a decision invoking special rule cancellation of removal under nacara is subject to the provision codified at.holder,cir.under that provision,we may not review any judgment regarding the granting of relief relative to cancellation of removal,id.citing,but only constitutional claims and questions of law raised in the petition.id.citing a d see also holder,cir.castro holder,cir.thus,we can not review discretionary determinations regarding requests for special rule cancellation of removal under nacara,absent legal or constitutional error,at.
the traditional rules of evidence do not apply in immigration hearings,and arrest reports historically have been admissible in such proceedings.henry ins,cir.citations omitted.w hile an arrest,without more,is simply an unproven charge,the fact of the arrest,and its attendant circumstances,often have probative value in immigration proceedings.id.there is no rule as to the relative probative value of arrest records based on their age.id.at.an ij may determine an applicant credibility on the basis of the totality of the circumstances,including the consistency of the applicant statements with other evidence of record and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements,without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim,or any other relevant factor.c c.determinations of credibility,and relative credibility,are factual in nature,at.
the case before us rings familiar an apparent successor to,in which the petitioner argued that the ij bungled the decision on special rule cancellation of removal by relying on hearsay evidence particularly the police reports to determine that the petitioner did not deserve a favorable exercise of discretion,giving the reports too much weight and fail ing to assess the probative value of the police reports properly in light of testimony contradicting the reports.at.we labeled his challenge hopelessly factbound and sans any hint of any cognizable constitutional claim or question of law.id.it is no less true here that a challenge to the way in which the agency weighed the evidence and balanced negative and positive factors is not a claim that raises a legal question.id.citing holder,cir.elysee gonzales,cir.and that is all that lima claims here he argues that the ij should not have found the police reports credible and should instead have credited his own testimony and gonzález affidavit,as a result of which,presumably,the ij would have found more positive factors favoring lima and granted him relief.there is,of course,no problem
