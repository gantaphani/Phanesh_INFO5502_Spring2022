wardlaw,circuit judge 
bladimir martinez appeals his conviction by jury trial and his sentence for being a removed alien found in the united states in violation of.during its deliberations,the jury sent a note to the judge seeking guidance on the significance of a special finding as to martinez removal date.the special finding had significance only with respect to the sentence imposed by the jury.without responding in open court and without notifying or consulting counsel,the judge penned his own response on the note and returned it to the jury.between the time the jury sent its note and the return of the verdict,an time period elapsed.the jury found martinez guilty of illegal reentry and specially and separately found that he was removed subsequent to december,thereby escalating the statutory maximum sentence from two years to twenty.the court failure to consult martinez counsel before responding to the jury note violated federal rule of criminal procedure rule and the sixth amendment.because much of the government documentary evidence concerning martinez prior removal contained demonstrable errors,and because defense counsel,had she been consulted,would have specifically requested that the trial court instruct the jury that the government was required to prove the removal date beyond a reasonable doubt,the district judge error was constitutionally harmful.we therefore vacate martinez sentence and strike the special finding.on remand,the government may elect to retry the removal date issue before a sentencing jury,or it may request that the district court resentence martinez under the sentencing provision in a.
in december,border patrol agents apprehended martinez while he was attempting to hide himself in an area just north of the united states mexico border.the government charged martinez by information with one count of being a removed alien found in the united states,in violation of.the information also charged that martinez had been removed subsequent to december,the date he was convicted for felony commission of a lewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of under california penal code b.
the central issue at trial was alienage.in a evidentiary phase,the government adduced evidence that martinez was removed from the united states in and reentered in as a noncitizen without permission to reenter.defense counsel did not call any witnesses,but challenged the accuracy of the prosecution immigration documents which had been created by government agents during martinez prior removal and his apprehension.the documents indicated that martinez had told immigration officers he was not a citizen but inconsistently stated he was a citizen of guatemala and mexico.
on the second day,the court gave the jury its initial instructions,which addressed the one charge,its elements,the government burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,and the requirement of unanimity.these instructions failed to mention that the jury would be asked to make a finding concerning martinez removal date or that the government had to prove the removal date beyond a reasonable doubt.
following closing arguments,the court delivered its final instructions.the court also reviewed the verdict form with the jury.the judge identified the two questions on the form whether or not martinez was guilty of being a removed alien found in the united states,and,if so,whether martinez had been removed from the united states after december.the judge did not tell the jury that the government had to prove that martinez was removed after december,beyond a reasonable doubt,but did tell the jury that to respond yes to the question it must unanimously agree that martinez had been removed after that date.the judge also told the jury that if it needed to communicate to the court,it could do so by written note,but that any response might be delayed because the court would consult with the lawyers before answering it.
at,the jury sent a note to the court that asked,on the jury form,what significance is the date of december,on the portion that asks if he was deported subsequent to the date of.the court wrote its response directly on the jury note,stating,it is a matter for the court to consider,not the jury.the jury has to consider whether the defendant was deported or removed after that date.
eight minutes after it had sent its first note,at,the jury sent a second note announcing that it had reached a verdict.the judge convened counsel,but before bringing in the jury,informed counsel that he had received a note from the jury.he stated,i did think it was important to bring counsel back in to answer this question,so i answered it myself.the judge also told counsel,so you know,if you have a problem with that,i guess you take it up with the court of appeals.the jury found martinez guilty and that he was removed after december.the court sentenced martinez to months in prison,with two years of supervised release.defense counsel apparently had a problem with the court decision not to consult with counsel before answering the jury question,and this is the resulting appeal.

the district court violated federal rule of criminal procedure a and martinez sixth amendment right to counsel by failing to notify and consult with his counsel before responding to the jury question.
rule provides a defendant an expansive right to be present throughout his trial.though that right is also guaranteed by the constitution,rule codified a right to be present that is broader than the constitutional right alone.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.rule outlines when the defendant presence is required generally every critical stage of the trial,when it is not,and when presence may be waived.
it is well established that a district court failure to notify defense counsel about a jury note and to give counsel the opportunity to be heard before the court responds violates rule.in rogers united states,the deliberating jury sent a note to the court inquiring whether the court would accept the verdict guilty as charged with extreme mercy of the court.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court did not alert the defendant or his counsel and instead instructed the court marshal to advise the jury that the c ourt answer was in the affirmative.id.internal quotation marks omitted.five minutes later,the jury returned a guilty verdict recommending the court mercy.id.at.the supreme court held that the district court ex parte response to the jury request for further instructions violated rule,which required that the message be answered in open court,and that defense counsel be given an opportunity to be heard before the trial judge responded.id.at.
while the rogers court noted that a violation of rule may in some circumstances be harmless error,the court determined that both the nature of the information conveyed to the jury,in addition to the manner in which it was conveyed,rendered it prejudicial.id.at.specifically,the district court should have,a t the very least,told the jury that its recommendation for mercy was not binding in any way.id.the court also noted that,after deliberating for almost two hours,the jury returned its verdict five minutes after learning that it could recommend mercy,which strongly suggested that the district court response induced unanimity.id.
the rogers court relied on two earlier decisions in which the court had found error under similar facts,but by reasoning from the principles attendant to the orderly conduct of a jury trial,including the right to be heard.the first decision,fillippon albion vein slate,involved a civil suit for negligence.id.at.there,during deliberations,the jury sent a note to the district court asking whether the plaintiff could be found contributorily negligent,and the court replied in writing with supplementary instructions.id.at.the court did so in the absence of the parties and their counsel,and without calling the jury into open court.id.the court wrote that the supplementary instructions ought to have be en given either in the presence of counsel or after notice and an opportunity to be present.id.at.it explained that the orderly conduct of a trial by jury,essential to the proper protection of the right to be heard,entitles the parties to be present in person or by counsel at all proceedings from the time the jury is impaneled until it is discharged.id.the court thus reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the district court,noting that erroneous rulings are presumptively injurious,especially those embodied in instructions to the jury.id.at.
the rogers court also relied on shields united states,which involved a criminal prosecution.in that case,the jury sent a note to the district court during deliberations stating that it had reached a verdict for five of the eight defendants.id.at.the court replied in writing that the jury must reach a verdict as to all of the defendants.id.neither the defendants nor their counsel were advised of the communications,nor were the communications made in open court.id.at.the supreme court remanded the case for a new trial,explaining that its holding followed a fortiori from the rule laid out in fillippon,which required,especially in a criminal case,that jury instructions be given in the presence of counsel or after notice and an opportunity to be present.id.at.
in our circuit,we have held that a court violates rule not only when it fails to consult counsel about a jury note,but also when it does so inadequately.in united states artus,cir,the jury sent a note to the court asking about the jury instructions and the government closing argument,in which the prosecutor had introduced facts not in evidence.id.at.the court informed counsel that it would speak to the jury foreperson.id.the court did so,answering at length several factual inquiries from the foreperson about the case.id.at.we held that,even though the court informed counsel that it would answer the foreperson questions beforehand,the court violated rule because it did not adequately consult with counsel prior to giving the supplemental instructions.id.we reasoned that t he interchange between jury and judge should be surrounded with formalities so that the defendant has an adequate opportunity to evaluate the propriety of the proposed response or instruction,formulate objections,or suggest a different response.id.on the basis of the court violation of rule and the government improper statements during closing argument,we reversed the conviction.id.at.
sixth amendment 
we have held that the sixth amendment,in addition to rule,requires a court to consult defense counsel when it receives an inquiry from the jury in united states,a single juror sent a note to the court during deliberations asking about the evidence showing the defendant intent to possess and distribute heroin.at.without consulting counsel,the court chose to not respond.id.at.we held that the court decision violated the defendant sixth amendment right to be represented by his attorney at a conference during which defendant counsel could have argued in favor of a reply.id.
we affirmed the conviction,however,applying chapman california,and finding that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,at.to determine whether the error was harmless,we considered the three factors identified in united states frazin 
first,we consider the probable effect of the message actually sent,second,the likelihood that the court would have sent a different message had it consulted with appellants beforehand and third,whether any changes in the message that appellants might have obtained would have affected the verdict in any way.
id.at quoting frazin,at.we concluded that the error was harmless because the court silence likely did not influence the jury,the jury previously received the relevant jury instructions regarding intent,and the note d id not reveal any legal disorientation on the part of the juror or the jury but rather reveal ed some difficulty in assessing the probative value of the evidence.id.at.
in united states,we extended this sixth amendment right to require trial courts to consult counsel about the court communications to a deliberating jury,even when those communications are not initiated by the jury.there,the court sent an unsolicited note to the jury in the absence of counsel and the parties,at.the note informed the jury that if deliberations were not concluded by friday at,an alternate juror would be substituted for a deliberating juror who had a conflict the following week,and deliberations would have to begin anew.id.we concluded that the note was a supplementary instruction that the court should have reviewed with counsel,because counsel might have objected to the instruction or sought alternative language.id.at.we then determined that the failure to give counsel the opportunity to be heard was both a constitutional and statutory violation id.at.nevertheless,the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the jury reached its verdict by friday at,suggesting that the jury had no difficulty reaching a verdict,and would have returned it well before regardless of the note.id.at.
the district court violated martinez constitutional and statutory rights by failing to notify counsel of the jury note and to give counsel the opportunity to be heard during the preparation of the response.
martinez argues that this error was structural,requiring automatic reversal under united states cronic.he cites musladin lamarque,cir,and united states mohsen,cir,two recent cases in which we found the failure to consult counsel before responding to a jury note constitutional error,but did not hold that the error was structural.indeed,we have never held that such error is structural error under cronic.
in musladin,a state capital case on habeas review,we considered whether clearly established federal law existed requiring consultation with counsel when the court receives a inquiry from the jury.at.to determine whether the communication constituted a cronic critical stage of trial,we considered whether it was a stage that held significant consequences for the accused.id.at significant rights,skilled counsel would be useful in helping the accused understand the legal confrontation,and the proceeding tests the merits of the accused case.hovey ayers,cir.quoting menefield borg,cir.
the supreme court has held that a critical stage under cronic is a step of a criminal proceeding,such as arraignment,that h olds significant consequences for the accused.bell,at.in at least one case,we melded the two critical stage determinations together,suggesting that a sixth amendment violation involving the absence of counsel always requires automatic reversal.see united states hamilton,cir.in several other cases,we have recognized that the cronic critical stage determination is separate but nevertheless used the hovey test for determining whether a stage implicates the sixth amendment.see,mcneal adams,cir.united states benford,cir.in mcneal adams,for example,we stated that we were issu ing th e opinion to clarify the difference between a stage at which the defendant has a right to counsel,see mempa rhay,and a critical stage requiring per se reversal if counsel is absent,see united states cronic.at.the opinion in mcneal nevertheless applied the test from hovey to determine whether the hearing at issue was a cronic critical stage.judge berzon wrote separately to clarify the distinction 
i believe the majority confuses the critical stage standard applicable to unitedstates cronic,with the separate critical stage standard applicable to all claims under the sixth amendment.put simply,the majority erroneously treats the two as the same,when they are not.the standard applicable in the first instance is any stage of a criminal proceeding where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected,hovey ayers,cir citation and quotation marks omitted,while that applicable in the second instance is whether the denial of counsel at a given stage holds such significant consequences for the overall 
quoting bell cone.we concluded that it did,explaining that the stage at which the deprivation of counsel may be critical should be understood as the formulation of the response to a jury request for additional instructions,rather than its delivery.id.at.finding that this principle was not clearly established federal law,however,we held that because the court simply referred the jury to the prior instructions,instructions that defense counsel had participated in formulating,it would not be unreasonable to conclude that this was not a cronic critical stage.id.at.in so stating,and in a series of footnotes,we distinguished among the types of jury inquiries that might or might not trigger a critical stage,such as rereading the prior instructions,see hudson jones,cir,rereading testimony,see united states toliver,cir,or providing supplemental instructions,see french jones,cir,suggesting a inquiry somewhat at odds with the concept of structural error musladin,at.
in mohsen,after concluding the court erred by failing to consult the parties or counsel before responding to the jury request to see the indictment with the specific charges,we determined that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.at.we rejected mohsen argument that answering a jury question without consulting counsel is always structural error requiring reversal,stating that in musladin w e never suggested that all errors regarding jury communications during deliberations were subject to automatic reversal.id.at.we distinguished the jury request in musladin from that in mohsen because u nlike the communication in musladin,the jury note in mohsen was not a question about the law governing the jury deliberations.id.nor did the note in mohsen make any substantive inquiry about the facts or the law,distinguishing it from jury notes in other previous cases.id.citing frantz hazey,cir.en banc.we then cited three cases in which we had found a court ex parte response to the jury to be harmless error,which involved a court unsolicited supplementary instruction regarding the substitution of an alternate juror,at,in which the court chose not to respond to a note from a single juror,at and frazin,in which the court responded to a note that the jury was deadlocked with an instruction to continue deliberations,at.mohsen,at.thus,our previous cases suggest that the question whether the failure to consult counsel about a jury note is structural error turns on both the nature of the jury request and the need for counsel participation in formulating a response.
here,the jury was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that martinez was removed after december,the date he was convicted of the predicate aggravated felony.if the jury so concluded,the statutory maximum sentence for his illegal reentry conviction would jump from two to twenty years under b.factual determinations that increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.apprendi new jersey,see also united states,cir.as applied to,the apprendi principle requires that to trigger b sentence,facts establishing that the removal occurred after an aggravated felony conviction must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury.
we need not decide in this case,however,whether the judge ex parte response to a jury note about the significance of an apprendi sentencing factor was structural in nature because we find that the constitutional error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under the frazin test.even if we were to determine that the judge formulation of his response to this jury note,which dealt only with sentencing,was a critical sentencing stage,the result would be the same we must vacate martinez sentence and remand for resentencing.united states yamashiro,cir.vacating sentence for structural error where defendant was deprived of counsel during victim allocution at sentencing proceeding.an error,constitutional or otherwise,that relates solely to sentencing does not require the vacation of a conviction.see see also robinson ignacio,cir.granting writ of habeas corpus and remanding for resentencing without performing harmless error analysis.
probable effect of the message actually sent 
a court message to a deliberating jury inevitably influences the jury analysis.particularly in a criminal trial,the judge last word is apt to be the decisive word.frantz,at quoting bollenbach united states.for that reason,when a court receives a jury note,how the court reply is worded can have just as much impact as the court decision,for example,whether or not to grant the jury request to see evidence.id.even analytically correct answers to a jury may unnecessarily and improperly influence a jury.id.quoting arizona johnson,cir.
the unique circumstances surrounding the removal date finding likely heightened the impact of the court message.the jury did not learn that it would need to make a special finding about martinez removal date until just before deliberations began.and the court gave only a brief instruction regarding that finding,stating that the jurors had to unanimously agree that martinez was removed after december.the court never instructed the jury that this finding,like the elements of the crime itself,had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the government.
the court message,though technically accurate to those versed in the law who would likely interpret it as referencing sentencing,was misleading to the jury.in reply to the jury question,the court stated,it is a matter for the court to consider,not the jury.the jury has to consider whether the defendant was deported or removed after that date.the response was confusing it was internally inconsistent because it both told the jury that the date was a matter for the court to consider and then said it was for the jury to consider.moreover,the court told the jurors they needed only to consider when martinez was removed,not that they needed to determine whether the government proved the removal date beyond a reasonable doubt.further,the message suggested that,unlike the determination of guilt,the court and jury shared the factfinding task concerning the removal date.
that the court message caused the jury to quickly examine the evidence of the removal date under an impermissible burden of proof is made more probable by the lapse of only eight minutes between the jury note and its return of the verdict time which included getting the note to the judge,the judge thinking about and then writing the response,and the delivery of the judge response.indeed,in rogers,the supreme court held that the return of a jury verdict only five minutes after the court message strongly suggest ed that the trial judge response may have induced unanimity.at.
the court response here was different in kind from the responses in cases where we have found a court error harmless.the response was unlike that in,where the court chose not to respond to a single juror note.at.it was also unlike that in mohsen,where the court refused to provide a copy of the indictme
