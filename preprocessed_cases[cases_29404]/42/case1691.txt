petitioner omima ibrahim soliman has filed a petition seeking review by this court of the july,wl decision of the board of immigration appeals bia ordering her removal to egypt.by our order of june,we have granted the petition for review and vacated the bia order of removal,in that the bia order was premised on the erroneous determination that soliman had been previously convicted of an aggravated felony,as that term is defined in a a u this opinion further explains the rulings embodied in our june,order,and it is filed pursuant thereto.
soliman is a native of egypt,and she immigrated to this country on may.on may,soliman was indicted in fairfax county,virginia,for the offense of fraudulent use of a credit card,in violation of virginia code,for having represented that she was the holder of a credit card belonging to someone else,without the card holder consent,to obtain property in excess of soliman was convicted on june,and,on october,the court sentenced her to two years of incarceration,all suspended,plus two years of probation.
on december,the immigration and naturalization service the ins issued soliman a notice to appear and initiated removal proceedings against her.the notice to appear classified soliman as removable from this country pursuant to the provisions of a a iii,which gives the attorney general the authority to deport a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.the aggravated felonies subject to this statutory provision are enumerated in a a u of importance here,these aggravated felonies include a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year,a g subsection g,and an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds,a m i subsection m i.
the ins notice to appear alleged that soliman virginia conviction for credit card fraud constituted a theft offense under subsection g.soliman maintained otherwise,however,asserting that her offense was not a theft offense under subsection g,but rather a fraud offense,covered by subsection m i.according to soliman,the offense for which she was convicted involved less than the specified in subsection m i,and thus is not an aggravated felony and a proper basis for deportation 
by decision of january,the immigration judge the ij rejected each of soliman contentions,agreeing with the ins and concluding that her conviction was for a theft offense under subsection g.in so ruling,the ij defined a theft offense as a criminal offense where there is a criminal intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership.the ij reasoned that,because soliman was not entitled to obtain the property that she did under the statute under which she was convicted,her crime involved theft within the meaning of subsection g.
the bia affirmed the ij ruling by its order of july,the bia order,from which soliman petition for review emanates although the bia agreed with soliman that her offense by its terms,involves fraud,it nonetheless concluded that the theft and fraud subsections of a,spelled out in subsections g and m i,are not mutually exclusive,and ruled that a crime which involves fraud may also involve theft.bia order at.indeed,the bia observed,the common definition of the term theft includes fraud.id.citing black law dictionary,defining theft as a popular name for larceny t he fraudulent taking of personal property belonging to another without his consent,with the intent to deprive the owner of the value of the same.the bia then defined a theft offense as the unlawful taking of property,whenever there is a criminal intent to deprive the owner of the rights or benefits of ownership,either permanently or less so.id.at.
in assessing whether soliman conviction was for a theft offense,the bia applied the categorical approach set forth and explained by the supreme court in taylor united states,d explaining that court analyzing prior conviction must first look to categorical nature of statute of prior conviction,and then,if necessary,look to certain facts underlying conviction.in so doing,the bia first concluded that virginia code,under which soliman was convicted,is not a categorical theft other words,its elements are not the same as the elements of a theft offense under federal law.looking then to soliman indictment to determine the particular facts underlying her conviction,the bia found that the actual conduct underlying her offense was the functional equivalent of a theft offense as the bia had defined it the unlawful taking of property,whenever there is a criminal intent to deprive the owner of the rights of benefits of ownership,either permanently or less so.bia order at.specifically,the bia concluded that,in soliman prosecution in fairfax county,there had been an unlawful taking of property from the merchant because t he fraud renders the taking unlawful further,it found there was criminal intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership because soliman had deprived the card true owner of his or her benefits or rights of ownership.id.emphasis added.
by her petition for review,soliman has raised a single issue whether the bia erred in determining that she was deportable because her virginia conviction constituted an aggravated felony,a theft offense pursuant to subsection g.
as an initial matter,we recognize that our jurisdiction to consider and resolve petitions for review from the decisions of the bia is limited.section a c of title,united states code,provides that no court has jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense.we have recognized,however,that we possess limited jurisdiction to review factual determinations that trigger the provision specifically,whether soliman is an alien,and whether she has been convicted of an aggravated felony.see ramtulla ashcroft,cir citing ins,d.if either of these two factual determinations is found to be erroneous,we possess jurisdiction over soliman petition for review otherwise,we are obliged to dismiss her petition.see lewis ins,cir explaining that jurisdiction turns on presence,or lack thereof,of these two facts and court therefore has jurisdiction to review them.
by her petition for review,soliman admits the fact that she is an alien.the only jurisdictional fact she contests is whether she was convicted in virginia state court of an aggravated felony within the meaning of a.
in support of her position in this proceeding,soliman makes two contentions.first,she maintains that her conviction in virginia was for an offense that involves fraud or deceit,that she was not convicted of a theft offense,and that the bia erred in improperly characterizing her conviction as a theft offense under subsection g.in support of this contention,she points to the definitions of theft offense adopted in similar proceedings by our sister circuits.see nugent ashcroft,cir defining theft offense as a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent emphasis added united states,cir same united states,cir same ins,cir same.second,and alternatively,soliman maintains that if her virginia conviction included both theft and fraud,we should adhere to the reasoning of the third circuit in nugent,and apply the minimum threshold of subsection m i to any such hybrid offense.at.the attorney general contends in response,first,that the bia properly categorized soliman conviction as a theft offense,and thus as an aggravated felony,and second,that the bia interpretation of a is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.because we are able to resolve soliman petition for review by finding that soliman conviction was not for a theft offense under subsection g,we need not reach and address her alternative contention with respect to imputing subsection m i minimum threshold to subsection g.
the supreme court has determined that the special deference rules of chevron apply to bia interpretations of the statutes it administers.see ins,d see also blanco de belbruno ashcroft,cir applying chevron to bia interpretations of ins regulations.as the court has explained,such deference is premised on the proposition that the power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,by congress.chevron,at.quoting morton ruiz,d.when chevron deference applies,a court in reviewing an agency action is confronted with two questions 
first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
id.at.more specifically,chevron deference applies to the bia interpretations of the immigration and nationality act,the statute at issue here.see,at.see also blanco de belbruno,at.
pursuant to the foregoing,we are obliged to apply the principles of chevron to the bia determination of the underlying issue in this meaning of subsection g.however,we need not accord deference to the bia ultimate finding that soliman particular offense was an aggravated felony,which involves an issue of our appellate jurisdiction and an interpretation of virginia criminal law,neither of which lies within the bia authority or expertise.see,at.deferring to bia interpretation of statute it administers reno,cir declining to apply chevron deference to enforcement of federal jurisdiction limitations.
under chevron,we are first obliged to consider whether congress has spoken on the precise question at,whether a theft offense includes fraud.see chevron,at.if congress intention is clear,the inquiry ends there,as pure questions of statutory construction are for the courts to decide.ins,d.the bia order determined that the common definition of the term theft includes fraud and applied the definition of theft offense to encompass fraud.as explained below,however,that determination was contrary to the intention of congress.
in assessing congress intent,we are obliged to look to and apply the traditional tools of statutory construction,at.and under settled rules,the plain language of the statute in question is deemed the most reliable indicator of congressional intent.we are obliged to look to the statutory language as a whole,construing each section in harmony with every other part or section,because act s of congress should not be read as a series of unrelated and isolated provisions.gustafson alloyd,d.
the plain text of a shows that congress specifically distinguished fraud from theft,and that it meant for the two offenses to be treated differently.subsection g provides that an aggravated felony is a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.subsection m i,on the other hand,provides for an aggravated felony classification for an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.congress thus decided to treat fraud as a distinct offense from theft within a,and it prescribed a threshold before a fraud offense can qualify as an aggravated felony.
the classic definitions of theft and fraud,as those terms were commonly used at the time of the act adoption in,appear to have key differences.for example,the crime of theft was then generally described as 
a fraudulent taking of corporeal personal property belonging to another,from his possession,or from the possession of some person holding the same for him,without his consent,with the intent to deprive the owner of the value of the same,and to appropriate it to the use or benefit of the person taking.
black law dictionary ed emphasis added see also black law dictionary ed defining theft as t he act of taking property without the owner consent.under this definition,a theft involved five elements a taking of property from its owner or his representative without that person consent with intent to deprive the owner to the benefit of the thief 
on the other hand,the crime of fraud was then generally described as 
an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or to surrender a legal right a false representation of a matter of fact,whether by words or by conduct,by false or misleading allegations,or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed,which deceives and is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his injury.
id.at emphasis added.when a theft offense has occurred,property has been obtained from its owner without consent in a fraud scheme,the owner has voluntarily surrendered his property,because of an intentional perversion of truth,or otherwise act ed upon a false representation to his injury.the key and controlling distinction between these two crimes is therefore the consent occurs without consent,while fraud occurs with consent that has been unlawfully obtained.
where congress has utilized distinct terms within the same statute,the applicable canons of statutory construction require that we endeavor to give different meanings to those different fraud and theft.see,united states nordic village,d.similarly,statutory provisions are to be construed as a whole,and we are not to give one word of a statute a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words.gustafson,at.further,where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another provision of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion,at.internal quotation marks omitted.finally,we are loath to read one statutory provision so as to render another provision of the same statute superfluous.cooper indus.aviall,d see also norman singer,statutes and statutory construction ed.
in order to give proper effect to the intention of congress that theft and fraud offenses are to be treated differently for purposes of an aggravated felony issue,a proper definition of the term theft offense must distinguish between such an offense and a fraud scheme.and the key distinction on that point is the without consent element,present in the classic definition of a theft offense.this key distinction was eliminated by the definition of theft offense used by the bia in this proceeding,substituting the term unlawful for without consent of the property owner.bia order at.in so doing,the bia authorized a fraud offense to satisfy the unlawful taking requirement of a theft,and thus be subsumed within the term theft offense.such a result is contrary to the intention of congress,as evidenced by its separate and different treatment of fraud.see,at.indeed,the bia definition of theft offense makes the fraud provision of subsection m i superfluous,and it results in an outcome that is contrary to congress explicit inclusion of a threshold for fraud offenses into subsection m i transforming all fraud offenses into theft offenses,and thus also into aggravated felonies under a.see cooper.at cautioning against reading statute so as to make portions superfluous.
our conclusion that a taking of property without consent is an essential element of a theft offense is also consistent with the theft offense definitions adopted and utilized by the courts of appeals to previously consider this issue.these courts have concluded that a theft offense is a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership,even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent,at see also nugent,at,at,at.b
