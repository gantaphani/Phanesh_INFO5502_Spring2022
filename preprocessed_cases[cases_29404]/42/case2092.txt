petitioner yousif lazar seeks review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge ij decision declaring lazar asylum application frivolous.at a hearing in november,lazar admitted that he made material misrepresentations in his application,including that he was detained and beaten in saddam hussein iraq.as a result,the ij declared his application frivolous.because a finding of frivolousness prevents an alien from obtaining any other relief under the immigration and nationality act ina for which he might otherwise qualify except for withholding of removal,which lazar does not seek,the ij denied lazar application for an adjustment of status based on his marriage to a naturalized united states citizen.for the reasons that follow,we deny lazar petition for review.
background 
lazar is a native and citizen of iraq,who arrived in the united states on may,without being admitted or paroled by an immigration officer.lazar filed an application for asylum and for withholding of removal on may,first asylum application.subsequently,lazar also sought to become a permanent resident based on his marriage to a fellow iraqi émigré,who had become a naturalized united states citizen.
lazar original counsel,robert dekelaita,assisted him in preparing and filing his first asylum application.there,lazar explained that he was an assyrian christian,and therefore part of a minority group that was persecuted in saddam hussein iraq.lazar stated that he became involved in the assyrian democratic movement adm in iraq in.his brother also had been a member of the adm but was forced to seek asylum in the united states when his writings got him in trouble.lazar claimed that he distributed adm flyers and newspapers in baghdad in and,until one day he was arrested along with several other assyrians,interrogated,and beaten.he was released after being detained for a week,only to be picked up again three days later,and interrogated and beaten.lazar decided to flee iraq in,after the adm distributed particularly vitriolic flyers denouncing saddam hussein.
prior to his asylum hearing on november,lazar obtained new counsel,george mann,and submitted a second asylum application second asylum application,in which he repeated his allegations of having endured persecution and abuse in iraq as a result of his political activities.
at the november,asylum hearing,lazar sought a continuance until his application for a visa based on his marriage to a naturalized united states citizen could be processed.the ij noted that he had already granted multiple continuances of lazar asylum hearing in anticipation of a decision from the department of homeland security dhs on lazar application.while attempting to find out why lazar application still had not been processed,the ij stated that he wanted to proceed with the asylum hearing,at least to have lazar sign his second asylum application.
noting that lazar had filed two asylum applications,the ij explained that although he would consider the most recent version,lazar might still be required to account for any differences between them.the ij then explained the consequences for filing a frivolous application 
now,sir,if you knowingly file a frivolous application for asylum,you would be barred forever from receiving any benefits under our immigration act.now,this,of course,would mean you could never come back to the united states.and,of course,you could never adjust your status based upon your marriage.a frivolous application for asylum is one which contains statements or responses to questions that have been deliberately fabricated.
joint appendix.in addition to giving these oral warnings,the ij provided lazar with written information about filing a frivolous asylum application.
the ij then asked lazar whether he had been over this application that was prepared with the assistance of mann,line by line and word for word lazar answered,y es.in response to a question from the ij about whether he would like to make any changes to his application,lazar said no.he answered affirmatively when asked if the application was entirely accurate.with that,lazar signed his second asylum application and affirmed to the ij that the entire contents of his application were all true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.
the ij proceeded to ask lazar some questions.in response,lazar testified that he was in greece for about six months prior to coming the united states,that he was never in germany,as he reported in his first asylum application,and that he entered the united states through mexico.the government then questioned lazar.
in response to the government questions,lazar testified that he grew up in kirkuk,iraq.he claimed to have moved to baghdad in for school and work and to have lived there continuously until he fled iraq in.when asked whether he was absolutely positive about living exclusively in baghdad from to,lazar stood by his testimony.at this point,the government handed lazar a document and asked him whether in fact he was not in athens,greece in,where he had applied for refugee status.ultimately,lazar made several significant admissions showing that he had not been truthful in his second asylum application,or in his testimony in response to the ij and the government questions.lazar admitted that he was in greece for at least a part of the period in which he claimed to have been in baghdad although he stated in his second asylum application that he had never applied for refugee status before,he had in fact applied for such status in the united states,while living in greece and his arrest and detention in baghdad,which formed the basis for his asylum application,was a fabrication.lazar further stated that he lied to improve his chances for obtaining asylum and suggested that he had lied upon the advice of his former counsel,dekelaita.because of lazar submission of a false application,the government asked the ij to make a finding that the application was frivolous.
lazar counsel,mann,expressed surprise at his client admissions and asked the ij for a continuance to confer with lazar and assess the situation.the ij noted that he was familiar with at least one other allegation by a former dekelaita client that dekelaita had urged the client to lie in an asylum application.the ij concluded that he needed to review a pertinent judicial decision on whether a recantation of false statements made in an asylum application would vitiate a frivolous finding,and he urged the parties to review the case as well.the ij decided to continue the hearing for almost a year,until september,and further gave lazar thirty days to come clean by submitting a filing identifying any other falsehoods in his second asylum application.
on december,lazar filed a third asylum application third asylum application,apparently in an effort to comply with the ij request that he come clean.the cover letter accompanying lazar third asylum application explained that the factual account is incomplete but that it would be supplemented with a full statement as soon as possible.rather than complete the application,however,lazar withdrew all his asylum applications on august,and elected to proceed exclusively on his request for an adjustment of status because his visa request had been favorably adjudicated.thus,the only relief lazar sought was an adjustment of status to permanent resident based on his marriage to a united states citizen.
at the september,hearing,the ij acknowledged lazar withdrawal of his request for asylum and his intent to proceed only on his application for an adjustment of status.however,the ij held that lazar had filed a frivolous asylum application and therefore,he was not eligible for an adjustment of status,despite his marriage to a united states citizen.the ij stated that he had given lazar an opportunity to explain any discrepancies or implausible aspects of his asylum claim prior to making a frivolousness determination.lazar did not offer some nuance or some spin,but rather conceded that he lied in his application.moreover,the ij held that a prompt recantation by an asylum applicant does not prevent a court from deeming an asylum application frivolous.the ij stated 
there needs to be a general deterrent to all potential asylum applicants that they can not lie to the court or to the immigration service or there would be serious consequences.it also is a specific deterrent in each case before the court or the service,and that is to preclude this particular person from lying.once the lie is done,he shot himself in the foot.and the fact that he then confesses the error of his way is of little and no import to the court.public policy dictates that recantation not be a viable option.but even if it were a viable option,the court notes that the respondent did not recant his application.the respondent got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.what he did not know is the government had evidence that would demonstrate that his application was fake,phony and fraudulent.this,of course,would be an involuntary recantation,and the court can not see why any involuntary recantation,if you want to call it that,would preclude a finding of frivolousness.it would make a mockery of this system.but in any event,the respondent did not recant,he just confessed and it was a forced confession at that.
accordingly,the ij denied lazar application for adjustment of status.
on february,the bia affirmed the ij decision.the bia held that the ij frivolous determination was amply supported by the record.the bia stated that lazar could not explain away his prevarication by blaming his former counsel because lazar was caught in his lie after he was represented by new counsel and after the ij had specifically cautioned him about the consequences of submitting a false asylum application.further,the bia stated that even if there could be circumstances in which a timely retraction of a deliberate material fabrication could be effective to preclude a finding of frivolousness,such a timely retraction did not occur.lazar timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
where the bia summarily adopts the ij decision and also provides commentary of its own,we review both the bia decision and the ij decision.gilaj gonzales,cir per curiam.we review a finding that an asylum seeker submitted a frivolous application under the standard for factual findings.selami gonzales,cir.under the standard,factual determinations must be upheld if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.koliada ins,cir per curiam internal quotations and citation omitted.to reverse a factual determination,we must find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.
lazar raises several arguments on appeal,including that he should not be subjected to the harsh finding of frivolousness where he was acting pursuant to the advice of his unscrupulous former counsel,the ij did not give him a sufficient opportunity to explain the falsehoods in his application,he was denied due process because the ij held conversations with another ij,and because his case was not adjudicated by a panel of the bia,he timely retracted his false statements,which should preclude a frivolous finding,and the case should be remanded to the bia,in light of a new bia decision.each of these will be discussed in turn.
legal principles applicable to a finding of frivolousness 
an asylum application,filed on or after april,such as lazar,is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.a number of requirements must be met before an asylum application may be declared frivolous,including notice to the alien of the consequences of filing a frivolous application,a specific finding by the ij or the bia that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous application,sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that a material element of the asylum application was deliberately fabricated,and an indication that the alien has been afforded sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.in re yl,bia lexis,at bia.because of the severe consequences that flow from a frivolousness finding,the preponderance of the evidence must support an ij finding that the petitioner knowingly and deliberately fabricated material elements of the claim.id.at.further,the ij must consider plausible explanations offered by the petitioner in considering whether the preponderance of the evidence supports a frivolousness finding.id.such a finding shall not preclude an alien from seeking withholding of removal,but the alien shall be permanently ineligible for any benefits under the ina if the alien received notice,inter alia,that he would be permanently ineligible for benefits if he filed a frivolous application.d.
lazar can not blame his former counsel 
lazar contends that but for dekelaita improper actions and unscrupulous advice,he would have become a permanent resident based on his marriage to a naturalized united states citizen,and that therefore dekelaita rendered ineffective assistance which precludes a finding of frivolousness.pet.br.at.further,lazar argues that he did not knowingly make any material misrepresentations in his asylum application,as required by d and,because he relied upon dekelaita.
lazar misses the point.even if he made misrepresentations in his asylum application based on dekelaita advice,he had multiple opportunities to retract these falsehoods and explain them as the product of his attorney malfeasance.lazar did not do so,at least not until he was caught.at the november,hearing,lazar was represented by new counsel who prepared his second asylum application.prior to signing his application,lazar received written and oral notice from the ij that filing a frivolous application could prevent him from receiving any relief under the ina except for withholding of removal to which he might otherwise qualify.lazar testified that he had carefully reviewed his second asylum application with his counsel,that he did not need to make any changes,and that everything set forth in the application was accurate.lazar then proceeded to testify falsely in response to the ij and the government questions until the government presented him with documentation showing that he was in greece for at least part of the period in which he claimed to have been living in baghdad.lazar then admitted his multiple misrepresentations.rather than attempt to clarify his statements,lazar subsequently withdrew his asylum application altogether.
even assuming that lazar was improperly influenced by dekelaita,he could,and should,have revealed the falsehoods permeating his first asylum application to his new counsel in preparation for filing his second asylum application.in addition,lazar could have spoken up of his own volition at the november hearing prior to signing his application.for these reasons,lazar predicament is of his own making and he can not hide behind dekelaita alleged improprieties.
further,to the extent that lazar asserts that dekelaita conduct amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel that should relieve him of the ij frivolousness finding,we note that lazar has failed to satisfy the requirements for asserting such a claim.lazar has not submitted an affidavit detailing dekelaita failings,or shown that dekelaita has been informed of the allegations and given an opportunity to respond.matter of lozada,bia sako gonzales,cir.thus,dekelaita alleged ineffective assistance does not serve as a basis for granting lazar relief.
lazar was given an opportunity to explain the discrepancies between his asylum application and his hearing testimony 
lazar contends that a finding of frivolousness was not warranted where dekelaita involvement in pressuring him to make misrepresentations was not fully fleshed out in the course of the proceedings,lazar withdrew his asylum application,and the ij,by his own admission,did not compare word for word and line by line lazar third asylum application,filed on december,and ultimately abandoned,with his fraudulent second asylum application.
lazar arguments are unavailing.first,for the reasons described above,even if dekelaita rendered ineffective assistance that prejudiced lazar
