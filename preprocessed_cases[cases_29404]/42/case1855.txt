efren contends that the district court erred in applying an sentence enhancement because his prior texas conviction for assault is not a crime of violence as defined for this purpose by the united states sentencing guidelines.we agree.accordingly,we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.
facts and proceedings below 
on october,border patrol agents found in cameron county,texas and determined him to be a citizen of mexico who had entered the united states illegally.had been deported from the united states on may,after pleading guilty to assault in texas state court 
on february,pleaded guilty to violating a and b which proscribe knowingly and unlawfully being present in the united states after having been denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed following certain convictions.
for violations within section,sentencing guideline b c provides for an enhancement if the violation follows a conviction for an aggravated felony.application note a for guideline states that f or purposes of subsection b c,aggravated felony has the meaning given that term in section a of the immigration and nationality act a.a in its various subparagraphs lists multiple offenses that constitute an aggravated felony.the only one relevant to this appeal is subparagraph f,which provides that an aggravated felony includes a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.provides 
the term crime of violence means 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
citing guideline b c,the presentence report psr recommended adding eight levels to total offense level,based on categorizing texas assault conviction as an aggravated felony.objected to this treatment of his assault conviction and further objected that was facially unconstitutional.after two sentencing hearings addressing concerns,the district court overruled his objections and adopted the psr enhancement recommendation,rendering guideline total offense level and range for imprisonment eighteen to months.
on june,the district court sentenced to months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.
discussion 
in his timely appeal,argues that the district court erred in treating his texas assault conviction as an aggravated felony under b c because the texas assault offense for which he was convicted is not a crime of violence as defined by,and therefore is not an aggravated felony under a f.subsections a and b offer alternative definitions for crime of violence.thus,the propriety of sentence enhancement turns on whether his texas conviction for assault meets either the definition of crime of violence in subsection a or the definition in subsection b.we discuss each of these provisions in turn.
the texas assault conviction constitutes a crime of violence under subsection a if it has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.when deciding whether a prior conviction is a crime of violence because it has as an element the use of force,we use the categorical approach established in taylor united states,d.united states,cir.under that approach,this court must analyze an offense statutory definition and not the defendant underlying conduct.id.
prior conviction was under texas penal code a,which provides 
a person commits an offense if the person 
intentionally,knowingly,or recklessly causes bodily injury to another,including the person spouse 
intentionally or knowingly threatens another with imminent bodily injury,including the person spouse or 
intentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another when the person knows or should reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or provocative.ann.a vernon.
both and the government agree that a of the texas penal code,a class a misdemeanor,constitutes the relevant assault definition in this case.to convict under a,the government must prove that the defendant intentionally,knowingly,or recklessly cause d bodily injury to another the government contends that a requirement that a defendant cause bodily injury incorporates a requirement to show the intentional use of force,such that prior assault conviction satisfies a definition of crime of violence.we disagree for the following reasons.
first,as we have previously explained in relation to b,the term force has a specific meaning and,when used in the statutory definition of a crime of violence,is synonymous with destructive or violent force.united states,cir quoting united states,cir,which explained that,in the context of burglary,force means more than the mere asportation of some property of the victim.
second,under a clear language,use of force must be an element of the offense,another term for which we have previously delineated a specific meaning 
in our current legal terminology,an element is a constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed.black law dictionary ed.if any set of facts would support a conviction without proof of that component,then the component most decidedly is not an or the crime.united states,cir en banc.
thus,an assault offense under section a satisfies subsection a definition of a crime of violence only if a conviction for that offense could not be sustained without proof of the use of destructive or violent force.
the bodily injury required by section a is physical pain,illness,or any impairment of physical condition.ann.a.such injury could result from any of a number of acts,without use of destructive or violent force,making available to the victim a poisoned drink while reassuring him the drink is safe,or telling the victim he can safely back his car out while knowing an approaching car driven by an independently acting third party will hit the victim.to convict a defendant under any of these scenarios,the government would not need to show the defendant used physical force against the person or property of another.thus,use of force is not an element of assault under section a,and the assault offense does not fit subsection a definition for crime of violence 
this court had previously held that an assault offense under section a has,as an element,the use of physical force under a a ii so as to meet that section definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and thus constitute a predicate offense for purposes of g.see united states shelton,cir stating that because texas penal code a requires bodily injury it includes as an element the use of physical force.in shelton,a panel of this court relied largely on the panel opinion in united states,cir.shelton,at,the panel had concluded that texas intoxication assault offense,texas penal code included use of force as an element by virtue of its requirement of causation of serious bodily injury and was hence a crime of violence under b a ii,note b ii i stating definition almost identical to section a,at.after shelton,however,was taken en banc.cir.in the en banc opinion we held the opposite namely 
there is a difference between a defendant causation of an injury and the defendant use of force.consequently,use of force was simply not a fact necessary to support his conviction for intoxication assault,cir.
moreover,in the en banc court,id.at,specifically cited with approval,as supporting its ruling on the element requirement of section b a ii,note b ii i,the second circuit decision in chrzanoski ashcroft,cir,holding that the offense of assault in the third degree under connecticut general statutes a was not a crime of violence under section a.the connecticut statute provided that a person is guilty of assault in the third degree when with intent to cause physical injury to another person,he causes such injury to such person or to a third person.with respect to whether under the statute use of physical force against the person of another is an element of the offense,the connecticut statute is not materially different from texas penal code a at issue here the chrzanoski court recognized,as the en banc court did in,that for purposes of section a a n element of a crime is a fact that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction.chrzanoski at.chrzanoski specifically considered and rejected the government argument that force is implicit in the statute requirement of intentional causation of physical injury,id.at,and held instead that the intentional causation of injury does not necessarily involve the use of force.id.at.the en banc court in specifically stated its agreement with that holding of chrzanoski and went on to hold,at,that the defendant use of force was simply not a fact necessary to support his conviction for violating the statute which required that his conduct cause serious bodily injury to another.
chrzanoski analysis of the ways in which the connecticut third degree assault statute could be violated without the defendant use of force are likewise fully applicable to.a,viz 
given the elements of section a under connecticut law,it seems an individual could be convicted of intentional assault in the third degree for injury caused not by physical force,but by guile,deception,or even deliberate omission moreover,human experience suggests numerous examples of intentionally causing physical injury without the use of force,such as a doctor who deliberately withholds vital medicine from a sick patient.in sum,while there are undoubtedly many ways in which force could be used to commit third degree assault under connecticut law,the plain language of the statute does not make use of force an explicit or implicit element of the crime.rather,its language is broad enough to cover myriad other schemes,not involving force,whereby physical injury can be caused intentionally,at 
in united states,cir,the en banc court reaffirmed the en banc holding that for purposes of the has as an element the use of physical force language of,application note b ii i,if any set of facts would support a conviction without proof of that component,then the component most decidedly is not an or the crime.
because the en banc opinion in comes after shelton,which is itself a panel opinion,and because of shelton heavy reliance on the panel opinion in which was later reversed en banc,we feel compelled to decide whether.a has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another within the meaning of section a on the basis of the principles set down in and rather than in reliance on shelton.on this basis we conclude that although section a requires that the defendant intentionally,knowingly,or recklessly cause s bodily injury to another,that section may be violated by the defendant so causing such injury by means other than the actual,attempted,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,and hence does not have such use of force as an element and does not fall within section a 
in addition to its reliance on shelton,the government leans heavily on the district court finding of family violence and the conduct underlying conviction to support its claim that the prior assault conviction is a crime of violence under subsection a.the government quotes the information charging 
o n or about the day of october,and before the making and filing of this information,in cameron county,texas,efren hernandez villegas,the defendant,did then and there unlawfully,intentionally,knowingly,or recklessly cause bodily injury to another,namely,adriana hernandez,a family member,by hitting adriana hernandez with defendant hand kicking adriana hernandez with defendant foot.
in his plea colloquy,admitted hitting his wife,although he neither denied nor admitted kicking her.
under the categorical approach described above,however,conduct underlying an offense may not be employed to meet the definition of crime of violence under subsection a.accordingly,the government may not rely for this purpose on facts alleged in an indictment or information.this court clarified this matter in united states,where we considered whether the texas child endangerment offense included use of force as an element 
although the actual conduct described in the indictments could be construed to involve the use of physical force against the person of another,that is irrelevant for purposes of this case.the inquiry under paragraph i looks to the elements of the crime,not to the defendant actual conduct in committing it.this rule springs directly from the language of the crime of violence definition itself,which states that a crime of violence is an offense that has as an element the use of force.at.
we further noted that under texas law,the manner and means,even when required to be charged in the indictment,does not constitute an element of the offense.id.at.rather,inclusion of manner and means serves to satisfy due process concerns related to adequately notifying defendants.id.thus,if statutory language is wholly,as here,an offense is not a crime of violence under subsection a simply because an indictment or information describes force being used in a particular commission of that offense we do not say here that an indictment is always a charging instrument may appropriately be referenced in order to determine which of several statutorily specified or referenced methods of committing an offense or statutory subdivisions containing different offense definitions or elements are involved in a given case.see id.at.
subsection b defines crime of violence as any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.subsection b expressly pertains only to felonies.therefore,assault conviction is a crime of violence as that term is defined by b only if it constitutes a felony.because the offense described in texas penal code a can not be classified as a felony under either state or federal law,we hold that prior conviction does not satisfy b definition for crime of violence 
texas law specifically categorizes an assault under a as a class a misdemeanor,which may be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year.see.ann.b vernon classifying assault under section a as a class a misdemeanor id.class a misdemeanors are punishable by up to one year in prison.federal law,in turn,makes clear that the lowest class of felony within the federal system must be punishable by more than one year.a defining a class e felony.as such,neither texas nor federal law permits us to categorize assault conviction as a felony.
the government argues that,while the default federal definition of a felony is,as noted above,an offense punishable by more than one year,in this case,assault under a is a felony under federal law because a f defines aggravated felony for the purposes of guideline b c as a crime of violence as defined in section of title for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.we find this argument unpersuasive.
a f definition of aggravated felony has two requirements first,that the offense meet either of section alternative definitions of crime of violence and second,that the offense imprisonment term is at least one year.the government argument conflates the second requirement with the separate requirements of section itself,which must be independently satisfied.
an offense can meet a therefore constitute an aggravated felony under a f regardless of whether it is considered a felony under state or federal law.this is consistent with this court decision in united states,cir,where we held that although a prior conviction was labeled as a misdemeanor by state law,it could still be considered an aggravated felony under.if the offense meets a definition of crime of violence,section a f still requires that it have at least a imprisonment term.if that second,requirement is met,the offense will be an aggravated felony regardless of alternative definitions of felony.
if an offense does not meet the requireme
