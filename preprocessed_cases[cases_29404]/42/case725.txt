azem gashi,a citizen of serbia petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the oral decision of immigration judge ij alan vomacka,which denied gashi application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.see in re azem gashi,no.a june,bia decision,aff g in re azem gashi,no.a immig.city may,ij decision.gashi testified that,in,he and others were attacked by soldiers under the command of ramush haradinaj,a leader of the kosovo liberation army kla.in and,gashi met with international officials investigating allegations that haradinaj and the kla had committed war crimes during the kosovo conflict and related to them the details of the attack.soon thereafter,gashi was assaulted and threatened,prompting him to flee to the united states.gashi contends he was targeted by supporters of haradinaj by reason of his cooperating with the war crimes investigators.
the ij rejected gashi claim of past persecution,explaining that gashi failed to demonstrate that the abuse he suffered had a sufficient nexus to a protected ground.of relevance to this petition,the ij found that the abuse could not be considered to be on account of gashi membership in a particular social group within the meaning of the governing statute the immigration and nationality act ina because of the lack of a socially visible trait identifying membership in the group.the bia adopted the ij reasoning,concluding that gashi failed to identify a particular social group that fulfilled the elements required for eligibility under the ina.
we do not agree with the ij conclusion that members of a group consisting of persons who witnessed haradinaj alleged crimes and cooperated with international investigators were not visible to both persecutors and the wider community.gashi name was published on a list of potential witnesses against haradinaj,his fellow villagers were aware that he had spoken with investigators,and other potential witnesses were harassed.these facts satisfied the social visibility requirement for a particular social group.therefore,we can not accept the bia conclusion that a group consisting of potential witnesses against haradinaj does not constitute a particular social group.
to the contrary,we conclude that the proposed group of cooperating witnesses is a particular social group under the ina.the proposed group meets the three requirements of having an immutable,common characteristic,having some degree of social visibility,and being defined with sufficient particularity.on remand,the agency must consider whether gashi is a member of the group,whether the attacks and threats directed against gashi amounted to persecution,and,if so,whether that persecution was on account of his membership in the group.
if the agency does find that gashi suffered past persecution on account of his particular social group membership,then it must afford gashi a presumption of fear of future persecution.in the proceedings below,the ij and the bia found no past persecution and therefore placed the burden of proving fear of persecution on gashi.a finding on remand that gashi was a victim of past persecution would automatically shift the burden to the government to prove that gashi has no fear of future persecution.we vacate and remand so that the agency may consider these questions in the first instance.
background 
gashi fled kosovo in february and tried to enter the united states under the visa waiver program using a fraudulent passport.he was refused admission to the united states and was referred to an ij for proceedings.gashi filed his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief in july.
among other claims,gashi asserted that he suffered past persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group in the affidavit included with his application,gashi explained that he and his family were ethnic albanians living in kosovo when conflict erupted with serbia in.motivated by a desire to end the serbian oppression of ethnic albanians,gashi joined the armed forces of the republic of kosovo fark resistance group.gashi served under the command of colonel tahir zemaj.
during the conflict,the fark had a number of disagreements with the rival kla,which also sought to expel the serbs from kosovo.gashi testified that he and three friends,all of them members of the fark,were caught in the crossfire of the fark kla dispute when they were stopped and attacked by a kla unit on july.the kla forces,which were commanded by ramush haradinaj and another individual referred to as togeri,or lieutenant,shepherded gashi and his friends to the front yard of a house used by the kla.gashi holder,administrative record at.haradinaj took out a pistol and shot gashi in his right ankle,and then he and his brother beat gashi and his friends with metal rods and the butts of submachine guns.gashi friend,idriz,was beaten with a baseball bat.
afterward,gashi and his friends were ordered to strip to their underwear and run to a village called kodrali while togeri followed in a car and fired a submachine gun above their heads.haradinaj wanted the wounded gashi and his injured friends to serve as a warning to the rival fark commander,zemaj.as gashi and his friends passed through a village called irzniq where other kla units were stationed,togeri shouted out that gashi and his friends were zemaj soldiers and that they should be beaten.the kla forces attacked gashi and his friends.at some point,gashi and his friend petrit had to support idriz,who had suffered a head wound.togeri drove away after gashi and his friends reached the village kodrali,where they reunited with a fark unit and were given medical treatment.
in august,representatives of the united nations mission in kosovo unmik visited gashi region and inquired about the july,incident.other villagers directed the representatives to gashi,who described the attack on himself and his friends.gashi spoke with the same unmik representatives two more times,on november,and on august.
around august,gashi noticed an increase in the number of threats he received over the telephone.people in his village who favored the kla called gashi a traitor and a troublemaker,and they warned him that he was messing with serious things.in september,gashi was attacked near his house by two masked men,one of whom brandished a knife.screaming for help,gashi managed to fight off the assailants and escape to his house.in november,while gashi was driving,a car approached very quickly,as if to hit him.he received a telephone call that night telling him that his end will be near.a month later,in december,gashi was attacked by three masked men as he accompanied a friend home.one of the men hit him on the head with a metal knob while another said to k ill this dog here.the masked men ran off when a car passed by and stopped to help gashi.after receiving another threatening telephone call,gashi fled to the united states.gashi did not inform the international investigators of his relocation and did not testify at haradinaj trial before the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty,at which haradinaj was acquitted.
after an individual merits hearing on december,the ij rendered an oral decision on may,denying gashi application.the ij ruled that gashi had not proven past persecution on account of a protected ground.in relevant part,the ij concluded that gashi was not a member of a particular social group because he did not have a trait that was visible to society as a whole.the ij explained that gashi was not from a different ethnic group and had no observable traits.ij decision at.the ij also noted that many people in kosovo would be unaware of his particular history.id.at.because the ij also rejected gashi assertion that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion,the ij found that gashi had failed to show that any of the attacks and threats against him had a nexus to a protected ground.see id.
while the absence of a connection between the attacks and a protected ground would have been sufficient to deny gashi past persecution claim,the ij made the additional ruling that the attack on gashi and his friends did not rise to the level of persecution.noting that the kla forces could have killed gashi if they had so desired,id.at,the ij stated his belief that gashi was merely the means to deliver a humiliating message to his commander,id.at.furthermore,the ij stated that the assaults and threats did not constitute persecution either,but he offered no explanation for this conclusion.see id.at t he recent threats and assaults against gashi involving the hague tribunal do not constitute persecution.
the ij also held that gashi had not shown a fear of future persecution at the hands of haradinaj supporters.while the ij acknowledged that gashi had given preliminary statements to unmik officials and had been pressured not to testify,the ij emphasized that gashi never testified against haradinaj.the ij faulted gashi for traveling to the united states and making no effort to inform icty prosecutors of his relocation.see id.at.in view of gashi decision not to testify and haradinaj eventual acquittal,the ij concluded that haradinaj and his supporters had no motive to punish gashi.see id.at.the ij therefore ruled that gashi had not carried his burden of proving fear of persecution.see id.at t he court believes the respondent fails to show that at the present time the haradinaj supporters have a reason to further harm the respondent.
the bia affirmed the decision of the ij.the bia did not specifically address the ij finding that gashi had no socially visible characteristic.instead,the bia stated that it agree d with the immigration judge that,as a potential witness against haradinaj,the applicant is not a member of a particular social group.bia decision at.accordingly,the bia agreed with the ij that gashi had not shown a nexus between the abuse against him and a protected ground.see id.the bia did not consider whether the assaults and threats directed at gashi in constituted persecution under the ina.
the bia also agreed with the ij that gashi had failed to meet his burden to show a fear of future persecution.id.the bia explained that haradinaj and his supporters had no reason to harm gashi given gashi failure to testify and haradinaj acquittal.see id.
discussion 
where,as here,the bia has adopted and supplemented the ij decision,we review the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.legal issues,and the application of law to fact,are reviewed de novo.castro holder,cir citation omitted.because the ij found gashi to be credible,we treat the version of past events that gashi related to the ij as undisputed fact.see delgado mukasey,cir 
asylum is a discretionary form of relief available to certain aliens who qualify as refugees under the ina.see b a.the ina defines a refugee as an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his native country because of persecution or a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.gashi claims his eligibility results from a fear of persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group consisting of persons who witnessed war crimes by the kla and haradinaj and cooperated with authorities investigating those crimes.
for applications filed after may,such as that of gashi,the real id act of places the burden on the asylum applicant to establish a sufficiently strong nexus to one of the protected grounds by demonstrating that race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.castro,at quoting real id act of a,b b i.
an alien who proves past persecution on account of a protected ground is entitled to a presumption of fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim.see b jalloh gonzales,cir.the government can rebut the presumption in different ways,such as by showing either that conditions in the alien native country have changed such that the alien no longer has a fear of persecution,or that the alien can avoid future persecution by relocating to a different region of his native country.see b i a b jalloh,at.the regulations make clear that,i n cases in which an applicant has demonstrated past persecution the government shall bear the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the changed country conditions or the feasibility of relocation.b ii.
an alien does not need to prove any past persecution to establish his eligibility for asylum.proof of a fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground is sufficient to establish asylum eligibility.see id.b see also huang ins,cir if an alien establishes a fear of future persecution,he is automatically eligible for asylum.absent a showing of past persecution,however,the alien bears the burden of proving that he has a fear of persecution.see a and b iii.in addition,an alien who has not shown past persecution also has the burden of proving that it would not be reasonable for him to relocate to a different region of his native country where he could avoid persecution.see id.b i.
ii.gashi challenge 
gashi contends the bia erred in concluding that the category of persons in which he claims membership,providing the basis for his past persecution,did not constitute a particular social group within the meaning of the statute.we agree.accordingly we vacate the bia order and remand for further consideration.
exhaustion 
as an initial matter,the government argues that gashi forfeited any claim regarding the elements of a particular social group because he did not raise the issue in his appeal to the bia.although it is true that gashi did not explicitly raise this point in his brief to the bia,the bia chose nonetheless to address the issue in its decision and relied on an incorrect legal standard in making its decision.in such circumstances,we have ruled that the bia excused the petitioner failure to raise the issue,and we proceeded to consider it.ye dep t of homeland,cir see also waldron ins,cir.we do so here as well.
requirements of a particular social group 
decisions of the bia and of this court have addressed the characteristics needed to qualify as a particular social group under the ina.the bia has ruled that the members must share a common characteristic that is either beyond the power of the individual to change or so fundamental to individual identity or conscience that it ought not be required to be changed.matter of acosta,overruled in part on other grounds,matter of mogharrabi.this common characteristic,furthermore,must have enough social visibility that it identifies members of the group to others in the community,particularly to potential persecutors.see ucelo gomez mukasey,cir in re c a,gomez ins,cir a particular social group is comprised of individuals who possess some fundamental characteristic in common which serves to distinguish them in the eyes of a persecutor or in the eyes of the outside world in general.in addition,the proposed group must have particular and boundaries.ucelo gomez,at.
the bia held that a group consisting of potential witnesses against haradinaj does not satisfy those requirements.bia decision at.the bia implicitly expressed agreement with the ij,who ruled that gashi could not qualify because he did not have any socially visible characteristic because he is not from a different ethnic group,and because many people in kosovo would be unaware of his particular history.ij decision at.
gashi,however,pointed to characteristics that are both immutable and visible in the kosovar society.as for visibility,gashi name appeared on a public list of potential witnesses against haradinaj compiled by the prosecutor at the icty.gashi my name is there in that list.ij listed as a witness to appear in,at that trial gashi yes,as a witness.in re c a,at confidential informants against a drug cartel had no social visibility because,i n the normal course of events,an informant against the cartel intends to remain unknown and undiscovered.people in his village knew that gashi spoke with unmik representatives because they directed the representatives,who sought information about the july,incident
