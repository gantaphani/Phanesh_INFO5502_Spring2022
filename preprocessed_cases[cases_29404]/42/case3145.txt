francisca morales de soto,a mexican native and citizen,petitions for review of the government reinstatement of a removal order issued in.the immigration and customs enforcement ice agency of the department of homeland security dhs first notified morales of its intention to reinstate removal in.since that time,the government has revised its policies regarding the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in immigration proceedings.morales asks this court to remand her case so that the agency can reconsider the exercise of its discretion in light of those changed policies.we conclude that remand of a decision to reinstate removal is not warranted in these circumstances.we also reject morales claim that ice abused its discretion in reinstating removal before morales could exhaust her appeals from a separate petition to reapply for admission to the united states.we deny the petition for review.
background 
francisca morales de soto attempted to enter the united states on january,at the border crossing in calexico,california.because she lacked a legal visa,she was issued a notice and order of expedited removal and was removed back to mexico.later that same month,morales reentered the united states without inspection and has resided here ever since.she now lives with her husband and three minor children,all four of whom are citizens.
in july,morales filed an application to adjust her status to that of a lawful permanent resident based on petitions filed by her husband and her brother,who is also a citizen.she also filed a form,application for permission to reapply for admission into the united states after deportation or removal,and a form,application for waiver of grounds of inadmissibility.all three applications were denied because she had previously been removed and had failed to meet the requirements to obtain consent to reapply to the united states her case was referred to ice,which notified her on july,of its intention to reinstate her prior order of removal.morales filed a petition for review by this court that same day and received a stay of removal.we now address that petition.
ii.jurisdiction 
the immigration and nationality act ina substantially limits this court review of a prior order of removal that has been reinstated by the government.a.however,we retain jurisdiction to review the reinstatement order itself under a.see,cir,abrogated on other grounds by gonzales.in her petition,morales does not challenge the legitimacy of her january expedited order of removal.instead,she limits her appeal to the manner in which ice decided to issue the reinstatement order against her.we therefore have jurisdiction over the petition.
iii.discussion 
when an alien has unlawfully reentered the united states after being subject to a prior order of removal,the ina allows the government to reinstate the prior order of removal rather than undertake removal proceedings a second time.a.the only factual predicates for reinstatement are that petitioner is an alien,who was subject to a prior removal order,and who illegally reentered the united states.gonzales,cir.en banc.in most cases,immigration officers make such reinstatement decisions without a hearing before an immigration judge.see id.at.
there is,however,no requirement that ice reinstate removal in all cases,even when these factual predicates are met.reinstatement of removal is neither automatic nor obligatory.holder,cir.as an alternative to reinstatement,ice has the prosecutorial discretion to initiate a new removal proceeding before an immigration judge.in this case,ice chose not to exercise that discretion and instead reinstated morales prior removal order without providing for a hearing.
morales,acknowledging that we can not review the merits of ice exercise of its prosecutorial discretion,does not contest the validity of ice decision in to reinstate removal.she instead contends that changed circumstances since ice initially made its decision in require us to remand her case so that ice can reconsider the exercise of its discretion.
morales makes two arguments.first,she contends that remand is necessary because of changes in ice internal policies surrounding the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.second,she argues that the reinstatement of removal was premature and that remand is required as a remedy for that error.neither argument has merit.
changes in ice prosecutorial discretion policies 
since july,when ice first notified morales of its intention to reinstate removal,ice has released a number of memoranda pertaining to its exercise of prosecutorial discretion.morales petition focuses on two of these memoranda.the first memorandum was issued by john morton,then the director of ice,in.memorandum from john morton,director of ice,on exercising prosecutorial discretion consistent with the civil immigration enforcement priorities of the agency for the apprehension,detention,and removal of aliens june,hereinafter morton memo the second memorandum was issued by john sandweg,then the acting director of ice,in.memorandum from john sandweg,acting director of ice,on facilitating parental interests in the course of civil immigration enforcement activities august,hereinafter sandweg memo the morton memo listed factors that ice agents should consider when weighing the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,including factors relevant to morales,such as the alien length of presence in the united states and her family ties to the country.morton memo at.the sandweg memo focused on the treatment of alien parents of minor children,stressing the need for ice agents to consider whether the alien is a parent or legal guardian of a or legal permanent resident minor when exercising prosecutorial discretion.sandweg memo at.
morales argues that these memos constitute an intervening change in ice policies since her removal was reinstated,necessitating a remand under ordinary principles of administrative law.reviewing this question of law de novo,garcia de rincon dep t of homeland,cir,we disagree.
to begin with,we know from experience that ice may reconsider the exercise of its discretion regardless of whether we remand morales petition.indeed,the government may reconsider its position while a petition is pending before us.in recent years our court has remanded dozens of pending petitions at the government request.moreover,the government represents that morales made a specific request to dhs that discretion be exercised in her favor after the morton memo was issued and that the request was explicitly declined.remand is obviously not necessary to permit the agency to exercise discretion of this kind.
there are circumstances where remand is appropriate after there has been a change in applicable agency policy.an appellate court reviewing an agency decision following an intervening change of policy by the agency should remand to permit the agency to decide in the first instance whether giving the change retrospective effect will best effectuate the policies underlying the agency governing act.nlrb food store emps.union,local.this requirement arises from the intersection of two doctrines.panhandle pipeline ferc,cir.the first is that a reviewing court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decisions,even when a change in governing law is made by an administrative agency.id.at citing thorpe housing.the second is that a reviewing court may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given.id.at quoting motor vehicles mfrs.ass state farm mutual auto.ins.
but the food store doctrine does not apply to a case,like this one,involving review of a purely discretionary decision by an agency.the morton and sandweg memos speak only to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and do not create or modify the law to be applied by this or any other court.aside from constitutional claims or questions of law reviewable under,we have no authority to review the merits of ice discretionary decision to reinstate a prior removal order in situations where the factual predicates for reinstatement are met.a b.this reflects the understanding that an agency decision not to prosecute or enforce,whether th
