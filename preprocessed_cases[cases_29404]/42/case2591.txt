mirwais ali,a native and citizen of afghanistan,came to the united states at the age of three.at eighteen,ali had several encounters with the law resulting in three state convictions,which triggered removal proceedings by the immigration authorities.for the reasons discussed below we find that the child citizenship act of does not apply retrospectively and thus does not provide ali any relief.we also find that although ali felony conviction was vacated and reduced to a misdemeanor by the wisconsin state courts,it was reasonable for the board of immigration appeals bia to hold that ali vacated felony remains a felony for immigration purposes.also,we conclude that the bia denial of ali convention against torture cat claim was supported by substantial evidence.finally,we find that ali has no liberty or property interest in the discretionary relief he this case cancellation of removal.therefore we lack jurisdiction to review his due process claim.thus,we affirm the immigration judge citizenship determination,the bia convention against torture determination,and the bia denial of ali motion to reconsider.and we dismiss ali withholding of removal claim for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
ali was born in afghanistan in,immigrated with his parents to the united states at the age of three,and was granted lawful permanent resident status on march.ali mother became a citizen in,when ali was still a minor.since,ali has resided in the united states and has not left the country.he does not speak any of the native languages of afghanistan nor does he have any family or friends there.
as a teenager,ali was convicted of various offenses in wisconsin state court receiving stolen property,possession with intent to distribute tetrahydrocannabinol thc,the active ingredient in marijuana,and receiving stolen property.following these convictions,what was then the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings against ali.in his notice to appear,the ins claimed ali was removable under the immigration and nationality act ina,for having been convicted,after admission to the united states,of an aggravated felony relating to illicit trafficking of a controlled substance a controlled substance offense other than a single offense involving possession of one own use of grams or less of marijuana and two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.he was taken into ins custody in november and has remained in detention since that time.
ali made several claims to defeat removal.on may,the immigration judge ij denied all of ali applications for relief,making the following findings he was not a citizen under the child citizenship act of cca having been convicted of an aggravated felony,possession with intent to distribute thc,he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal he was also statutorily ineligible for asylum because his felony conviction constitutes a particularly serious crime his conviction for a particularly serious crime also precluded his eligibility for withholding of removal and he had not made out a claim for relief under cat.finding that ali failed to designate a country of removal,the ij ordered ali removed to afghanistan.the ij also stated that if the wisconsin state court would vacate or modify ali felony drug conviction to the misdemeanor of mere possession,ali could avoid removal by filing a motion to reopen consideration of his case to apply for cancellation of removal.the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion on september.
on march,the dane county circuit court of wisconsin entered an order amending ali felony conviction of possession with intent to deliver thc to simple misdemeanor possession of thc.on may,ali filed with the bia a motion to reopen his removal proceedings to present a cancellation of removal claim based upon the wisconsin state court amendment of his conviction.on may,the bia denied ali motion as untimely.on june,ali filed a motion to reconsider the board may decision.on july,the bia denied the motion for reconsideration,applying its june,ruling in matter of pickering,wl bia to conclude that,despite the modification of his sentence to a misdemeanor,ali remained convicted of an aggravated felony for immigration purposes and was statutorily ineligible to apply for cancellation from removal.ali now appeals the following decisions the ij citizenship determination under the cca,affirmed by the bia without opinion the ij denial also affirmed by the bia without opinion of ali petition for withholding of removal and his claim for relief under cat and the bia denial of ali motion to reconsider.
ii.analysis 
child citizenship act of 
ali claims that he can not be removed from the united states because he is a citizen under the child citizenship act of,a,stat,codified at a.we must decide the nationality claim when no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented.b a ashcroft,cir.we review legal issues presented in such claims de novo but defer to the bia factual findings,reversing them only if they lack the support of substantial evidence in the record,at.because the bia affirmed the ij citizenship determination without opinion,the ij opinion becomes the basis of our review.vladimirova ashcroft,cir ememe ashcroft,cir.
the cca changed the way in which children of citizens born outside the united states become eligible for citizenship.it amended of the ina and grants automatic american citizenship to children who are born outside of the united states when the following three conditions have been met at least one parent of the child is a citizen of the united states,whether by birth or naturalization the child is under the age of eighteen years and the child is residing in the united states in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.a.
section of the new law provides that this amendment shall take effect days after the date of the enactment of this act and shall apply to individuals who satisfy the requirements of section of the immigration and nationality act,as in effect on such effective date,title i,stat.as the cca was signed by the president on october,the amendments became effective on february.we have construed the cca not to apply retrospectively,see dave ashcroft,cir,at.the bia and other circuits have also construed the cca in this fashion.see,in re,wl bia drakes ashcroft,cir.therefore,even though ali mother is a citizen,ali does not qualify for automatic citizenship under the cca because he was over the age of eighteen on february,the cca effective date.dave,at,at.the cca thus does not protect ali against removal.
withholding of removal 
ali also seeks review of his denied withholding of removal claim.as indicated in his notice to appear,ali was deemed removable under the ina for having been convicted,after admission to the united states,of an aggravated felony.specifically,ali was convicted of a felony relating to the illicit trafficking of a controlled substance under ina a a iii,a a iii a controlled substance offense under ina a b i,a b i and two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out a single scheme of criminal misconduct under ina a a ii,a a ii.
before we may review the bia denial of ali request for withholding of removal,however,we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to do so.section a c of title of the united states code strips us of jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable by virtue of having committed certain criminal offenses.however,that provision does not bar our jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction.we also have jurisdiction to determine whether an alien is being removed for a permissible reason.bosede ashcroft,cir.see also sandoval ins,cir.therefore,we first examine ali criminal offenses.second,we analyze whether the criminal offenses preclude ali statutory eligibility for withholding of removal.
as the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion,we review the ij ruling denying ali withholding of removal as the final agency decision.vladimirova,at.we review the ij decision under the substantial evidence standard,which requires us to affirm the decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ememe,at.the ij found that ali wisconsin conviction for possession with intent to distribute thc constituted illicit trafficking in a controlled substance or a drug trafficking crime.consequently,the ij regarded ali as an aggravated felon which under a a iii rendered him deportable.ali claims that he is no longer an aggravated felon,because wisconsin amended his conviction from a felony to a simple misdemeanor.however,after ali later appeal to the bia on a motion to reconsider which we will discuss in a moment,the board concluded in its july,opinion that although wisconsin modified ali conviction from a felony of possession with intent to distribute thc to a misdemeanor for simple possession of thc,ali remained convicted of an aggravated felony for immigration purposes.the bia relied on matter of pickering,for its decision.in pickering,the bia ruled that if a court vacates an alien conviction for reasons solely related to rehabilitation or immigration hardships,as opposed to responding to procedural or substantive defects in the underlying criminal proceedings,then the alien remains convicted for immigration purposes.id.at.
while we give deference to the bia interpretation of the statutes it administers,marquez,cir citing chevron,natural resources defense council,d,we apply de novo review to the legal question of whether ali criminal acts constitute an aggravated felony under federal law,cir.title a b includes in its definition of aggravated felony illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.section c of title of the united states code in turn defines drug trafficking crime as any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et c.thus,a state conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver is both a drug trafficking crime and an aggravated felony under the ina if it is punishable under the controlled substances act csa and qualifies as a felony.the csa regards thc as a controlled substance,schedule i subsection c,and clearly prohibits its possession with the intent to distribute.see a.
we now turn to whether possession with intent to deliver thc is a felony under federal law.the csa defines felony as any federal or state offense classified by applicable federal or state law as a felony.see also defining felony drug offense as an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the united states or of a state that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs,marihuana,or depressant or stimulant substances.pursuant to a plea of nolo contendere,ali was convicted of possession of grams or less of thc with intent to deliver,in violation of wisconsin statute h.a violation of this statute is a class i felony under wisconsin law.because of ali prior conviction for receiving stolen property in violation of wisconsin statute a,ali was eligible for an enhanced sentence of not more than three years under wisconsin statute a as a repeat offender.therefore,ali wisconsin conviction for possession with intent to deliver fits the federal definition for a drug trafficking crime and aggravated felony.
there still remains the question of what effect wisconsin amendment of ali felony conviction should have on his immigration status.as resolution of this question involves our review of the bia interpretation of the statutes it administers,under chevron,we must first determine whether congress has spoken directly on the issue before us,and if so,whether congressional intent on that issue is clear.at.in pickering,the bia interpreted the ina definition of convicted,which the ina defines as follows 
the term conviction means,with respect to an alien,a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court,or if adjudication has been withheld,where i a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt,and ii the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the liberty to be imposed.
a a.the parties have not directed us to a federal statute describing the effect a conviction modified to avoid immigration hardships should have on deportation proceedings,nor have we identified any on our own therefore,we must determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,id.at,remembering that a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency,id.at.we agree with the holdings of several of our sister circuits on this issue and consequently do not find the bia reading of a a to be unreasonable.see,cir holding that a vacated federal conviction remained valid for immigration purposes,cir holding that a state conviction vacated solely to avoid deportation and the subsequent hardship to alien family remained a conviction for deportation purposes zaitona,cir finding a federal conviction vacated to avoid deportation would not be recognized for immigration purposes.see also gill ashcroft,cir finding a state conviction dismissed pursuant to state rehabilitative statutory scheme,and not because of any procedural or substantive defect in the conviction,remained a conviction for immigration purposes.
as the bia reading of a a is not unreasonable,we must defer to it,at marquez,at,as we have done elsewhere,see,sandoval,at relying on bia rulings matter of kaneda,wl bia and matter of,interim decision,wl bia to hold that an alien whose conviction had been modified because of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea stage did not remain convicted for immigration purposes.
the bia pickering decision is fatal to ali request for relief from removal.ali conviction satisfies the two prongs of the federal definition of conviction as outlined in a a.the two prongs within a a are that ali entered a guilty or nolo contendere plea and that the judge ordered some form of punishment.ali pleaded no contest to the possession of thc with intent to deliver charge.in addition,ali was sentenced to three years probation and a suspension of his license.
in their stipulated motion to amend ali conviction,the wisconsin district attorney and ali counsel made explicit their ultimate aim b y amending the felony conviction to that of a misdemeanor,the defendant would avert his pending deportation from the united states of america.it was upon this stipulated motion that the dane county circuit court issued its order amending ali conviction to simple misdemeanor possession of thc.it is therefore,obvious that ali conviction was amended simply to avoid deportation.on these facts and under the bia decision in pickering,ali remains convicted of an aggravated felony for immigration purposes 
ali points to sandoval in an attempt to support his argument that this court should consider only his modified conviction for misdemeanor possession of thc when evaluating his immigration status.however,that case is readily distinguishable.the petitioner in sandoval presented a cognizable ineffective assistance of counsel claim.this ineffective assistance of counsel claim effectively questioned the voluntariness of sandoval guilty plea.here,there is no procedural or substantive defect in ali conviction.therefore,sandoval does not apply to ali 
even though ali remains convicted of an aggravated felony for immigration purposes,his removal from the united states is not automatic as he may be saved by withholding of removal.we have jurisdiction to determine whether the bia properly found a criminal alien ineligible for withholding of removal.bosede,at.withholding of removal is governed by statute,b a this relief is not discretionary.if an alien meets the statutory criteria,the attorney general must withhold removal,d.however,the statutory entitlement is limited by b b ii,which excepts from relief aliens who have
