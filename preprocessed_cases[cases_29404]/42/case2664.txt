yvonne wigglesworth last entered the united states pursuant to the visa waiver pilot program vwpp,which allows visitors from certain countries to enter the united states without a visa for a stay of ninety days or less.see.the immigration and naturalization service ins instituted deportation proceedings against wigglesworth,but later realized that it improvidently had commenced those proceedings because,as a condition of entering under the vwpp,wigglesworth had waived her right to a deportation proceeding.the immigration judge ij agreed and granted the ins motion to terminate the proceedings,a decision that was affirmed by the board of immigration appeals bia.wigglesworth now appeals and seeks an order from this court to reinstate the proceedings and require the ins to process her application for suspension of deportation.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we dismiss the appeal.
backgrounda.facts 
yvonne wigglesworth was born in denmark and is a citizen of sweden.she has resided in the united states since june,with two interruptions.in,she returned to sweden for a period of approximately one year to serve a sentence for trafficking in hashish.she returned to the united states in.after her return,she left the united states only once in,for a period of three weeks,she visited her ailing mother in sweden.
prior to her first departure from the united states in,wigglesworth married an united states citizen,charles wigglesworth.they have one child,kristina,born in january.
in,wigglesworth filed a petition for alien relative form for his wife.the ins approved this petition on january.in,the wigglesworths went to an immigration consulting agency called servicio continental to inquire about adjusting wigglesworth immigration status to that of a lawful permanent resident.the agency apparently told wigglesworth that,in order to complete the application,she first would need to establish that she had entered the united states legally by obtaining a new departure record to replace the one that was misplaced after her reentry.although it is unclear from the record exactly what was communicated to her,wigglesworth was left with the impression that she would be able to reenter the united states without a visa pursuant to the vwpp and thereafter pursue an adjustment of status.
seeing this situation as an opportunity both to obtain the necessary entry documents as well as visit her mother,wigglesworth left the united states for sweden.when she returned to the united states three weeks later,she entered pursuant to the vwpp,which allows visitors from certain countries to enter the united states without a visa and stay for up to ninety days.in order to be admitted under the vwpp,the visitor must waive any right to contest,other than on the basis of an application for asylum,any action for deportation against the alien.b.prior to reentering the united states,wigglesworth executed a version of form,the visa waiver pilot program information form the form contains a section identified as a waiver of rights it states 
i hereby waive any and all rights to review of or appeal from an immigration officer determination as to my admissibility,or to contest,other than on the basis of an application for asylum,any action for deportation.specifically,i am waiving my rights to a hearing before an immigration judge to determine my admissibility or deportability an administrative appeal to the board of immigration appeals and the judicial review of any or all of the above decisions.
see ins submission of october.the form also contains a section entitled certification,which states in relevant part i certify that i have read and understood all the questions and statements on this form.id 
administrative proceedings 
after entering the united states pursuant to the vwpp,wigglesworth filed an form to adjust her status to that of a lawful resident alien.the following month,and wigglesworth appeared at the chicago office of the ins for an interview on the application.the ins denied her application on the ground that she was excludable from the united states as a result of her controlled substance conviction.the ins issued a order and a notice of hearing.wigglesworth appeared pursuant to notice,and the hearing was continued so that she could obtain counsel and apply for suspension of deportation.
in december,wigglesworth appeared with her attorney for the hearing,conceded deportability pursuant to the order to show cause and applied for suspension of deportation.after receiving evidence,the ij took the case under advisement.while the case was pending before the ij,the ins filed a motion to terminate the proceedings on the basis that the district director exercises sole jurisdiction over determinations of deportability in the cases of aliens who were admitted to the united states pursuant to section of the act,the vwpp.prior to the ij ruling on its motion,the ins arrested wigglesworth at her home in order to deport her.wigglesworth then petitioned the ij for a stay of deportation pending a decision on the motion to terminate.the ij granted the stay.apparently on word that the ins would not abide by the stay issued by the ij,wigglesworth also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court.the district court granted the petition and ordered the ins to release wigglesworth while the administrative proceedings were pending.
on july,the ij granted the ins motion to terminate the deportation proceedings as having been commenced improvidently insofar as the vwpp regulations required a determination of deportability without commencement of a deportation proceeding.although the ij acknowledged that he could not reach the question of the constitutionality of the vwpp,he believed that,given the facts of the case,it would be hard to conclude that the respondent knowingly and intelligently waived her right to a hearing when she last entered.
wigglesworth appealed this order,and the bia affirmed.it stated 
on appeal,the respondent argues that the immigration judge erred in finding her ineligible for suspension of deportation based upon her entry pursuant to the visa waiver pilot program vwpp.we agree with the immigration judge that she is ineligible for suspension of deportation based upon her vwpp entry.the immigration and nationality act and the applicable regulations clearly indicate that an alien admitted as a visa waiver pilot program visitor waives any right to contest any action for deportation,other than on the basis of an application for asylum in the united states as provided in section of the act.
as the respondent was admitted as a visitor under the vwpp,she waived her right to contest any action for deportation other than asylum.therefore,we affirm the immigration judge decision finding the adult respondent was barred from applying for suspension of deportation under section of the act and.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the immigration judge ordering the deportation proceedings terminated.

wigglesworth filed a timely petition for review with this court.
before this court,wigglesworth requests that we vacate the order of the bia and remand this case to the ij to complete the proceedings,including a determination of wigglesworth application for suspension of deportation.the ins argues,however,that we can not consider wigglesworth petition for review for two reasons wigglesworth waived her right to contest her deportation when she entered the country pursuant to the vwpp and g precludes judicial review of discretionary decisions to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders.we consider these arguments below.
waiver of rights 
the vwpp allows visitors from certain countries to enter the united states without a visa if they meet certain qualifications,such as the alien possesses a transportation ticket and has been determined not to represent a threat to the welfare,health,safety,or security of the united states.a.in return for being admitted pursuant to this streamlined procedure,the alien must waive certain rights,see itaeva ins,cir specifically the vwpp provides 
b waiver of rights 
an alien may not be provided a waiver under the pilot program unless the alien has waived any right 
to review or appeal under this chapter of an immigration officer determination as to the admissibility of the alien at the port of entry into the united states,or 
to contest,other than on the basis of an application for asylum,any action for deportation against the alien.
prior to being admitted to this country,wigglesworth signed a version of form,which contained an explicit waiver as well as a certification that the signor had read and understood the form.thus,there is no question that wigglesworth waived her rights to contest her deportation.furthermore,there is no question that both in the terminated proceedings before the ij,as well as in this court,wigglesworth seeks to contest her deportation on a basis other than asylum specifically,she seeks relief by way of suspension of deportation.as two of our sister circuits already have determined,such a challenge is specifically forbidden by the language of the statute.see itaeva,at nose attorney,cir.because wigglesworth waived her right to contest her deportation except on the basis of asylum,she has waived her right to contest the ins disposition of her application for suspension of deportation or the termination of her deportation hearing 
constitutional challenge 
wigglesworth also presents a constitutional challenge to the vwpp.specifically,she argues that it violates her rights to due process by depriving her of a hearing where she has not knowingly or intelligently waived such hearing on her right to remain in the united states.petitioner br.at.we must determine whether this claim is properly before us.
this court has acknowledged that,when judicial review is otherwise foreclosed by statute,jurisdiction remains in this court to raise substantial constitutional questions.see,singh reno,cir.in singh,we reiterated our holding in laguerre reno,cir 
as we explained in laguerre,direct review in the courts of appeals remains an option for aliens wishing to challenge their deportation on constitutional grounds.thus,judicial review is curtailed as congress intended,but enough of a safety valve is left to enable judicial correction of bizarre miscarriages of justice.
singh,at quoting laguerre,at.as we noted,this safety valve exists in instances in which judicial review is curtailed.we must evaluate,therefore,whether wigglesworth had a means of challenging the deportation order issued by the ins under the vwpp.
although the record is unclear exactly as to when the ins determined that wigglesworth was deportable and issued a final order of deportation pursuant to the vwpp,it made this determination at least prior to the date that she was taken into custody for purposes of deportation,february.consequently,we look to the judicial review provisions in effect at that time,specifically,to determine what means were available to wigglesworth to challenge her deportation order 
in general,the former sets forth the judicial review procedures only for final orders of deportation issued pursuant to administrative procedures contained in b,specifically an administrative hearing before an ij and an appeal to the bia.however,a determination that an individual was deportable under the vwpp was a determination made by the district director of the of the typical proceedings before an ij.indeed,the regulations implementing the vwpp make clear that the determination is made without referral of the alien to immigration proceedings 
c determination of deportability.an alien who has been admitted to the united states under the provisions of section of the act and of this part who is determined by an immigration officer to be deportable from the united states under one or more of the deportation grounds listed in section of the act shall be removed from the united states to his or her country of nationality or last residence.such removal for deportation shall be determined by the district director who has jurisdiction over the place where the alien is found,and shall be effected without referral of the alien to an immigration judge for a determination of deportability,except that an alien admitted as a visa waiver pilot program visitor who applies for asylum in the united states must be referred to an immigration judge for a determination of deportability.
emphasis added.
the former,however,acknowledged the possibility that an individual could be under the threat of deportation from an order that did not originate through proceedings before an ij.the statute therefore provided that the procedure set forth therein was the sole and exclusive procedure for the judicial review of all final orders of deportation made pursuant to administrative proceedings under section b except that any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas proceedings.a emphasis added.therefore,under the former a,aliens held pursuant to any order of deportation,regardless of how or from whom the order issued,could employ habeas as a means of challenging the deportation because the determination that wigglesworth was deportable was not made through deportation proceedings before an ij pursuant to b,her remedy for purposes of challenging that order was through a writ of habeas corpus as contemplated by a.
wigglesworth recognizes the possibility that a district court,as opposed to a court of appeals,is the proper forum to air her constitutional challenge.she therefore urges this court to transfer her petition to a district court pursuant to if we conclude that she has raised her arguments in the wrong forum.
section states 
whenever a civil action is filed in a court as defined in section of this title or an appeal,including a petition for review of administrative action,is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed,and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court from which it is transferred.
although is not cast in discretionary terms the court shall transfer,this court has stated that there is no reason to raise false hopes and waste judicial resources by transferring a case that is clearly doomed phillips seiter,cir.
a court is authorized to consider the consequences of transfer before deciding whether to transfer that is implicit in the statute grant of authority to make such a decision,and implies in turn that the court can take a peek at the merits,since whether or not the suit has any possible merit bears significantly on whether the court should transfer or dismiss it.
id.at internal citation omitted.we,therefore,take a peek at the merits of wigglesworth constitutional claim to see if transferring to the district court is in the interest of justice.
wigglesworth argues that the vwpp violates her rights to due process of law and points to cases from the supreme court and this court that establish that those who have entered this country the right to a fair hearing prior to being deported.because this right to a fair hearing is a constitutional right,she continues,any waiver of that right has to be knowing and voluntary.she further maintains that,when she waived her right to a hearing before an ij,her waiver was not knowingly made.consequently,in her view,the vwpp,as applied to these circumstances,violates her rights to due process.wigglesworth points to nose in support of her argument.
in nose,the fifth circuit considered the validity of nose waiver pursuant to the vwpp.it began its analysis by observing that g enerally,even aliens who have entered the united states unlawfully are assured the protection of the fifth amendment due process clause,including the right to a hearing before an immigration judge before being deported.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.furthermore,it continued,a ltho
