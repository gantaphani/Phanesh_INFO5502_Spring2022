friedrich was born in romania in.in,he attempted to join the wehrmacht german armed forces but was denied entry because he was not a german citizen.he instead volunteered for the schutzstaffel ss,and began active duty in october.following basic training,friedrich was assigned to the death head battalion at the concentration camp in poland.had approximately prisoners when friedrich arrived in january.the prisoners were used as slave labor in a nearby stone quarry and received inadequate food,clothing,and medical care.nearly died in the first five months of.
in august,friedrich and other guards marched approximately prisoners from to the dyhenfurth concentration camp.friedrich remained as a guard at dyhenfurth until the camp was evacuated in january.at that time,friedrich and other guards marched approximately prisoners more than thirty miles back to.the winter march took several days and the prisoners slept without blankets in open fields.was evacuated the following month,and friedrich was among the guards who escorted approximately prisoners to the flossenbürg concentration camp.after walking for nearly a day,the prisoners were loaded onto unheated cattle cars for a rail trip that lasted more than a day.the prisoners were not provided with food or sanitation facilities during the trip and many did not survive.friedrich served as a guard upon his arrival at flossenbürg.when the camp was evacuated in april,friedrich accompanied prisoners on a march to the dachau concentration camp.during the march,american soldiers overtook the group and friedrich fled unnoticed.
in,the united states began admitting certain european refugees for permanent residence,without regard to regular immigration quotas,under the displaced persons act dpa,stat.persons who had assisted the enemy in persecuting civilians were ineligible for visas under the dpa.see fedorenko united states,d.two years later,congress amended the dpa to provide in relevant part that 
no visas shall be issued under the provisions of this act to any person who advocated or assisted in the persecution of any person because of race,religion,or natural origin.

no visa shall be issued under this act to any person who personally advocated or assisted in the persecution of any person or group of persons because of race,religion,or national origin.

in,friedrich applied for a visa under the rra.he stated in his visa application that he had been in the german army from to but made no mention of his service with the ss or his duty at the concentration camps.friedrich was granted a visa in and subsequently was naturalized in.after learning of friedrich involvement with the ss,the united states sought to revoke his citizenship under section a of the immigration and nationality act of,codified at a.the district court granted summary judgment to the government and revoked friedrich citizenship.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.mayer nextel west,cir.in ruling on a motion for summary judgment,the court is required to view the facts in the light most favorable to the party and must give that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts.id.
the government carries a heavy burden of proof in a denaturalization proceeding and evidence justifying revocation of citizenship must be clear,unequivocal,and convincing.fedorenko,at.nonetheless,an illegally procured naturalization may be set aside.id.at.a naturalization is illegally procured if an applicant fails to comply strictly with all of the congressionally imposed prerequisites to the acquisition of citizenship id.one of these statutory prerequisites is that an applicant has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.united states negele,cir quoting a.an individual is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence if he entered the country without a valid immigration visa.id.
in fedorenko,the supreme court concluded that under the plain language of the dpa,an individual service as a concentration camp armed voluntary or him ineligible for a visa.at.as friedrich points out,however,fedorenko and nearly all other cases involving revocation of citizenship actions against former members or supporters of the nazi regime arose under the dpa,not the rra.the only case to address the rra in this context is united states lileikis.friedrich primary legal argument is the same raised by the defendant in lileikis that the rra addition of the modifier personally to the dpa prohibition against advocating or assisting in persecution decreased the class of individuals ineligible for permanent residence.id.at 
friedrich contends that in light of the need to impart some meaning to the word personally,we should interpret it to require that an applicant must have had a subjective mental intent to engage in persecution.a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as having their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.united states fountain,cir.we agree with the district court that nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word personally suggests that it connotes having a subjective mental intent about.
friedrich also asserts that there is no evidence that he engaged in individual acts of a persecutory nature such as whipping or beating.this argument misconstrues the statutory language.qualifying words or clauses refer to the next preceding antecedent except when evident sense and meaning require a different construction.mandina united states,cir citing karl llewellyn,the common law tradition.accordingly,the modifier personally refers to advocated and assisted which are connected by the disjunctive or the pertinent question is therefore whether friedrich personally assisted in persecution,not whether he engaged in direct persecution 
we accept as true for purposes of our review friedrich contentions that he never saw a prisoner escape,never harmed a prisoner,never discharged his weapon while guarding prisoners,and never saw any prisoners die during the forced evacuation marches.friedrich admitted,however,that he served as a death head guard at the concentration camps and during forced marches,that he was armed during these duties,and that he had strict orders to shoot prisoners attempting to escape.
we have recently observed in a slightly different context that an armed death head concentration camp guard,by impeding prisoners escape through his presence,was actively and personally involved in persecution.negele ashcroft,cir involving removal under the holtzman amendment,a e.we see no reason to reach a different conclusion here.history provides us with a description of the conditions at flossenbürg,one of the camps at which friedrich armed presence impeded the escape of prisoners 
flossenbürg concentration camp can best be described as a factory dealing in death.although this camp had in view the primary object of putting to work the mass slave labour,another of its primary objects was the elimination of human lives by the methods employed in handling the prisoners.hunger and starvation rations,sadism,inadequate clothing,medical neglect,disease,beatings,hangings,freezing,forced suicides,shooting,all played a major role in obtaining their object.prisoners were murdered at random spite killings against jews were common,injections of poison and shooting in the neck were everyday occurrences epidemics of typhus and spotted fever were permitted to run rampant as a means of eliminating prisoners life in this camp meant nothing.killing became a common thing,so common that a quick death was welcomed by the unfortunate ones.
