petitioners seek review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying them asylum,individually and as a married couple,from eritrea and ethiopia.finding no reversible error,we deny the petition for review.
background 
comprising ethiopia,eritrea,somalia,and sudan,the region known as the horn of africa has a troubled history.after world war ii,italy relinquished control of its african colonies,including eritrea.in,the united nations federated eritrea with ethiopia.in the early,ethiopia dissolved the federation and annexed eritrea as a province.factions in the eritrean province began clamoring for independence almost immediately and fought a brutal war with the ethiopian government.these factions later joined forces with ethiopian groups seeking political reform to secure the overthrow of the marxist regime of mengistu haile mariam in.
once the mengistu regime was overthrown,ethiopian leaders permitted a national referendum on eritrean independence in.registration to vote in the referendum was tied to verification of eritrean nationality through a detailed form with information about a voter religious affiliation,parents and grandparents,and references from three eritrean citizens.more than one million voters,living in over forty different countries,selected independence by a huge majority.eritrea,supported by the new ethiopian government,declared independence in may.
relations between ethiopia and its new neighbor proved cordial.after several years,however,border disputes led to war in may.at the outbreak of war,the legal status of the approximately voters in the eritrean independence election who continued to live in ethiopia remained uncertain,and in june ethiopia began forcibly removing to eritrea people who had voted in the election.the deportations occurred without due process.the deportees were often forced to stay in detention camps briefly,and ethiopia regularly scheduled the deportations piecemeal to break up families 
petitioner senait kidane tesfamichael and her family were among those forcibly removed from ethiopia.senait parents were originally from the eritrean region,but senait was born and lived in addis ababa,ethiopia,until the deportations.at her asylum hearing,senait testified credibly that she heard of the deportations in and feared removal.shortly after the deportations began,senait and her ethiopian husband,petitioner dawit,attempted to escape out of ethiopia,possibly to kenya.their escape plans were foiled,however.on a bus near the kenyan border,police asked the passengers for identification.senait could not produce any,as authorities had stripped her of her ethiopian id following her vote in the eritrean referendum dawit intervened on senait behalf,but his intervention led to both his and senait arrest and detention.
as he credibly testified,dawit spent a month in jail for the purported crime of smuggling eritreans.until his mother secured his release through a bond,he slept in one room with up to forty men,received little food,and saw other detainees with bruises caused,he believed,by beatings.while in jail,dawit was interrogated generally once or twice a day,for one or two hours,about how many people he had smuggled and how much he charged.
dawit was able to secure senait release one week after his own by bribing officials.back in addis ababa,dawit was twice stopped by police both times dawit cooperated and was released.fearing reprisal for his help to senait,and without reporting to court on the pending smuggling charges,dawit fled alone to kenya,then south africa,where he lived from to.
ethiopian authorities found senait in june and removed her to eritrea senait testified that she spent three days in a detention center without food or water,then was forced to walk nine kilometers in an area filled with land mines on the way to eritrea.there,senait reconnected with her family and worked at a gas station.she testified that she was occasionally taunted or told to go back to ethiopia.she also claims that she was denied full eritrean citizenship and an exit visa,and that she feared military conscription.
in,two years after senait had been removed to eritrea,and after the war ended dawit sent for her.without an exit visa,senait had to be smuggled out of eritrea.she traveled through sudan and swaziland before reuniting with dawit in south africa.there,the couple stayed for a year until they were robbed and burglarized,crimes which scared senait,and they decided to leave.after traveling through cuba,nicaragua,guatemala,and mexico,the couple arrived in the united states in march.
senait and dawit entered the united states without visas,and they conceded removability pursuant to a a i.an immigration judge ij found them ineligible for asylum,withholding of deportation,and relief under the convention against torture cat.a single judge of the bia affirmed.
discussion 
the conflict precipitated a rash of asylum seekers entering the united states although petitioners are sympathetic victims of this conflict,the bia and this court must analyze their claims statutorily.if petitioners do not qualify for asylum,the bia correctly rejected their claims 
this court reviews the bia legal conclusions de novo.girma,cir ashcroft,cir.we will defer to the bia interpretation of immigration regulations if the interpretation is reasonable,at.the bia factual findings are upheld if supported by substantial evidence,long gonzales,cir,that is,unless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find otherwise.id.
to qualify for asylum,an alien must be a refugee.see a.the immigration and naturalization act defines a refugee as a person unable to return to his or her country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.past persecution entails harm inflicted on the alien on account of a statutorily enumerated ground by the government or forces that a government is unable or unwilling to control.b.the alternative asylum ground,a fear of persecution,results when a reasonable person in the same circumstances would fear persecution if deported.jukic ins,cir.
in either case,to establish persecution,the alien harm or suffering need not be physical,but may take other forms,such as the deliberate imposition of severe economic disadvantage or the deprivation of liberty,food,housing,employment or other essentials of life.ins,cir quoting matter of laipenieks,i n,bia citations omitted.nevertheless,
i t does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair,unjust or even unlawful or unconstitutional.if persecution were defined that expansively,a significant percentage of the world population would qualify for asylum in this it seems most unlikely that congress intended such a result.
majd gonzales,cir quoting gonzales,cir.
the petitioners each bring an individual claim for asylum.additionally,they bring a claim for asylum on the basis that they will be separated if removed to their respective countries.if we find error in the bia decision in resolving any of the claims,we must remand,as senait and dawit would have derivative claims for relief based on their marriage 
senait claim 
the bia held that senait was a citizen of eritrea,firmly resettled in eritrea,and unable to show past persecution or a fear of persecution if returned to eritrea.
senait takes issue with this reasoning and would have us consider her a refugee from ethiopia based on ethiopia forced deportation policy,which sent her to eritrea.this claim falters under the facts and the plain language of the statute.as was just noted,aliens who seek asylum must meet the definition of a refugee.see a see also eduard ashcroft,cir.the statute defines a refugee as including 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality or,in the case of a person having no nationality,is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided,and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
a a emphasis added.the statute thus permits an alien to seek asylum from only one test country that of the alien nationality,or,if the alien is stateless,that of the country where the alien last habitually resided.wangchuck dep t of homeland,cir noting the error in the bia assumption that an alien could be eligible for asylum based on a fear of persecution in either of two countries.in senait case,the bia adjudicated her asylum claim with reference to eritrea.if the bia decision to use eritrea as senait test country is supported by substantial evidence,any persecution that senait allegedly faced in ethiopia is irrelevant under the statute.
a national is a person owing permanent allegiance to a state.a.senait has never argued that she is still an ethiopian national,as she was divested of ethiopian citizenship.moreover,in her asylum application,senait filled in eritrea as her presented nationality citizenship.nationality is a status conferred by a state.dhoumo bia,cir paripovic gonzales,cir petitioner was rendered stateless by the dissolution of the former yugoslavia.the bia implicit reliance on senait concession that she is not an ethiopian national is hard to criticize 
the bia found that senait was a citizen of eritrea and firmly resettled there senait argues that she could not have been firmly resettled in eritrea because,as an ethiopian deportee,she was not granted the same rights as eritreans.yet the only thing this argument can do is force senait asylum claim into the statelessness rubric if senait is a national of eritrea,her asylum claim must be decided through eritrea.if senait is not a national of eritrea,her asylum claims must be decided through the country where she last habitually resided.that country turns out also to be eritrea.
by finding that senait was firmly resettled in eritrea,the bia implicitly found that senait last habitual residency was eritrea,or,in any event,not ethiopia.al najjar ashcroft,cir approving an implicit finding of last habitual residence.substantial evidence supports such a finding under any plausible definition of last habitual residence 
the immigration law defines residence as the place of general abode,which is a person principal,actual dwelling in fact,without regard to intent.a.senait has not lived in ethiopia since june,and she did not arrive in the united states until march.for more than two years,she lived in eritrea with her mother,some of her siblings,and,while he was alive,her father.she also was employed as a gas station cashier with mobil oil.after living in eritrea,senait lived briefly in south africa with dawit,but they chose to move away from there.
significantly,senait asylum application indicates that she perceived eritrea to be her test country.the form asks please list your last address where you lived before coming to the.if this is not the country where you fear persecution,also list the last address in the country where you fear persecution.emphasis added.senait furnished addresses in south africa and eritrea she omitted ethiopia.further,when asked if she feared harm if returned to her home country,she responded by invoking hardships in eritrea,not ethiopia.
these facts belie any notion that ethiopia is senait last habitual residence the bia determination to use eritrea as her test country is supported by substantial evidence.
senait next challenges the bia decision that she did not suffer past persecution and lacks a reasonable fear of future persecution in eritrea senait argues that the eritrean government regularly commits human rights violations the eritrean government required senait,unlike native eritreans,to carry a card that identified her as an ethiopian refugee she was denied an exit visa she has a vulnerable social status as an ethiopian refugee and she was harassed and discriminated against by the eritrean government.on these points,the bia explained that senait only individualized complaint was that customers at the gas station where she worked made remarks threatening that those born in ethiopia should be sent back there,and that t hese incidents and alleged discrimination against eritreans from ethiopia fall short of persecution.further,the bia noted that there was no evidence that senait was treated differently than eritreans by the government.
the bia decision is supported by substantial evidence.senait fears fall far short of the required extreme conduct needed to establish persecution.her only complaint of individualized harassment stemmed from a few incidents where she was taunted at work.persecution can not be based on mere denigration,harassment,and threats.eduard ashcroft,cir see also id.at persecution requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation quoting mikhailevitch ins,cir.petitioners also point to their expert affidavit that eritreans from ethiopia are treated harshly,are unduly discriminated against,and are blamed for hardships.as the expert conceded,however,many eritrean problems are undoubtedly effects of the economic hardships caused by the war overall.eduard holds that n either discrimination nor harassment ordinarily amounts to persecution under the ina,even if the conduct amounts to morally reprehensible discrimination on the basis of race or religion.id.at.finally,the fact that eritrea denied senait an exit visa does not on this record establish persecution the totality of the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to that of the bia.
dawit claim 
dawit asylum claim is premised on his arrest,detention,and charge for violating ethiopia travel laws by smuggling eritreans.these acts,he asserts,amounted to past persecution on account of his social group and imputed political opinions.in providing parameters for the term persecution,the bia has stated 
while punishment of criminal conduct in itself is not persecution,where that punishment entails such things as severe beatings or being sent to a nazi concentration,is excessive or arbitrary and is motivated by one of the specified grounds,such punishment would constitute persecution under immigration laws.
at quoting laipenieks,i n at.in this case,the bia held that dawit punishment would be prosecution for a criminal act,not persecution.
based on the record,substantial evidence supports the bia determination that dawit did not experience past persecution.dawit encountered ethiopian law enforcement three times.first,he was arrested and detained for a month when he and senait were stopped at the kenyan border near the beginning of the border war,and he was charged with smuggling.the detention was under unpleasant and unduly prolonged but not brutal conditions.later,he was stopped twice in addis ababa and his bag was searched.on neither of these latter occasions,however,could dawit affirm whether the police were aware of the pending criminal charges or were conducting planned surveillance on him.
not only do these law enforcement encounters fail to rise to the level of physical persecution,compare,at,but it is also unclear whether they were motivated by political or social group animus against dawit.there is no explanation in the record for his being accosted in addis ababa.and as to the smuggling charge,when two countries are at war,it is not invariably persecution for each sovereign to control the travel of persons it believes may harbor sympathy for the enemy or who might flee the country to fight on the other side.the background of dawit detention,of course,is the forced deportations and denationalization that both ethiopia and eritrea carried out against their resident ethnic minority and that other courts have asked the bia to evaluate for asylum purposes.see haile,at.still,there is no direct connection between his criminal charge and the ethnic cleansing,while there is an obvious purpose in a country enforcement of passport and travel laws during wartime.
dawit argues that he was singled out for prosecution because,when he identified himself as senait husband,the authorities knew his political opinions and sought to punish him as a sympathizer with eritreans.t
