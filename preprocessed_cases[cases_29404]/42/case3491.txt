applicants for asylum must show by clear and convincing evidence that they filed their applications within one year after arrival in the united states,absent changed or extraordinary circumstances.see a b the heart of petitioner nirmal singh argument on appeal is that his credible testimony does not require corroboration to establish by clear and convincing evidence that his asylum application was timely.see id.nonetheless,the board of immigration appeals bia decided that singh could be required to provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony,citing b b ii,a completely different statutory provision that governs proof of an applicant status as a refugee we agreed to rehear this case en banc to clarify whether the bia erred in imposing the corroboration provision found in b b ii on singh showing of timely filing under a b basic principles of statutory construction lead us to conclude that the bia improperly imported the corroboration requirement of b b ii governing demonstration of refugee status into a b requiring applications to be timely filed 
section b b ii applies to the merits of an asylum claim,not to the filing deadline for asylum applications.the provision is governed by a b,which is silent on the issue of corroboration.it may seem harmless to gloss over the language of the statute,but doing so would do a disservice to our charge to interpret the statute as written.
further,the corroboration requirement is not without consequence.this burden is not illusory,as the bar determination is not reviewable absent a legal or constitutional question.see a,a d.in keeping with the supreme court mandate to look to the language of the statute itself,ransom fia card,we grant the petition and remand the matter to the bia 
background 
nirmal singh is an indian citizen and former resident of that nation punjab state.singh maintains that as a result of his political activities and affiliation,he was arrested and tortured on four occasions.according to singh,after his fourth confrontation with authorities,a police officer told him if you want to save your life,leave india.singh claims that he took the officer advice and shortly after fled to canada.singh asserts that he arrived in canada,using a false passport,on october.he says he stayed there for approximately ten days before entering the united states without inspection on or about october.in the fall of,singh filed for asylum 
at his hearing before the ij,singh conceded his removability and sought asylum.the ij rejected singh request for asylum as untimely filed.although the ij made no adverse credibility finding,he found singh testimony insufficient to establish his last date of entry into the united states by clear and convincing evidence.in so ruling,the ij noted that singh had provided no documentation corroborating his claim that he entered this country on october.without an established date of entry,singh could not prove that he filed his application within year after the date of his arrival in the united states.a b.
singh appealed to the bia,which invoked the corroboration provision of b b ii and concluded that singh application was because he failed to provide corroboration of his date of entry.according to the bia,a lthough the respondent has claimed on appeal that his credible testimony should have been sufficient to meet his burden of proving his date of entry,the statute specifically provides that,in determining whether an asylum applicant has met his burden of proof,the trier of fact may require an applicant to provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony.quoting b b ii.singh timely petitioned this court for review.
ii.jurisdiction to review the legal question presented.
we first consider whether we have jurisdiction to review the bia timeliness determination.subject to certain exceptions,an individual application for asylum will be considered only if the applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within year after the date of the alien arrival in the united states.a b.section a states that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under a.read together,these provisions appear to deprive this court of jurisdiction over determinations that an individual failed to file his application within one year of entering this country.see hakeem ins,cir.
despite this jurisdictional limitation,the real id act of restores our jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law.ramadan gonzales,cir per curiam quoting fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir see also a d nothing in any other provision of this chapter which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.singh claims that,because his testimony was deemed credible,the agency committed a legal error by requiring corroboration.because this is a legal argument about how to construe b b ii,and not a factual argument about whether the evidence proved singh date of entry,we have jurisdiction to review singh challenge.
iii.the one year filing deadline under b b ii does not include a statutory corroboration requirement.
we now turn to whether an immigration judge may require an asylum applicant to corroborate credible testimony that he complied with the filing deadline.the bia has not addressed this issue in a precedential decision.we therefore analyze the statute de novo,and begin with the statutory text.
section,entitled asylum,is divided into two subsections a addresses the authority to apply for asylum,and b governs the conditions for granting asylum.the first provision,subsection a,regulates whether an applicant can even get out of the starting gate to apply for asylum.an applicant who does not pass the threshold tests under a never gets to b.
the filing deadline for asylum applications is found in a b,which precludes applicants from applying for asylum unless they demonstrate by clear and convincing that they filed within year after the date of their arrival in the united states.subsection a also includes other requirements,such as physical presence or arrival in the united states,id.a,and the absence of disqualifying factors such as a safe third country to which the individual may be removed,id.a a,or a previously denied asylum application,id.a c.none of the threshold requirements found in a references corroboration or documentary evidence.
congress imposed the filing deadline for asylum applicants as part of the illegal immigration reform and illegal immigrant responsibility act of,a,stat.congress later made additional revisions to asylum law through the real id act of,but the act did not amend a b the petitioner burden to demonstrate compliance with the deadline or add a corroboration provision of general applicability throughout the ina.see,stat.because congress declined to provide a corroboration provision applicable to the timely filing requirement in a,the question before us is whether congress addressed corroboration of timely filing in another statutory provision.the answer is no.
until the passage of the real id act,it was the law of this circuit that corroboration of an asylum applicant credible testimony with respect to refugee status could not be required.see aden holder,cir citing ladha ins,cir kataria ins,cir.with the real id act,congress abrogated our case law by adding to the ina three new,independent corroboration provisions one for asylum,one for withholding of removal,and one for all other forms of relief the corroboration provisions are virtually identical and none applies to the filing deadline 
the first provision is titled conditions for granting asylum and added b b ii.real id act of,a,stat.the bia and the dissent rely upon this provision,which allows adjudicators to request corroboration of an applicant testimony establishing refugee status where such corroboration is reasonably available,to conclude that singh failed to demonstrate compliance with the deadline due to the lack of corroborating evidence.see b b ii.
nothing in the text of the statute allows the corroboration provision of b b ii to be imported magically into a,the provision establishing the filing deadline.rather,the language of b b ii and its immediate statutory context mandate the opposite conclusion.see robinson shell oil,the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.see also ransom.at interpreting the statute based on the plain language and the statutory context and purpose.
subsection b governs the conditions for granting asylum,and covers the grant of asylum,not the authority simply to start the asylum process through an application.within b,the first subparagraph,b a,provides the agency the discretionary authority to grant asylum to an individual who has applied in accordance with the established requirements and procedures and who is a refugee within the meaning of a a.b a emphasis added.the next subparagraph,b b,is titled burden of proof and provides that t he burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee.id.b b i emphasis added.this clause refers exclusively to demonstrating that the applicant is a refugee under the statute.
the corroboration provision invoked by the bia,b b ii,follows in the next clause and is also linked to an applicant refugee status.under the heading sustaining burden,b b ii provides,in its entirety 
the testimony of the asylum applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant burden without corroboration,but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant testimony is credible,is persuasive,and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.in determining whether the applicant has met the applicant burden,the trier of fact may weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record.where the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony,such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and can not reasonably obtain the evidence.
emphasis added.this corroboration provision is linked by its and context directly to proof that the applicant is a refugee.id.b b ii emphasis added.the statutory definition of a refugee relates exclusively to whether the applicant has suffered past persecution or has a fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.id.a a.this definition of a refugee contains no to the procedural requirements for asylum,such as being physically present in the united states or filing a timely application.see id.in short,the corroboration language in subsection b stands independent of the timely filing deadline in subsection a.
this interpretation is sensible when considering the practical application of as a whole.subsection a lays out the predicate requirements that enable an individual to apply for asylum,including the filing deadline.id.a b.if the individual can not clear those hurdles,then subsection b does not apply at all.a sequential reading of the two statutory subsections,the plain language of each,and the focus of subsection b on refugee status all point to a single conclusion the refugee corroboration provision of subsection b does not apply to the time bar under subsection a the bia erred as a matter of law in applying b b ii to singh showing of timely filing,because that provision applies only to the merits of an asylum application,not to preliminary requirements such as timeliness.
as noted above,b was not the only corroboration provision added to the ina by the real id act.the second such corroboration provision is titled withholding of removal and added b c.stat.at.consistent with the text of the act,that provision governs applications for withholding of removal only.further,the corroboration provision codified at b c incorporates b b ii by reference,including the limitation to refugee status determinations.there is no basis for holding that the corroboration requirement applicable to withholding of removal claims would apply to singh asylum application.
the third provision is titled other requests for relief from removal and added c.stat.at.the overall structure of the act underscores that this provision is distinct from the preceding section and applies to all forms of relief from removal other than asylum or withholding of removal.because c does not apply to asylum applications,it follows that this section can not apply to singh asylum application.
at first glance,the act engenders some ambiguity on this point,because the codified portion of the act,entitled applications for relief from removal,does not contain the word other and refers to relief or protection from removal without qualification.c.looking only at the codified text of the act,it may appear at first glance that c could apply to all forms of relief from removal,including asylum and withholding of removal.but that conclusion can not be correct.in this case,the text and structure of the act,including the title of the subsection actually adopted by congress other requests for relief from removal provide a clear indication of congressional intent to exclude asylum and withholding applications from that provision.see almendarez torres united states,t he title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.internal quotation marks omitted.the legislative history reinforces that the corroboration provision codified at c b governs other applications for relief from removal and not applications for asylum and withholding of removal.r ep,at.we should give effect to this legislative intent c b applies only to applications for forms of relief other than asylum and withholding.see chevron natural res.def.council,if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.
there is no mystery here whether congress intended the real id act corroboration provisions to apply to an asylum applicant showing of timely filing.in the same section of the same act,congress added three corroboration provisions,each covering a different form of relief one for the merits of asylum applications section a of the act,adding b b ii one for the merits of applications for withholding of removal section c of the act,adding b c and one for the requirements of all other forms of relief section d of the act,adding c b because none of those provisions applies to the timeliness of an asylum application,and because no other statutory provision creates a relevant corroboration provision,the bia erred as a matter of law in applying the corroboration provision found in b b ii to singh showing that he timely filed an application for asylum.
the question now is where our holding leaves singh.the clear and convincing standard requires more than proof by a preponderance of the evidence and less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.kenyeres,at.to date,the bia has provided neither definition nor structure to the contours of that standard with respect to the filing bar indeed,testimony may be credible without rising to the level of clear and convincing evidence.as a consequence,we take no position whether,in the absence of credible testimony that meets the clear and convincing standard,an immigration judge may weigh the lack of reasonably available corroborating evidence in assessing compliance with the standard.nor do we consider whether singh simply failed to meet the standard here,without reference to corroborative evidence,as the bia did not address that issue.we leave those considerations to the bia in the first instance and remand this case to the bia for the agency to determine without imposing the statutory corroboration provision in b b ii whether singh credible testimony unaided by corroborating evidence demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that singh application was timely.
