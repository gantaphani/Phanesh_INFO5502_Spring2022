jose luis hernandez arias appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with attempted reentry after a prior removal in violation of.he argues that the conviction was predicated on a removal order that was obtained in violation of his due process rights.hernandez arias challenge centers on whether a can be removed as an alien found in the united states without having been admitted or paroled where the alien adjusted to temporary resident status,but that status was later terminated.we conclude that termination of hernandez arias temporary status operated to revoke any admission resulting from the prior adjustment of status,rendering hernandez arias unadmitted and removable.
factual background 
hernandez arias is a native and citizen of mexico who entered the united states without inspection in.he is the father of two united states citizen children.he has worked in an auto body shop and as a car salesman.
hernandez arias was granted temporary resident status in following his application for amnesty pursuant to a.this status was revoked in on account of his conviction on five counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of in violation of california penal code a b.hernandez arias was sentenced to six years in prison for each count,to be served concurrently.
hernandez arias was paroled from prison in.after a lengthy interlude,hernandez arias again came to the attention of immigration authorities in october,after he was convicted of misdemeanor grand theft and sentenced to days in jail.hernandez arias was subsequently served with a notice to appear nta charging removability for being an alien present in the united states who has not been admitted or paroled in violation of a a i of the immigration and nationality act ina.
hernandez arias appeared pro se at a group removal hearing held on november.the immigration judge ij informed the group of their right to be represented by an attorney,but at no expense to the government.the ij confirmed that each individual had received a list of immigration attorneys from the area and understood their responsibility to contact such attorneys should they desire further assistance.the group collectively waived the right to counsel.the ij also informed the group of potential eligibility for certain forms of relief from deportation,including asylum,convention against torture cat protection,cancellation of removal,adjustment of status,and voluntary departure.he did not specifically mention the potential for relief under h of the ina waiver of inadmissibility.
during the individual component of the hearing,the ij found hernandez arias deportable as charged based on his illegal entry in the ij then sought to ascertain hernandez arias potential eligibility for relief.hernandez arias stated that his wife had filed an application for adjustment of status on his behalf in,but that they never received anything from that.he noted that he had been convicted of child molestation in and had two citizen children.
the ij advised hernandez arias of his uncertainty regarding whether hernandez arias would be eligible for a waiver or not,but that he might be able to apply for a green card if his wife had applied for adjustment before april of.the ij also noted that hernandez arias might qualify for cancellation of removal,but that such relief was doubtful given his criminal history.in any case,the ij explained that hernandez arias bore the burden of proving eligibility for relief.when asked whether he wished to take some time to prepare his case,hernandez arias declined and said that he did not wish to pursue any relief.the ij accordingly ordered hernandez arias removed to mexico.hernandez arias accepted the decision and waived his right to appeal.he was deported on november.
not even three weeks later,on december,hernandez arias applied for entry into the united states at the san ysidro port of entry using a fraudulent passport and visa,hernandez arias admitted to immigration agents that he had previously been deported and lacked lawful status.
the government filed a indictment against hernandez arias,charging attempted reentry after a prior deportation in violation of,fraud and misuse of reentry documents in violation of a,and aggravated identity theft in violation of.hernandez arias moved to dismiss the charge for alleged defects in his underlying removal.he argued that he was not removable as charged because he had been admitted within the meaning of the immigration statutes when he was granted temporary resident status.hernandez arias also contended that his removal hearing was fundamentally unfair because the ij had not advised him of his potential eligibility for h relief.the government opposed the motion,arguing that hernandez arias removal comported with due process and that hernandez arias had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.
the district court denied hernandez arias motion to dismiss.it concluded that hernandez arias was properly removed under a a i as an alien who had not been admitted,because adjustment to temporary resident status was not an admission within the meaning of the immigration provisions.alternatively,the court held that even if hernandez arias had been admitted as a temporary resident,the termination of his temporary residency operated to return him to his prior unadmitted status pursuant to u.the court further held that hernandez arias was not prejudiced by the ij failure to advise him of the availability of prospective relief under h because hernandez arias was statutorily ineligible for that relief.as hernandez arias failed to demonstrate a due process violation resulting in prejudice,the court declined to reach the issue of administrative exhaustion.
a jury convicted hernandez arias of illegal reentry and fraudulent use of reentry documents,but acquitted him of the aggravated identity theft charge.the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.the court noted that the guidelines range for the fine was to for each count,but recognized that hernandez arias did not have the ability to pay that kind of fine.accordingly,the judge ordered payment of a fine in installments.the fine amount and payment plan mirrored the recommendation in the presentence report,which provided no details regarding hernandez arias ability to pay.hernandez arias objected to the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence,without specifically mentioning his fine.judgment was entered,and hernandez arias filed a timely notice of appeal.

iii.analysis 
collateral challenge to removal order 
an alien who has been denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed commits a crime if the alien enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in,the united states.a.one method of violating is returning to the united states after entry of a prior removal order.see id.a see also united states vidal mendoza,cir.congress has strictly limited an alien ability to bring a collateral challenge to such an order vidal mendoza,at citation omitted.an alien facing criminal charges may initiate a collateral attack on the underlying order only if the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d.
if the alien establishes a due process violation that prevented his waiver of appeal from being knowing and intelligent,he is excused from the exhaustion requirement.see united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.therefore,the crucial question in this case is whether hernandez arias has demonstrated a due process violation and fundamental unfairness.fundamental unfairness for purposes of d is demonstrated when the deportation proceeding violated the alien due process rights and the alien suffered prejudice as a result.united states reyes bonilla,cir,cert.denied.citation omitted.hernandez arias alleges three distinct due process violations in his removal proceeding that he was not removable as charged because he was admitted within the meaning of immigration law when he was granted temporary resident status that he was not informed of his potential eligibility for a h waiver and that he was not adequately advised of his right to counsel.he contends that he suffered prejudice from these violations because he was removed when he should not have been or,alternatively,was removed despite the availability of viable avenues for relief.none of hernandez arias arguments is persuasive.
hernandez arias was removable as charged.
the government alleged in the nta that hernandez arias was removable pursuant to a a i for being a n alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled hernandez arias was granted temporary resident status in pursuant to the amnesty provisions of the immigration reform and control act of irca codified at irca created a window between and in which aliens who unlawfully entered the united states before january,could obtain lawful permanent resident lpr status.see a b.a process was involved.first,an alien was required to apply for temporary residence.see id.a.next,the temporary resident had to file an application for adjustment to lpr status within months after adjustment of status to that of a temporary resident.see id.b.hernandez arias completed the first step,but not the second.
the ina defines admission and admitted as the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.id.a a.this definition applies across the ina.see id.a defining terms a s used in this chapter.t he plain meaning of the term admission in a a refers to a procedurally regular admission and not a substantively lawful admission.hing sum holder,cir footnote reference omitted.thus,an alien is admitted pursuant to a a when he undergoes the process of inspection and authorization by an immigration officer at the port of entry,id.at,regardless of whether the alien initially entered lawfully.see id.at.
because hernandez arias was never inspected at the border,he was not admitted as that term is defined in a a.however,both this court and the bia,in precedential decisions,have not limited the scope of admitted to a a strict definition.garcia quintero gonzales,cir.certain events,such as adjustment to lpr status or acceptance into the family unity program fup,qualify as admission for immigration purposes.see id.at recognizing alien as admitted in any status upon acceptance into the fup see also ocampo duran ashcroft,cir classifying alien who entered without inspection as admitted upon adjustment to lpr status.the bia considers a djustment of status as essentially a proxy for inspection and permission to enter at the border,which is given as a matter of administrative grace the bia has consistently construed an adjustment of status as an admission in re koljenovic,i n,bia.according to the bia,adjustment applicants are to be treated as if they are being admitted.see also in re alyazji,i n,bia declining the invitation from the department of homeland security to redefine the term admission on a basis and concluding that adjustment of status constitutes an admission.
it could be persuasively argued that admission to temporary residency qualifies as an admission.the relevant statutory text includes the word admission,providing that t he attorney general shall adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence if the applicant fulfills certain requirements.a emphasis added.and,as with lawful admission for permanent residence,lawful admission for temporary residence involves the statutory fiction of an administrative inspection by immigration officials coupled with legal permission to remain in the united states.see koljenovic,i n at.our logic in ocampo duran also suggests that the grant of lawful temporary resident status should constitute an admission.see ocampo duran,at equating the privilege of lawfully residing in the country with an admission see also lawrence holder,cir deferring to the attorney general interpretation of ina c defining admissions as encompassing applications for c relief.without deciding the issue,we assume that adjustment to temporary resident status pursuant to a is an admission under the immigration laws.
we need not definitively resolve whether hernandez arias adjustment to temporary resident status constituted an admission because,even if it did,termination of that status operated to revoke any prior admission.hernandez arias convictions rendered him statutorily ineligible for further participation in the amnesty program,and his temporary resident status was terminated by the immigration and naturalization service.see c,k,u.pursuant to u,t ermination of the status of any alien previously adjusted to lawful temporary residence under section a of the act shall act to return such alien to the unlawful status held prior to the adjustment,and render him or her amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedings under section or of the act,as appropriate.once hernandez arias temporary resident status was terminated,by operation of the governing regulation,he automatically reverted to his prior unlawful,unadmitted status.
hernandez arias contention that he retained the benefits of his adjustment to temporary residence despite termination of that status lacks textual support in the applicable regulation.were his admission to remain in effect despite termination of his status,hernandez arias would not in fact return to the unlawful status held prior to the adjustment.u emphasis added.the regulation also specifies that termination of status rendered hernandez arias subject to removal under sections exclusion or deportation of the ina.see id.
fairly read,describes a limited form of status with no lasting immigration benefit.the regulation specifically provides that a n alien whose status is adjusted to that of a lawful temporary resident under section of the act is not entitled to any benefit or consideration accorded under the act to aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.v.to the extent that admission is a lasting immigration benefit conferred upon lprs,see ocampo duran,at,similar treatment of temporary residents is foreclosed under the governing regulation.
hernandez arias contends that terminating his admission would effect a rescission of status in violation of u,which provides that the phrase termination of status of an alien granted lawful temporary residence under section a of the act shall not be construed to necessitate a rescission of status as described in section of the act,and the proceedings required by the regulations issued thereunder shall not apply.however,we do not view termination in this context to be analogous to rescission.the difference between rescission and termination is one of timing,similar to the difference between annulment and divorce.the legal effect of an annulment is to return the parties to the status of individuals who were never married to each other.see purganan schweiker,cir noting that generally annulment relates back and erase s the marriage and all its implications from the outset.a consequence of annulment is that none of the benefits accumulated during the marriage is retained.see id.in contrast,a divorce severs the marital union as of the date the divorce becomes final.see steve escalera,california marital annulments,contemp.legal issues,whereas a divorce judgment dissolves an existing full legal recognition to the marriage relationship between the date of its formation and the date of termination of the marital annulment judgment is said to relate back and
