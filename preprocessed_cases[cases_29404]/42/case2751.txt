rose mambwe,a native and citizen of angola,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article of the convention against torture cat.for the following reasons,we deny mambwe petition.
background 
mambwe entered the united states on or about june,as a nonimmigrant visitor with authorization to stay in this country until december.although mambwe is a citizen of angola,she entered the united states using a zambian passport,which she has since admitted was obtained by fraud.on september,mambwe filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article of the cat.
the former immigration and naturalization service determined that mambwe was not eligible for asylum and referred her application to an immigration judge ij to commence removal proceedings.in her master calendar hearing before the ij,mambwe admitted that she was removable under a b for remaining in the united states after december,without authorization.mambwe sought relief based on allegations that she suffered past persecution in her native country of angola as well as in zambia,where she lived for more than fifteen years as a refugee.we have drawn the following narrative of events leading up to mambwe arrival in the united states from her testimony before the ij,supplemented in places with details that appear only in her written application.
mambwe was born in lewa,angola,on october.at the time,angola was in the midst of a civil war between the popular movement for the liberation of angola mpla and the national union for the total independence of angola unita,which would last for another years.mambwe reports that her ethnic or tribal group,the mbundu,was known to be aligned with the mpla.
in,unita forces attacked mambwe village.mambwe has not heard from her father or brothers since the attack,so she presumes that they were either conscripted into unita military or killed.mambwe and her mother fled angola and eventually settled in the meheba refugee camp near solwezi,zambia.three years later,mambwe mother went to angola to search for the rest of her family,leaving mambwe in the care of a friend.mambwe mother never returned.
in,mambwe was raped by persons who she describes as boys from the refugee camp.soon thereafter,mambwe learned that she was pregnant.on january,mambwe gave birth to a daughter,norah.hoping to continue her schooling,mambwe left norah in the care of a pentecostal minister named tony choni and went to live with two members of choni church,matthew and paula chishemba,whom she calls foster parents.mambwe foster parents did not permit her to go to school instead,they forced her to work on their farm in zambezi,zambia,and sometimes physically abused her.at some point in,mambwe ran away from her foster parents farm and returned to meheba,where she spent the next four years enrolled in the meheba secondary school for refugees.after graduating from secondary school in,mambwe moved back to the farm.
in december,zambezi was attacked by a group of eight to ten men.mambwe identified the attackers as members of unita military because they were wearing camouflage pants and speaking languages that are common in angola but rare in zambia.during the attack,the unita soldiers decapitated matthew chishemba and cut off paula chishemba hands.the soldiers then kidnapped mambwe and took her across the border into angola.mambwe was held captive,along with several other women from angola and zambia,for two to three weeks.during that time,mambwe was repeatedly raped and beaten.mambwe and the other captives finally managed to escape into zambia with the help of one of the soldiers.
mambwe returned to meheba once more,this time to live with tony choni and her daughter norah.when choni was transferred to kitwe,zambia,in early,mambwe went with him.mambwe spent the next two years living in kitwe with norah,choni,and choni wife,christine.according to mambwe,choni made arrangements for her to travel to the united states in june using a zambian passport that he acquired by falsely identifying mambwe as a native and citizen of zambia.mambwe testified that when she left zambia on or about june,she intended to stay in the united states.
the ij denied mambwe application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article of the cat.after summarizing mambwe version of the facts and many of the documents contained in the administrative record,the ij noted that there was conflicting evidence concerning mambwe credibility.notwithstanding several potential red flags in the record,the ij found that mambwe testimony was generally credible.on the merits of mambwe claim for asylum,the ij found that mambwe met her initial burden by proving that unita attack on her village in constituted past persecution on account of a protected ground.although this meant that mambwe was presumed to have a fear of future persecution in angola,the ij found that the department of homeland security dhs rebutted the presumption by proving that there had been a fundamental change in circumstances in angola namely,the end of the civil war between the mpla and unita in.the ij went on to find that the attack did not rise to the level of severity required to support a grant of humanitarian asylum in the absence of a fear of future persecution and that mambwe was not eligible for asylum based on the other incidents that she rape perpetrated by boys from the refugee camp in and the attack and kidnapping carried out by unita soldiers in they did not involve persecution on account of mambwe race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.having denied mambwe claim for asylum,the ij held that mambwe failed to meet the higher burden of proof required to establish her eligibility for withholding of removal.finally,the ij found that mambwe did not qualify for protection under the cat because she failed to present any evidence tending to show that she would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the angolan government if she returned to angola.
mambwe appealed to the bia,arguing that she suffered past persecution in angola and zambia,that changed conditions in angola did not negate her fear of future persecution,and that even if she lacked a fear of future persecution she would still merit humanitarian relief.the bia dismissed mambwe appeal in its entirety.first,the bia agreed that mambwe suffered past persecution in angola,noting that the dhs had not challenged the ij finding that mambwe met her initial burden by proving that unita attack on her village in constituted past persecution on account of a protected ground.but the bia found no clear error in the ij conclusion that the end of the civil war between the mpla and unita in amounted to a fundamental change in circumstances that rebutted the presumption that mambwe had a fear of future persecution in angola.the bia went on to hold that mambwe was not eligible for humanitarian asylum because she failed to establish compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to angola because of any harm that she suffered there on account of a protected ground.in particular,the bia agreed with the ij finding that the attack did not rise to the level of severity required to support a grant of humanitarian asylum.with respect to the other incidents that mambwe described,the bia adopted the ij determination that the rape perpetrated by boys from the refugee camp in and the attack and kidnapping carried out by unita soldiers in did not involve persecution on account of mambwe race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.the bia therefore concluded that those incidents could not support a grant of humanitarian asylum.while the bia noted that mambwe raise d no other arguments on appeal,it summarily affirmed the ij denial of her application for withholding of removal and protection under the cat for the reasons identified by the ij.the bia granted mambwe sixty days to voluntarily depart the united states before its alternate order of removal took effect.
mambwe filed a timely petition for review of the bia decision,arguing that the denial of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat was erroneous in numerous respects.
ii.discussion 
mambwe first challenges the denial of her claim for asylum.to establish her eligibility for asylum,mambwe bore the burden of proving that she qualifies as a refugee.see b b.in this context,refugee is a term of art which refers to a person who is unable or unwilling to return to her country of nationality because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a.because the statutory definition makes the motive for persecution critical,an applicant must provide some evidence of it,direct or circumstantial.ins,d.
the regulation establishing the administrative process for making asylum determinations provides that an applicant who has proved past persecution on account of a protected ground is presumed to have a fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim.b.this presumption may be rebutted,however,if the dhs proves by a preponderance of the evidence that t here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality.id.b i a.even if the dhs meets this burden,the ij may grant humanitarian asylum if the applicant has either demonstrated compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country of nationality arising out of the severity of the past persecution,id.b iii a,or established that there is a reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country,id.b iii b.
in dismissing mambwe administrative appeal on her claim for asylum,the bia adopted the ij reasoning in relevant part while adding reasoning of its own thus,we will consider both decisions.see rafiyev mukasey,cir.we review the administrative findings of fact under a substantial evidence standard.see manani filip,cir.these findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see rafiyev,at.and the bia ultimate decision to deny an application for asylum is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d see rafiyev,at.
there is no dispute that mambwe met her initial burden by proving that unita attack on her village in constituted past persecution on account of a protected ground.nevertheless,mambwe argues in her petition that the ij and the bia should have found that the attack and kidnapping carried out by unita soldiers in also constituted past persecution on account of her membership in the mbundu ethnic or tribal group as well as her imputed political opinion.mambwe points to her testimony that the whole village of zambezi was attacked,the geographic fact that zambezi is near the zambian border with angola,and a state department report on human rights practices in zambia for,which indicated that unita rebels had crossed the zambian border and abducted civilians.mambwe asserts that this evidence proves that the attack and kidnapping were a attempt to deter any support for the mpla.we disagree.
mambwe theory seems to rest on two major assumptions first,that a attack necessarily involves persecution on account of political opinion or some other protected ground or at least is more likely to involve such persecution than other types of attacks against civilians and second,that the most plausible explanation for unita incursions into zambian territory was to persecute known,suspected,or potential supporters of the mpla,such as mambwe.neither of these assumptions is true.on the contrary,there is no shortage of alternative explanations for why rebel soldiers might carry out a attack in foreign territory without engaging in persecution on account of a protected ground,including simple lawlessness and base criminality.
even assuming,however,that the evidence mambwe identified could support the inference that the attack and kidnapping were,at least in part,we are not convinced that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to reach that conclusion.see,at.noting that to obtain judicial reversal of an adverse factual determination,an applicant must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find in his favor.as the dhs recounts,mambwe own testimony about her alleged persecutors motives was equivocal at best.for example,when she was asked to explain why the soldiers attacked zambezi,mambwe stated,i do know why they attacked they just attacked.likewise,when she was asked to explain why the soldiers kidnapped her and several other women from angola and zambia,mambwe initially stated,they were abusing us and raping us but i do know why they did that.later,mambwe said she agreed with the notion that the soldiers were merely pursuing their own gratification.while mambwe reported that she heard the unita soldiers went to zambezi looking for somebody presumably,a member of the went on to say that the soldiers did not suspect her of being an enemy and that she did not think they knew she was from angola.
after considering the record as a whole,we find that mambwe has failed to show that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude that the attack and kidnapping carried out by unita soldiers in involved persecution on account of her race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.accordingly,we may not overturn the ij and the bia determination that the attack and kidnapping did not constitute past persecution on account of a protected ground 
mambwe next contends that the dhs failed to rebut the presumption that she had a fear of future persecution arising from unita attack on her village.we have no difficulty concluding that substantial evidence supports the ij and the bia determination that the dhs met its burden by showing that the end of the civil war between the mpla and unita amounted to a fundamental change in circumstances.specifically,a state department report on human rights practices in angola for indicates that unita entered into a agreement with the angolan government in april.following the,unita demobilized,disarmed,and disbanded its military.killings and abductions attributed to unita reportedly stopped entirely.in november,unita signed a peace agreement that officially ended the year civil war.the report noted in summary that unita has progressed significantly in its transition to a demilitarized political organization and the largest opposition party.these developments led most of the refugees who were displaced by the civil war to return to angola.according to estimates provided in a state department report on general conditions in angola,more than of angola original refugees have returned home,while an additional refugees were slated to return in as part of a repatriation program organized by the united nations high commissioner for refugees.
despite the uncontroverted evidence that conditions in angola have fundamentally changed,mambwe insists that she continues to fear persecution because the civil war was not put to rest by the signing of the peace accord or even by the official disarmament of unita.yet mambwe has not identified any evidence to support the notion that unita continued to engage in militant or repressive conduct after the civil war officially ended in.equally,mambwe has not identified any evidence that individual members of unita sought revenge against their former enemies real or perceived,such as members of the mbundu ethnic or tribal group who supported the mpla.mambwe instead asserts in general terms that angola is still overridden by civil unrest and violence and that human rights violations are prevalent.this exaggerated description of conditions in angola is beside the point,inasmuch as a general state of unrest is typically insufficient to qualify as persecution.see habchy filip,cir quoting al yatim mukasey,cir see also mohamed ashcroft,cir harm arising from general conditions such as anarchy,civil war,or mob v
