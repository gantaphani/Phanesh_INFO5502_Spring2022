immigration 
the panel denied jose daniel lemus petition for review from the board of immigration appeals decision retroactively applying to him the holding in holder martinez gutierrez,that an applicant for cancellation of removal must satisfy the requirement on his own,without relying on a parent residential history.
petitioner contended that martinez gutierrez announced a new rule of law and that,under chevron oil huson,its holding should not be applied retroactively to him.the panel held that because it was deferring to the bia decision in matter of escobar,bia,as directed by the supreme court,rather than adopting a new rule on its own,the retroactivity analysis set forth in montgomery ward,ftc,cir,applied rather than that of chevron oil.the panel held that the second montgomery ward factor,which favors retroactivity if a party could reasonably anticipate the change in law,and the third factor,which examines the extent of reliance upon the former rule,weighed heavily against lemus.the panel further found that the fifth factor favored the government strong interest in uniform application of the immigration statutes.
ponsor,senior district judge 
in holder martinez gutierrez,the supreme court unanimously held that the board of immigration appeals bia permissibly construed section a of the immigration and nationality act,a,when it concluded that an alien seeking cancellation of removal had to satisfy the requirement on his own,without relying on a parent residential history.id.at.petitioner lemus contends that martinez gutierrez announced a new rule of law and that,under chevron oil huson,its holding should not be applied retroactively to him.
we disagree.lemus citation of holder,cir.en banc,in support of his argument for prospective application of martinez gutierrez is not persuasive.in,we applied chevron oil retroactivity analysis,because we ourselves were explicitly adopting a new rule,setting aside our own longstanding circuit precedent.id.at.where,as here,we are adopting no new rule on our own,but merely at the direction of the supreme court deferring to the bia,chevron oil retroactivity criteria are inapplicable.
holder,cir.en banc,offers a more compelling precedent on the issue of retroactivity.in that case,we did not announce a new rule on our own authority,as in,but rather deferred to a rule previously announced by the bia,as martinez gutierrez has instructed us to do here.held that in this situation the proper approach to the issue of retroactivity is set forth in montgomery ward,ftc,cir.at.applying montgomery ward,we hold that martinez gutierrez should be applied retroactively.based on this,we will deny the petition.
facts and procedural history 
petitioner jose daniel lemus is a guatemalan citizen who entered the united states as a in with his mother.in,after lemus turned eighteen,he became a legal permanent resident through his stepfather.on april,lemus was crossing by car from mexico to calexico,california when a routine sweep uncovered nearly fifty pounds of marijuana in his vehicle rear panels.lemus was initially charged with importation of marijuana and held in custody.on june,he pleaded guilty to one count of making a materially false statement to a federal officer in violation of.on july,he was sentenced to time served.four days later,he was transferred into the custody of the department of homeland security and was thereafter placed into removal proceedings,charged with being inadmissible as an alien who was or had been a trafficker in illicit controlled substances.
in proceedings before the ij,lemus admitted that he was involved in drug trafficking and was to be paid for his thwarted attempt to bring marijuana into the united states.nevertheless,he sought relief through an application for cancellation of removal,a course available to certain permanent residents.section a a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a,authorizes the attorney general to cancel the removal of a person who has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status and has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
the government argued that lemus was not eligible for this relief because he had not fulfilled the continuous residency requirement.lemus acknowledged that he could not independently satisfy this requirement,since he had only been a legal resident for approximately five years when he pleaded guilty to the false statement charge he argued,however,that by imputing his stepfather years of residency to himself,he could satisfy the requisite number of years needed to qualify.
at the time of the proceeding before the ij,this imputation was permitted in the teeth of the bia vigorous disagreement under the authority then prevailing in the ninth circuit.see holder,cir.gonzales,cir.a dispute nevertheless arose at the hearing before the ij,not about the principle of imputing a parent residential history,but about whether lemus stepfather had actually acquired enough countable years to allow lemus to satisfy the residency requirement.the ij inquiry therefore necessarily focused on when the stepfather had actually been admitted for purposes of this calculation.
lemus argued before the ij that his stepfather was admitted as part of the family unity program,which would have meant that,under ninth circuit authority,lemus could count his stepfather years in presenting his case for cancellation.the government disagreed,contending that the stepfather admission was based on a deferred action decision,which would have precluded lemus from imputing his stepfather residential history.in order to clarify the historical picture,lemus lawyer asked the ij to order the government to produce the stepfather alien registration file the ij continued the case in the hope that the government would locate and turn over the,but the government ultimately failed to do this.
at the final hearing before the ij,on april,the principal issue was the date upon which lemus stepfather was admitted.the ij sided with the government and found lemus ineligible for cancellation of removal.the ij also held that he had no authority to require the department of homeland security to produce the stepfather,and he ordered lemus removed.
lemus appealed the ij ruling to the bia where,again,the central issue initially was whether lemus could take advantage of his stepfather residential history to satisfy the eligibility requirements for his application for cancellation of removal.lemus conceded,as he did before the ij,that he could not independently meet the residency requirement.
while the bia appeal was pending,the supreme court issued its decision in holder martinez gutierrez.in its unanimous decision,the supreme court reversed the line of ninth circuit decisions that allowed imputation of a parent years of residency under a,instead holding that the bia contrary construction of the statute,as set forth in matter of escobar,at,was reasonable and therefore entitled to deference.martinez gutierrez,at.in escobar,the bia had interpreted the statute as requiring that an alien satisfy the years of residency requirement independently,without imputing a parent residence period.at.
lemus argued to the bia,as he does here,that martinez gutierrez should not apply retroactively to him in light of the contrary ninth circuit precedent controlling on june,when he pleaded guilty to making a materially false statement.lemus contended that he would have proceeded differently in his criminal case if he had known that his plea would render him ineligible for cancellation of removal.lemus further argued before the bia that,since in his view martinez gutierrez should not apply retroactively,his stepfather residency ought to be imputed to him and that,if there was any uncertainty regarding his stepfather residency,the government should be required to produce his stepfather to clear up the confusion.
the bia concluded that martinez gutierrez foreclosed any argument for imputation,rejecting lemus contention that it should not be applied retroactively.the bia reasoned that because retro
