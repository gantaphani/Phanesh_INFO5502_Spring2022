nazani,an iranian,overstayed her visitor visa,and,consequently,the ins instituted deportation proceedings against her.sargis conceded deportability but sought asylum and withholding of deportation.after a hearing,the immigration judge ij issued a ruling in which he denied asylum and withholding of deportation but granted sargis voluntary departure.the board of immigration appeals bia or board affirmed the ij decision.sargis now seeks further review in this court.for the reasons given in the following opinion,we must deny the petition and affirm the decision of the board.
backgrounda.
we begin by setting forth the basic facts from the administrative record before us sargis is a year old native and citizen of iran.an armenian christian,she first began to experience difficulties in iran when the ayatollah khomeini came to power.according to sargis,the new government forced her husband to retire from his job solely because he was armenian.he found another job with a foreign construction company however,that company eventually shut down.sargis testified that her husband was unable to find other work because he was armenian and christian.the government,however,did give sargis husband his pension.
at the time that the ayatollah overthrew the shah,many armenian schools were closed.those that remained open were forced to teach islam and to accept moslem students.at that time,sargis and her husband sent their only child,a son,to live in italy where he could study in an armenian school and would not have to learn the islamic faith.
after sargis and her husband sent their son abroad,government soldiers came to their home in tehran looking for him.several times government agents interrogated her and her husband and took her husband to the komiteh for further questioning.sargis believes that these intrusions aggravated her husband heart condition of which the agents were aware.sargis husband died from his heart condition in,and the government stopped sending agents to her home after his death.after her husband death,sargis did continue to receive his pension.
sargis stated that she suffered other hardships because she was armenian.specifically,she had difficulty obtaining food.after waiting hours in food rationing lines,she often was forced to the end of the line or told there was nothing for her because she was armenian.when fellow armenians objected to this treatment,they were beaten or told to leave the country.sargis was forced to change her diet and obtain food through the black market because of these actions.
sargis also was forced to wear the islamic garb.twice she was approached by the police and was cited for not following the islamic dress code.her niece,who lived with sargis at the time,was spray painted by islamic extremists when she went out in public without her scarf to cover her face although sargis opposed the dress code,after this incident she complied out of fear for her safety.
sargis also testified that government agents were stationed at the front gates of her church and hassled young girls and women as they entered church specifically,they would complain about your hair or something.when the women came out of church,government agents sometimes would take the women for questioning and if you have a cross on you,and they just grab the cross and throw it or something.id.
after sargis husband died,she left iran and entered the united states as a visitor for pleasure on august.she has remained in the united states since that time and has resided with her niece outside chicago.
sargis son now lives in italy.she has one sister and two nieces who reside in chicago.she no longer has relatives residing in iran.
sargis was placed in deportation proceedings on july.at the hearing before the ij,sargis and her niece testified to the facts we have set forth.after hearing the testimony and reviewing the submitted documentation,the ij denied sargis application for asylum.
the ij characterized sargis claims as based on her religion and her gender 
the respondent contention is that she has a claim,namely,she felt compelled to wear an islamic or moslem dress,the hedjab,because she feared the consequences if she did not,that wearing this dress was contrary to her religious beliefs and practices,particularly to her armenian christian faith,and as a result of this compulsion by the state and by society she was denied the free practice of her religion.
the ij further noted that t he respondent in fact did wear the dress.she was never harmed on any occasion because of what she wore.she was never arrested or imprisoned or even harassed by authorities at any time.she did attend church.id.at.consequently,the ij concluded that sargis experiences did not rise to the level of persecution.the ij,however,did grant sargis voluntary departure.
the bia affirmed the ij opinion in its entirety.the bia characterized sargis claim as persecution by fundamentalist muslims in iran due to her religious beliefs as a christian armenian,and due to her refusal to comply with the traditional muslim dress code.the bia first evaluated sargis claims of past persecution.the bia characterized persecution as an extreme concept and stated that sargis experiences in iran did not rise to this level.id.at.in making its determination,the bia acknowledged that sargis had been forced to wear the muslim garb for fear of being attacked,that she had suffered discrimination with respect to food rationing because she was armenian,and that her son was forced to go abroad to study his native language and culture.although deplorable,these incidents constituted harassment,not persecution.id.
the bia also found that sargis had not established a fear of future persecution.again,the bia acknowledged harassment and discrimination by the iranian government against christians,but held that it did not rise to the level of persecution.the bia similarly rejected sargis argument that she would suffer persecution on account of her membership in a social group consisting of christian women who fear the threat of persecution for failing to conform to the dress code imposed by islamic laws.id.the bia acknowledged that the women who shared this plight may qualify as a particular social group for the purposes of asylum law 
to the degree that the respondent and other women in her proposed group oppose the dress code because they feel it is an imposition of the islamic religion on them,we would find the members of this group should not be required to change their opposition because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.
id.the bia nevertheless rejected sargis argument that she would suffer persecution because of her membership in this group 
w e note that the respondent always complied with the dress code while living in iran,and she has indicated that,if returned to iran,she would continue to conform to the dress code.despite the islamic dress code,the respondent continued to practice her christian religion in iran.the respondent has not testified that she will willingly oppose the islamic law by refusing to wear the required clothing.thus,we do not accept that the respondent actions reflect that her opposition to the islamic law is fundamental to her individual identity or conscience.therefore,the respondent has not established her membership in the particular social group.
id.sargis timely sought relief from this court.
discussiona.
asylum eligibility is a factual determination which we review under the substantial evidence test.petrovic ins,cir quoting sivaainkaran ins,cir.we shall disturb the bia findings only if the record lacks substantial evidence to support its factual conclusions.ambati reno,cir quoting malek ins,cir.this court may not reverse the bia determination simply because it would have decided the case differently.see anton ins,cir.
congress has given the attorney general discretion to grant asylum if an applicant qualifies as a refugee under a a.the immigration and nationality act ina defines refugee as 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
in order to qualify as a refugee,the asylum applicant must establish that he has a fear of future persecution based on one of the statutorily protected categories.an alien may establish fear of future persecution in one of two ways.see marquez ins,cir.first,he may establish that he endured past persecution.see id.if he meets this requirement,there is a rebuttable presumption that he has a fear of future persecution and therefore should be granted asylum.see asani ins,cir.alternatively,the asylum applicant may come forward with evidence that he will endure persecution if returned to his country of origin.see marquez,at.
we first address whether the record supports the determination that sargis has failed to establish that she has suffered past persecution on account of her armenian ethnicity and her religious affiliation.
in this regard,sargis points to the fact that,when she lived in iran,she was forced to the end of food rationing lines,that guards were posted at her church and harassed women as they came in and took some for questioning when they departed and that she was forced,under threat of imprisonment or bodily harm,to wear the islamic garb.
although persecution encompasses more than threats to life or freedom,reno,cir,such actions must rise above the level of mere harassment to constitute persecution,sofinet ins,cir.types of actions that might cross the line from harassment to persecution include detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,or torture.begzatowski ins,cir quoting mitev ins,cir.
sargis undoubtedly has endured harassment and hardship in iran on the basis of her ethnicity and religious affiliation.she has been confronted by police because her dress did not conform to the requirements imposed by the dominant religion,interrogated concerning her son and forced to the end of rationing lines.however,sargis never was detained she was not physically assaulted she did not suffer extreme economic deprivation nor was she the direct subject of a physical threat.we must conclude that,under our precedent,the evidence of record does not compel a finding of persecution.see begzatowski,at holding that being repeatedly forced into situations constituted persecution asani,at stating that it is likely that the events described by beaten resulting in the loss of two teeth,deprived of food and water,detained in a cell with no room to sit,and chained to a sufficiently serious to rise beyond the level of mere harassment 
sargis also submits that the bia erred in determining that she did not have a fear of persecution based on her membership in a particular social women who oppose wearing the islamic garb.she asserts that,if returned to iran,she will suffer persecution on the basis of her membership in this group.
this court has held that t o qualify for asylum based on group membership,an alien must identify a particular social group establish that she is a member of that group and,establish that her fear of persecution is based on her membership in that group.sharif ins,cir.the common characteristic that defines the social group must be one that the members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.lwin ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
evaluating the evidence according to the standards set forth above,sargis first burden is to identify a particular social group.with respect to this element,we believe that sargis has met her burden.sargis identified in her brief the group of christian women in iran who do not wish to adhere to the islamic female dress code.this group is virtually indistinguishable from social groups recognized by other circuits.see fatin ins,cir safaie ins,cir 
sargis also meets the second falls within this particular social group furthermore,the consequences of failing to comply with the dress,imprisonment,and being physically abused such as having your lips rubbed with glass clearly constitute persecution under the ina.
nevertheless,we can not say that the record before us conclusively establishes that sargis has been persecuted on the basis of her inclusion within this group certainly,the determination of the board to the contrary can not be characterized as unsupported by the record.in order for sargis to qualify as a refugee,she also has to establish that complying with the dress code would,for her,rise to the level of persecution.see fatin,at.when asked whether she objected to wearing the islamic dress,sargis replied that t his is not our armenian culture,its not our dress.we do we do dress this kind of things.when asked whether she considered it a religious practice,she responded that w hen they want us to wear the same thing that as the religion wants wants them to do,it kind of forcing you to accept their religious id.finally,in response to the question from her counsel whether she felt that the dress code infringed on her religious practice,sargis responded,yes,its against my religion.i think that they tried slowly to take to change us into islam religion.id.at.however,sargis also testified that she complied with the dress code,id.at,and,because of her compliance,she was not stopped from attending church,id.
we do not believe that sargis testimony compelled a finding by the board that complying with the islamic dress requirements would constitute persecution for her.first,when asked why she objected to the dress,her first response was that it was not her culture.second,although she testified that she believed that the dress code was a way to force christians to conform to islam,she did not testify that it violated a specific tenet of her faith.finally,sargis had complied with the dress code while she lived in iran and,as long as she did so,was not prevented from attending church and practicing her faith.consequently,because the evidence could be interpreted such that the dress requirements are not abhorrent to sargis deepest beliefs,fatin,at,we can not say that the bia determination to deny asylum on this basis is without support in the record.
we faced a similar,although not identical,claim of persecution based on social group membership in sharif.in sharif,the petitioner claimed that she would be persecuted upon her return to iran on the basis of her status as a westernized woman.id.at.we accepted for the sake of argument that westernized women constituted a cognizable social group.however,the court determined that 
sharif is still unable to demonstrate a reasonable fear of persecution because of her membership in that group.there is no evidence to suggest that sharif is either unable or unwilling to comply with iranian law when she returns to iran.sharif has no history of objecting to iran social code.nor is there any evidence to suggest that sharif will voice her opposition to iranian law when she returns.
id.at.the court therefore concluded that sharif inability to enjoy the freedoms enjoyed by american women does not equate with a threat of affirmative persecution by the iranian regime based on sharif views.id 
we are constrained to point out an additional matter that immigration authorities ought to consider before deporting sargis to iran.we take note of the very significant delay that this case experienced during the administrative process.deportation proceedings first were instituted against sargis in.today,almost a decade later,at the age of,she faces deportation to a country in which,according to the record,she has no close relatives.although we are bound by the record to sustain the board determination that sargis will not be subject to persecution on the basis of her religion or social group,the practical reality is that,given her age and her attempt to remain in the united states,she can not expect a warm welcome or a very easy life.in fact she probably can expect,given her age,a very hard life.inasmuch as the difficulties
