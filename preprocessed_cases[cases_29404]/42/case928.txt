recently,the board of immigration appeals bia set down standards for reviewing determinations that an applicant asylum application was frivolous under section d of the immigration and nationality act ina,d.in re.in the two cases currently before us,consolidated for disposition,the bia upheld frivolousness determinations before the decision in was rendered.we remand these cases in order to give the agency an opportunity,in the first instance,to reconsider its rulings in light of to further clarify the guidelines for review set forth in.
petitioner biao yang,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,applied for asylum and withholding of removal under the ina,b,and for relief under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,treaty doc.in january,immigration judge ij paul defonzo denied yang application based on his findings that yang asylum application was,see a b,and that yang lacked credibility.the ij also concluded that petitioner application was frivolous under d.the decision was affirmed by the bia on may,except insofar as the ij found that yang had not established extraordinary circumstances for failing to meet the deadline for filing an asylum application.in re biao yang,no.may,aff g no.immig.city.
petitioner ming liang lin,also a native and citizen of the people republic of china,applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief in march.in december,ij noel ferris denied lin claims on adverse credibility grounds.the ij also concluded that petitioner application was frivolous.both of these determinations were affirmed,without opinion,by the bia on june.in re ming liang lin,no.june,aff g no.immig.city.
petitioners timely appealed the bia decisions to this court.because the separate appeals involve common issues of law and fact,we consolidate the cases for disposition.we conclude that substantial evidence supports the credibility rulings however,we vacate the findings of frivolousness and remand the cases in order to give the bia the opportunity to interpret and apply the relevant statutes and regulations governing frivolousness under the standards the bia recently set forth in.
adverse credibility determinations 
in yang case,the bia adopted and affirmed,then modified,the ij decision.in such circumstances,we review the ij decision minus the ground for denying relief that was rejected by the bia.see xue hong yang dep t of justice,cir.accordingly,we will address yang asylum claim as if it were not barred by the filing deadline,as did the bia.in cases such as lin where the bia summarily affirms an ij decision without issuing an opinion,see e,we review the reasoning and decision of the ij directly,treating it as the final agency determination.see ming xia chen bia,cir.
we owe particular deference to an ij credibility finding,mindful that the law must entrust some official with responsibility to hear an applicant asylum claim,and the ij has the unique advantage among all officials involved in the process of having heard directly from the applicant.zhou yun zhang ins,cir,overruled on other grounds by shi liang lin dep t of justice,cir en banc.hence,our review of an ij credibility assessment is an exceedingly narrow inquiry to ensure that the ij conclusions were not reached arbitrarily or capriciously and that credibility findings are based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
we may,however,vacate and remand an adverse credibility determination if we find that the ij has failed to act fairly in judging credibility and in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,cao he lin dep t of justice,cir,where the ij based the credibility ruling upon speculation or upon an incorrect analysis of the testimony,id.at,or where the ij unduly relied on inconsistencies that are relatively minor and isolated and do not concern material facts,diallo ins,cir internal citations omitted.notwithstanding these types of errors,we may still affirm a credibility finding if we can confidently predict that there is no realistic possibility that,absent the errors,the ij or bia would have reached a different conclusion.cao he lin,at.
the ij determined that yang was not credible based on yang failure to mention at his airport interview that he was ever arrested or beaten inconsistencies in his testimony regarding the chronology of events an implausible and inconsistent account of how he escaped from detention the ij observation that yang appeared to be simply making up testimony when confronted by inconsistencies contradictory and implausible testimony regarding his employment and contradictory evidence regarding when yang decided to leave china.these findings,which are supported by the record,are more than sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination.furthermore,yang acknowledged making the inconsistent statements at the airport,and because there is no evidence of any coercion in the interview yang provided no other indication that the interview transcript was ij properly relied on that transcript and rejected yang various explanations as inadequate.see ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.moreover,the ij made clear that his findings were based,in part,on yang demeanor,and we normally afford such findings particular deference.see zhou yun zhang,at.accordingly,the adverse credibility finding underlying the denial of asylum and withholding of removal is upheld.
we note that while yang application included a request for cat relief,the ij did not address that request anywhere in his decision,nor did the bia.although we see little evidence in the record to support that claim,it is for the agency to make eligibility determinations in the first instance,see ins orlando ventura,d.because,for the reasons set forth below,we remand this case to the agency,the agency should also address yang eligibility for cat relief on remand.
ming liang lin 
the ij adverse credibility determination in lin case is also supported by substantial evidence.the ij based her determination on,inter alia,inconsistencies in lin testimony and application regarding when he was baptized.since lin claims of persecution are based on his practice of religion,his inconsistent testimony regarding when and how many times he had been baptized constitutes a substantial discrepancy.the ij,therefore,properly relied on lin inconsistent testimony in support of her adverse credibility determination.see ins,cir to form the basis of an adverse credibility determination,a discrepancy must be substantial when measured against the record as a whole.
in addition,the ij found that lin had no identity documents that were good and an id card that was,in fact,fraudulent.submission of inconsistent statements as well as a fraudulent document in support of an asylum application can constitute substantial evidence supporting an adverse credibility determination.see borovikova dep t of justice,cir in re,determining that presentation of a false document in support of an asylum application can be fatal to the credibility of the applicant.because the government forensics report indicated that lin resident identification card was a counterfeit,and lin only explanation was that it was bought from the public security office,the ij reasonably concluded that this submission fatally undermined lin overall credibility.id.
the ij also relied lin failure to call as witnesses his was living in new members of his current parish in new york.an applicant failure to corroborate his or her testimony may bear on credibility,because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question.see xiao ji chen dep t of justice,cir.because lin testimony was not otherwise credible,the ij properly relied on the lack of corroborative evidence.moreover,here,the ij warned lin before his actual hearing that she a would give the letter attesting to his church membership no weight in the absence of a witness,and b would give his cousin affidavit no weight whatsoever.
in sum,the ij adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence in light of the record as a whole.the factors that the ij properly relied upon were central to lin claim of persecution.we note,however,that the ij also relied on several factors that do not support such a determination nevertheless,reviewing the record as a whole,we can confidently predict that the ij would reach the same decision on remand,even absent the grounds improperly relied upon.see xiao ji chen,at.
because the ij permissibly determined that lin was not credible and therefore did not meet his burden of proof for asylum,and because lin claim also depends on the credibility of his testimony,it necessarily follows that denial of withholding of removal was also correct.zhou yun zhang,at.moreover,the ij properly concluded that lin had utterly failed to make out a claim under the convention against torture for illegal departure,because lin admitted that he had not departed china illegally,and there is no evidence in the record tending to show that lin would be subject to torture upon his return to china.
ii.frivolousness determinations 
having concluded that the ijs credibility rulings were supported by substantial evidence,we turn to their frivolousness determinations.section d of the ina,d,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,provides,in relevant part 
d asylum procedure 
notice of privilege of counsel and consequences of frivolous application at the time of filing an application for asylum,the attorney general shall advise the alien of the privilege of being represented by counsel and of the consequences,under paragraph,of knowingly filing a frivolous application for asylum 
frivolous applications 
if the attorney general determines that an alien has knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum and the alien has received the notice under paragraph a,the alien shall be permanently ineligible for any benefits under this chapter,effective as of the date of a final determination on such application.
d.thus,a final decision that an asylum application is frivolous permanently forecloses the petitioner from all benefits under the immigration laws of this country 
because of the severe consequences of a finding of frivolousness under d,see,at,the corresponding federal regulations prescribe the parameters within which an ij and the bia must operate in making these determinations 
for applications filed on or after april,an applicant is subject to the provisions of section d of the act only if a final order by an immigration judge or the board of immigration appeals specifically finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application.for purposes of this section,an asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.such finding shall only be made if the immigration judge or the board is satisfied that the applicant,during the course of the proceedings,has had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.
in yuanliang liu dep t of justice,cir,we considered a petition for review of the bia affirmance of a frivolousness finding.after surveying all of the relevant caselaw,we remanded the case to the bia so that it could,in the first instance,set down clear and explicit standards by which frivolousness decisions may be judged.in doing so,we encourage d the bia to consider not only the relevant statutes and regulations,but also the principles articulated by our sister circuits id.at.
on remand,the bia,in vacating the ij frivolousness finding,set forth the following procedural safeguards which must be followed by immigration judges in rendering frivolousness determinations 
notice to the alien of the consequences of filing a frivolous application a specific finding by the immigration judge or the board that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous application sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that a material element of the asylum application was deliberately fabricated and an indication that the alien has been afforded sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.
the first provision require s that the attorney general advise the alien at the time of filing an asylum application of the consequences of filing a frivolous application,permanent ineligibility for any benefits under the immigration and nationality act except for withholding of removal.id.citing d 
the second provision requires that the immigration judge separately address and include specific findings that the respondent deliberately fabricated material elements of his asylum claim.id.at.an element of a claim is fabricated when it misrepresents the truth a deliberate fabrication involves a knowing and intentional misrepresentation of the truth.id.at internal citations omitted.therefore,an immigration judge specific finding that a respondent deliberately fabricated a material element of his asylum claim constitutes a finding that he knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application.id.
in laying out standards for the third provision,the bia rejected our suggestion in liu that concrete and conclusive evidence of fabrication be required to support a frivolousness finding.id.at.instead,the bia articulated the following requirement 
after taking into account the respondent explanations for discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim,the immigration judge must provide cogent and convincing reasons for finding by a preponderance of the evidence that an asylum applicant knowingly and deliberately fabricated material elements of the claim.
finally,with respect to the fourth requirement,an opportunity to account for discrepancies,the bia,in one section of its opinion,suggests that immigration judges should,as a matter of good practice,inform applicants that they are considering a frivolousness determination.id.at in order to afford a sufficient opportunity to account for discrepancies,it would be a good practice for an immigration judge who believes that an applicant may have submitted a frivolous asylum application to bring this concern to the attention of the applicant prior to the conclusion of proceedings.later in its opinion,however,the bia appears to require such an action in cases where it would not be obvious to an applicant that such a finding was being considered.see id.at in the case before us,the immigration judge did not mention during the course of the hearing that she was contemplating a frivolousness finding.we do not find that the particular concerns underlying the frivolousness finding were such that the respondent should necessarily have anticipated such a finding and provided explanations relevant to the question whether he deliberately fabricated the account of the forced abortion and illegal adoption in the second application.ultimately,the bia found that the ij had failed to take into account the applicant explanations for the inconsistencies and thus failed to meet the fourth requirement for making frivolousness determinations.
although the ij in yang case rendered his decision long before the bia handed down its decision in,the ij unquestionably complied with at least some of the procedural safeguards articulated in.first,the ij,on at least two occasions,once at a master calendar hearing and then again at the individual hearing,provided yang with notice of the consequences of filing a frivolous application.moreover,the ij,during the course of the hearing,informed yang that he was considering a frivolousness finding 
more problematic in yang case,however,is the requirement that the ij separately address and include specific findings that the respondent deliberately fabricated material elements of his asylum claim.id.at.while the ij exhaustively laid out his reasons for making an adverse credibility determination,with regards to the frivolousness finding,the ij stated only 
notwithstanding the representations of the applicant regarding his understanding of the nature and gravity of the warnings concerning frivolous asylum applications,it is clear to the court that yang has submitted a clearly fabricated
