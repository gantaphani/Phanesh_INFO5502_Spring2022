petitioner carlos bringas rodriguez is a citizen of mexico and a gay man who was sexually abused by family members and a neighbor in mexico.he challenges the bia decision denying his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and convention against torture cat protection,and denying his motion to remand to the ij in light of his recent hiv diagnosis.relying on our decision in castro martinez holder,cir,the bia found that bringas failed to show that the mexican government was unwilling or unable to control those who perpetrated such acts.we have jurisdiction under a,and we deny the petition.
petitioner,bringas rodriguez bringas,was born and raised in tres valles,veracruz,mexico.he began to realize that he was attracted to men at age six,and by age ten he considered himself gay.he is now openly gay and is.as a child,he suffered physical abuse at the hands of his father,who would tell him to act like a boy,you not a woman and to do things a man does.his father also abused bringas mother and siblings,but he says he was abused most of all because he was different.
bringas was later sexually abused by his uncle,cousins,and a neighbor.his uncle began the abuse when bringas was four and continued the abuse every two or three months until he turned twelve.when bringas turned seven,his cousins began to abuse him on a monthly basis as well.bringas testified that when he turned eight,his uncle admitted to him that he was sexually abusing him because bringas was gay.he further recalled that his abusers never called him by his name but called him fag,f g faggot,queer and laughed about it.
bringas first came to the united states with his mother and stepfather in when he was twelve,and he lived with them in kansas for five months.bringas was undocumented.he then moved back to mexico because he was troubled over hiding his sexuality and history of abuse,and he wanted to live with his grandmother.once back in mexico,however,the abuse continued.his uncle,cousins,and a neighbor raped him in his early teens.he never reported the abuse to the police,believing such a complaint would be frivolous,and he did not tell his family until years later,fearing that his abusers would harm his mother or grandmother.
in,at age fourteen,bringas returned to the united states to live with his mother and stepfather in kansas and to escape his abusers.in august,bringas was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in colorado essentially,he was drinking at his house and a friend brought over a minor.bringas spent ninety days in jail,where he attempted suicide.dhs filed a notice to appear in september.
in february,bringas filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat,alleging that he was raped by his uncle,cousins,and neighbor while living in mexico.he explained that he feared returning to mexico because he would be persecuted for being gay and the police would ignore his complaints.the ij denied all applications for relief.he denied bringas asylum claim because it was untimely with respect to withholding,the ij found that bringas had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of his uncle,cousins,and neighbor,but concluded that the abuse,while horrendous,did not constitute past persecution on account of a protected status.the ij found that perverse sexual urges motivated the abusers,and not bringas sexual orientation.the ij also observed that bringas never reported his abuse to an adult or to the mexican police and that there was no evidence that mexican authorities were unwilling to offer protection.
turning to the risk of future persecution,the ij looked at country reports for mexico for and and found that,despite a few specific accounts of persecution of homosexuals in mexico,the country as a whole and especially in mexico city has made significant advances with respect to gay people.accordingly,bringas could relocate to a place like mexico city without risking possible future abuse.so,the ij found,bringas did not show a more likely than not possibility of persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group of male homosexuals.
the ij also denied relief under the cat on the grounds that bringas offered insufficient evidence that the government routinely turns a blind eye to allegations of sexual abuse of children.as a result,bringas could not prove that torture in the future by the government,or with the acquiescence of the government was likely.
the bia affirmed.it denied bringas asylum claim on the merits,assuming the application was timely filed.the bia concluded that bringas failed to establish past persecution because he could not show that he was abused on account of a protected ground,and he had not demonstrated that the government was unwilling or unable to control his abusers.bringas was thus not entitled to a presumption of future persecution.the bia also found that bringas did not have a fear of future persecution because he failed to show a pattern or practice of persecution against gays in mexico.citing our opinion in castro martinez holder,cir,the bia explained that no widespread brutality against homosexuals or criminalization of homosexual conduct exists in mexico.additionally,the bia discussed mexico improved treatment of homosexuals over the years mexico has taken numerous positive steps to address the rights of homosexuals,including legalizing gay marriage in mexico city and prosecuting human rights violations against homosexuals.
the bia also rejected bringas withholding of removal and cat claims.with respect to withholding,it noted that because bringas failed to satisfy the lower burden of proof required for asylum,it follows that he has also failed to satisfy the higher standard of eligibility required for withholding of removal.with respect to cat,the bia found no clear error in the ij determination that bringas failed to show that he will more likely than not be tortured in mexico by or with the acquiescence of the mexican government.
finally,the bia rejected bringas argument that his case be remanded to the ij in light of bringas recent hiv diagnosis.bringas brief to the bia explained that,since his hearing before the ij,he had been diagnosed with hiv.he argued that this fact is significant because it now places him in a more vulnerable position should he be returned to mexico.the bia declined to remand bringas case to the ij for further consideration because bringas had not provided any additional country conditions evidence or specific arguments regarding how his status as an hiv positive homosexual changes the outcome of his case.he filed a timely petition for review of the bia dismissal and sought a stay pending review.we granted the stay and now deny the petition for review 
bringas argues that the bia erred in denying his asylum and withholding of removal claims.to be eligible for asylum,an alien must demonstrate that he is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or a political opinion.castro martinez holder,cir citing a a.the requirements for a withholding claim are similar,except that the alien must prove a clear probability of persecution on account of a protected characteristic.b a.if a petitioner can not establish his eligibility for asylum,his withholding claim necessarily also fails.zehatye gonzales,cir.
substantial evidence supports the bia determinations that bringas failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution,and he is thus ineligible for asylum.see castro martinez,at cir elias zacarias,d quoting a noting that we must uphold the bia factual findings if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole because bringas failed to meet his burden to establish eligibility for asylum,he also fails the higher burden required to obtain withholding of removal.castro martinez,at citing gomes gonzales,cir.
past persecution 
asylum petitioners may produce evidence of their past persecution,which creates a presumption of a fear of future persecution.hanna keisler,cir see b.to establish past persecution,bringas must show that he has suffered harm on the basis of a protected ground and that the harm was inflicted either by the government or by individuals or groups the government is unable or unwilling to control.castro martinez,at.the bia concluded that bringas failed to satisfy both prongs.we will only address the second of these prongs.even if we thought that the record compelled the conclusion that bringas was abused on account of his sexual orientation,bringas provided insufficient evidence that the government was unwilling or unable to prevent that abuse.
because the sexual abuse bringas suffered was not inflicted by government actors,he must show that the government was unable or unwilling to control his attackers.id.at.in determining whether the government was unable or unwilling to control violence committed by private parties,the bia may consider whether the victim reported the attacks to the police.id.at citing baballah ashcroft,cir see id.w here the persecutor is not a state actor,we consider whether an applicant reported the incident to police,because in such cases a report of this nature may show governmental inability to control the actors.quoting rahimzadeh holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,petitioners are not required to report persecution to the police in order to show that the government is unable or unwilling to control their abusers.id.at we have never held that any victim,let alone a child,is obligated to report a sexual assault to the authorities,and we do not do so now.
where a petitioner does not report the abuse to the authorities,however,there is a gap in proof about how the government would have responded,and the petitioner bears the burden to fill in the gaps by showing how the government would have responded had he reported the abuse.id.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.it is insufficient for a petitioner to state his belief that the government would do nothing about a report of abuse.rather,a petitioner may show,a mong other avenues,that private persecution of a particular sort is widespread and but not controlled by the government or that others have made reports of similar incidents to no avail.id.quoting rahimzadeh,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we agree with the bia that bringas has not met his burden to prove the government unwillingness to respond.the bia relied on our decision in castro martinez holder,cir,in determining that bringas had not met his burden here.the facts in bringas case are very similar to those in castro martinez.in castro martinez,castro,a gay,mexican man,sought asylum on account of a credible history of sexual abuse suffered because of his sexual orientation.id.at.castro also had failed to report the abuse to mexican officials,and the bia ultimately concluded that he had failed to demonstrate that mexican authorities would have ignored the rape of a young child or that authorities were unable to provide a child protection against rape.id.at see also id.at.we denied castro petition for review.
bringas attempts to distinguish castro martinez.he argues that while castro offered nothing more than a conclusory statement that he believed the police would not have helped him,id.at,bringas provided such evidence by giving a reason why he never reported his abuse to the mexican police he testified that a couple of his gay friends told him that they got raped,they got beat up,like abuse,and they went to the police in veracruz,mexico and they did do anything except laugh in their faces.
we agree with the dissent that castro martinez left open the possibility that bringas could meet his burden of proving that the government was unable or unwilling to control their abusers by showing that others have made reports of similar incidents to no avail.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.but we part ways with the dissent assertion that castro martinez qualifies a gay petitioner for asylum as a matter of course,provided that he submits country reports documenting official persecution on account of sexual orientation and evidence unsubstantiated hearsay or otherwise that others have made reports of similar incidents to no avail.dissenting op.at quoting castro martinez,at.castro martinez sets forth no such mechanical formula for obtaining asylum,nor does our holding there support the proposition that any evidence of other reports of similar incidents,no matter how unreliable,is sufficient to satisfy this other avenue of establishing that a government is unable or unwilling to prevent persecution.implicit in castro martinez holding is that,in order for this method of proof to be successful,the evidence must be sufficient.
here,we agree with the ij and the bia that bringas evidence was not sufficient.looking first to the country reports bringas submitted,neither the nor the report mentions any instances of discrimination or persecution in his home state of veracruz,mexico.indeed,the two reports,produced by the state department to survey the state of sexual orientation discrimination across a country of million people,note only one specific example of government persecution on the basis of sexual orientation in mexico.the dissent highlights this incident in detail,but does not explain why the ij reviewing this documentation should have concluded that a single example establish es that government discrimination persist s.dissenting op.at.nor does the dissent seek to draw any connections from this incident,which occurred in,to circumstances in tres valles,a town nearly miles away.
rather,the country reports bringas provided to the ij highlighted gay pride marches in cities across the country,the largest drawing participants.additionally,the report described the expansion of marriage equality in mexico city,and detailed a ruling from the mexican supreme court requiring mexico states to recognize legally performed marriages performed elsewhere,a ruling,we note,that was made five years before the united states supreme court reached a similar conclusion.in sum,the country reports submitted to the ij simply do not make a persuasive case that the mexican government was unwilling or unable to protect bringas 
turning next to bringas testimony,bringas provided very few details about his friends negative experiences with police in veracruz.he offered no details about his friends accounts no names,ages,indication of the nature of their relationship to bringas,information on how or to whom they reported their abuse,or any evidence showing that these nameless friends actually reported any abuse to the mexican authorities.even if we could fully credit bringas friends statements,there is no evidence connecting general police practices in the state or city of veracruz with the specific police practices in bringas town of tres valles without something to suggest that the police in tres valles would respond in the same way as the police described in bringas friends reports,we decline his invitation to compel the bia to paint all the police in veracruz with the same broad brush.
the dissent resists this conclusion by stating that because bringas friends reported discrimination by police in veracruz and tres valles is in the state of veracruz,any geographic objection s to bringas evidence must fail.dissenting op.at.to draw a parallel,the dissent argument is that if someone reports discrimination at the hands of police in california,it would be fair to assume that police in san diego,eureka,or santa barbara would act in accordance with that report.we refuse to make this unfounded logical leap.the dissent is correct that in light of the difficulty of gathering evidence of persecution,we adjust the evidentiary requirements for asylum seekers,id.at quotation marks omitted we do not,however,forego them completely,and reference to vague reports from anonymous friends can not overcome the lack of any corroborating evidence 
by highlighting the factual gaps in bringas description of his friends reports,the dissent suggests that we inappropriately discount his testimony despite the fact that the ij found his testimony credible.see dissenting op.at.not so.we agree that as a general rule,because the immigration judge did not render an adverse credibility finding,we must accept bringas factual testimony as true and that bringas testimony includes hearsay evidence from anonymous friend s that may not be rejected.gu gonzales,cir.similarly,we do not challenge the well established principle,dissenting op.at,that hearsay evidence is admissible in immigration proceedings,rojas garcia ashcroft,cir.
however,these two propositions do not compel the result pressed for by the dissent.as we have repeatedly held the absence of an adverse credibility finding does not prevent us from considering the relative probative value of hearsay.gu,at see also singh holder,cir sharma holder,cir.indeed,in gu,we explained that statements by the declarant may be accorded less weight by the trier of fact when weighed against evidence.at.here,without many details to flesh out the context of bringas friends hearsay statements,their relative probative value is rather low.
to be clear,we are not,as the dissent charges,discount ing bringas hearsay testimony.dissenting op.at.nor are we requiring a certain level of specificity in bringas description of his friends reports.id.at.instead,we are making what,we think,are commonsense observations a more detailed description should be afforded greater weight than a less detailed description,and hearsay statements with details that can be corroborated are more probative than hearsay statements that do not include any verifiable details.
the dissent response to these conclusions brings the very problem this hearsay evidence poses into sharp relief.in light of bringas hearsay testimony and submitted country reports,the dissent chastises the ij statement that we certainly do not have any evidence whatsoever that mexican authorities were unwilling to protect bringas as plainly wrong.dissenting op.at.the dissent only quoted the ij in part.here is the full statement 
w e certainly do not have any evidence whatsoever that the police in mexico or the authorities do not take any action whatsoever to offer some type of protection against the abuse of children,sexually,whether the sexually abused child is a male or female,or whether the abuser is a male or a female.
emphasis added.
the ij finding is quite correct.there is no doubt that bringas did not offer any evidence suggesting that mexican police refused to protect abused children.the submitted country reports make no reference to it,and because bringas hearsay statement was so lacking in detail,we have no idea how old his friends were who reported abuse to the police in veracruz.because bringas testimony was so vague,even the dissent attempts to bolster its veracity get tangled up in its factual shortcomings.rather,the full statement of the ij only demonstrates how firmly in line the ij and bia were with this court precedent.see castro martinez,at affirming the bia reliance on the lack of evidence in the record that mexican authorities would have ignored the rape of a young child or that authorities were unable to provide a child protection against rape 
as the ij recognized,bringas allegations are not just about discrimination against gay and lesbian mexicans they are about child molestation.bringas has put forward no evidence that mexico tolerates the sexual abuse of children,or that mexican officials would refuse to protect an abused child based on the gender of his or her abusers.instead,substantial evidence supports the bia finding that bringas failed to prove that the government would be unwilling or unable to control his abusers,and bringas bare hearsay assertions from friends of unknown ages are insufficient to overturn the bia contrary conclusion,which was based on other evidence in the record.accordingly,we hold that bringas failed to establish his past persecution and is therefore not entitled to a presumption of a fear of future persecution.see b.
well founded fear of future persecution 
alternatively,in the absence of evidence of past persecution,a petitioner may simply provide evidence of a fear of future persecution.to establish a fear,bringas must show that his fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.castro martinez,at citing ahmed keisler,cir.as there was no adverse credibility determination,we accept that bringas fear of future persecution was genuine.id.citing li holder,cir.in order to show that his fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable,bringas has two avenues.he may demonstrate that he was a member of a disfavored group against which there was a systematic pattern or practice of persecution,or that he belongs to a disfavored group and has an individualized risk of being singled out for persecution.sael ashcroft,cir see b iii.
bringas pattern or practice of persecution argument lacks merit,and he forfeited his argument that he will be singled out as a member of a disfavored group when he failed to raise it before the bia.
pattern or practice of persecution 
bringas argues that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of gay men in mexico.despite some evidence of violence against gays in mexico,castro martinez forecloses this argument.in castro martinez,we rejected the claim that the mexican government systematically harmed gay men and failed to protect them from violence.at.although we acknowledged evidence of discrimination and attacks,we explained that country conditions reports showed that the mexican government efforts to prevent violence and discrimination against homosexuals ha d increased in recent years,and,we noted,mexican law prohibits several types of discrimination,including bias based on sexuality,and it requires federal agencies to promote tolerance.id.recognizing the mexican government radio campaign to fight homophobia and noting the various country reports reflections of the ongoing improvement of police treatment of gay men and efforts to prosecute homophobic crimes.
here,the bia made findings similar to those in castro martinez and found that the situation for gay men in mexico is improving.it first cited bromfield mukasey,cir,a case where we held that there was a pattern or practice of persecution against gay men in jamaica a country which criminalized homosexual conduct and prosecuted individuals under the law the evidence there also showed numerous cases of violence and widespread brutality against persons based on sexual orientation.then the bia turned to bringas case and stated that unlike bromfield 
t he record here does not demonstrate widespread brutality against homosexuals or that there is any criminalization of homosexual conduct in mexico to the contrary,the record shows that mexico has taken numerous positive steps to address the rights of homosexuals,including legalizing gay marriage in mexico city and prosecuting human rights violations against homosexuals.
bringas offers no evidence showing that there has been a change in conditions in mexico since we decided castro martinez.accordingly,we are bound by our holding in castro martinez,and the bia determination that no pattern or practice of persecution exists is supported by substantial evidence 
singled out for persecution as a member of a disfavored group 
even without evidence of a pattern or practice of persecution,bringas could still establish a fear if he could demonstrate a particularized risk that he will be singled out for persecution if returned to mexico.bringas argues that he has been singled out in the past for mistreatment for his membership in the disfavored group of homosexual men,so he has a strong individualized risk of future harm.the government argues that bringas forfeited this claim when he failed to raise it before the bia.we agree that bringas failed to exhaust this argument before the bia.
bringas failed to argue that he would be singled out for persecution as a member of a disfavored group in his brief to the bia he consequently has forfeited this claim.see abebe mukasey,cir en banc per curiam holding that an alien is deemed to have exhausted only those issues he raised and argued in his brief before the bia see also alvarado holder,cir although a petitioner need not raise his precise argument in administrative proceedings,he must specify which issues form the basis of the appeal.alterations and emphasis in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.he argues that by raising his similar claim of a pattern or practice of persecution,he necessarily exhausted his argument before the bia.not so.the pattern or practice argument is separate and distinct from the singled group argument,and we analyze them separately,wakkary holder,cir.unlike the pattern or practice analysis,the singled group analysis requires proof of an individualized risk of harm.see b iii see also castro martinez,at wakkary,at sael,at.
our holding in castro martinez forecloses bringas pattern or practice of persecution argument,and he failed to exhaust his argument that he will be singled out as a member of a disfavored group.bringas has not demonstrated a fear of future persecution,and,accordingly,we deny the petition with respect to asylum and withholding of removal.
bringas claim under the cat fails because he did not show that he would more likely than not be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the mexican government if he is removed to mexico.see garcia milian holder,cir.to qualify for cat relief,an alien must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.id.at quoting c.the bia found no clear error in the ij determination that bringas did not demonstrate that he will more likely than not be tortured in mexico by or with the acquiescence of an official of the mexican government.
even if bringas past experiences constituted torture,the bia is not required to presume that he would be tortured again because of his own credible testimony that he had been subjected to torture as a child.konou holder,cir.this is especially true where the factors that precipitated bringas mistreatment as a child would be less relevant to a selfsufficient homosexual adult.id.at.here,the ij determined that bringas could likely relocate to a different part of mexico,such as mexico city,where the population appears more accepting of gays,and the ij noted the complete lack of evidence indicating that the mexican government was aware of any torture taking place.the ij concluded that bringas reports showing instances of mistreatment of homosexuals in mexico were not sufficient to establish the burden of proof requirement of a more likely than not possibility of torture.the same evidence that supported the bia dismissal of the claim also supports the ij and bia conclusions that bringas failed to establish a likelihood of torture conditions in mexico are insufficiently dangerous for gay people to constitute a likelihood of or sanctioned torture.see castro martinez,at.and because substantial evidence supported the bia denial of cat relief,we deny bringas petition with respect to his claim under the cat.
finally,the bia did not abuse its discretion in finding that bringas hiv diagnosis,standing alone,does not require a remand to the ij.in bringas brief to the bia,he moved to remand the case because,not long after the ij decision issued,he discovered that he is hiv positive.the bia denied his motion to remand.
denials of motions to remand are reviewed for abuse of discretion.malhi,cir.the bia abuses its discretion if its decision is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.romero ruiz mukasey,cir quoting lopez galarza,cir konstantinova,cir the bia abuses its discretion when it fails to offer a reasoned explanation for its decision,distorts or disregards important aspects of the alien claim.
the bia gave a rational explanation for its denial of bringas motion to remand based on his hiv diagnosis.in requesting a remand,bringas merely noted in one short paragraph at the end of his brief to the bia that his diagnosis is a significant fact because it now places him in a more vulnerable position should he be returned to mexico.the bia rejected this argument because bringas did not provide any additional country conditions evidence or specific arguments regarding how his status as an hiv positive homosexual changes the outcome of his case.the bia also noted that the lack of access to hiv drugs is a problem suffered not only by homosexuals but by the mexican population as a whole.see castro martinez,at.because the bia offered a reasoned explanation and its decision was neither arbitrary nor irrational,we hold that the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying bringas motion to remand.
in sum,we hold that substantial evidence supported the bia denial of bringas claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat.we also conclude that the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying bringas motion to remand.
concurrently,we grant the motion of the public law center,lambda legal defense and education fund,the national immigrant justice center,the center for hiv law and policy,hiv law project,immigration equality,disability rights legal center,and the asian pacific islander wellness center to file a brief as amici curiae in support of bringas.we deny bringas motion to take judicial notice of facts beyond the administrative record.see b a singh ashcroft,cir.
petition denied.
carlos bringas rodriguez,a mexican national,testified credibly that throughout his childhood in the town of tres valles in the state of veracruz he was sexually abused by his uncle,his cousins,and a neighbor.his abusers told him they were abusing him because he was gay,and they referred to him using homophobic slurs.his abusers also punched him and beat him,and they threatened to hurt him and his grandmother if he told anyone about the abuse.
bringas rodriguez left mexico twice.the first time,he came to the united states at age twelve and lived briefly with his mother and in kansas.while he was in kansas,some of his gay mexican friends told him that they had reported similar abuse to mexican police officers but that the officers had laughed at them,refused to provide help,and told them they deserved the abuse they received.the second time,he came to the united states at age fourteen.he has not returned to mexico.
bringas rodriguez never reported to mexican police the abuse he suffered.he testified credibly before the immigration judge ij that he did not do so because he believed a report would be pointless.
the panel majority denies bringas rodriguez asylum claim.the majority relies primarily on castro martinez holder,cir,a decision in which we denied a similar asylum claim.but castro martinez was a carefully circumscribed decision.in castro martinez we stated that,even if a petitioner himself had not reported abuse,asylum could be warranted if the petitioner showed that mexican officials were unwilling to help other gay victims of abuse.
i have growing doubts about the correctness of castro martinez,an opinion with which i agreed when it was issued.however,even to the extent castro martinez should remain the law of this circuit,i respectfully dissent from the panel conclusion that it forecloses relief in this case.
past persecution in mexico 
carlos bringas rodriguez began to realize his attractions when he was six.as early as ten years old,he considered himself gay.as a child,bringas rodriguez was physically abused by his father,who told him,act like a boy,you not a woman.his father abused bringas rodriguez mother and siblings as well,but he abused bringas rodriguez the most because he was different.
bringas rodriguez was also abused and raped by an uncle,his cousins,and a neighbor.bringas rodriguez uncle began to sexually abuse him when he was just four years old,and his uncle abused him every two or three months thereafter.after bringas rodriguez turned seven,his cousins sexually abused him on a monthly basis.bringas rodriguez uncle,cousins,and a neighbor raped him at home when his mother was not there,and sometimes dragged him into nearby bushes in the neighborhood.bringas rodriguez abusers told him that they would hurt him and his grandmother if he told anyone,and,on a few occasions,they punched him.on one occasion,when bringas rodriguez resisted one cousin attempt to rape him,the cousin beat him severely.
when bringas rodriguez was eight,his uncle told him that the reason for the ongoing abuse was bringas rodriguez sexuality.his uncle was not alone in his views.bringas rodriguez testified,my abusers never called me by my name but called me fag,fucking faggot,queer and laughed about it.
bringas rodriguez first came to the united states in,when he was twelve.he lived in kansas with his mother and for five months,and continued to hide his sexuality and history of sexual abuse.when bringas rodriguez returned to mexico to live with his grandmother after his stay in kansas,the abuse resumed unabated.bringas rodriguez uncle sexually abused him again.bringas rodriguez cousins referred to him as their sex toy and resumed their abuse.a neighbor raped him.the neighbor assault left bringas rodriguez with bruises all over his body.because of the continuing abuse and rape,bringas rodriguez fled mexico,returning to the united states in at age fourteen.
bringas rodriguez never told the mexican police about the abuse he had suffered.even though he wanted protection from his abusers,bringas rodriguez believed any complaints to the police would have been futile.he testified before the ij that,while he was living in kansas,two mexican gay friends told me that they got raped,they got beat up,like abuse,and they went to the police and they did do anything.they even laugh in their faces.in a declaration submitted to the immigration court,bringas rodriguez wrote that he feared that the mexican police would laugh at me and tell me i deserved what i got because i was gay.this happened to friends of mine in veracruz.
ii.persecution the government is unable or unwilling to control 
to establish his eligibility for asylum,bringas rodriguez must demonstrate that he is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or a political opinion.castro martinez,at citing a a.bringas rodriguez must also show the harm was inflicted either by the government or by individuals or groups the government is unable or unwilling to control.id.
persecution on the basis of a protected ground 
we have held that gay men in mexico can constitute a social group for the purpose of an asylum claim.see also boer sedano gonzales,cir.undisputed evidence in the record shows that bringas rodriguez was abused,over a sustained period,for being gay.bringas rodriguez testified that his uncle told him he was being abused because he was gay.bringas rodriguez also testified that his uncle,cousins,and neighbor never called me by my name but called me fag,fucking faggot,queer and laughed about it.every person who abused bringas rodriguez throughout his childhood either told him that he was being abused for being gay or referred to him using homophobic slurs.
government unable or unwilling to control the harm 
the question at the heart of this case is thus not whether bringas rodriguez was abused because he was gay.rather,it is whether bringas rodriguez can show that the mexican government was unable or unwilling to control his abusers.i agree with the panel majority that this question is currently controlled by castro martinez,an opinion i joined four years ago.but i part ways with the majority as to the meaning and application of castro martinez.
in castro martinez,we discussed different methods by which an asylum seeker could demonstrate a government inability or unwillingness to control harm inflicted by private parties.for example,we stated that the bia may consider whether the victim reported the attacks to the police.castro martinez,at.while such a report can suffice to demonstrate a government unwillingness to control the persecution,a report is not necessary.we have never held that any victim,let alone a child,is obligated to report a sexual assault to the authorities,and we do not do so now.id.at.but if the victim does not report to the police,there is a gap in proof about how the government would have responded.id.alterations omitted quoting rahimzadeh holder,cir.in such cases,the petitioner bears the burden of filling that gap.id.
we were careful in castro martinez to list other avenues through which a petitioner could carry this burden.id.specifically,we identified four additional ways in which an asylum seeker like bringas rodriguez could show that his government was unwilling or unable to prevent persecution by parties.he could 
establish that private persecution of a particular sort is widespread and but not controlled by the government 
show that others have made reports of similar incidents to no avail 
demonstrat e that a country laws or customs effectively deprive the petitioner of any meaningful recourse to governmental protection or 
convincingly establish that going to the authorities would have been futile or would have subjected the individual to further abuse.
id.at alterations omitted quoting rahimzadeh,at.after reviewing the facts in castro martinez,we concluded that the petitioner did not present sufficient evidence to show that mexican officials would have been unable or unwilling to prevent his abuse.id.
the panel majority here concludes that castro martinez compels denial of bringas rodriguez petition because t he facts in bringas case are very similar to those in castro martinez.op.at.the facts are similar in one respect.in both cases,petitioners introduced united states state department country reports describing police violence against homosexuals.in castro martinez,the petitioner submitted country reports documenting societal discrimination against homosexuals in mexico and attacks on gay men committed by private parties.at.he also presented evidence of widespread police corruption in mexico and incidents of police violence against homosexuals.id.we concluded that these reports,without more,did not compel the conclusion that the police would have disregarded or harmed a male child who reported being the victim of homosexual rape by another male.id.at.
in the case now before us,bringas rodriguez submitted similar country reports.because bringas rodriguez left mexico in and has not returned since,the relevant period for purposes of our analysis is the years before.bringas rodriguez submitted country reports from and.although the and reports the period at issue in this case,they provide probative information.both country reports state that in mexico discrimination and persecution based on sexual orientation including discrimination and persecution by governmental officials had lessened over time.but they also state that discrimination and persecution remained serious problems,five and six years after bringas rodriguez left the country.
the country report states,while homosexual conduct experienced growing social acceptance,the national center to prevent and control stated that discrimination persisted.the country report similarly notes that,according to a governmental agency and a nonprofit organization,societal discrimination based on sexual orientation remained common.the report continues 
one of the most prominent cases of discrimination and violence against gay men was that of agustin humberto estrada negrete,a teacher and gay activist from ecatepec,mexico state.in he participated in a gay rights march wearing a dress and high heels.according to the ngo asilegal,soon after the march,estrada began receiving threatening telephone calls and verbal and physical attacks.in he was fired from the school for children with disabilities where he worked.after his dismissal,he and a group of supporters began lobbying the government to reinstate him when they went to the governor palace to attend a meeting with state officials in may,police beat him and his supporters.the next day he was taken to prison,threatened,and raped.although he was released,estrada continued to face harassment by state authorities.
emphasis added.through these reports,bringas rodriguez established that government discrimination on the basis of sexuality in mexico persisted,even years after he fled the country.
while castro martinez and bringas rodriguez both p
