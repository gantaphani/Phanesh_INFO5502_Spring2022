christine lennon appeals a final judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the district court.lennon pled guilty to being found in the united states,having knowingly and unlawfully the united states in violation of a and b.lennon claims that the district court sentencing analysis violated her rights under the constitution ex post facto clause.in part,this analysis turns on defining the nature of the offense to which lennon pled.we have jurisdiction under and,for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
lennon entered the united states in at the age of as a lawful permanent resident.she is a single mother of three children,all american citizens by birth.she has maintained a close relationship with her children and has provided for them despite receiving no support from their three biological fathers she also suffers from graves disease,an autoimmune disorder.
lennon means of providing for herself and her children have not always been legal.in,at age nineteen and only two years after assuming legal permanent residency in the united states,lennon committed a shoplifting offense.she was convicted in and received a fine.that year,lennon was also charged with and convicted of violating the pennsylvania controlled substance act,when drugs and drug paraphernalia were found in her apartment.she served months of her to month sentence.in,she was convicted of aggravated assault on a new jersey state trooper.lennon led the troopers on a chase that reached speeds over miles per hour and ended when she struck a different trooper vehicle with her car lennon was sentenced to four years imprisonment,but was paroled to ins custody for deportation due to her criminal activity.
lennon was deported to her native jamaica on september.eleven months after being deported,lennon the united states under the pseudonym diedra barlow.she neither applied for admission to the united states nor obtained the express consent of the attorney general before she.see a.
soon after her illegal,lennon resumed her violations of the law.she was convicted in of possession with intent to distribute marijuana that offense resulted in a sentence of sixty days imprisonment followed by three years probation.lennon also pled guilty to shoplifting three times in,receiving a probation sentence each of the last two times.additional shoplifting charges remain pending against her in cherry hill,new jersey upper merion township,pennsylvania and springfield township,pennsylvania grand larceny and grand theft charges remain pending against her in,respectively,orange county and palm beach county,florida.
lennon eventually came to the attention of ins officials as a result of an anonymous tip and was apprehended on july.she was indicted for,and pled guilty to,being found in the united states,having knowingly and unlawfully the united states in violation of a and b hereinafter section.at.section a contains three separate offenses,phrased in the disjunctive illegal,attempted illegal reentry,and being found illegally in the united states.see united states disantillo,cir.
at sentencing,lennon contended that the indictment ambiguously charged her both with illegal,and with being illegally found in the united states.the government asserted that that lennon was charged only with the found in charge of section a and contended that such a violation is a continuing one,starting on the date or approximate date of her actual in and running through her apprehension in.that being so,the government advocated including as criminal history enhancements two of lennon crimes that occurred for criminal history purposes fewer than ten years before her date but more than ten years before the date in on which she was found,in the sense of being actually apprehended.
lennon also argued that,whatever crime she was charged with,the sentencing guidelines should apply because her crime was completed upon her illegal in.the government disagreed,pointing out that section enumerates being found in as a criminal offense that is distinct from unlawful reentry.the government argued that because her found in violation was continuing,it was committed at the time she through the date when she came to the attention of ins officials in.under that theory,the version of the guidelines was inapplicable.
in the alternative,lennon argued that the district court should use the november version of the in effect on the date she was apprehended by ins than the november version of the in effect on the date she was sentenced.the government contended that use of the november guidelines was appropriate and gave rise to no ex post facto issue.
in imposing sentence,the district court first held that lennon crime was committed on the date she was found thus falling under the found in prong of section.the district court looked to the november guidelines,section,to find lennon base offense level to be.the district court then applied the point enhancement in section b a based either on lennon aggravated assault conviction b a ii or her possession with intent to distribute conviction b a i.next,the district court reduced her offense level by three points for acceptance of responsibility under section for a total offense level of.
finally,the district court looked to lennon extensive criminal history in order to assign her a criminal history score.the district court did consider under section e those of lennon offenses that occurred more than ten years before her found holding that found in violations are continuing assigned her four criminal history points for those offenses.the district court assigned an additional points under section e for those of lennon crimes that occurred within ten years before her found date.the district court designated a total criminal history category of v.the district court determined,however,that this criminal history was overstated,and reduced it to a category iv,making her sentencing range months.see sentencing guidelines manual.the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.lennon timely appealed and maintains that the district court violated her rights under the constitution ex post facto clause.
we exercise plenary review over the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines and constitutional questions.see united states cicirello,cir united states spinello,cir united states figueroa,cir.we review the district court factual findings for clear error,see cicirello,at,and the district court application of those facts to the guidelines for an abuse of discretion.see buford united states,d united states zats,cir.in this context,we consider each of lennon claims in turn.
the ex post facto clause provides no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.const.art.i,cl.see also const.art.i,cl.a law does not run afoul of the ex post facto clause unless it retroactively alters the definition of criminal conduct or increases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.cal.dep t of corr.morales,d see also,lynce mathis,d citing calder bull,dall.united states brady,cir citing cummings missouri,wall.the sentencing with all statutes that impose or dictate,of course,subject to the ex post facto clause.see miller florida,d united states kopp,cir see also sentencing guidelines manual.but a district court is entitled to employ the guidelines in place at the time of sentencing unless doing so would expose the defendant to harsher penalties than were in effect at the time the crime was committed.see united states corrado,cir.in order to establish,therefore,that the ex post facto clause requires the application of an earlier version of the sentencing guidelines,a defendant must show that the crime was committed at a time that the earlier guidelines version was in force and that the earlier version is more favorable to him or her.see united states audinot,cir.
lennon first contends that the version of the guidelines in force on the date of her have been used to calculate her sentence.those guidelines would have been more favorable to her because,she argues,she would have a reduction for acceptance of total offense level of,rather than the level the district court calculated under the november guidelines
