opinion of the court 
in the petition by errol nugent at for review of a final order of removal by the board of immigration appeals bia,we must decide whether we have jurisdiction inasmuch as nugent was ordered removed from the united states under a a ii for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.in the consolidated appeal at from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania we must decide whether a conviction under a pennsylvania theft by deception statute constitutes an aggravated felony.
we hold that we lack jurisdiction in the petition for review of the final order of removal and will dismiss the petition,but,for reasons other than those stated by the district court,we affirm the judgment of the district court on the aggravated felony issue denying the writ of habeas corpus without prejudice to appellant applying to the attorney general for cancellation of the removal order pursuant to.we will first address the petition for review.
nugent is a native and citizen of jamaica who entered the united states on august,as a lawful permanent resident when he was seven years old.on january,he was convicted in the court of common pleas of montgomery county for the state of pennsylvania of theft by unlawful taking theft of movable property in violation of.ann.a west supp and receiving stolen property in violation of.ann.a west supp.the crime involved theft of two typewriters valued at a total of approximately.nugent could have been sentenced to five years imprisonment,but instead he was sentenced to months on probation.theft of the two typewriters valued at this amount constituted a misdemeanor of the first degree.see.ann.b west supp.a misdemeanor of the first degree was punishable by up to five years imprisonment.see.ann.west com schreiber,holding that a sentence of five years imprisonment would have been appropriate for a misdemeanor conviction of theft by unlawful taking.
on november,nugent was convicted in the court of common pleas of montgomery county for the state of pennsylvania of theft by deception in violation of.ann.a west supp.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than six months but not more than months.
it was on the basis of nugent pennsylvania conviction that the immigration and naturalization service ins charged nugent with removability from the united states under a a iii for having been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in a g.the original notice to appear stated

the conviction alleged above in allegation and the conviction alleged in allegation on the notice to appear dated february,did not arise out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.

and how do you plead allegations six and seven

on the same day,october,the ij issued an oral decision concluding that nugent was subject to removal as an aggravated felon.the ij then added further,in court today counsel has conceded the allegations set forth in the.the court finds the respondent is subject to removal as charged therein.app.at.as set forth above,the form added paragraphs and in which the ins listed nugent conviction for theft by unlawful taking and referenced his conviction for theft by deception.thus,the two crimes involving moral turpitude consisted of theft by deception,conviction date november,as contained in the ins allegation in the original notice to appear,and theft by unlawful taking,conviction date january,as contained in the ins allegation and in the form.the ij specifically ordered nugent removed from the united states based on convictions for both the aggravated felony listed in the notice to appear and the two crimes of moral turpitude listed in the form,additional charges of.
nugent appealed the ij decision to the bia,and on november,the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion,thereby adopting the ij decision as the final agency determination.nugent timely appealed the bia order.
the bia had jurisdiction pursuant to b and to review the decision of the ij.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and b to determine our jurisdiction under a c.drakes zimski,cir.section a c,the ina provision,bars us from reviewing any final removal order for an alien who has been ordered removed from the united states because of convictions for either an aggravated felony or two crimes of moral turpitude,among other offenses.thus,we must determine whether these jurisdictional facts are present.valansi ashcroft,cir.
in determining the pure legal questions before us that govern our own jurisdiction,we apply a de novo standard of review.id.
the ina provision provides in relevant part 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a or a a iii aggravated felony,b,c,or d of this title,or any offense covered by section a a ii two or more crimes involving moral turpitude,not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct of this title for which both predicate offenses are,without regard to their date of commission,otherwise covered by section a a i of this title.
nugent conviction for theft by unlawful taking theft of movable property was a crime involving moral turpitude.the ina does not define moral turpitude,but we have noted that a legal dictionary defines the term as c onduct that is contrary to justice,honesty,or morality.de ashcroft,cir quoting black law dictionary ed.although nugent received a sentence of only months on probation for the conviction,he could have been sentenced to up to five years imprisonment.see.ann.west.ann.and west supp.
likewise,nugent conviction for theft by deception constituted a crime involving moral turpitude.nugent received a sentence of imprisonment of not less than six months but not more than months.the and crimes did not aris e out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct a a ii.both crimes of moral turpitude could have resulted in sentences of one year or longer,id.a a i ii,and whether the crimes were committed more than five years after nugent admission to the united states is irrelevant under a c.therefore,under the no review provision,a c,we lack jurisdiction to review the removal order based on nugent having committed two crimes involving moral turpitude,a a i ii.
although nugent concedes that he is subject to removal based on his convictions for two crimes involving moral turpitude,he nevertheless contests the order of removal based on the aggravated felony conviction because he contends that the pennsylvania theft by deception conviction set forth in paragraph of the notice to appear does not constitute an aggravated felony under a g.for its part,the government concedes that nugent is removable both by reason of having committed an offense that is properly considered an aggravated felony and by reason of having committed two crimes involving moral turpitude for which,respectively,he could have received a sentence of one year br.for resp t at.the government nevertheless asks us to address the aggravated felony issue to obviate the need for nugent to seek resolution of that issue via a petition for writ of habeas corpus.id.at.
having decided,or more properly,because the parties stipulate,that we have no jurisdiction to review the final order bottomed on moral turpitude grounds,we must now decide whether this court possesses jurisdiction to consider the issue both parties have urged upon us by brief and oral argument,whether a conviction under the pennsylvania theft by deception statute constitutes an aggravated felony under a g.it is to this issue that we now turn.
a federal court,whether trial or appellate,is obliged to notice want of jurisdiction on its own motion.mansfield,ry.swan.we have jurisdiction in immigration cases to determine whether jurisdictional facts are present.drakes,at.graven in stone is the maxim that parties can not confer jurisdiction on a federal court by consent or stipulation.reale int l,federal republic of nigeria,cir.without jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause.jurisdiction is power to declare the law,and when it ceases to exist,the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.steel citizens for a better env t,d quoting ex parte mccardle,wall.for a court to pronounce upon the meaning or the constitutionality of a state or federal law when it has no jurisdiction to do so is,by very definition,for a court to act ultra vires.id.at.
nugent asks us to review not the final order but one of two reasons for removal in the final order.for its part,the government recognizes that we lack jurisdiction because of the moral turpitude convictions but somehow seeks a decision on the aggravated felony issue.to assist us in deciding this very difficult issue,on february,we requested supplemental briefing 
by statute,our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing final orders,a,b,d and g,not a particular reason supporting the order.if we do not have jurisdiction to review the order based on one of the reasons,petitioner removability on grounds of two crimes of moral turpitude,what authority do we have to review another reason supporting the order,whether the bia erred in determining that petitioner conviction constitutes an aggravated felony 
in petitioner response dated march,he advised the court 
in october,petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the eastern district of pennsylvania which was docketed at no and assigned to the honorable curtis joyner,judge of the eastern district of pennsylvania.that petition for writ of habeas corpus raised the single question that has been presented to this court,whether theft by deception under pennsylvania law is a theft offense or a offense.the reason for filing that petition at that time was that nugent had just been detained by dhs and this court denied a stay of removal.the government opposed the stay of removal in this court on jurisdictional raised recently by this that denial of the stay did not state a basis for the motions panel decision denying the stay.all facts regarding this court consideration of the matter,as well as the denial of the stay,was set forth in the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.judge joyner issued a stay shortly after the filing of the petition,but,on february,denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus,holding,without opinion or analysis,that theft by deception is an aggravated felony.on february,petitioner appealed the order of judge joyner to this court.attached hereto is a copy of the notice of appeal as well as the docketing statement from this court.
the habeas appeal has been docketed in this court at.by order dated march,we consolidated the habeas appeal from the united states district court at with the present petition to review the order of the bia at.in view of this consolidation,and in light of the thorny jurisdictional problem,we will not consider the aggravated felony issue in this proceeding at.rather,we will consider it in the appeal of the district court habeas corpus judgment at.
accordingly,we will dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the petition to review the removal order based on nugent having committed two crimes involving moral turpitude.see a c and a a.
we now turn to the appeal from the district court at.
nugent contends that the district court erred in denying his habeas corpus petition because it held his pennsylvania conviction for theft by deception was a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a g.because the denial of the writ of habeas corpus was a final order and an appeal was timely we have jurisdiction.our review is plenary on this issue involving statutory construction.valansi,at.
appellant represents to us that because in october,he was detained by the dhs,he applied for writ of habeas corpus under c in the district court.the petition raised the single question that has been presented to this court,whether theft by deception under pennsylvania law is a theft offense or a offense.ltr.of petitioner counsel to the court dated march.although by order dated february,the district court denied the petition without a detailed statement of reasons,it stated in a footnote to its order this court finds that the petitioner was convicted of an aggravated felony and as such,he is removable.see a g.
for the reasons that follow,we disagree with the district court sole reason for denying the writ.we hold that the appellant is removable,but not on the basis of section a g for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,as stated by the court,but solely on the basis of a a ii for having been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude.we will affirm the judgment of the district court on this ground only,and apply the tenet that we may affirm for reasons completely different from those advanced by the district court.paac rizzo,cir cert.denied,d i t is proper for an appellate court to affirm a correct decision of a lower court even when that decision is based on an inappropriate ground emphasis in original.we now discuss in detail why we disagree with the district court stated reason that nugent conviction under pennsylvania theft by deception statute.ann,constitutes an aggravated felony as defined by the ina.we have not previously addressed whether a conviction under pennsylvania theft by deception statute comes within the rubric of an aggravated felony as it relates to a theft offense under a g an offense that involves fraud or deceit under a m i.
the record indicates that on january,nugent attempted to make two withdrawals totaling from an account in the name of earl rampert at willow grove bank in abington township,pennsylvania.earlier on the same day,nugent had made separate withdrawals of and,respectively,from the willow grove and hatboro branches of willow grove bank.the account from which nugent attempted to make the withdrawals had been opened with a deposit on december,and a check for had been deposited into the account on january.nugent admitted to police that the check was counterfeit.
on november,nugent was convicted in the court of common pleas of montgomery county for the state of pennsylvania of theft by deception in violation of.ann.west supp section is taken word for word from of the model penal code code promulgated by the american law institute ali in.nugent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than six months but not more than months.
the ij concluded and the bia agreed that nugent pennsylvania conviction of theft by deception came within the purview of a g,that includes as an aggravated felony any theft offense including receipt of stolen property and robbery for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.
nugent argues that because his conviction for theft by deception involved fraud or deceit,it is not a theft offense under a g,but a fraud or deceit offense under a m i,in which t he term aggravated felony means an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.the loss suffered by the victims of nugent theft by deception did not exceed,and thus the ins did not charge him with removability based on section a m i.
whether nugent theft by deception offense is a theft offense a an offense involving fraud or deceit is a distinction with a serious difference,as it carries a significant consequence for nugent.there is no minimum dollar amount to constitute an aggravated felony if the pennsylvania conviction is a theft offense as contemplated by section a g,but if it is an offense that involves fraud or deceit and the loss to the victim or victims is or less,it would not qualify as an aggravated felony under section a m i.here,the bad check amounted to only.
carrying his reasoning one step further,nugent argues that although he is subject to removal based on his convictions for two crimes involving moral turpitude,convictions on this ground alone do not prevent him from applying for cancellation of the removal order pursuant to.having a conviction that is deemed an aggravated felony,however,would make nugent ineligible to apply for the cancellation.see a stating that the attorney general may not cancel removal in the case of an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
nugent argues first that the determination of what constitutes a theft offense in the context of the ina definition of an aggravated felony is made by reference to a federal standard rather than the labels attached to crimes by pennsylvania criminal laws.see taylor united states,d stating that the term burglary in e must have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various states criminal codes in re,interim decision bia explaining that we generally apply a federal standard in determining whether a state offense fits within the aggravated felony definition.
nugent is correct in saying that pennsylvania labeling of the crime as theft by deception is not determinative of its status as a theft offense under section a g.rather,this court must examine the plain language of the ina and assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.ins phinpathya,d internal quotations and citations omitted.
moreover,nugent contends that congress inclusion in section a m i of the language fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds demonstrates that congress did not intend fraud or deceit offenses involving or less to nevertheless be defined as aggravated felonies under section a g.see ins,d explaining where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion internal quotations and citation omitted.
although we reject nugent argument,for the reasons that follow,we agree with his contention that an offense under pennsylvania theft by deception statute falls within section a m i so that it would not be an aggravated felony unless the victim suffered a loss exceeding.but we must go further,we must decide whether the pennsylvania statute must also meet the requirements of section a g.
in aligning state and federal criminal offenses,previously this court has applied a formal categorical approach that requires comparison of the elements of the state law offense to see if they encompass acts beyond those subject to prosecution under the federal definition.drakes,at noting the supreme court endorsement of such an approach in taylor,at.
where federal criminal statutes use words of established meaning without further elaboration,courts typically give those terms their common law definition.moskal united states,d gilbert united states,d in the absence of anything to the contrary it is fair to assume that congress used theft in the statute in its sense.if research into the common law yields several competing definitions,however,courts should look to the reading that best accords with the overall purposes of the statute even if it is the minority view.moskal,at.where the traditional definition is out of step with the modern meaning of a term,more generic,contemporary as those found in state apply.see taylor,at.furthermore,congress general purpose in enacting a law may prevail over this rule of statutory construction altogether.id.
under this approach,we must examine pennsylvania theft by deception law to see if it encompasses acts beyond those subject to prosecution under the federal theft offense definition,as contemplated by a g.id.at.more specifically,we must determine whether a pennsylvania theft by deception offense is also an offense involving fraud or deceit set forth in a m i.
unfortunately the ina does not define theft offense,and equally unfortunately,congress has not supplied a definition of theft or larceny in the galaxy of federal offenses.and,in the context of the facts in this case,we are unwilling to say that the contretemps involving a theft offense crime and a fraud or deceit crime is free from ambiguity.we therefore must refer to the teachings of drakes and follow the formal categorical approach.
our starting point is clear.where federal criminal statutes use words of established meaning without further elaboration,courts typically give those terms their common law definition.
the common law spoke in terms of larceny,rather than theft and the words are used interchangeably.blackstone defined larceny simply as the felonious taking and carrying away of the personal goods of another.blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england,book iv,at.but in the development of the common law,courts defined larceny in more comprehensive terms.the refined common law description appears to be the felonious taking by trespass and carrying away by any person of the personal goods or things of another from any place,without the latter consent and with the felonious intent to deprive the owner of his or her property permanently and to convert it to the taker own use d,larceny.professor wayne lafave supplies a concise summary 
larceny at common law may be defined as the trespassory,taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to steal it.american statutes dealing with larceny as a discrete offense have generally left the six elements of the crime unchanged,except that there has been considerable enlargement of the kinds of property which can be the subject of larceny.
wayne lafave,substantive criminal law,at ed footnote omitted.
before statutory offenses appeared on the scene,c hoses in action including bonds and notes of all classes,according to the common law,are not the subject of larceny,being mere rights of action,having no corporeal existence though a person may be indicted for stealing the paper on which they are written.i wharton criminal law,at ed.emphasis added.a bank check was considered a excluded from the common law offense of larceny.see bell united states,d.
thus,it would seem that the modern crime of obtaining property by false pretenses was not even a crime at common law.to plug the loophole,in parliament enacted a statute that punished one who knowingly and designedly,by false pretense or pretenses,shall obtain from any person or persons,money,goods,wares or merchandises,with intent to cheat or defraud any person or persons of the same.geo ii,cited in lafave,supra,at.in the eighteenth century,t he theoretical distinction between false pretenses and larceny by trick may be stated simply.if a thief,through his trickery,acquired title to the property from the owner,he has obtained property by false pretenses but if he merely acquired possession from the owner,he has committed larceny by trick.bell,at.emphasis added.
specific to pennsylvania,our research discloses that the false pretenses statute,geo ii,was not received by the province prior to the declaration of independence and the subsequent creation of the present commonwealth 
an act was passed on the january,entitled an act to revive and put in force such and so much of the late laws of the province of pennsylvania,as is judged necessary to be in force in this commonwealth.in this act it is provided,that the common law,and such of the statute laws of england as have been heretofore in force in the said province,shall be in force,except as hereafter excepted.
samuel roberts,digest of select british statutes xv hereinafter digest discussed in commonwealth guy,aldisert.an examination of pennsylvania official compendium of british statutes that were deemed to be in effect at the time pennsylvania became a state reveals that the statute geo ii,was not included.see generally,digest containing the full december,report to the pennsylvania legislature by the justices of the supreme court of pennsylvania of the english statutes which are in force in the said commonwealth,and of those of the said statutes which in their opinion ought to be incorporated into the statute laws of the said commonwealth,id.at xv.
from the foregoing discussion,we must conclude that the government may not find support for its position in the common law crime of larceny,or theft,because the property that was the subject of its asportation had to be tangible and corporeal,like bonds,notes,and,to be sure,modern bank checks,were not considered goods or property in the context of common law larceny.similarly,nugent finds no succor in the common law because the crime of false pretenses,a fraud or deceit crime,was the product of parliament and not the collective experience of the judiciary.
following the direction of the categorical approach in drakes,if research into the common law does not supply the answer,we look to the reading that best accords with the overall purpose of the statute.in so doing,however,w here the traditional definition is out of step with the modern meaning of a term,more generic,contemporary as that found in state apply.drakes,at quoting taylor,at.
as early as,judge cardozo was preaching the use of generic,contemporary definitions rather than older,if not truly ancient,approaches.when speaking of the difference between larceny and embezzlement,he said,t he distinction,now largely obsolete,did not ever correspond to any essential difference in the character of the acts or in their effect upon the victim.the crimes are one in the common speech of men as they are in moral quality.van vechten am.eagle fire ins.
in,the supreme court was faced with a problem similar to what we face in this case.bell,at.here,we must decide whether the pennsylvania offense of larceny by deception trick involving or less is an aggravated felony as defined in section a of the ina.whereas in bell,the court had to interpret the bank robbery provision,b,that imposes criminal sanctions on w hoever takes and carries away,with intent to steal or purloin,any property or money or any other thing of value,exceeding belonging to,or in the care,custody,control,management,or possession of any bank,credit union,or any savings and loan association.at.
in bell,the court discussed extremely technical distinctions present in old interpretations of two by trick and false pretenses.bell opened a bank account and deposited therein a check belonging to another.after the check cleared,he closed the account and was paid the total balance in cash.he was arrested and convicted.the question for decision was whether the restricted common law definition of robbery should apply.although the court was faced with a robbery statute,its discussion concentrated on concepts of larceny by trick.
the court concluded,congress has not adopted the elements of larceny in terms,explaining that the statutory language takes and carries away represents merely one element of common law larceny and is entirely consistent with false pretenses.id.at.moreover,the statutory language with intent to steal or purloin has no established common law meaning.id.citing united states turley,d.the court pointed to two other aspects of b that indicate congress intention to go beyond the definition of larceny.id.first,whereas common law larceny excluded theft of a written instrument embodying a chose in action,section b is broader in that it includes any property or money or any other thing of value exceeding.id.citing lafave scott,handbook on criminal law.second,whereas common law larceny required theft from the owner possession,section b is more expansive in that i t applies when the property belong s to,or is in the care,custody,control,management,or possession of,a covered institution.id.at.citations omitted.based on the above analysis,the court held that notwithstanding the common law label attached to b,more generic,contemporary definitions proscribe bell conduct here,explaining 
although the term larceny appears in the legislative reports,the congressional purpose plainly was to protect banks from those who wished to steal banks if they used no force in doing so to the extent that a bank needs protection against larceny by trick,it also needs protection from false pretenses.we can not believe that congress wished to limit the scope of the amended act coverage,and thus limit its remedial purpose,on the basis of an arcane and artificial distinction more suited to the social conditions of century england than the needs of century america.such an interpretation would signal a return to the incongruous results that the amendment was designed to eliminate.
thus,the marching order we receive from the court is that in interpreting federal criminal statutes where there is no specific definition,do not fall in love with the label attached to an offense.
we now turn to an analysis of the generic,contemporary definitions of the terms theft offense,section a g,and an offense that involves fraud or deceit,section a m i,to determine whether either or both of these aggravated offense provisions applies to offenses under pennsylvania theft by deception statute.for this we look to logical reasoning and the background of the aggravated offense provisions enacted by congress and the foundation of the theft by deception statute adopted by pennsylvania legislature.
at the onset,we agree with our sister circuits that it was congress intent for a theft offense to include more than what was considered larceny at common law b y choosing the words theft offense rather than just theft,congress signaled that it was not presenting an exhaustive list of offenses just theft and receipt rather,with its word choices,congress indicated that the phrase ought to be given a broad read.see ins,cir see also united states,cir en banc congress used the words theft offense rather than just theft,thus indicating that the phrase ought be read to incorporate different but closely related constructions in modern state statutes.under the code,theft includes theft by unlawful taking or disposition theft by deception theft by extortion theft of property lost,mislaid,or delivered by mistake receiving stolen property theft of services theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received and unauthorized use of automobiles and other vehicles.model penal code.in,the seventh circuit engaged in an extensive discussion of the background of the term theft offense as used by congress in the ina,including an evaluation of theft offenses set forth in the code,and came up with the definition a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent.at.the ninth circuit has adopted this definition,at,and a panel within this circuit has relied on it in a opinion,williams ins.cir judges fuentes,sloviter and debevoise.
we agree that given this broad definition,nugent bad check transaction for which he was convicted under the pennsylvania theft by deception statute is a theft offense as set forth in section a g.indeed,a worthless check is property within the scope of pennsylvania theft by deception statute.as we have explained previously,in common law larceny it was not so regarded common law larceny was limited to thefts of tangible personal property.this limitation excluded,for example,the theft of a written instrument embodying a chose in action.bell,at.pennsylvania consolidated theft statute,which we note was taken verbatim from code,defines property in the context of theft offenses 
anything of value,including real estate,tangible and intangible personal property,contract rights,and other interests in or claims to wealth,admission or transportation tickets,captured or domestic animals,food and drink,electric or other power.
ann.emphasis added.wharton teaches that a includes bonds and notes of all classes.wharton criminal law,supra,at.a is defined as a right to receive or recover a debt,or money,or damages for breach of contract,or for a tort connected with contract,but which can not be enforced without action,and includes a check on a bank.see bouvier law dictionary ed.
we must conclude then that a bank check is regarded as property in the context of generic,contemporary larceny,or theft,concepts requiring caption when the actor secured dominion over the property of another and asportation carrying away of the other property,and therefore nugent bad check transaction for which he was convicted under pennsylvania theft by deception statute is a theft offense under a g.this does not,however,end our inquiry.
the sole question for decision is whether within the purview of pennsylvania theft by deception statute,section,nugent conviction for passing a bad check represents an offense involving fraud or deceit under a m i,notwithstanding that it also constitutes a theft offense under a g.if we decide that nugent conviction is an offense that involves fraud or deceit as well as a theft offense,then to qualify as an aggravated felony under the ina it must meet the requirements of section a m i,loss to the victim of more than,in addition to section a g,term of imprisonment of at least one year.here it is stipulated that nugent state conviction was based on a bad check amounting to only,and therefore nugent conviction could not be an aggravated felony if section a m i applies.
and the distinction is especially critical to nugent because if we determine that both the district court in the habeas corpus proceeding and the ij in the removal proceeding erred in concluding that his state offense amounted to an aggravated felony under the ina,then,as we have emphasized previously,nugent will be able to apply for cancellation of removal pursuant to.conviction of an aggravated felony prohibits such relief.see a.
for the reasons that follow,we are persuaded that appellant is correct in his contention that he was not guilty of an aggravated felony when he was convicted of pennsylvania statutory offense of theft by deception in which the victims loss did not exceed.
title a provides 
the term aggravated felony means 
g a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a g 
m an offense that i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.a m i 
the term offense means t he doing that which a penal law forbids to be done,or omitting to do what it commands.bouvier law dictionary ed.
in comparing these two subsections of section a,we are struck by several distinctions.first,we note that g is limited to a theft offense second,in m,congress uses the broader term an offense as does every other different offenses set forth in e,h through l and n through u third,m and the laundering money offense d are the only offenses listed in section that set a minimum amount of damages that must be proved before the offense may qualify as an aggravated felony.
these distinctions are significant.it could be that because all other offense portions of section a are listed in the universal form offense rather than the limited or particular form theft offense,that congress intended that subsection m i apply only to theft offenses.indeed,a case could be made that was its intention.this view would find support in the rules of logic discussed hereinafter in the distinctions between universal and particular propositions,and distributed and undistributed terms.in any event,for our immediate purposes,it is not necessary for us to decide how many of the other offenses listed in section a,if any,are limited by subsection m i.and we expressly do not do so.suffice it to say,we decide here only that m i clearly applies to those theft offenses under subsection g that are anchored on fraud or deceit.
in the view we take we therefore reject the arguments advanced by the parties.we reject the government contention that the naked language of subsection g compels a conclusion that nugent committed an aggravated felony as defined by section a of the ina and also reject nugent argument that subsection g does not apply,that he did not commit a theft,but only an offense involving fraud or deceit under subsection m i.
instead,we hold that congress intent was for both g and m i to apply to an offense involving theft and fraud or deceit,and thus the requirements of both provisions must be fulfilled for such an offense to qualify as an aggravated felony for purposes of the ina.accordingly,we must decide in favor of the appellant because the property loss involved was less than the statutory minimum.
first,the logicians teach us that a term,such as an offense as contained in section a m or a theft offense as in section a g,is said to have both a quality and a quantity.here we are concerned with quantity.the quantity of a proposition is universal or particular according to whether the proposition refers to all members of a class or to some members of the class designated by its subject term.in the case of m we have a term representing all members of a class an offense.
when a term contains no restrictions as in m an offense,logicians refer to it as distributed,and the proposition of which it is the subject as universal and is a class.in the universe of offenses set forth in section a,however,the term theft offense in g is predicated on some,but not all,of the distributed term an offense in m,and is therefore considered as undistributed and is a subclass.the proposition of which it is the subject is denoted as a particular.see ruggero aldisert,logic for lawyers a guide to clear legal thinking ed irving copi,introduction to logic ed.expressed in less technical phrasing all theft offenses are offenses,but not all offenses are theft offenses.
we are taught that conclusions in all reasoning,including legal reasoning,deductive or inductive analogy,derive their validity from the axiom known as the dictum de omni et nullo,which states what is true of the universal or class is true of the particular or subclass.joseph gerard brennan,a handbook of logic see also ralph eaton,general logic.this is an axiom concerning all or none in its class.it was first established by aristotle,but in today legal reasoning it is the unstated linchpin in formulating the major premise in every categorical deductive syllogism that lawyers use in their briefs,and judges in their opinions.the axiom may also be stated as if every member of a class has or does not have a certain property,and if certain individuals are included in that class,then these individuals have or do not have the property.see stebbing,a modern introduction to logic ed t hat one term should be included in another as in a whole is the same as for the other to be predicated of all of the first quoting aristotle,anal.priora,b.
we believe,therefore,that the logical framework used to support the conclusion we reach can be set forth in the following polysyllogism 
depriving another of property by fraud or deceit is an offense m.
the offense of theft by deception deprives another of property by theft g.
therefore,the offense of theft by deception is an offense under m and g.
the offense of theft by deception is an offense under m and g.
a violation of pennsylvania theft by deception statute,is an offense of theft by deception.
therefore,a violation of pennsylvania theft by deception statute,is an offense under m and g.
with the foregoing as our analytical guide,we now proceed to evaluate the elements of sections a g and m i of the ina and those of the pennsylvania theft by dece
