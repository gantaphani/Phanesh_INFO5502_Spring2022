these cases,which we address together,raise the question of whether aliens who were erroneously denied the opportunity to apply for c relief,should be barred from seeking such relief as a result of their subsequent accrual of five or more years of imprisonment on one or more aggravated felony offenses.we conclude that petitioners applications for c relief should be judged by the executive office for immigration review eoir nunc pro tunc,that is,as if the petitioners had not yet accrued five years imprisonment.because we hold that it would be appropriate to award petitioners equitable relief,we do not decide the issue of whether c,as a matter of statutory interpretation,compels the same result.
background 
statutory history 
prior to the amendment of the immigration laws in,section c of the immigration and nationality act ina afforded one of the most important forms of relief available to aliens facing deportation as it existed over much of its history,c relief was potentially available to most legal residents of the united states,including many who were criminal aliens.see c repealed.for a significant number of such aliens,a c waiver constituted the only possible way of securing relief from deportation.united states copeland,cir.in recognition of the importance of c relief to aliens facing deportation,we have held that the erroneous denial of the opportunity to apply for c relief may render deportation proceedings fundamentally unfair.id.at.
in and again,in,congress limited the availability of c relief.in,congress restricted the category of aggravated felons eligible for c relief to those who had not served five or more years in prison on their aggravated felony offense.see immigration act of immact,a,stat.in,in d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,congress excluded aggravated felons altogether from the class of those eligible for c relief,d,stat.shortly thereafter,in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,congress replaced c relief with a new form of discretionary relief known as cancellation of removal,for which aggravated felons are not eligible,b,stat.codified at.
the amendments to c were subsequently deemed by the attorney general to apply to all pending and future deportation proceedings.see matter of soriano,op.atty,see also matter of yeung,wl bia.thus,during the years immediately following the passage of aedpa and iirira,aggravated felons facing deportation were routinely deemed ineligible for c relief.our court reversed part of the attorney general approach in,and held that d was not intended to apply retroactively to immigration proceedings pending at the time of its enactment.henderson ins,cir.in,in cyr ins,cir cyr i,our court further limited the sweep of aedpa and iirira.we concluded that the acts restrictions on discretionary relief imposed retroactive consequences on those who had pled guilty prior to the laws enactment.id.at.a retroactive effect of this sort,we held,was only permitted under landgraf usi film products,d,if congress clearly intended it.cyr i,at.finding no such intent in the statutes,we ruled that the relevant aliens were potentially eligible for c relief.id.at.cyr was subsequently affirmed by the supreme court.ins cyr,d cyr ii.
following the decisions in henderson and cyr i and ii,many aliens who had been denied the opportunity to apply for c relief under soriano or yeung petitioned the board of immigration appeals the bia or the board to reopen their immigration proceedings.in addition,the bia itself,sua sponte,reopened the proceedings of some aliens,who now appeared to be eligible for c relief.the petitioners are among those who sought,or were sua sponte granted,reopening of their immigration proceedings after henderson or cyr.
anthony milton edwards 
petitioner anthony milton edwards edwards entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.prior to his incarceration on the charges forming the underlying basis for his deportation order,he was lawfully employed for many years,and served in the united states military.petitioner edwards has strong family ties in the united states,with both of his parents,as well as all of his siblings,residing here.
edwards was arrested on august,on charges.on october,he pleaded guilty to,and was convicted of,attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.shortly thereafter,on january,he was convicted,again upon a plea of guilty,of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.edwards was committed to the custody of the new york department of correctional services nydocs on march,with days of jail time credit.edwards was subsequently paroled into the custody of the immigration and naturalization service the service or the ins on august.on july,edwards was recommitted to the custody of the nydocs for violating the conditions of his parole.edwards was into the custody of the ins on october.he is currently detained by the service in leesport,pennsylvania.
on june,while edwards remained in state custody,the ins initiated deportation proceedings against him.following a deportation hearing,an immigration judge ij found edwards deportable,but granted him a c waiver.the ij noted that edwards had strong family ties in the united states,had adduced significant evidence of rehabilitation,and had been legitimately employed prior to his incarceration.the ij concluded that edwards had demonstrated outstanding equities and found specifically that it would be in the best interest of the united states to allow edwards to remain here 
the ins appealed to the bia,which on may,reversed.the bia found that edwards was ineligible for c relief based on aedpa d and the attorney general opinion in matter of soriano,at.petitioner edwards motion for reconsideration of the board decision was denied on july.at that time,edwards had not yet served five years in prison on his aggravated felony offenses.
three and half years later,the bia reopened petitioner edwards deportation proceedings sua sponte noting our court intervening decision in henderson,the board determined that it would be appropriate to remand petitioner edwards proceedings for further consideration of his eligibility for c relief.in so doing,the board stated in part that 
barring any additional criminal activity on the part of the respondent,we would agree with the immigration judge original decision to grant the respondent the requested relief.however,due to the length of time that has elapsed since the immigration judge decision,based primarily on the great strides the respondent has made towards rehabilitation,we will remand the record for either party to present additional evidence regarding the exercise of discretion in this case.
edwards,no.at.
on remand,however,edwards proceedings focused exclusively on whether he met the statutory eligibility criteria for c relief.in response to questions by the ij,edwards lawyer conceded that edwards had,by the time of the remanded proceedings,served more than five years in prison on one or more aggravated felony offenses the ij,as a result,concluded that edwards was ineligible for c relief.on appeal,the bia affirmed,rejecting edwards request to be returned to the position that he was in at the time th e board rendered its decision on may.matter of edwards,no.york at bia.
ii.habeas petition 
petitioner edwards subsequently filed a pro se habeas petition in the eastern district of new york pursuant to.in his petition,he alleged,among other things,that he had already been awarded c relief,and that the time he served on his parole violation should not be counted towards the five year bar.the government responded that the additional time served by edwards was properly counted towards the five year bar,and that edwards was,as such,currently ineligible for c relief.
in an opinion dated march,the district court gleeson,denied edwards petition for a writ of habeas corpus.edwards ins,wl.judge gleeson concluded that,under this court decision in ins,cir,all prison time accrued by edwards must be counted towards the five year bar.id.at.as a result,he found that the bia had not erred in finding edwards ineligible for c relief.id.at.
edwards filed a timely notice of appeal on april.
eva trinidad falconi 
petitioner eva trinidad falconi falconi entered the united states as a visitor in,and was granted lawful permanent resident lpr status in.falconi is married to an american citizen and has a son.prior to her arrest,falconi had lived legally in the united states for over fifteen years.
on april,falconi was arrested on offenses,and committed to detention.on april,she pleaded guilty to,and was convicted of,conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.falconi was sentenced to months imprisonment,which she is currently serving at the philadelphia federal detention center.
shortly after falconi conviction,the ins initiated deportation proceedings against her.beginning in september,a series of removal hearings were conducted before an ij at the danbury federal correctional institution,where falconi was then incarcerated.at the final hearing,on feburary,falconi requested c relief.the ij rejected her request without reaching the merits,finding that falconi was statutorily ineligible for relief under matter of yeung,at.
falconi timely appealed the ij determination to the bia.on october,the bia dismissed her appeal,concluding that,under matter of soriano at,falconi was ineligible for c relief.at that time,falconi had served less than five years in prison on her aggravated felony offense.
falconi moved to reopen her deportation proceedings following the supreme court decision in cyr ii.in her motion,she alleged,inter alia,that her application for c relief should have been evaluated under and law.by that time,however,falconi had served more than five years in prison.the bia,therefore,concluded that she had not demonstrated eligibility for c relief,and,on that basis,denied her motion to reopen.
ii.habeas petition 
falconi filed a pro se habeas petition in the eastern district of new york on march,pursuant to.in her petition,falconi alleged,among other things,that she should be a potential candidate for c relief.
in an opinion dated november,the district court trager,granted falconi petition.falconi ins,d.judge trager observed that,at the time that the ij and bia issued their decisions on falconi application for c relief,she had served less than five years in prison.id.at.thus,absent the immigration judge and bia retroactive application of the aedpa,falconi would have been eligible to apply for ina c discretionary relief.id.judge trager concluded that falconi should not be deprived of the opportunity to seek c relief by the bia and ij erroneous retroactive application of the aedpa.id.at.he accordingly remanded her c petition to the eoir for adjudication on the merits.
ii.discussion 
the ins argues as an initial matter that petitioner falconi claims are not ripe for judicial review.relying on our decision in simmonds ins,cir,the service suggests that because falconi will not become eligible for release until,her claims would be better adjudicated at a later date.the service points out that the immigration laws have been especially changeable in recent years,and notes that subsequent changes in the law might require revisiting falconi claims prior to her actual deportation.see simmonds,at.while the immigration laws have indeed been highly changeable in the past decade,we disagree that such mutability renders falconi claims unripe for review at this time.
as we held in simmonds,the variability of the immigration laws is a proper consideration in evaluating the prudential ripeness of an alien claims.id.and,where an alien,like simmonds,faces release and deportation at the earliest a decade in the future,this variability may well reduce the fitness of the issues raised by the alien for review.see id.here,however,petitioner falconi may be released and deported within the next two years.in a system where adjudication of petitioner falconi claims could itself take well over two years,we can not conclude that the potential for legal changes within this period renders falconi claims unfit for review.
the other component of the ripeness inquiry,hardship,is also manifestly present here.were we to require petitioner falconi to refile her claims at a later date,such claims would likely not be finally adjudicated prior to her earliest possible release date.id.at making clear that simmonds claims might become ripe closer to his release date.as such it is more than possible that petitioner falconi would face deportation if her deportation was not stayed or mandatory detention if her deportation was stayed while her claims were being adjudicated.id.noting that detention or deportation could constitute hardship.
we therefore conclude that petitioner falconi claims are ripe for judicial review.
b.the merits 
on the merits,both petitioners falconi and edwards raise two claims.first,they assert that as a matter of statutory construction,an alien eligibility for c relief should be determined by reference to his or her status as of the time of the entry of an administratively final order of deportation.petitioners secondarily argue that our court,in the exercise of its equitable powers,should afford petitioners nunc pro tunc relief because we believe that petitioners second contention is correct,we need not ultimately decide the merits of their first statutory argument.
statutory issue 
under the discretionary relief regime in existence at the time of petitioners guilty pleas,aliens were required to demonstrate three criteria in order to be statutorily eligible for c relief that they possessed lawful permanent resident status that they had been lawfully domiciled in the united states for seven or more years and if they had been convicted of an aggravated felony or felonies,that they had served less than five years in prison on those aggravated felony offenses.see c repealed because all three of these criteria may change over time,the question of when an alien eligibility is determined,and whether an alien may become eligible or ineligible for c relief,has long been a matter of considerable attention in both our and the bia c jurisprudence.
were we to look only at our decisions concerning when an alien eligibility under the three categories is to be determined,we might well conclude that whether five years imprisonment has been served should be decided as of the date on which each alien final order of deportation was entered.compare lok ins,cir concluding that time ceases to accrue for the purposes of c seven years of lawful domicile requirement after the eoir determination of deportability becomes final,but relying on a rationale that appeared to be limited to the context of the seven years requirement,with ins,cir applying case law addressing the accrual of time towards the seven years domicile requirement to the five years imprisonment context without mentioning the specific rationale relied on in lok.
ins regulations,moreover,could also be read to support this position.see,c recodified at c,which states,broadly,that a motion to reopen proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application for relief under section c of the act may be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final order of deportation emphasis added the relevant part of section c was seemingly added to the regulation as a result of our decision in vargas ins,cir.see executive office for immigration review motions and appeals in immigration proceedings.at.while vargas dealt only with c lawful permanent resident status requirement,see vargas,at,the regulation enacted by the ins uses much more sweeping language,language that seems to adopt petitioners suggested approach to determining statutory eligibility.
nevertheless,the ins is currently forcefully contending that the five years imprisonment bar continues to accrue indefinitely,and precludes c relief at whatever point the five years have been reached.and this position inevitably raises the question of whether chevron and auer deference should be applied but,in addition to the usual reasons for questioning the applicability of either form of deference,the cases before us raise another possible,and complicated,ground for declining deference.we have recently held that an erroneous denial of the opportunity to apply for c relief may constitute a due process violation.see united states copeland,cir united states sosa,cir.if deference to an agency interpretation serves to cast doubt on the constitutionality of a statute,the question of whether courts should afford deference,and bite the constitutional bullet,is anything but easy.federal election commission,concluding that the statute before the court was ambiguous,but rejecting the relevant agency interpretation in order to avoid constitutional concerns.
fortunately,none of the above issues need to be resolved today.petitioners have offered a second and independent argument as to why they are currently potentially eligible for c relief.that argument,based on the equitable remedy of nunc pro tunc,has merit and suffices to decide the cases before us.it,therefore,permits us to leave unsettled the aforementioned statutory interpretation issues.
ii.nunc pro tunc relief 
the equitable remedy of nunc pro tunc literally now for then relief has a long and distinguished history in the field of immigration law.for more than sixty years,the attorney general and the board of immigration appeals have recognized its importance in mitigating potentially harsh results of the immigration laws.see matter of l,holding,in the first reported i n decision,that an alien in deportation proceedings could be awarded relief under the predecessor statute to c,because the attorney general could exercise his discretion nunc pro tunc see also matter of t,bia applying the principle established in matter of l.when a matter is adjudicated nunc pro tunc,it is as if it were done as of the time that it should have been done.see matter of a,bia remedying a prior failure to waive grounds of exclusion by entering an order nunc pro tunc.
the use of the nunc pro tunc doctrine has not been limited to the administrative bodies charged with executing the immigration laws.courts,also,have relied on the doctrine,in order to return aliens to the position in which they would have been,but for a significant error in their immigration proceedings.see,batanic ins,cir see also ins,cir.while our circuit has not previously explicitly invoked the nunc pro tunc doctrine in ordering relief for bia error,we have,in substance,awarded just such relief where equity required.see drax reno,cir see also iavorski ins,cir noting that nunc pro tunc relief has long been available to remedy error in immigration cases.
it is thus beyond question that an award of nunc pro tunc may,in an appropriate circumstance,be granted as a means of rectifying error in immigration proceedings.whether it should be used in the cases before us depends on a number of subsidiary questions to which we now turn.
a statutory bar 
a court may not award equitable relief in contravention of the expressed intent of congress.see ins pangilinan,d.as such,were we to conclude that congress meant to preclude the use of nunc pro tunc relief in the context before us,we would necessarily be forced to reject petitioners nunc pro tunc arguments.the ins contends that congress did in fact intend to bar the use of nunc pro tunc relief in the instant circumstances.it suggests that c repealed,which sets out the statutory requirements for c eligibility,evinces a clear intent that all aggravated felons who have accrued five or more years imprisonment be deemed ineligible for c relief.we disagree.
the bia has,through much of c history,explicitly deemed it appropriate to award c waivers nunc pro tunc.see,matter of a,at and,despite multiple amendments and a recodification of the statute,congress has not expressly countermanded this practice.see,matter of s,bia,approved at reviewing the legislative history of the immigration and nationality act of,and concluding that congress,in recodifying the seventh proviso as c,did not intend to preclude nunc pro tunc awards of relief.congressional reenactments,when made in the light of administrative interpretations of this kind go a long way to precluding the ins current contention.see,isaacs,at.they do,that is,unless the reenactments themselves evince,through changes in c,an intent to reject the prior administrative construction.
the amendments to c,which added the five year bar requirement,do not demonstrate any such intent.see immigration act of,a,stat,enacting the five year bar.while clearly the amendments were meant to limit the circumstances in which aggravated felons could be afforded c relief,see giusto ins,cir per curiam,there is no evidence that congress,in enacting them,intended to preclude otherwise appropriate awards of nunc pro tunc relief.certainly,the language of the amendments is not the type of categorical language,that,in other circumstances,has been found to bar an award of equitable relief.pangilinan,at.discussing the multiple explicit statutory provisions that would have to be disregarded in order to afford equitable relief in that case.nor have we located legislative history suggesting that congress,when it passed the five year bar,meant to incapacitate the courts from remedying serious ins error.see generally giusto,at noting that there is relatively little legislative history explicitly clarifying congress intent in enacting immact.united states ex rel.klonis davis,cir noting that it was evident from both the language and legislative history of the statute at issue that the act did not allow determinations to be made nunc pro tunc.
we conclude that an award of nunc pro tunc relief,if otherwise appropriate,would not contravene c.
b when nunc pro tunc relief should be afforded 
where nunc pro tunc relief is not barred by statute,courts have defined the circumstances in which it is appropriate to award such relief in broad and flexible terms.thus,courts have suggested that nunc pro tunc relief should be granted or refused,as justice may require mitchell overman,and that such relief should be available whenever necessary to put the victim of agency error in the position he or she would have occupied but for the error.ethyl browner,quoting delta data systems webster.applying this framework,courts have concluded an agency error would otherwise be irremediable,and where the plaintiff has been deprived of a significant benefit fairness to the parties,weil markowitz,dictates that the error be remedied nunc pro tunc.see,ethyl,at see also batanic,at.
in the immigration context,we believe that these standards mandate that an award of nunc pro tunc relief ordinarily be available where agency error would otherwise result in an alien being deprived of the opportunity to seek a particular form of deportation relief see,batanic,at ordering nunc pro tunc relief,where such relief was required in order to allow an alien to apply for asylum.as our court has noted,d eportation usually has very serious consequences.copeland,at.in effect,for many residents of our country,it may constitute the equivalent of banishment or exile.fong haw tan phelan.therefore,where agency error has prevented an alien from seeking deportation relief,justice require s,mitchell,at,that the agency rectify that that it do so,if necessary,by means of nunc pro tunc relief.
the government suggests that we should impose an additional the denial of deportation relief or other underlying procedural flaw rise to the level of a due process affording nunc pro tunc relief and,admittedly,this is the approach we have taken in another immigration law context.as we recently held in united states copeland,cir,in order for a defendant to obtain dismissal of an indictment in an illegal reentry prosecution,the erroneous denial of c relief in the context of the underlying deportation proceeding must rise to the level of a due process violation.as a result,the defendant,in order to show the requisite fundamental unfairness,must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that he would have been afforded relief,had the opportunity to apply for relief not been erroneously withheld.id.at.
but,what is at stake in the illegal reentry context is not the
