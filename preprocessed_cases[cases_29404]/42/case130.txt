guo shou wu,a native and citizen of china,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal of an order of an immigration judge ij denying his applications for relief from removal.for the reasons set forth below,his petition is denied.
background 
wu asserted the following facts in support of his claim.he is married,and his wife still lives in china.in accordance with china family planning program,after the birth of their first child,wu wife received,against her will,an device.wu and his wife consulted a private doctor and,without the consent of family planning officials,had the device removed.the couple became pregnant for a second time,and,despite efforts to conceal the pregnancy,wu wife was subjected by family planning officials to a forced abortion.wu and his wife then moved to a remote area,where she again became pregnant and gave birth to their second child.
when it came time to register their children with the government,over wu pleas and objections,family planning officials detained and forcibly sterilized his wife as punishment for having had an unsanctioned second child.family planning officials also fined the couple renminbi.thereafter,wu remained in china without incident for nine years,at which point he illegally departed the country.he illegally entered the united states and was charged with removability.
appearing before an ij in new york,wu conceded removability but requested relief from removal in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.to be granted asylum,wu had to show that he was unable or unwilling to return to china because had suffered past persecution,or had a well founded fear of future persecution,on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see a a,b a.to be granted withholding of removal,wu had to show that upon removal to china he would more likely than not face future persecution on account of one of those bases.see id.b a b.because the more likely than not or clear probability standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for asylum,a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard necessarily fails the withholding of removal standard as well.see mediouni,cir.to be granted protection under cat,wu had to show that upon removal to china he would more likely than not be tortured.see c.
wu applications for relief were denied,and wu subsequent appeal to the bia was dismissed.wu petitioned the second circuit for review,but the petition was dismissed in accordance with a stipulation between the parties to vacate the bia decision and to remand the matter for a new hearing in which an ij would consider any new evidence in addition to the evidence from the previous hearing.
the matter was assigned to an ij in boston.the ij discredited wu testimony,but went on to address the merits of wu applications as if he had testified credibly.in that regard,the ij found that wu failed to establish either past persecution or a well founded fear of future persecution,and thus was entitled to neither asylum nor,a fortiori,withholding of removal.the ij also found that wu failed to establish a clear probability of future torture,and thus was not entitled to protection under cat.on appeal the bia concluded that wu applications for relief were governed by the real id act,which allows the ij to make credibility determinations without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim.pub,div.b,stat.codified at b b iii.the bia also concluded that wu failed to demonstrate past persecution,a well founded fear of future persecution,or a clear probability of future torture,and thus was not entitled to relief from removal.accordingly,the bia dismissed the appeal.this petition followed.ii.discussion 
wu petitions for review on the ground that the bia erred in concluding that i the real id act applied,ii wu failed to demonstrate past persecution,and iii wu failed to demonstrate a well founded fear of future persecution 
standard of review 
we review the bia legal conclusions de novo and its factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard.soeung holder,cir.under this deferential standard,we must uphold the bia determination unless the record not only supports,but compels the contrary conclusion.lópez de hincapié gonzales,cir.
real id act 
wu first asserts,and the government concedes,that the bia erred in concluding that the real id act applied to wu case.the ij had found that the act did not apply,and the bia affirmed the ij denial of relief.nevertheless,the bia said the act applied because it believed,mistakenly,that wu filed his asylum application after may.in fact,wu filed his application in,so the act does not apply.see in re s b,bia.
but wu does not explain how this error affected his case after all,the bia order did not depend on any real id act provisions,which,in this context,merely provide a framework for the trier of fact to assess credibility,see id.at.indeed,the bia assumed the credibility of wu testimony,but went on to conclude that wu failed to establish past persecution,a well founded fear of future persecution,or a clear probability of future torture.so the error was harmless.see jaya gonzales,app x,cir invoking harmless error doctrine in instance where bia arguably erred.
past persecution 
wu next asserts that he is entitled to asylum because he was persecuted for resisting china coercive population control program that is,he was persecuted on account of his political opinion.assuming for the sake of argument that wu demonstrated that he had resisted a coercive population control program,the bia nevertheless determined that wu failed to show that he had been persecuted.we can not say that the record compels the contrary conclusion.
in his brief,the only example of persecution that wu provides is that he was deprived of his right,freedom and liberty to father additional children with his wife.to support the proposition that this deprivation amounts to persecution,wu directs us,not to any controlling authority,but to the ninth circuit decision in jiang holder,cir.but jiang did not hold that deprivation of the right to father children,by itself,amounts to persecution.rather,the ninth circuit held that the forced abortion or sterilization of a noncitizen spouse is but one factor that can indicate persecution.id.at.there,the noncitizen offered substantial evidence of additional persecution in support of his claim,such as being i expelled from school,ii detained by authorities,iii forced to pay a heavy fine to be released from detention,iv subject to near arrest by police at his home on the morning of his wedding,and v forced to flee his hometown to hide from authorities.id.at.
here,by contrast,wu mentions only the deprivation of his ability to father more children.and even if we were to add to that alleged deprivation the other harms that wu arguably suffered as a result of his resistance,we could not conclude that the record compels a finding of past persecution.true,in,wu was fined renminbi which,according to the government,amounts to roughly today for fathering an unsanctioned second child.but economic disadvantage must be severe and deliberate to rise to the level of persecution,see vanchurina holder,cir in re t z,bia,and the record does not indicate that the fine caused wu severe economic disadvantage.
wu seems to argue that,if we refuse to hold that the forced abortion and sterilization of his wife amounts to persecution of him,we will somehow be punishing individuals like his wife,who may plan to follow their spouses in fleeing alleged persecution and seeking asylum in the united states.but this argument was never made before the bia and thus is beyond our review.see makhoul ashcroft,cir t heories not advanced before the bia may not be surfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial review.
well founded fear of future persecution 
finally,wu claims to have a well founded fear of future persecution in response to either his resistance to china coercive population control prog
