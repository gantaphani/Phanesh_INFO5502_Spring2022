ali is a citizen of egypt who entered the united states on june,on a diplomatic visa.as a major in the egyptian army,ali came to this country to undergo training at the united states army logistics management college in fort lee,virginia.when ali overstayed his visa and failed to depart the united states in october,the dhs detained him and charged that he was removable under the immigration and nationality act the ina.in june,ali appeared before an immigration judge the ij in arlington,virginia,where he conceded removability and filed an application for relief under the ina the application.more specifically,ali sought three types of,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture the cat in support thereof,ali contends that he will be persecuted,tortured,and possibly even executed if he is returned to egypt.according to ali,he is and will be perceived by the egyptian government to possess political opinions because he married an american woman of jewish descent,applied for asylum in the united states,and deserted his,sensitive position in the egyptian army.
the ij conducted a merits hearing concerning ali application on september,the ij hearing.by his order of december,the ij denied ali requests for asylum and withholding of removal the ij order on the other hand,the ij order granted ali request for protection under the cat,concluding that it is more likely than not that upon his return to egypt,ali would be detained and tortured by the egyptian government to punish him for deserting the egyptian army and to extract information from him on what he may have revealed while in the united states.ij order.ali thereafter appealed to the bia from the ij order denial of asylum and withholding of removal,and the dhs to the bia on the ij order award of cat relief.on may,the bia affirmed the ij order in all respects the bia order in this proceeding,we assess ali requests for asylum and withholding of removal only,as the attorney general has not sought review of the bia affirmance of the ij order award of cat relief 
ali,who entered the egyptian army in and attended military school in cairo,rose to the rank of major and served as a computer engineer prior to his arrival in the united states he contends that his egyptian army office handled m any of the most important and sensitive matters of what was going on in egypt.in testifying at the ij hearing,ali explained that his office received information about the egyptian military capabilities,including information regarding military relations with israel.id.at.ali described living in egypt as a good life with many of the privileges of being an officer in the egyptian army.id.at.he reported getting along well with his fellow soldiers and enjoying his service in the egyptian army.ali only reason for coming to the united states was to attend training at fort lee from approximately july to october.
once in the united states,ali decided to stay beyond the term of his visa because of his relationship with kelly stine,an american he met during his training in this country and whom he married on november.ali asserted that he could not leave his new wife behind in the united states and that she would not be allowed to live with him in egypt.for this reason,ali decided to divorce my egyptian wife,not return home,and stay in the united states to be with kelly.although not herself jewish,stine testified that the ethnic and religious origin of her family name is jewish and german 
when ali failed to return to egypt following his training program at fort lee,various egyptian officials began to communicate with the dhs seeking ali return.these communications,occurring as early as november,reflect that ali was deemed absent without leave awol from the egyptian army,and that he was believed to have committed the egyptian offenses of military desertion,fraud in connection with his egyptian marriage,and causing egypt to lose the cost of his military training and travel.these communications urged that the necessary steps be taken to return ali to egypt,and warned that ali is a security risk to the united states.in addition,a dhs agent testified at the ij hearing that,during the preceding year,she had spoken with the egyptian embassy about ali at least five times,including an august conversation in which she revealed to her embassy contact that ali was seeking asylum in this country.
ali asserted that the egyptian government efforts to ensure his return to egypt demonstrate an interest in his circumstances beyond that ordinarily accorded a military deserter,and that these efforts support his contention that he will face persecution in egypt.in addition to the potential punishment that he faces for desertion,fraud,and causing losses to the egyptian military,ali contended that he will be persecuted in egypt for his actual and imputed political opinion s.petr.br.according to ali,the egyptian government will impute political opinions to him because of his marriage to stine,because he sought asylum in the united states,and because of his desertion from the egyptian army.ali asserted that,upon returning to egypt,he will be subjected to various types of torture,including simulated drownings,cigarette burns,severe beatings with rubber sticks,electric shocks,and sexual assaults.although his work in the egyptian army did not involve the punishment of accused deserters,ali recalled his joking about how when the military found such men,they would face torture for their disloyalty.
to substantiate his fear of persecution upon returning to egypt,ali presented the ij with the testimony of an expert on egyptian law and practice and human rights issues.that witness,a sadek,was born in egypt and became a citizen of the united states after arriving in.he testified that torture is systemic and ongoing in egypt and that the egyptian legal system will not protect ali from it.sadek confirmed that ali will be treated by the egyptian authorities as a defector and will be subjected to severe torture during the interrogation process to ascertain whether he has disclosed any sensitive military information to any foreign intelligence services.sadek also testified that ali will face persecution in egypt because he applied for asylum in the united states 
according to sadek,the egyptian government would cut ali to pieces because he married stine,due to her jewish last name.this is so,sadek said,because jews are the enemy of the egyptians and the arabs,and this is mentioned in the koran.id.for these reasons,ali faces a very real and significant threat of persecution and torture by the egyptian government.id.at.sadek admitted,however,that before the egyptian government would charge ali with being a spy because of his wife,it would first investigate her identity and religion.sadek also opined that egyptian military officers undergoing training in the united states are generally under scrutiny by the egyptian authorities,especially the embassy,and that such authorities would be aware of any asylum applications filed by such officers.
the decisions of the bia concerning asylum eligibility or withholding of removal are deemed conclusive if supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.as we have heretofore recognized,w e review the bia administrative findings of fact under the substantial evidence rule,and we are obliged to treat them as conclusive unless the evidence before the bia was such that any reasonable adjudicator would have been compelled to conclude to the contrary.haoua gonzales,cir citing b b.pursuant to the applicable regulations,the bia reviews factual determinations made by an ij,including credibility rulings,only to determine whether such findings are clearly erroneous.d i.in order to secure judicial relief from the denial of an application for asylum or withholding of removal,an alien must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,at.finally,we review de novo any legal issues determined by the bia.blanco de belbruno ashcroft,cir.
in this proceeding,ali seeks our review of the bia order to the extent that it affirmed the ij order denial of his requests for asylum and withholding of removal.under the ina,the secretary of the dhs and the attorney general are both authorized to grant asylum to an alien who has satisfied the statutory definition of a refugee.b.a refugee under the ina is a person who is unable to or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a an applicant becomes eligible for asylum upon establishing that he has suffered from past persecution,or that he has a fear of future persecution.see b.such an applicant may establish a fear of future persecution by demonstrating that a reasonable person in the circumstances would fear persecution and that the fear has some basis in the reality of the circumstances and is validated with specific,concrete facts.bia,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,an asylum applicant must demonstrate a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.yong hao chen ins,cir see also b b providing that applicant fear of persecution is if it is on account of protected ground and there is reasonable probability of suffering such persecution.importantly,an applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing his eligibility for such relief.a gonahasa ins,cir.
an award of relief in the form of withholding of removal,on the other hand,implicates a more demanding standard of proof than the fear standard applicable to asylum requests,in that a w ithholding of removal is available only to an alien who can demonstrate a clear probability of persecution on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a social group,or political opinion.ngarurih ashcroft,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,an applicant for relief who has failed to satisfy the less stringent fear standard of proof required for asylum relief is necessarily also unable to establish an entitlement to withholding of removal.id 
ali maintains that the bia erred in two respects in denying his requests for asylum and withholding of removal.first,he asserts that the bia erroneously decided that he had not established a fear of persecution on the basis of his actual or imputed political opinions.second,ali contends that the bia erred in ruling that the dhs disclosure to egyptian officials that he was applying for asylum failed to establish an independent ground for relief.we assess these contentions in turn.
in disposing of ali application,the ij order credited his testimony regarding the likelihood that he would be tortured upon being returned to egypt,and the bia order recognized that ali clearly has a heightened fear risk in egypt.bia order.despite this conclusion and its award of cat relief,the bia agreed with the ij order that ali has not met his burden of establishing a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground under the act,as is required to establish eligibility for asylum.id.at.instead,the bia order ruled that ali faces punishment upon his return to egypt because of his failure to continue his term of military service,which would constitute prosecution,not persecution.id.the bia rejected ali claim that he would be persecuted on the basis of political opinions imputed to him because he had sought asylum in the united states and married an american woman of jewish descent,finding instead that ali fears did not stem from suspected political opinion grounds.id.because ali failed to satisfy the burden of proof necessary for an asylum award,the bia concluded that he had also failed to satisfy the more stringent clear probability standard of eligibility required for withholding of removal.id.ali contends that the bia erred in so ruling,and that he is entitled to both asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of his actual or imputed political opinions.
as a preliminary matter,there is no evidentiary support for the proposition that ali possessed any actual political opinions.his wife is not jewish he left egypt to attend a training course for the egyptian army,not because of his political beliefs he has protected sensitive egyptian military information during the application process and he has not asserted any political opinions.accordingly,ali must,to establish the merit of his application,show that he is deemed by egypt to hold imputed political opinions that are applicable in this proceeding.see in re,bia persecution for imputed grounds,where one is erroneously thought to hold particular political opinions or mistakenly believed to be a member of a religious sect can satisfy the refugee definition.in this regard,ali bore the burden of establishing the necessary nexus between his future treatment in egypt and his imputed political opinions,as well as the burden to show that his persecutors actually imputed a political opinion to him.sangha ins,cir.although ali may properly be prosecuted in egypt for desertion and other criminal acts,he contends that he will in fact be persecuted,and thereby suffer from torture,prolonged detention,or even death,on account of his imputed political opinions.we thus assess the more specific aspects of this contention.
first,ali contends he will be persecuted in egypt because his wife is not egyptian and has a jewish surname.petr.br.because of his wife name,ali maintains that the egyptian government will impute political opinions to him,and that he will be accused of sharing sensitive information with the israeli or united states governments.ali also asserts that,as an egyptian army officer,he will face an investigation for marrying a,because the egyptian government will believe that he would be influenced to discuss matters of national security with his wife or her family.
there are readily apparent problems with this contention.first,although ali wife may be of jewish descent,she is not jewish.indeed,stine testified that,while she prays to god,she does not consider herself a member of any specific faith,informing the ij that her mother is protestant and that she does not know the religion of her deceased father.furthermore,the record does not contain any evidence that the egyptian government will actually seek to persecute ali for his marriage to stine or for any political opinions imputed to him on the basis thereof.finally,ali expert acknowledged that the egyptian government would investigate whether stine is jewish before making any such assumption or seeking to punish ali on that basis.
second,ali fears persecution by egypt because he has applied for asylum in the united states.specifically,ali believes that he will be interrogated and punished more severely because he has spoken of his fear of torture at the hands of the egyptian army and has applied for asylum in this country.indeed,ali contends that b eing accused of treason is a political accusation,both historically and in this case.petr.br.this is so,ali maintains,because t reason,of course,involves throwing ones sic lot with another country and the accusation that one has betrayed his or her country.id.at.given his imputed political treason against egypt,ali maintains that he will be persecuted
