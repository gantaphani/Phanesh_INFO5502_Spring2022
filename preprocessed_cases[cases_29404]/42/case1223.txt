opinion of the court 
section h of the immigration and nationality act ina expressly bars from status adjustment a who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence but later is convicted of an aggravated felony.h c.this appeal presents a question of first impression in this circuit whether someone who was accorded the designation of lawfully admitted for permanent residence status upon physical entry into the united states,but who in fact did not substantively qualify for such designated status,is still barred from section h relief.we determine that admission as an lawful permanent resident lpr in section h refers to a procedurally regular entry,not a substantively compliant one.as we conclude here that the prohibition holds,we will deny the petition for review.
background 
petitioner erasmo anibal martinez,a native of nicaragua,entered the united states without inspection in.in october,he married a united states citizen who bore his daughter later that year,and began the process of adjusting his status to lpr.on september,martinez was arrested and later charged in a indictment before the superior court of new jersey.on december,he pleaded guilty to sexual assault under stat,admitting that he had touched the vaginal area of his.
in early,after his plea but prior to his sentencing,martinez travelled to nicaragua to complete the immigrant visa application process.the united states consulate in nicaragua approved his application on march.martinez was admitted to the united states as a permanent resident the following day.on march,two weeks after he obtained permanent resident status,he was sentenced to four years in prison.martinez was released on parole on november.
the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against martinez in august,and martinez ultimately conceded that he was removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony for sexual abuse of a minor.see a a iii setting forth grounds for removability,a a defining aggravated felony.martinez argued,however,that he was eligible for adjustment of status under former ina section c,which waived the bar against status adjustment for convicted aggravated felons in the case of certain lprs dhs responded that martinez was not eligible for a section c waiver because he had not in fact been lawfully admitted for permanent residence an eligibility requirement under section c he had failed to disclose his prior arrest and guilty plea on his original application for permanent resident status.the immigration judge ij agreed.
in response,martinez sought instead to readjust his status under ina section h a,which allows for adjustment of alien status by the spouse,parent,son or daughter of a united states citizen where denial of such adjustment would constitute extreme hardship on either the alien or the citizen.section h,however,expressly bars from relief a who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence but since the date of admission has been convicted of an aggravated felony h c.with some creativity,martinez argued that this bar could not apply to him because he was actually inadmissible at the time he was granted lpr status due to his failure to disclose his prior arrest and guilty plea at the time he entered the united states as an lpr 
the ij rejected martinez argument.while substantive satisfaction of lpr status was an underlying requirement for section c waiver,the ij found that the absence of such satisfaction did not equate to waiver of the section h bar.specifically,the ij held that the board of immigration appeals bia decision in in re ayala arevalo,i n bia,controlled and martinez was statutorily ineligible for section h relief.
martinez timely appealed to the bia,arguing that he was eligible for section c relief because the ij erred in concluding that martinez had never been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.in the alternative,martinez contended that if the bia determined that he had never been lawfully admitted for permanent residence,then it should find him eligible for a section h waiver,thus overruling ayala.
the bia remained similarly unpersuaded.according to the board,martinez was ineligible for c relief because he had never been lawfully admitted for permanent residence,but he was also ineligible for h relief although martinez has never been lawfully admitted for permanent residence in a substantive manner,he had previously been admitted,even if that admission has subsequently been determined to have been in violation of law.quoting ayala at ellipsis in the original.the board concluded that ayala compelled a finding that martinez aggravated felony conviction rendered him ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section h,and the bia declined to overturn ayala.
martinez then timely filed a petition for review of the section h waiver question only,and later moved for a stay of removal,which was granted the newark immigration court had jurisdiction under a and the bia had jurisdiction under b.as martinez seeks review of a final order of removal,this court has jurisdiction under a.
ii.standard of review 
when,as here,the bia affirms an ij decision and adds analysis of its own,we review both the ij and the bia decisions.dia ashcroft,cir en banc abdulai ashcroft,cir.we review de novo questions of law,such as the proper construction of section h.fadiga att y,cir.using all traditional tools of statutory construction,we must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if congress has done so,our inquiry is at an end we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting chevron,at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we must assess whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction.chevron,at.if so,then we must defer to that construction.id.at.
unsurprisingly,respondent urges us to apply chevron deference here.martinez,however,argues on two grounds that chevron does not apply.first,martinez claims that no statutory ambiguity exists,such that congress clearly intended for the section h waiver to apply to an individual like martinez.second,martinez claims that even if such ambiguity does exist,it is for this court to resolve without deference to the bia statutory construction,which would be due only if the bia itself had interpreted section h.according to martinez,in ayala the bia explicitly found that section h clearly precluded waiver applicants such as himself thus the bia did not reach its own construction of the statute,and therefore this court should not defer to the bia application of section h.
martinez cites exclusively to caselaw from the circuit and the seventh circuit in support of his argument against chevron deference.see reply brief for petitioner at citing arizona thompson,peter pan bus lines,fed.motor carrier safety,escobar barraza mukasey,cir postal service postal regulatory comm n.the third circuit has not yet addressed the question of whether such deference is only appropriate when the agency has exercised its own judgment,not when it believes that its interpretation is compelled by congress.thompson,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted emphasis in original for the reasons set forth below,however,we find section h statutory language free of ambiguity though not in the manner martinez champions and thus we need not accord chevron deference.
iii.analysis 
statutory language 
section h provides one of the few avenues of relief for who would otherwise be eligible to adjust their immigration status but for certain grounds of inadmissibility,such as moral turpitude.in,however,as part of a larger immigration reform initiative,congress amended the statute to render fewer lprs eligible for the section h waiver on aggravated felonies.see illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div.c,stat.amending h.the statute currently provides that n o waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the cas
