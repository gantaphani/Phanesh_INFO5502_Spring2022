rachid chakir applied for asylum,asserting that he has a fear of persecution in his native morocco because of his conversion from islam to christianity.chakir petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia order affirming the denial of his application for asylum.we affirm the decision of the bia and deny chakir petition for review.
background 
chakir is a native and citizen of morocco and,by birth,a muslim.while in morocco,he developed an interest in christianity and began to study the bible through a correspondence program.after entering the united states on a tourist visa on august,chakir continued his bible studies.he was baptized as a christian on september.
chakir did not leave the united states at the expiration of his visa,however.he applied to the former immigration and naturalization service ins for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture cat on november.his asylum application asserted that he fears persecution or death because of his faith should he return to morocco.on december,ins initiated removal proceedings against chakir.at the initial hearing,chakir conceded his removability based on his failure to depart under the terms of his visa and,at a hearing on may,presented a renewed claim for political asylum and withholding of removal.
at the second hearing,chakir testified that he fears that if he returns to morocco,he will be killed or persecuted because of his christian faith.he testified that while he has concerns about the moroccan government,his main concern is persecution by individuals and groups that the moroccan government is unwilling to control.in particular,he stated that he fears his friends,his community,his neighbors,individuals in morocco government,muslim clerics and their followers,and even his family because of his conversion to christianity,which,chakir testified,his family would consider a dishonor.according to chakir,his brothers and sisters,who live in morocco,and morocco itself had become more fundamentalist in their islam.
chakir offered as witnesses john prodinger and richard smits,who attended church with chakir and who testified that chakir conversion to christianity was sincere.chakir also offered documentary evidence,including an article entitled a brief report about the moroccan church.this article reported that christians in morocco lack freedom to attend churches or to practice their faith openly.the article also described intimidation tactics used against christians,including placing known christians under police surveillance,confiscating christian materials and turning such materials over to the police,encouraging the media to rouse public sentiment against christians,encouraging muslim fanatics to persecute christians and force them to reconvert to islam,and subjecting christians to police interrogations,threats,physical assaults,and imprisonment because of their faith.
the government offered as its evidence two state department reports on morocco religious freedom report irfr and reports on human rights.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the immigration judge ij found chakir conversion to christianity sincere and credible but denied chakir petitions for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij determined that chakir conversion to christianity justified an exception to the bar for applying for asylum.the ij disagreed,however,with chakir opinions regarding the conditions and practices of muslims in morocco and about the likelihood of his mistreatment.the ij did not consider chakir to be the type of person who was courageous enough to martyr himself for his faith in morocco or to put himself at risk by practicing his christianity so openly as to attract attention.the ij compared conditions for christians in morocco with those in iran,finding that the conditions in morocco were very dissimilar from those in iran,where apostasy is a capital offense and where courts apply sharia law.the ij also determined that chakir had failed to identify any particular individual as his persecutor.concluding that chakir did not have a fear of persecution,the ij denied chakir application for asylum,withholding,and protection under the cat but granted chakir voluntary departure from the united states.
chakir appealed the ij decision denying his asylum petition to the bia,which affirmed the ruling.the bia determined that the ij was correct in relying on the irfr and reasonable in finding that chakir did not have a fear of persecution.the bia noted that while chakir had not articulated a clear claim that the ij had violated his due process rights during the hearing,any such assertion would fail because the ij is entitled to examine witnesses and clarify the testimony on specific allegations.the bia found no reversible error based on the ij treatment of chakir during the hearing and that the ij had based the ultimate resolution of chakir petition on conditions in morocco rather than on the comparison of conditions in morocco and iran.the bia upheld the grant of voluntary departure to chakir and then dismissed the appeal.this timely petition for review of the bia order followed.
ii.discussion 
chakir challenges the denial of his asylum application on two grounds the ij violated chakir due process rights during the hearing,entitling chakir to a new hearing and chakir met his burden of establishing a reasonable possibility of persecution.
because the bia opinion supplements the opinion of the ij,the ij opinion as supplemented by the bia opinion becomes the basis for our review.liu ashcroft,cir.we review the ij denial of chakir petition under the deferential substantial evidence standard,which requires us to affirm if the decision is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.citations omitted.we will reverse only if we find that the evidence compels a different result.brucaj ashcroft,cir.
we review chakir due process claim de novo,as the procedural sufficiency of an immigration hearing is a question of law.see kerciku,cir.
chakir due process claim 
chakir styled his due process claim as a claim brought pursuant to the fifth amendment of the constitution,which entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.this court has counseled on numerous occasions,however,that arguments must precede constitutional contentions.see rehman gonzales,cir explaining that n arguments always come first constitutional contentions must be set aside until their resolution is unavoidable.see also djedovic gonzales,cir boyanivskyy gonzales,cir.aliens are afforded the right to present all relevant evidence at an impartial hearing by statute,b b and regulation,c unless chakir claimed that the applicable statute and regulation are constitutionally deficient,which he conceded at oral argument that he does not,we will not reach the constitutional question.rehman,at.
reframed as a statutory claim,we consider whether the ij denied chakir the reasonable opportunity to present his relevant evidence at the asylum hearing.boyanivskyy,at.to prevail on this claim,chakir must demonstrate prejudice such that the ij error affected the outcome of the proceedings.rehman,at.
as a preliminary matter,the government contends that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider this claim because chakir failed to argue to the bia that he was denied a reasonable opportunity to present evidence at the asylum hearing.chakir brief to the bia did not articulate such a claim,as chakir only raised two arguments addressing the merits of the ij decision.generally,an alien is required to raise and exhaust his remedies before the bia as to each claim or ground for relief to preserve his right to judicial review of that claim.capric ashcroft,cir.the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement allows the bia to resolve procedural failings that it is capable of addressing.feto gonzales,cir.
although chakir failed to argue to the bia that he was denied a reasonable opportunity to present his relevant evidence at the asylum hearing,a review of the hearing transcript compels such an inquiry.the bia conceded as much when it noted chakir failu
