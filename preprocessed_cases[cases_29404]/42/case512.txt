the petitioners,try ang and sokunthea mean,are both cambodian nationals.they seek judicial review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying their joint application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture cat.because mean application is derivative and its success is dependent upon the success of ang application,see,da silva ashcroft,cir,we analyze the case as if ang were the sole petitioner.
ang assigns error in four respects i failure to consider his membership in a social group when determining his refugee status ii misinterpretation of testimony which,properly construed,would tend to support his claims iii failure to recognize that country conditions had not changed so significantly as to negate any founded fear of future persecution and iv failure to grant asylum for humanitarian reasons.finding these claims of error unpersuasive,we deny the petition.
the record reflects that ang,armed with a tourist visa,entered the united states on april.his wife,mean,joined him two months later having entered the country illegally.on november,they sought asylum.
the immigration and naturalization service ins charged the couple with remaining in the united states longer than permitted see a b.the ins scheduled a hearing for october.the petitioners conceded removability and for asylum,withholding of removal,relief under the cat,and in the alternative,voluntary departure.
at an evidentiary hearing held on august,ang testified about his political activities and employment in cambodia and the circumstances that brought him and his wife to the united states.mean did not testify.
the story,insofar as it is relevant here,began in,when ang fled to a cambodian refugee camp in order to escape forced conscription by the reigning government.the camp was located in an area controlled by a minority political party,the national united front for a neutral,peaceful,cooperative,and independent cambodia funcinpec.ang began working for this party as a volunteer.he played an active role in the campaign leading up to the national elections the funcinpec prevailed in the elections and ascended to power.
to earn a living,ang secured employment at the united states embassy.his job was to protect the americans who worked there.he steadily moved up the ranks and,by the time that the funcinpec came to power,he was in charge of sixty guards.a few years later,he was promoted and given responsibility for supervising guards.
in,a coup engineered by hun sen toppled the funcinpec government.hun sen party,the cambodian people party cpp,assumed control.ang transported americans to the safety of the embassy during the insurrection.in his asylum affidavit,he declared that he was not afraid of dying during this period because hun sen supporters would not dare to harm those who worked with the americans.
general elections were held in.john keo,ang boss at the embassy,asked him to report on any shootings,kidnappings,or other acts of violence connected with the voting.ang says that he received a number of veiled threats during this interlude,y ou will see what happens when the leaves cambodia the united states can not protect you all the time.
on march,ang and other embassy staffers heard a threat that came over their security radios.the unidentified speaker stated i will kill john keo and try ang before they take the airplane.keo asked all guards on duty to write reports about the incident.ang completed his report nine days later.
ang departure followed on the heels of this incident.using a tourist visa issued a few days before the broadcasted threat,ang left cambodia.on april days after arriving in the united notified the embassy by facsimile transmission of his resignation.he claims that police officers visited his wife twice in the following two days and threatened to kill her if she did not reveal his whereabouts.in roughly two months time,mean,using a bogus passport that she purchased for,joined her husband.
ang testified that he fears he will be killed if he were to return to cambodia.this fear relates both to his political activities and his past employment.the immigration judge ij disagreed,based partially on a finding that ang had worked at the american embassy,but that a significant credibility gap marred most of the other aspects of his testimony.
chronologically,the ij found that the early threats of which ang complained,to the extent that they occurred at all,were due to his funcinpec membership.the ij characterized these threats as unsubstantiated allegations he deemed them neither convincing nor compelling,especially given ang boast that he was not concerned about them.
the ij attributed the broadcasted death threat to a disgruntled former security guard who had been dismissed from his post.in this regard,the ij cited ang own testimony as demonstrating that he ang did not take the threat seriously.
moving to ang departure,the ij spotted a flat inconsistency in ang stated reason for leaving cambodia.ang initially vouchsafed that he left to save his life he later claimed,however,that he had intended to return after a visit to the united states,but that the subsequent threats reported by his wife convinced him to change his mind.as to those threats,the ij found ang testimony unworthy of credence.in the ij view,it was not plausible that ang absence would have been noticed so quickly.
finally,the ij found that ang had failed to provide objective facts sufficient to establish a fear of future persecution.
based on these findings,the ij denied the joint application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat,but granted a right of voluntary departure.the petitioners appealed and,on november,the bia summarily affirmed.this timely petition for judicial review followed.
when the bia summarily affirms an ij decision,the focus,for purposes of judicial review,is on the ij decision.we review that determination as if it were the bia.see olujoke gonzales,cir.in that process,we assay the ij findings of fact,including credibility determinations,under a highly deferential substantial evidence standard.see id.that standard demands that we uphold the ij decision as long as it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record as a whole.ins,d.absent a mistake of law,the ij decision must stand unless a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to reach a contrary conclusion.see b b see also negeya gonzales,cir.
against this backdrop,we turn to ang asylum claim.to qualify for asylum,an alien must demonstrate that he is a refugee as defined by the immigration and nationality act the act.id.b.according to the act,a refugee is a person who can not or will not return to his country of nationality or avail himself of that country protections because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a see harutyunyan gonzales,cir ins,cir.
the alien may carry this burden by proving past persecution based on one of the five enumerated grounds and,thus,animating a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.see harutyunyan,at.if the alien succeeds in making this showing,the burden shifts to the government to prove either a fundamental change in circumstances such that the alien no longer has a fear of persecution in his country of nationality or that the alien could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of his country of nationality.b i a b.
there is another avenue to asylum.if an alien can not establish past persecution,he may prove a fear of future persecution independent of any presumption.see ashcroft,cir.
in the case at hand,ang presents a hybrid claim of past persecution.this claim implicates both his political opinion his support for the funcinpec and his membership in a putative social group cambodian supporters of the united states.while it is clear that past persecution based on the former ground would,if proven,confer refugee status,see,bocova gonzales,cir,determining whether ang employment at the american embassy and his assistance to americans make him a member of
