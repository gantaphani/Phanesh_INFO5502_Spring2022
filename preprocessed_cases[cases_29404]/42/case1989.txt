petitioner benjamin petitions for review of an order of the immigration and naturalization service ins reinstating his prior deportation order under a of the immigration and nationality act ina argues that a does not apply retroactively to aliens who,like,illegally reentered the united states before the statute effective date of april.further argues that a implementing regulations violate his due process rights under the fifth amendment.because we conclude that a does not have an impermissible retroactive effect as applied to and that the corresponding regulations do not violate any of his due process rights,we deny petition for review and affirm the removal order.
the facts in this case are not in dispute.is a citizen of mexico.some time before,illegally entered the united states without inspection.on march,was deported to mexico through el paso,texas.at that time,was informed that if he returned to the united states without permission,he could be subject to criminal prosecution which could result in imprisonment a fine.
nevertheless,illegally reentered the united states sometime in.on may,the ins apprehended and served him with a notice of intent to reinstate his march,deportation order.then filed this petition for review.
as an initial matter,this court must determine whether it has jurisdiction to review the ins order reinstating previous deportation order.both parties in this case agree that ina a b grants this court jurisdiction to review the reinstatement order,but not the merits of order of deportation which has been reinstated that,of course,does not end our inquiry because this court must satisfy itself that jurisdiction is proper 
section a b of the ina grants the courts of appeals subject matter jurisdiction over final orders of removal.at the same time,ina a states,in relevant part,that a prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed.
turning to the issue at hand,a reinstatement order is not literally an order of removal because it merely reinstates a previously issued order of removal or deportation.nevertheless,reinstatement of previous deportation order is a final order of the ins.a fair interpretation of grants this court the authority to review the lawfulness of the reinstatement order.however,a limits that review to the reinstatement order itself this court can not reopen or review the merits of deportation order.we conclude,therefore,that this court has jurisdiction to hear petition for review of the reinstatement order 
next argues that ina a does not apply retroactively to him because he illegally reentered the united states in,before the provision effective date of april.this argument requires a brief overview and history of reinstatement procedures under the ina.
in,when illegally reentered the united states,ina f provided that,if any alien illegally reentered the united states after deportation,the previous order of deportation shall be deemed to be reinstated from its original date and such alien shall be deported under such previous order at any time subsequent to such reentry.the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira which became effective on april,made dramatic changes to immigration law.significant to this case,iirira replaced f with a new,broader reinstatement provision.the new reinstatement provision,a,states 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after reentry 
in enacting a,congress intent was to streamline and expedite existing procedures for removing illegal aliens,which had become cumbersome and duplicative.
pursuant to a,the ins promulgated regulations outlining the procedures for reinstating an alien prior deportation order.under the regulations,the alien is not entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge rather,an ins officer determines the identity of the alien whether the alien was subject to a prior order of removal and whether the alien unlawfully reentered the united states the alien then has an opportunity to make a statement the officer determines whether this statement warrants reconsideration an alien who expresses a fear of persecution upon return to the country of removal is referred to an asylum officer if that officer determines his fear is reasonable,the alien may apply for withholding of removal 
the key differences between the current reinstatement procedure under a and the former procedure under repealed f significant to this appeal are 
section a extends the reinstatement procedures to those aliens,like,whose initial removals were based upon entry without inspection.under f,reinstatement was only available for those aliens whose previous order of deportation was based on one of the enumerated grounds which did not include lack of inspection.therefore,under the old statute,would have been entitled to a new deportation procedure rather than being limited to the reinstatement procedure.
section a does not allow judicial review of the underlying previous removal order,as discussed above.section f,however,allowed the alien to attack the merits of a previous removal order.
the regulations implementing a allow an immigration officer to determine,following the analysis discussed above,whether reinstatement is proper.under f,an immigration judge made the determination.
we turn next to the question for decision in this case whether the current reinstatement procedure under a applies retroactively to.the landmark supreme court case,landgraf usi film products provides the starting point of our analysis of whether a applies retroactively.in landgraf,the supreme court set forth a test to determine whether a federal statute applies retroactively to conduct occurring before it was enacted first,the court must determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.in determining whether congress clearly expressed the temporal reach of the statute,the court is not limited to the statute express language,but may also use traditional tools of statutory construction if congress has clearly expressed whether the statute should apply retroactively,the inquiry ends 
however,if the statute contains no clear indication of congress intent,the court must then determine whether applying the new statute to past conduct would have retroactive effect.a statute has an impermissible retroactive effect when it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.if the court decides that the statute would have an impermissible retroactive effect if applied to past conduct,landgraf instructs that the statute does not apply retroactively 
proceeding under the landgraf framework,we must first determine whether congress has clearly prescribed the temporal reach of a.while contends that congress clearly expressed its intent that a apply only prospectively,the ins argues that congress clearly indicated just the the statute should apply retroactively.
makes several arguments to advance his reading of a.first,points out that the former reinstatement statute,f,expressly provided that the reinstatement procedure applied retroactively he maintains that the omission of any reference to retroactivity in a in contrast to f,indicates congress clear intent that the statute apply only prospectively.next,argues that congress inclusion of express language making retroactive other sections of the iirira demonstrates,by negative inference,that congress intended that a not apply retroactively finally,asserts that congress silence regarding retroactivity is instructive.he argues that congress enacted iirira against the backdrop of landgraf,and therefore,knew to use clear language if it intended a to apply retroactively.
on the other hand,the ins presents various arguments in support of its position that a applies retroactively.first,the ins points to a plain language stating that reinstatement applies to any alien who has reentered the united states illegally.the ins contends that this use of the past tense clearly contemplates past action.the ins also invokes chevron,natural resources defense council for the proposition that this court must defer to its interpretation of the iirira retroactive effect,absent congressional intent to the contrary,as long as it is reasonable 
although the supreme court has not addressed the precise issue of whether a applies retroactively,it did consider whether another iirira provision applied retroactively in ins cyr in cyr,the court considered the retroactive effect of iirira b,which replaced former c under c,the attorney general had broad discretion to waive deportation orders of resident aliens the b,however,excluded aliens convicted of aggravated felonies from the class of aliens to whom the attorney general could waive deportation before the effective date of iirira,cyr,an alien,pled guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable under law,the attorney general had discretion to waive his deportation,but under new b,the attorney general had no authority to grant cyr a waiver 
the court held that the statute did not apply retroactively following landgraf test,the court first found that congress intent regarding the retroactivity of b was unclear the court stated that landgraf first step is satisfied only where the statutory language is so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.the court stated that b contained no such clear statement of congress intent to apply the statute retroactively the court reasoned that neither iirira effective date nor its comprehensive nature clearly indicated that congress intended the provision to be retroactive the court also explained that congress willingness,in other sections of iirira,to indicate unambiguously its intention to apply specific provisions retroactively supported its conclusion that the temporal reach of iirira was unclear proceeding then to landgraf second step,discussed more thoroughly below,the court found that the statute had an impermissible retroactive effect,and therefore,did not apply retroactively to cyr 
although the supreme court has not addressed the issue at hand,other circuits have specifically considered the retroactivity of a and have reached different results under the first prong of the landgraf test.the sixth and ninth circuits have held that a does not apply retroactively,finding that the provision clearly indicates congress intention not to apply the provision retroactively in reaching this result,both courts relied primarily on congress elimination of the explicit retroactive language contained in f the legislative history and congressional silence on retroactivity of the provision based on their findings of a clear congressional statement that a does not apply retroactively,these courts did not reach landgraf second step.
the fourth and eighth circuits have reached a different result,however,and have held that congress intent on whether a applies retroactively is unclear both courts relied on various arguments advanced by the parties in this case to support their finding that congressional intent is ambiguous therefore,these courts proceeded to analyze the retroactivity of a under the second prong of the landgraf test.
in light of the supreme court ruling in cyr,we join the fourth and eighth circuits in holding that congress did not clearly indicate whether it intended to apply a retroactively.in cyr,the supreme court considered many arguments identical to those advanced by the parties in this case and,nevertheless,concluded that it was unclear whether congress intended the iirira provision at issue in that case to be retroactive in particular,the supreme court reasoned that congress clear statement in other iirira provisions that those provisions applied retroactively,the effective date of the statute,and the inclusion of the saving provision did not make congress statement sufficiently clear to satisfy landgraf first step 
section a does differ from the iirira provision at issue in cyr in significant ways,however.first,as points out,the predecessor of a explicitly stated that it applied retroactively.at the same time,however,as the ins points out,a states that an alien who has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily is subject to reinstatement of a prior deportation order congress could have stated,but did not,that an alien who reenters the united states illegally may have a prior order reinstated under a.nevertheless,in cyr,the supreme court made clear that t he presumption against retroactive application of ambiguous statutory provisions,buttressed by the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien must be considered when determining the retroactivity of iirira provisions for all of these reasons,we are satisfied that the language of a is not so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.therefore,we hold that congress did not indicate with sufficient clarity whether a applies retroactively to satisfy the first step of landgraf 
because we conclude that it is unclear whether congress intended that a apply retroactively,we must now determine whether application of the provision to has an impermissible retroactive effect.under landgraf second step,the court must determine whether the statute,if applied retroactively,would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.if so,the statute does not apply retroactively 
in cyr,discussed above,the court analyzed the iirira provision at issue under the second prong of the landgraf test after finding that congress had not clearly dictated the temporal reach of the iirira provision at issue the court stated that whether a statute has a retroactive effect under landgraf should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.the court explained that p lea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government.the court then reasoned that when cyr entered the plea agreement for his conviction,he was acutely aware of the immigration consequences of his conviction.the court found that aliens,like cyr,who entered plea agreements with the government before the iirira became effective almost certainly relied upon the likelihood of receiving a discretionary waiver of deportation from the attorney possibility that the new iirira provision deciding to forgo their right to a trial for these reasons,the court held that the newly enacted iirira provision had an impermissible retroactive effect 
in contrast,writing for the eighth circuit,judge loken held in that most of a had no such retroactive effect the court found that a denial of a hearing before an immigration judge did not have a retroactive effect because i llegal reentrants have no entitlement to such delays and no reasonable expectation that prior inefficiencies in the administration of our immigration laws would continue indefinitely.likewise,the court found that a extension of the reinstatement procedures to illegal reentrants whose prior deportation was based on entry without inspection did not have an impermissible retroactive effect judge loken wrote that n o illegally reentering alien has a reasonable expectation that his prior deportation order will not be reinstated for purposes of effecting a second removal.
we agree.in this case,was denied a hearing before an immigration judge,to which he was entitled under law.instead,an immigration officer made all of the predicate findings necessary to reinstate his prior deportation order.unlike the alien who entered a plea agreement in cyr,however,had no reasonable expectation of having a hearing before an immigration judge rather than an ins official when he illegally reentered
