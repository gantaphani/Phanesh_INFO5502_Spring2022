our task is to review a district court determination made after a bench trial that the was born in mexico,not the united states.after finding the petitioner had introduced sufficient evidence that he is a citizen,the district court shifted the burden to the government to rebut by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence,and found that it had done so.
the petitioner claims that the district court erred in concluding that clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence a phrase we have used to describe the government burden in proceedings is identical to the traditional civil intermediate burden of proof.he argues the proper burden is instead more akin to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard that applies in criminal cases.we disagree,and hold that clear,unequivocal,and convincing is the familiar intermediate standard used in civil cases when particularly important individual interests are at stake.
because we find no error in the district court application of the burden of proof,we also reach the second substantial question presented in this case the standard of review applicable to the trial court findings of fact.the petitioner argues we must review the district court findings de novo.we hold,instead,that the clear error standard of federal rule of civil procedure a applies.under that standard,the petition for review must be denied.
although the parties sharply contest whether the petitioner is a citizen,much of the evidence in this case is a matter of public record and undisputed.
two authentic birth certificates are in the record one of salvador mondaca vega,born on june,in sinaloa,mexico,the other of mondaca carlon,born on july,in imperial,california.although the petitioner concedes he has on multiple occasions identified himself as salvador mondaca vega,he claims he is really reynaldo mondaca carlon,a citizen.
it is uncontested that regardless of his place of birth,the petitioner grew up in el fuerte,sinaloa,mexico.he came to the united states around,when he was about twenty years old,to look for work.a long series of contacts with law enforcement and immigration authorities ensued.
his rap sheet indicates that in july,the petitioner,identifying himself as salvador mondaca,was taken into custody by the sheriff office in auburn,california and transferred to federal immigration officials.in september,the petitioner accepted voluntary departure under the name salvador mondaca vega.
the record also reflects various actions taken in and by individuals identifying themselves by the names on the birth certificates the parties dispute whether these actions were taken by the petitioner.in september,someone identifying himself as salvador mondaca unsuccessfully applied for a social security card,naming his place of birth as mexico and stating that his date of birth was april.also in september,someone identifying himself as reynaldo mondaca carlon registered for selective service in salinas,california he was later found unacceptable for induction.
in may,a person claiming to be reynaldo mondaca and identifying his date of birth as july,and his place of birth as imperial,california,successfully applied for a social security card.handwriting analysis suggests the signature on this application belongs to the petitioner.although the district court made no finding as to who made the first social security card application and the selective service registration,the court concluded that the may application was made by the petitioner.
according to the rap sheet,in may and september,the petitioner,claiming first to be salvador mondaca vega,then salvador mondaca,was transferred to immigration authorities in washington state and deported to mexico.a fingerprint analysis by the seattle police department indicates that fingerprints taken on both occasions were from the same individual,and that they belong to the petitioner.
in september,the petitioner,in a sworn interview with an ins official,stated that his name is salvador mondaca vega,that he was born on april,in sinaloa,mexico,and that he is a mexican citizen.expert handwriting analysis submitted by both parties suggests the signature on the statement was made by the petitioner.
the rap sheet indicates that on at least two occasions after his deportation,the petitioner received voluntary departure once in as salvador mondaca vega,and once in under the name jose valdez vega.the name salvador mondaca vega also appears in an october entry for a bench warrant issued in california for failure to appear 
in august,the petitioner married aurelia estrella.they had nine children,six born in mexico and three in the united states.in,the petitioner successfully petitioned for adjustment of status for his wife and two of his children based on his asserted status as a citizen the remaining four children received certificates of citizenship based on their father purported status.the department of state issued the petitioner a passport in april,and a replacement passport in september after the original was lost.
the convoluted procedural history of this case begins in,when the petitioner,after a conviction in washington state court for assault,was charged with entry without inspection and making a false claim of citizenship and placed in removal proceedings.
after an evidentiary hearing,an immigration judge found by clear,convincing and unequivocal evidence that the petitioner is a who entered without inspection and by misrepresentation.the bia affirmed.
on review,we found the petitioner claim of citizenship presented genuine issues of material fact and,pursuant to the statute now codified at b b transferred the proceedings to the eastern district of washington for a de novo determination of the petitioner alienage.mondaca vega ashcroft,app x,cir.the district court denied the parties for summary judgment,mondaca vega holder,cv fvs,wl,at,and conducted a bench trial.
at trial,the petitioner admitted that he had used the name salvador mondaca vega and other names he could not remember.he claimed,however,that he never knew the real salvador mondaca vega and could not recall how he came up with the name.he explained that he repeatedly used the name of a with authorities because friends told him a citizen would be detained longer.
the district court found the petitioner had carried his initial burden of proof by offering a passport and showing that his wife and children had adjusted status and obtained citizenship through him.mondaca vega holder,cv fvs,wl,at.july.the court then shifted the burden to the government to rebut the petitioner claim of citizenship by clear and convincing evidence,and,after hearing the government case,found this burden satisfied.id.at.this conclusion was based in part on the district judge finding that the petitioner testimony was not credible.id.at.
on april,a divided panel of this court found no clear error in the district court conclusion.mondaca vega holder,cir.a majority of the active judges then voted to rehear the case en banc 
the government bears the ultimate burden of establishing all facts supporting deportability by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.chau ins,cir.when,however,the government offers evidence of foreign birth,a rebuttable presumption of alienage arises,shifting the burden to the alleged citizen to prove citizenship.id.upon production by a petitioner of substantial credible evidence of the citizenship claim,this presumption bursts and the burden shifts back to the government to prov e the respondent removable by clear and convincing evidence.ayalavillanueva holder,cir see also lee hon lung dulles,cir w here one has,over a long period of years,acted in reliance upon a decision admitting him as a citizen of the united states,the fraud or error which will warrant disregard of such decision must be established by evidence which is clear,unequivocal,and convincing.
to the extent the government contends that the petitioner failed to offer even substantial credible evidence of citizenship,we reject this claim.the petitioner possessed a valid passport and successfully petitioned for the adjustment of status of his wife and children based on his purported status as a citizen.this is substantial credible evidence of citizenship.ayala villanueva,at.
at issue,then,is whether the government bore its burden of proving the petitioner alienage.see also lee hon lung,at noting that when the burden shifts back to the government,the question is whether sufficient evidence warrant s disregard ing the petitioner proof of citizenship.the threshold issue is whether the district court erred in holding the government to a clear and convincing burden of proof.we review the district court determination of the appropriate quantum of proof de novo.united states gill,cir.
the petitioner correctly notes that our cases often describe the government burden as proof by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.see,lim mitchell,cir citing chaunt united states,and knauer united states,lee hon lung,at citing schneiderman united states,and baumgartner united states.the petitioner argues that the word unequivocal must add some meaning to the words clear and convincing,and that clear,unequivocal,and convincing thus signifies a higher burden than simply clear and convincing.
we disagree.our task today is not to apply canons of statutory construction the burden of proof in proceedings is entirely a judicial construct woodby ins,d egree of proof is the kind of question which has traditionally been left to the judiciary to resolve.the supreme court has repeatedly used the phrases clear,unequivocal,and convincing and clear and convincing interchangeably.compare baumgartner,at describing the burden on the government in denaturalization cases as proof by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence,with pullman standard swint,describing the issue in baumgartner as whether or not the findings of the two lower courts satisfied the clear and convincing standard of proof necessary to sustain a denaturalization decree.we have repeatedly done the same.see,united states arango,cir lopez chavez ins,cir united states meza soria,cir.we therefore can not mechanistically conclude that the phrase signifies a burden of proof higher than the familiar intermediate standard simply because it contains the additional word unequivocal.
we are troubled,moreover,by the possible alternative interpretations of the phrase clear,unequivocal,and convincing.this phrase can not,as judge smith separate opinion contends,plausibly be interpreted to mean beyond a reasonable doubt.the supreme court surely knows how to use the phrase beyond a reasonable doubt when it wants to.in the citizenship context,however,it has never done so.rather,it has consistently described clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence as the familiar civil intermediate standard.see woodby,at in denaturalization cases the court has required the government to establish its allegations by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that standard of proof is no stranger to the civil law.footnote omitted schneiderman,at a certificate of citizenship is closely analogous to a public grant of land.to set aside such a grant the evidence must be clear,unequivocal,and convincing it can not be done upon a bare preponderance of evidence which leaves the issue in doubt.citations and internal quotation marks omitted california ex rel.cooper mitchell santa ana theater,per curiam t he court has never required the beyond a reasonable doubt standard to be applied in a civil case.this unique standard of proof is regarded as a critical part of the moral force of the criminal law.internal quotation marks omitted united mine workers of am.gibbs,although the norris laguardia act does not define clear proof,congress meant at least to signify a meaning like that commonly accorded such similar phrases as clear,unequivocal,and convincing proof.under this standard,the plaintiff in a civil case is not required to satisfy the criminal standard of reasonable doubt citing schneiderman,at.these cases make plain that the phrase clear,unequivocal,and convincing is simply one of the many articulations of the intermediate burden of proof,not a counterintuitive way to say beyond a reasonable doubt.meza soria,at concluding that a determination of alienage by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence in deportation proceedings could not have collateral estoppel effect in criminal reentry prosecutions because that burden is not the same as proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
equally implausible is the notion that clear,unequivocal,and convincing signifies a fourth burden of proof something between clear and convincing evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that there are three burdens of proof,and expressly noted that the word unequivocal is among the many adjectives used to describe the intermediate burden.see cooper,at three standards of proof are generally recognized,ranging from the preponderance of the evidence standard employed in most civil cases,to the clear and convincing standard reserved to protect particularly important interests in a limited number of civil cases,to the requirement that guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal prosecution.footnote omitted addington texas,the intermediate standard usually employs some combination of the words clear,cogent,unequivocal,and convincing.three is enough.it defies reason to think that a fourth burden of proof could be meaningfully distinguished and distinctly applied.see addington,at e fforts to analyze the differences among burdens of proof may well be largely an academic exercise mccormick on evidence listing adjectives used to describe the intermediate burden and stating that n o high degree of precision can be attained by them.we have never saddled district courts with the exercise of discerning a burden located in between clear and convincing evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt,and we decline the invitation to do so now.
to be sure,standards of proof serve a symbolic function.see addington,at in cases involving individual rights,whether criminal or civil,the standard of proof at a minimum reflects the value society places on individual liberty.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.but the intermediate burden of proof requires an abiding conviction that the truth of the factual contentions at issue is highly probable.colorado new mexico.for this reason,it is appropriately employed when,as here,particularly important interests are at stake.cooper,at see santosky kramer,termination of parental rights addington,at civil commitment united states ruiz gaxiola,cir forcible medication of detainees.the symbolic value of the intermediate standard matches the gravity of the task in these proceedings.it is not necessary to create,out of whole cloth,a nebulous fourth burden to recognize that an alienage determination implicates important rights.we therefore conclude that the district court did not err in its articulation of the government burden of proof.
because we find no error in the district court use of the intermediate burden of proof,we must next determine the standard of review applicable to the district court finding that this burden was satisfied.the petitioner argues that,notwithstanding the factual nature of the district court findings,our review is independent,that this court reviews the trial judge factual determinations without deference and independently determines what the evidence below establishes.again,we disagree.
federal rule of civil procedure a provides in plain terms that district court f indings of fact,whether based on oral or other evidence,must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.the petitioner argues that because the supreme court has created an exception to clear error review for ultimate findings of fact in denaturalization proceedings,the same standard should govern our review here.
baumgartner was the first case to expressly articulate the principle of independent review in denaturalization cases.the question was whether evidence purporting to show baumgartner loyalty to the third reich supported a finding that he had obtained his naturalization decree by fraud.at.the court held that the evidence did not support a finding of fraud,and,in so doing,set aside the findings of the district court.id.at.the opinion acknowledged the usual rule of deference to trial court factfinding,but found that the rule did not apply to the conclusion that may appropriately be drawn from the whole mass of evidence,which,although technically a finding of fact,implicated broadly social judgments judgments lying close to opinion regarding the whole nature of our government and the duties and immunities of citizenship.id.at.
subsequent denaturalization cases underscored that independent review was motivated by concern about the risk of political persecution uniquely present in the denaturalization context.thus,in knauer which involved the validity of an oath of allegiance the court explained that without independent review of lower court findings,valuable rights would rest upon a slender reed,and the security of the status of our naturalized citizens might depend in considerable degree upon the political temper of majority thought and the stresses of the times.at quoting schneiderman,at.
first amendment concerns are also prevalent in the denaturalization cases.in nowak united states,for example,the government sought to prove that the petitioner was not attached to the principles of the constitution by showing that he has been a member of the communist party with knowledge that the party advocated the overthrow of the government by force and violence.the court applied independent review and set aside a denaturalization decree,emphasizing that party membership and expression of opinions or predictions about future events was not enough,under its jurisprudence,to show advocacy of violent overthrow.id.at citing yates united states,overruled by burks united states,and dennis united states.
because the denaturalization cases often pose first amendment concerns,they have naturally been linked with the supreme court first amendment jurisprudence.see,schneiderman,at we brought this denaturalization case here on certiorari because of its importance and its possible relation to freedom of thought.citation omitted.in the first amendment context,independent review is also sometimes applied.see bose consumers union of,noting that the court has independently reviewed factual records in first amendment cases involving fighting words,incitement to imminent lawless action,obscenity,and defamation.independent review in this context protects not only a litigant first amendment rights,but also facilitates the appellate courts role in marking out the limits of the constitutional standard through the process of adjudication.id.at.thus,appellate courts conduct an independent review of the record both to be sure that the speech in question actually falls within the unprotected category and to confine the perimeters of any unprotected category within acceptably narrow limits in an effort to ensure that protected expression will not be inhibited.id.at see also knauer,at emphasizing the blurred line between facts and law in determinations of loyalty and fraud baumgartner,at noting the ultimate facts under review clearly implie d the application of standards of law.
the supreme court,however,has never extended independent review to alienage determinations.and,as this case demonstrates,the court reasoning for applying independent review in denaturalization cases does not apply here.
the question for the district court was straightforward who is the petitioner is he reynaldo mondaca carlon,a native and citizen of the united states,or salvador mondaca vega,a native and citizen of mexico nothing about this determination implicates broadly social judgments or opinions regarding the whole nature of our government and the duties and immunities of citizenship.baumgartner,at see also chaunt,at.nor does it implicate or concerns.see knauer,at schneiderman,at.and,most importantly,there were no questions of mixed questions of law and fact,nor questions that could conceivably bear on the future definition of a legal the district court.see baumgartner,at.under b b,we refer proceedings to the district court for the sole purpose of resolving a genuine issue of material fact.u.b b see,anderson holder,cir proceedings involving question of whether petitioner paternity was established by legitimation before he turned ayala villanueva,at proceedings involving identity of petitioner father chau,at proceedings involving identity of petitioner father and satisfaction of residency requirements.the petitioner is either reynaldo or salvador,and the entirely answer to this question has no implications for future cases.see bose,at.independent review therefore has no role to play in these proceedings.
the petitioner urges that we follow lim,an case applying independent review to findings of fact.at.lim derived this independent review principle by unelaborated analogy to the supreme court denaturalization jurisprudence.id.at.if lim is good law,it indeed controls the outcome here.but,for the reasons explained above,we conclude that the analogy to the denaturalization cases does not withstand critical scrutiny.
moreover,in the years since lim,the supreme court has questioned whether there can ever be independent appellate review of a question of fact.in pullman standard,the court reversed the fifth circuit for independently reviewing a finding of intentional discrimination in a title vii case.at.in doing so,the court emphasized that the clearly erroneous standard of federal rule of civil procedure a does not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual findings,and,in particular,it does not divide findings of fact into those that deal with ultimate and those that deal with subsidiary facts.id.at see also anderson city of bessemer city,reemphasizing that rule a has no exceptions.and,just last term,the supreme court reversed the federal circuit for failing to apply review to factual findings underlying the construction of a patent claim.teva pharm.usa,sandoz.the court held that although the scope of a patent claim is a question of law,underlying evidentiary determinations are nevertheless questions of fact and therefore subject to review under rule a,which applies to all factual findings without exception.id.
under these cases,the relevant distinction for purposes is no longer between primary and ultimate facts,but facts and law.see pullman standard,at whatever baumgartner may have meant,its discussion of ultimate facts referred not to pure findings of fact but to findings that clearly imply the application of standards of law.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.to be sure,the distinction is often vexing.id.at.but not today.there are no mixed questions of law and fact nor standards that require development through the process of adjudication that could blur the dividing line in this case.bose,at.here,as in lim,only historical facts need be determined.see lim,at.lim principle therefore has no continued vitality 
in urging independent review,the petitioner also emphasizes the severity of the deprivation at stake.we do not minimize the point.the value of citizenship is well acknowledged in the case law.see,fedorenko united states,baumgartner,at.and,the petitioner arguably stands to lose just as much from a determination that he is not a citizen as a naturalized citizen does from a denaturalization decree 
but the value of citizenship and the hardship of deportation are not the only,or even the primary,factors that motivated independent review in the denaturalization cases.nor could they be.we review findings of lower courts with deference in a broad array of settings that implicate precious rights and severe deprivations.we even apply the deferential standard in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting convictions in death penalty cases.see davis woodford,cir as amended.indeed,in deportation proceedings,where t he immediate hardship is often greater than that inflicted by denaturalization,woodby,u.at,we nevertheless review agency factfinding with deference,see b b t he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.no greater scrutiny should apply to the factual findings of an article iii judge in alienage determinations.
for these reasons,we conclude that we are required under rule a to review the district court factual findings including its ultimate conclusion that the petitioner is not a citizen because he was born in clear error.under this standard,we must defer to the district court findings unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson,at quoting united states gypsum.we may not duplicate the role of the lower court.id.thus,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we may not reverse it even though convinced that had we been sitting as the trier of fact,we would have weighed the evidence differently.id.at.as long as there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.id.at.
the following facts are beyond dispute the petitioner has accepted voluntary departure on multiple occasions,he has been deported under the name salvador mondaca vega,he signed a sworn statement under the name salvador mondaca vega,and fingerprints taken for salvador mondaca vega by the ins match his fingerprints.these facts give rise to a reasonable if not inevitable inference that the petitioner is salvador mondaca vega,born in mexico see united states bucher,cir r easonable inferences from th e facts are the province of the trier of fact.see also anderson,at explaining that we must defer to the factfinder reasonable conclusions that are based on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.
to be sure,there is evidence to the contrary.the petitioner wife and one of his daughters attested that he is reynaldo mondaca carlon,a citizen.and the petitioner testified that although he has used various aliases,reynaldo mondaca carlon is his true name and identity,that he began to use the name salvador mondaca vega with authorities because he believed he would be released from detention faster as a mexican citizen and that he continued to use the name because the authorities already knew him as salvador.
acting as the finder of fact,however,the district court was entitled to discount this evidence.much of it turned on credibility.see allen iranon,cir citing anderson,at noting the special deference due to credibility determinations.for example,in her first declaration,the petitioner wife referred to sinaloa,mexico as the rancho of the petitioner birth.she later retracted this statement,but the district court was surely entitled to draw an adverse inference from the inconsistency,see gibbs pierce cnty.law enforcement support agency,cir in cases of conflicting testimony where credibility is necessarily at issue,we must be especially reluctant to set aside the findings of the trial court.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court also found the petitioner testimony inconsistent and implausible.the petitioner claims he received the california birth certificate from his mother in mexico after being deported in may.the court reasonably noted,however,that it made little sense for the petitioner thereafter to continue to use the name of a with immigration authorities,particularly given that he claimed to always carry the birth certificate with him.the petitioner testimony was also inconsistent with his deposition and some of the documentary evidence.see mondaca vega,wl,at noting discrepancies masayesva zah,cir the court found some of the testimony implausible or contradictory.there was no clear error.
there are some minor errors in the district court factfinding.for example,the government admits that the petitioner was not removed in july or september of or november of,as the district court had concluded.but this error is inconsequential in light of undisputed evidence showing that the petitioner has indeed been removed under the name salvador mondaca vega on other occasions.the district court also incorrectly believed that the petitioner would have had to show a birth certificate in order to obtain a social security number.there was no evidence to this effect in the record,and no stated basis for judicial notice of this fact.but it is hardly conceivable that absent this mistake,the district court would have reached a different conclusion,given the ample other reasons to doubt the petitioner credibility 
finally,the petitioner emphasizes the various occasions on which the government appears to have accepted that he is a citizen directly,by issuing him passports and adjusting the status of his family members,and indirectly,by charging him with a crime as a citizen or conducting investigations into his citizenship status that terminated favorably or inconclusively.these facts should weigh in the petitioner favor before the finder of fact.ultimately,however,the petitioner position is simply that the evidence could plausibly be read as supporting his claim that he was born in this country.but the district judge found to the contrary,and the clear error standard does not vest us with power to reweigh the evidence presented at trial in an attempt to assess which items should and which should not have been accorded credibility.cataphote de soto chem.coatings,cir.
based on the entire evidence,we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson,at quoting gypsum,at.that ends the analysis we are not entitled to reject the district court findings of fact because,on a cold record,we would have come out differently or because we weigh the equities in the petitioner favor.we are therefore constrained to deny the petition for review.
the petition for review is denied.
united states citizenship is a right no less precious than life or liberty.united states dang,cir quoting klapprott united states,rutledge,concurring.the supreme court has noted,it is better that many immigrants should be improperly admitted than that one natural born citizen of the united states should be permanently excluded from his country.fat white.yet today,the majority diminishes a citizen ability to protect his citizenship,by allowing the government to prove that petitioner is not a united states citizen by the traditional,less demanding,standard of proof used in general civil litigation.thus,this year old petitioner whom the government has previously recognized as a united states citizen will be stripped of his claimed citizenship and deported,without forcing the government to meet its heavy burden of proof to submit clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence not leav ing the issue in doubt that he is not a citizen.dang,at quoting fedorenko united states.
this case does present a conflicting history of petitioner life.however,amid all of the confusion,no one disputes that petitioner as reynaldo mondaca carlon reynaldo has presented himself to the government as a united states citizen,and the united states has treated petitioner as a united states citizen.thus,no one disputes that the government bore the burden to submit evidence that clearly,unequivocally,and convincingly not leaving the issue in doubt showed petitioner was not reynaldo.
because i agree with petitioner that the district court erroneously reached its decision,when it only required the government to present clear and convincing evidence regarding his citizenship,this case demands remand to the district court to redetermine the issue using the correct burden of proof.because remand is necessary,i would not address petitioner remaining issues 
even though i do not agree with the majority holding on the burden of proof,i reluctantly concur in the judgment to deny the petition section vi.applying the clearly erroneous standard of review to the district court findings of fact under federal rule of civil procedure a and using the majority clear and convincing burden of proof,i can not grant the petition for review.there would also be no benefit to remanding this case to the district court,because the outcome would not change.
i.the burden of proof required for clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence is greater than the burden of proof required for clear and convincing evidence.
federal courts have recognized a higher burden of proof for clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.
the supreme court has recognized three general standards of proof preponderance of the evidence the minimum standard,evidence the intermediate standard,and beyond a reasonable doubt the high standard.see addington texas.however,the supreme court has never suggested that standards of proof are limited to these three general levels.to the contrary,the supreme court and other courts have expressly recognized variants to the intermediate standard of proof.see california ex rel.cooper mitchell bros.santa ana theater,per curiam this court has,on several occasions,held that the clear and convincing standard or one of its variants is the appropriate standard of proof in a particular civil case.in cases involving individual rights,whether criminal or civil,the standard of proof at a minimum reflects the value society places on individual liberty.addington,at alterations and citation omitted.
in both deportation and denaturalization proceedings,federal case law and regulations governing deportability require that the government establish by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the petitioner is removable.see chaunt united states,woodby ins,a.we have also applied this same clear,unequivocal,and convincing standard in cases where citizenship is at issue.see lim mitchell,cir lee hon lung dulles,cir.this case requires us to determine whether the addition of the word unequivocal changes the government burden of proof to a standard above clear and convincing evidence.
in addington,the supreme court settled this very issue.in addington,the supreme court was faced with the question of the appropriate standard of proof to apply in civil commitment proceedings at.in determining the appropriate standard of proof,the supreme court recognized that the addition of the word unequivocal created a burden approximating,if not exceeding,that used in criminal cases,which higher burden was required for cases with unusually drastic consequences.id.at emphasis added the supreme court further recognized that a higher burden of proof in denaturalization cases was appropriate,because those issues were basically factual and therefore susceptible of objective proof,as opposed to civil commitment proceedings that are dependent on subjective proof.id.
similarly,in kungys united states,the supreme court considered whether kungys misrepresented or concealed facts to obtain citizenship,plurality opinion by scalia.the supreme court remanded the matter to the third circuit,but cautioned the court to bear in mind that clear,unequivocal,and convincing standard required an unusually high burden of proof.id.at emphasis added.justice stevens,in his concurrence emphasized the special burden on the government,which in this kind of civil proceeding is equivalent to that enforced in criminal cases.id.at stevens,concurring.
this higher burden of proof has also been recognized in other cases.see klapprott,at black,announcing judgment of the court and delivering the opinion plurality opinion noting that the clear,unequivocal,and convincing burden is substantially identical with that required in criminal cases proof beyond a reasonable doubt id.at rutledge,concurring noting that the burden of proof for denaturalization approximates the burden demanded for conviction in criminal cases,namely,proof beyond a reasonable doubt schneiderman united states,holding citizenship should not be taken away without the clearest sort of justification and proof,and that proof can not leave the issue in doubt see also united states horwitz,moreover,with so dire consequences in the balance,the proof must be made by clear,unequivocal and convincing evidence which does not leave the issue in doubt,in effect,proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
our sister circuits have also recognized this higher burden of proof when revocation of citizenship is at issue.for example,in united states sprogis,the second circuit noted 
the government bears a heavy burden of proof in attempting to revoke an individual citizenship.because citizenship is such a precious right,the government to succeed must prove its case by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence which does not leave the issue in doubt.in addition,the facts and the law should be construed as far as is reasonably possible in favor of the citizen.
cir emphasis added citing fedorenko,at,and quoting schneiderman,at.
the sixth circuit,relying on addington,concluded that the word unequivocal raised the level of proof necessary above the intermediate standard of proof.see ward holder,cir.in ward,the government sought to remove the petitioner,arguing that he had abandoned his status.id.at.the sixth circuit concluded that the appropriate degree of proof required was clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.id.the court then examined the level of proof that this standard required.id.at.the sixth circuit,applying addington,concluded that the word unequivocal ma de a difference,and therefore t he clear,unequivocal,and convincing standard is a more demanding degree of proof than the clear and convincing standard.id.
the bia has also recognized that the addition of the word unequivocal to the clear and convincing standard alters the burden of proof.see matter of patel,bia.in addressing the standards of proof,the bia recognized that t he clear and convincing standard imposes a lower burden than the clear,unequivocal,and convincing standard applied in deportation and denaturalization proceedings because it does not require that the evidence be unequivocal or of such a quality as to dispel all doubt.id.
because consequences were unusually drastic loss of citizenship and expulsion from the united states,the supreme court has explained that the higher burden was appropriate in citizenship cases.addington,at.this unusually high burden of proof reflects the value that society places on one citizenship.see trop dulles,plurality opinion noting that united states citizenship itself is a fundamental right.
this higher burden of proof is consistent with the supreme court discussions with regard to the value of united states citizenship.removal of petitioner implicates a loss of a serious liberty interest a determination of this loss requires a heavy burden.see kungys,at noting t his court has long recognized the plain fact that to deprive a person of his american citizenship is an extraordinarily severe penalty to deport one who so claims to be a citizen,obviously deprives him of liberty.it may result also in loss of both property and life or of all that makes life worth living.internal alterations and quotation marks omitted quoting klapprott,at fedorenko,at any less exacting standard would be inconsistent with the importance of the right that is at stake in a denaturalization proceeding.additionally,the supreme court has recognized that the loss of citizenship can have severe and unsettling consequences.fedorenko,at.the potential loss of citizenship,regardless of whether obtained through birth or naturalization,is significant.see knauer united states,holding that citizenship obtained through birth or naturalization carries with it all of the rights and prerogatives of citizenship obtained by birth in this country save that of eligibility to the presidency.although a deportation proceeding is not a criminal prosecution,the supreme court has not closed its eyes to the drastic deprivations that may follow when a resident of this country is compelled by our government to forsake all the bonds formed here and go to a foreign land where he often has no contemporary identification.woodby,at.the immediate hardship of deportation is often greater than that inflicted by denaturalization,because many resident aliens have lived in this country longer and established stronger family,social,and economic ties here than some who have become naturalized citizens.id.at.thus,the supreme court has required the solidity of proof for a judgment entailing the consequences of deportation,particularly in the case of an old man who has lived in this country for more than sixty years.id.at.
past imprecise language does not overrule clear precedent.
in this decision,the majority ignores this precedent,instead reading the word unequivocal out of the phrase,concluding that clear and convincing is the same standard as clear,unequivocal,and convincing.thus,it determines that the word unequivocal is meaningless,because the phrases have been used interchangeably in the past.
imprecise usage or improper citation is not a proper basis for concluding that words have no meaning,especially in light of the supreme court clear and unambiguous directive regarding the burden of proof.it is especially improper,because the majority does not cite and i can not find any supreme court citizenship cases that suggest these standards are the same.congress has not addressed the required standard of proof,and the supreme court has never overruled the precedent.thus,the majority cites precedent where the supreme court and other courts have,in other contexts,used the standard interchangeably without regard to whether there is a different standard being applied.however,those mistakes in other contexts should not alter our application of this supreme court precedent.
the majority not only ignores the term unequivocal,it also ignores the dependent clause used by the supreme court in citizenship cases,which helps explain the term unequivocal.the supreme court has explained time and time again in the context of citizenship issues that clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence does not leave the issue in doubt.see schneiderman,at emphasis added see also baumgartner united states,knauer,at klapprott,at plurality opinion perez brownell,overruled on separate grounds by afroyim rusk,nowak united states,chaunt,at costello united states,fedorenko,at kungys,at.the clear and convincing standard highly probable is not equivalent to this language.
the majority conclusion could only suggest that,because the supreme court inartfully chose its words in several cases,citizenship cases deserve nothing better.however,supreme court precedent suggests it is much more likely that the supreme court selected its words carefully for a select type of cases,and this court is bound to follow its precedent until such time as the supreme court overrules itself.see rodriguez de quijas,if a precedent of the supreme court has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to the supreme court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.
comparing burdens of proof in immigration contexts further supports a conclusion that clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence has a greater burden of proof than clear and convincing evidence.
to again justify its decision,the majority notes that its task today is not to apply canons of statutory construction the burden of proof in proceedings is entirely a judicial construct.i agree that we are examining judicial precedent.however,when we determine the burden of proof,we must be mindful that the standard of proof at a minimum reflects the value society places on individual liberty.addington,at alterations omitted quoting tippett maryland,cir.
let us examine how these phrases are used by congress.congress has mandated that,in removal proceedings under,an alien be ordered removed in absentia if the service establishes by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable as defined in subsection e of this section.b a emphasis added see also.in contrast,congress has also mandated if an alien is an applicant for admission,the alien must establish that he or she is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section,c a emphasis added,or if an alien is asserting that he or she is lawfully present in the united states pursuant to a prior admission,then the alien must establish this fact by clear and convincing evidence,c b emphasis added.
applying rules of statutory interpretation to,i t is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.united states menasche,quoting inhabitants of montclair tp.ramsdell.t he use of different words or terms within a statute demonstrates that congress intended to convey a different meaning for those words.sec mccarthy,cir.thus,we can not suggest that congress intended each subsection of to require the same intermediate burden of proof.if so,we would ignore the familiar canon of statutory construction,which requires that a bsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,the language of the statute itself must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania.further,because congress used different standards of proof language in,w e would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship.russello united states.therefore,congress must have intended different standards of proof in the three contexts of immigration proceedings.
in interpreting b a,congress thus meant for aliens only to be removed in absentia after the government had met a higher burden of proof than the general clear and convincing intermediate standard.in establishing this burden,congress is presumed to be knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to any new legislation it enacts.native vill.of venetie council alaska,cir.thus,the majority ruling today suggests that congress enacted b a,providing a higher societal value to an alien who did not get proper notice of a hearing and with no claim to citizenship than to this petitioner claim that he was being robbed of his citizenship.the ruling can not reflect the value society places on united states citizenship,as we must.
conclusion 
in deportation hearings,where a petitioner who claims to be a united states citizen will be deported and removed from the united states,the government must prove by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that he or she is deportable.again,quoting the sixth circuit and the bia,this standard of proof requires a more demanding degree of proof than the clear and convincing standard.ward,at matter of patel,at the clear and convincing standard imposes a lower burden than the clear,unequivocal,and convincing standard applied in deportation and denaturalization proceedings because it does not require that the evidence be unequivocal or of such a quality as to dispel all doubt.removal of petitioner implicates the loss of a serious liberty interest a determination of this loss requires a heavy burden,for which we must require the higher burden of proof.see kungys,at stevens,concurring noting t his court has long recognized the plain fact that to deprive a person of his american citizenship is an extraordinarily severe penalty to deport one who so claims to be a citizen,obviously deprives him of liberty.it may result also in loss of both property and life or of all that makes life worth living.quoting ng fung ho white.
ii.federal rule of civil procedure a mandates the appropriate standard of review.
i agree with the majority that the proper appellate standard of review for district court nationality determinations is clear error.however,i reach that conclusion differently than my colleagues,because i believe congress has spoken to the scope of judicial review in these cases.
congress requires that this court review a district court final order in nationality claims as we would a district court decision in a declaratory judgment action.federal rule of civil procedure a sets forth that review,requiring findings of fact not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.
in,congress enacted ed,in order to create a single,separate,statutory form of judicial review of administrative orders for the deportation of aliens from the united states.agosto ins,alteration omitted quoting,at,as printed in.in enacting,congress carved out one class of cases,however,where de novo review in district court would be available cases in which the person subject to deportation claims to be a united states citizen.id.at.the supreme court noted that,i n carving out this class of cases,congress was aware of our past decisions such as ng fung ho,holding that the constitution requires that there be some provision for de novo judicial determination of claims to american citizenship in deportation proceedings.id.
in addition to carving out this class of cases,congress also mandated the proper scope and standard of judicial review.see b.congress provided for two types of review when nationality claims were at issue.b.first,if a petitioner raised a nationality claim and presented no genuine issue of material fact,we may decide the issue of nationality subject to the administrative record and the administrative finding of fact.b a second,if the petitioner raises issues of material fact,then we must remand the matter to the district court to conduct a hearing and decide the issue as if it were a declaratory judgment.b b once the remand to the district court occurs,there is no basis for an appellate court to treat the case any differently than it would an appeal from a declaratory judgment.
congress was clear then and is clear now the district court is to conduct the de novo hearing and make a decision,just as if the action was brought as a declaratory judgment action under in declaratory judgment actions such as this tried by the district court without a jury,the district court shall find the facts specially and review of those factual findings must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.a,see also sessions,morton,cir.
in enacting b,congress took into consideration the supreme court mandate that a de novo review of citizenship claims must be undertaken prior to removal.in doing so,it specifically concluded that the district court was better positioned than another to decide the issue in question.miller fenton.it specifically declined to have this court review issues of fact de novo.if congress wanted this court to independently review the district court ultimate findings of fact,it could have easily provided for that review.it did not.
it is not relevant that the supreme court has not yet specifically addressed this court standard of appellate review under former a or b b,nor is it relevant that the supreme court has not overruled baumgartner and its progeny.congress has provided the scope and standard of review as to this class of cases.this court is bound to follow congress mandate.
with the exception of lim,no other case in the ninth circuit has addressed this specific issue.in light of the statutory enactment of,lim was wrongly decided.it relied on knauer and baumgartner without considering whether the new statutory framework precluded continued reliance on that standard of review.
lastly,even if there were any question with regard to the appropriate standard of review,the supreme court cleared any remaining doubt,in pullman standard swint,anderson city of bessemer city,and teva pharmaceuticals usa,sandoz.in teva,the supreme court noted that rule a does not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual findings from the obligation of a court of appeals to accept a district court findings unless clearly erroneous.id.at quoting pullman standard,at.rule a applies to findings of fact,including those described as ultimate facts because they may determine the outcome of litigation.bose consumers union of.the district court finding that it was highly probable that petitioner was mondaca vega is an ultimate fact,which determines the outcome of this litigation.this determination is purely fact based,and made after considering the evidence of petitioner identity submitted to the district court.thus,because the majority did not find an error of law here,we must give deference to the district court determination that petitioner is mondaca vega unless such determination is clearly erroneous.
this case involves the vexing nature of the distinction between questions of fact and questions of law.see pullman standard swint.on some questions,the answer is easy.how many times was petitioner deported under what name did petitioner successfully apply for a social security number has he ever been convicted of a crime as a citizen how many children does he have,and what is the status of their citizenship is the petitioner testimony persuasive these are undoubtedly questions of fact,and we review the district court answers to these questions for clear error.see.a.
on others,the distinction is more difficult.did the government prove by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that petitioner evidence of citizenship was illegally procured or obtained by fraud lee hon lung dulles,cir.the government contends,and the majority concludes,that this is a question of fact,subject to deference under clear error review.i believe that the district court answer to this question is not a pure finding of fact,but a finding that clearly impl ies the application of standards of law.see pullman standard,at quoting baumgartner united states.therefore,i would review that question de novo.see id.i consequently would reverse the district court and grant the petition for review.
the supreme court first prescribed a de novo standard for reviewing the government burden of proof in citizenship cases in baumgartner united states.there,the supreme court considered whether the government had proven by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that carl baumgartner,a naturalized citizen,had obtained his citizenship through fraud.see id.at.the answer to this question,according to the court,more clearly impli ed the application of standards of law than pure findings of fact.see id.at.de novo review was necessary because otherwise the emphasis on the government high burden of proof in citizenship cases would be lost if the district court ultimate conclusion on that question was deemed a fact of the same order as all other facts,not open to review.see id.at internal citation omitted.notably,the court distinguished the ultimate burden of proof question,which required a conclusion drawn from the whole mass of evidence,from subsidiary findings of fact,such as who said what,when,and where.see id.at.
as in baumgartner,when congress has not spoken and when the issue falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact,the distinction at times has turned on a determination that,as a matter of the sound administration of justice,one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question.see miller fenton.considering the gravity of the interest at stake citizenship and all its attendant rights and the correspondingly high burden of proof,the supreme court deliberately chose to designate the question of the government burden of proof as a question of law subject to independent,or de novo,review see baumgartner,at.
when deciding issues of citizenship in denaturalization cases,the supreme court has not strayed from its reasoning in baumgartner.see,fedorenko united states,i n reviewing denaturalization cases,we have carefully examined the record ourselves.costello united states,the issue in these cases is so important to the liberty of the citizen that the weight normally given concurrent findings of two lower courts does not preclude reconsideration here.chaunt united states,same nowak united states,scrutinizing the record in a denaturalization case with the utmost care knauer united states,we reexamine the facts to determine whether the united states has carried its burden of proving by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence,which does not leave the issue in doubt,that the citizen who is sought to be restored to the status of an alien obtained his naturalization certificate illegally.
as the majority recognizes,we have previously applied baumgartner independent standard of review in an alienage determination case.see lim mitchell,cir.in lim,the plaintiff asked for a judgment declaring him to be a citizen of the united states after the immigration and naturalization service began to question his identity.id.at.at the time of the lawsuit,lim had been considered a derivative citizen for almost years.see id.the government argued that lim was not entitled to citizenship because he was actually related to jew look,a chinese citizen,not lim sam,a citizen.see id.at.the district court agreed,holding that the government had shown that lim was not a citizen.id.at.independently reviewing this question,we reversed,holding that in light of the service prior determination of citizenship and lim reliance on it,the government had failed to show clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that lim was not a citizen.see id.at.
as in lim,the government here has treated petitioner as a citizen.he has been issued more than one passport.he has been convicted and sentenced to prison as a citizen.and six of his children have been awarded derivative citizenship or lawful permanent resident status based on petitioner own citizenship.although none of these actions have the conclusiveness of a formal naturalization,petitioner has relied on these actions,made his home here,and established the ties and roots of permanent citizenship.in cases such as this where the government has treated an individual like a citizen for years we have held that 
t he practical effect of a decision favorable to the government in this case is the same as that which results from a decision favorable to the government in a denaturalization case.in either case,the individual is stripped of what the supreme court termed the priceless benefits which derive from the status of citizenship.in either case,the government seeks to turn the clock back,with possible grievous consequences.
lee hon lung,at internal citation omitted quoting schneiderman united states,sanchez martinez ins,cir distinguishing lim and applying a clear error standard of review because there ha d been no prior determination of citizenship and petitioner claim to united states citizenship was based solely on his own belief and the recollections of others as to his putative birth.because the government repeatedly treated petitioner as a citizen over the course of forty years,i would follow the clear direction of lim and apply baumgartner standard of review to this case.
the majority agrees that lim squarely addresses this case.see op.at if lim is good law,it indeed controls the outcome here.in order to get around lim,which has been the law of our circuit for years,the majority overrules it 
the majority concludes that baumgartner simply does not apply because lim,and this case,involved an alienage determination,not a denaturalization proceeding but the majority uses too blunt a knife.although the supreme court has generally stated the importance of citizenship in denaturalization and expatriation cases,it has never suggested that the wrongful deportation of a united states citizen is a lesser loss of liberty than the stripping of one citizenship.see baumgartner,at murphy,concurring the naturalized citizen has as much right as the natural born citizen to exercise the cherished freedoms of speech,press and religion woodby ins,the immediate hardship of deportation is often greater than that inflicted by denaturalization,which does not,immediately at least,result in expulsion from our shores.see also lee hon lung,at noting that the practical effect of a judgment declaring someone to be a is the same as a denaturalization order.as plainly illustrated in this case,the important interests of citizenship present in denaturalization proceedings can also permeate alienage determinations made in the context of deportation proceedings.in seeking to remove petitioner,the government sole argument is that petitioner is not actually who he said he was,that petitioner citizenship was obtained through fraud.this is the same allegation that the government made against the petitioners in the denaturalization cases.baumgartner,at the gravamen of the government complaint and of the findings and opinion below is in short,that baumgartner was guilty of fraud.
the majority distinction between denaturalization and deportation proceedings further ignores the fact that the supreme court and this court have consistently applied the same intermediate burden of proof to both types of proceedings see chaunt,at woodby,at.we have also applied the same burden of proof to cases where citizenship is at issue.see also lim,at lee hon lung,at.and that is the same burden of proof that the majority applies today.op.at.the burden of proof issue can not be separated from the appellate standard of review in this case.it was only because of this exacting standard of proof that the baumgartner court applied de novo review to the district court ultimate determination.see baumgartner,at indicating that the trial court burden of proof would be lost without heightened appellate review.together,the burden of proof and standard of review work to safeguard the most valuable right of citizenship.see gorbach reno,cir en banc.for these reasons,i would hold that lim is sound and should be followed.
the majority also suggests that the baumgartner standard of review,as adopted by this court in lim,has been impliedly overruled by the supreme court in pullman standard swint,and anderson city of bessemer city.op.at.the majority concludes that lim is no longer good law because the supreme court has questioned whether there can ever be independent appellate review of a question of fact.op.at.according to the majority,the court need only conclude that lim has been overruled,leaving the supreme court to decide whether it has also implicitly repudiated its own decisions.op.at.but that is a distinction without a difference.lim merely adopted baumgartner and its progeny appellate standard of review.see lim,at.therefore,the two cases rise and fall together.until the supreme court holds otherwise,baumgartner and its progeny remain good law.
in contrast to baumgartner,both pullman standard and anderson concerned a question of fact the finding of intentional discrimination in discrimination cases.see anderson,at pullman standard,at.indeed,the distinction was abundantly clear in pullman standard and anderson because congress had designated the question of intentional discrimination as a pure question of fact.see pullman standard,at.
significantly,the court in pullman standard expressly distinguished baumgartner as not involving a question of fact.id.affirming that baumgartner applied independent review to the conclusion that the exacting standard of proof had been satisfied in citizenship determinations,the pullman standard court explained that the baumgartner court designation of this question as an ultimate fact referred not to pure findings of fact as it found discriminatory intent to be in this context but to findings that clearly impl y the application of standards of law.id.second alteration in original quoting baumgartner,at.as the pullman standard court recognized,rule a mandate for clear error review simply does not apply to conclusions of law.id.at see also id.at declining to address the issue of the applicability of the rule a standard to mixed questions of law and fact.
the supreme court recent decision in teva pharmaceuticals usa,sandoz,did not change this distinction.teva,like pullman standard and anderson,did not address the government burden of proof in citizenship cases.rather,teva addressed the appropriate standard of review to be applied to subsidiary factual matters made in the course of patent claim construction.id.at.the court concluded that these subsidiary factual matters were questions of pure fact subject to clear error review under rule a.id.at.notably,the court did not disturb its previous conclusion that baumgartner dealt with an issue of law,not fact.see pullman standard,at.the court also did not change its guidance on how to make the distinction.see id.
in light of the supreme court clear distinction of baumgartner and its repeated refusals to overrule that precedent,i would hold that baumgartner independent standard of review,as applied to alienage determinations in lim,remains binding on this circuit.see state oil khan,i t is the supreme court prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.see also united states zajanckauskas,cir holding that baumgartner is still valid and has not been overruled in any way.
independently reviewing the district court ultimate determination that the government met its burden of proof and reviewing the district court underlying findings of fact for clear error,baumgartner,at,i would reverse the district court and grant the petition.
all agree that the district court correctly determined that petitioner carried his initial burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that he is an american citizen by the name of reynaldo mondaca carlon.op.at.the government thus was required to present clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that petitioner was not who he claimed to be.op.at.the government did not meet its high burden.
first,several of the district court underlying findings of fact were clearly erroneous.see mccormack hiedeman,cir when reviewing for clear error a district court factual findings may be reversed only if illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record quoting am.trucking ass ns,city of,cir.
as the government admits,and the majority agrees,there is no evidence in the record to support the district court findings that petitioner was deported in july,september,or november.op.at.
there is also no evidence in the record supporting the district court conclusion that petitioner would have had to show a birth certificate in order to obtain a social security card.op.at see also united states berber tinoco,cir a trial judge is prohibited from relying on his personal experience to support the taking of judicial notice.internal quotation marks omitted citation omitted.this error is not inconsequential.the district court solely relied on this erroneous conclusion to discount petitioner testimony that he obtained his authentic birth certificate from his mother after he was deported the first time.thus,the district court had no basis to conclude that petitioner did not rightly possess an authentic birth certificate.
the district court relied on several other clearly erroneous findings in discounting petitioner testimony.for example,the district court found it implausible that petitioner would not have identified himself as a citizen each time he was deported in part because deportation was against his financial interest.but there is no evidence in the record to support the district court findings regarding employment opportunities for a farm worker in the,much less petitioner own personal financial motives.similarly,the district court improperly speculated that petitioner only began using the name reynaldo mondaca after he was married in order to obtain the benefits of a citizen.this finding is flatly contradicted by the record,which shows that petitioner obtained a social security number under reynaldo name in,almost twenty years before his marriage.
without these clearly erroneous findings,but considering all the other facts as found by the district court,i would conclude that the government has not proven by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that petitioner is salvador mondaca vega,citizen of mexico.
for each finding of fact offered by the government,there is an equal or more significant finding of fact favoring the petitioner.for example,it is undisputed that petitioner has accepted voluntary departure and has been deported under the name salvador mondaca vega.but it is also undisputed that the government has repeatedly treated petitioner as reynaldo mondaca carlon,a citizen.in,petitioner obtained a social security number,which he continues to use today.in fact,according to the social security administration,petitioner is currently qualified for social security benefits.similarly,the department of state issued petitioner a valid passport at least two times,once in and again in.the united states also granted petitioner children derivative citizenship based on his status.inally,and perhaps most damaging to the government position,the government charged petitioner in federal court as a citizen.there is no evidence in the record that the government ever questioned petitioner citizenship in conjunction with that proceeding.
the government also points to petitioner signed statement sworn under the name salvador mondaca vega.but petitioner signed many other documents under the name reynaldo mondaca carlon for example,in his application for a social security card,petitioner indicated that his parents were marin mondaca and antonia carlon and that he was born in imperial,california.petitioner also listed his name as reynaldo on all family documents,including documents that have no relation to his citizenship status.he is likewise listed as reynaldo on all of his children baptismal certificates filed with his parish in mexico.
the fingerprint evidence is similarly inconclusive.although petitioner fingerprints match those taken by the ins for salvador mondaca vega,petitioner fingerprints also match an fbi identification record that identifies petitioner as a citizen,born in california.
in light of the conflicting whole mass of evidence,see baumgartner,at,i find it impossible to conclude that the government has met its burden by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.see lim,at.i would reverse the district court and grant the petition.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
because the core question in these proceedings is one of identity,we refer to the petitioner by that title rather than as reynaldo mondaca carlon,his asserted name,or salvador mondaca vega,the name the district court found to be his true name.
the petitioner claims his true first name is reynaldo,not renoldo,and that the birth certificate misspells his name.
between and,the petitioner was charged with numerous offenses under the name reynaldo mondaca carlon and variations thereof.on at least one occasion,he was charged as a citizen.
at the time,this provision was codified at a repealed.
after hearing argument on march,the en banc panel vacated submission and referred the case to mediation.the case was resubmitted on february,after mediation efforts failed.
we use the term alienage determination to refer to adjudications made pursuant to b b and a.
although congress has provided for varying burdens of proof within the immigration and nationality act,it has not specifically addressed the burden in b b proceedings.notably,in c a,congress required the government to establish deportability by clear and convincing evidence.the relevant regulation,on the other hand,requires that deportability be proved by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.a.
judge smith relies on a statement in addington texas that t he term unequivocal,taken by itself,means proof that admits of no doubt,a burden approximating,if not exceeding,that used in criminal cases,emphasis added footnote omitted see also ward holder,cir relying on addington for the proposition that t he clear,unequivocal,and convincing standard is a more demanding degree of proof than the clear and convincing standard.but addington also clarifies that the word unequivocal,when used together with words such as clear and convincing,simply refers to the intermediate standard.at see also cooper,at distinguishing the burden applied in the deportation and denaturalization contexts from proof beyond a reasonable doubt.other isolated statements by individual justices in opinions suggesting clear,unequivocal,and convincing may approximate or be substantially identical to pr
