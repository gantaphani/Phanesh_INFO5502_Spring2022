opinion of the court 
lee moi chong appeals the district court denial of her habeas petition seeking relief from a final order of removal by the board of immigration appeals the board.chong argues that the board violated her due process rights,the immigration and nationality act the ina,and immigration and naturalization service the ins regulations in determining that she is ineligible for withholding of removal.we affirm.
chong,a malaysian citizen,became a permanent resident of the united states in.in may,a federal district court convicted chong of conspiracy to distribute heroin and possession of heroin with intent to distribute,in violation of and b.the district court sentenced chong to time served,which amounted to two years imprisonment.the court departed downward from the minimum sentence due to chong cooperation with the government.
based on chong drug convictions,the ins commenced removal proceedings.the ins claimed that it could remove chong because her convictions constituted aggravated felonies and related to a controlled substance.see a a iii id.at a b i.in august,chong conceded removeability and an immigration judge the ij ordered chong deported to malaysia.
chong subsequently filed a motion with the ij requesting a hearing to determine her eligibility for withholding of removal.the ina provides that the attorney general may not remove an alien to a country if the attorney general decides that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a.chong claimed that the malaysian government would prosecute her for her american drug convictions because she is ethnic chinese.the government argued that chong was ineligible for withholding of removal because her drug convictions constitute a particularly serious crime.id.at b b ii.an exception to b a applies if 
the alien,having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,is a danger to the community of the united states a n alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony or felonies for which the alien has been sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least five years shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.the previous sentence shall not preclude the attorney general from determining that,notwithstanding the length of the sentence imposed,an alien has been convicted of a particularly serious crime.
after granting chong a stay of removal,the ij denied chong an individualized hearing,reasoning that her drug convictions constitute per se particularly serious crimes.the ij certified his decision to the board.subsequently,the board issued two opinions that hold that determining whether an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and sentenced to less than five years imprisonment has been convicted of a particularly serious crime requires an individualized examination of the nature of the conviction,the sentence imposed,and the circumstances and underlying facts of the conviction.in re,interim decision,wl bia,in re,interim decision,wl bia.interpreting the board opinions to require an individualized hearing,the ij sent a letter to the board requesting it to remand chong case for a hearing.chong also requested that the board remand her case to the ij so the ij could make an individualized examination of her conviction.
on july,the board modified,but affirmed,the ij decision.the board held that chong was ineligible for withholding of removal because she had committed a particularly serious crime.the board noted that although chong sentence is below the term that the ina requires to be considered a per se particularly serious crime,the district court departed from the minimum sentence due to chong assistance to the government.the board stated this is different from a sentence reduction due to a minor role in the offense or other mitigating factors.the board also examined the complaint against chong and asserted that over several years,chong handled money derived from selling drugs and arranged telephonic connections for people involved in the conspiracy to promote the distribution of large amounts of heroin.alternatively,the board held that chong failed to show that a return to malaysia would threaten her freedom due to her chinese ethnicity.
chong then filed a habeas petition in the district court under,arguing that the board violated her due process rights and erred in determining that she was ineligible for withholding of removal.on september,while chong habeas petition was pending in the district court,the ins deported her to malaysia.the district court denied chong petition on february.the district court held that neither due process nor the ina required the board to provide chong with an individualized hearing to determine whether she committed a particularly serious crime.the district court also held that the board did not violate chong due process rights because the board provided chong with adequate notice did not deprive chong of an opportunity to be heard and based its decision on a permissible interpretation of the ina under chevron,natural resources defense council,d chong appeals,claiming that the board violated her due process rights,the ina,and ins regulations.
jurisdiction 
we initially must examine a number of jurisdictional issues to determine whether we can entertain chong appeal.first,the supreme court recently resolved a circuit split by holding that neither the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of nor the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of repeal district courts jurisdiction to review aliens habeas petitions filed under c.ins cyr,d accord liang ins,cir.second,c s admonition that habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless the prisoner is in custody does not deprive us of jurisdiction to review chong petition.c.chong filed her habeas petition on july.on september,while chong petition was pending in the district court,the ins deported her to malaysia.the district court denied chong petition on february.we hold that chong is in custody within the meaning of c notwithstanding her removal,because we measure custody at the time chong filed her petition.see carafas lavallee,d united states ex rel.wojtycha hopkins,cir the jurisdictional requirement is determined as of the date the petition is filed in the district court.
finally,we must determine whether an article iii,case or controversy continues to exist despite chong deportation.regardless of whether an article iii,case existed during the district court proceedings,chong must show the subsistence of a case or controversy in this court.see lewis continental bank,d.although the parties did not raise the case or controversy issue in their original briefs,we must resolve the issue because it implicates our jurisdiction.see paul fire marine ins.barry,d rogin bensalem township,cir inasmuch as mootness would divest us of jurisdiction to consider this appeal,we are obligated to address this issue as a threshold matter.footnote omitted.
we acknowledge that we previously have suggested that it is within our discretion to consider a mootness question not raised by the parties.see,jersey cent.power light lacey,cir as mootness is a jurisdictional question,we may consider it sua sponte.emphasis added.however,the supreme court has held that courts must decide article iii standing issues,even when not raised by the parties,before turning to the merits.steel citizens for a better env t,d stating that a court is bound to ask and answer a jurisdictional question for itself,even when not otherwise suggested citation omitted see also steele blackman,cir although neither party argues that steele appeal is moot,we are required to raise issues of standing sua sponte if such issues exist.therefore,we proceed to examine whether chong deportation renders her appeal moot.
initially,we must address chong argument that we should entertain her appeal because we previously maintained jurisdiction over a deportee habeas petition in marrero ins,cir.in marrero,this court held that it would have jurisdiction to review a deportation order after the alien has been deported if the record revealed a colorable due process claim,despite the since repealed c.id.at.however,marrero did not address whether an article iii case or controversy continued to exist after the alien deportation.the supreme court has cautioned that jurisdictional rulings of this sort have no precedential effect.steel,at.thus,we think our inquiry must extend beyond marrero.
under article iii,of the united states constitution,the exercise of judicial power depends upon the existence of a case or controversy.defunis odegaard,d.in this case,chong must show that her petition is not moot despite her deportation.put another way,chong must show that the standing she apparently had when she filed her habeas petition continues to exist now.see united states parole comm geraghty,d explaining that mootness is the doctrine of standing in a time frame.the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation standing must continue throughout its existence mootness.quoting henry monaghan,constitutional adjudication the who and when,yale.thus,chong must show that she has suffered,or is threatened with,an actual injury traceable to the ins that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.see lewis,at.
even when a litigant is unable to meet the requirements of the general mootness inquiry,the litigant may invoke an exception to the mootness doctrine to gain judicial review.there are four exceptions to the mootness doctrine,so that a court will not dismiss a case as moot if secondary or collateral injuries survive after resolution of the primary injury the issue is deemed a wrong capable of repetition yet evading review the defendant voluntarily ceases an allegedly illegal practice but is free to resume it at any time or it is a properly certified class action suit.artway attorney of,cir.in this case,chong contends that her petition presents a live case or controversy under the general mootness inquiry.alternatively,chong argues that sufficient collateral consequences flow from the board order of removal so that even though the ins already has deported her,we may entertain her appeal.
the supreme court has explained that an incarcerated convict or a parolee challenge to the validity of his conviction always satisfies the requirement,because the incarceration or the restriction imposed by the terms of the parole constitutes a concrete injury,caused by the conviction and redressable by invalidation of the conviction.spencer kemna,d.however,after the convict sentence expires,some concrete and continuing injury other than the incarceration or collateral consequence of the exist if the suit is to be maintained.id.
in spencer,the supreme court held that insufficient collateral consequences resulted from the petitioner parole revocation to avoid mootness.id.at.in so holding,the court criticized precedent that presumed the existence of collateral consequences and that accepted the most generalized and hypothetical of consequences as sufficient to avoid mootness.id.at.in particular,the court criticized its decision in sibron new york,d,where the court held that the mere possibility of adverse collateral consequences is sufficient to preclude a finding of mootness.id.at.citation omitted.nevertheless,the spencer court did not overrule sibron,instead distinguishing it by noting that although a court may presume collateral consequences in the context of a criminal conviction,the same can not be said of parole revocation.at.
this court interpreted spencer collateral consequences analysis in steele blackman,where the ins deported the petitioner after he filed a habeas petition seeking reversal of the board determination that his drug convictions amounted to an aggravated felony.at.in holding that the petitioner alleged facts sufficient to show a continuing injury and serious collateral consequences,we stated 
erroneous conviction of an aggravated felony will have several continuing and serious legal consequences for the petitioner,including serving as a permanent bar preventing his return to the united states to visit his family.see a a supp.ii imposing a permanent bar on admissibility for aggravated felons.a determination that the petitioner conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony would alleviate many of these collateral effects.
we hold that sufficient collateral consequences flow from the board order of removal to make chong appeal a live case or controversy under article iii.spencer rejects chong claim that the board order of removal creates sufficient collateral consequences by rendering her ineligible to return to the united states due to possible prosecution for felonious entry since chong is indeed required by prevent such a possibility from occurring.spencer,at.quoting lane williams,d.however,the ina provides,in relevant part,that an alien who has been ordered removed and who seeks admission within years of the date of such alien departure or removal is inadmissible.a a ii.thus,the board order of removal creates sufficient collateral consequences to render chong petition a live case or controversy by preventing her from entering the united states for ten years.see tapia garcia ins,cir holding that the deportee inability to reenter and reside legally in the united states with his family is a collateral consequence of his deportation because it is clearly imposed as a matter of law reno,cir,vacated on other grounds,d holding that the alien deportation did not render his habeas petition moot because he can not be admitted into the united states within ten years of the date of his removal.but see united states mercurris,cir holding moot the deportee habeas petition challenging the district court finding that his marijuana convictions rendered him an aggravated felon since the deportee controlled substance conviction prohibited him from entering the united states in the following ten years,regardless of his alleged status as an aggravated felon diaz duckworth,cir holding that the petitioner deportation mooted his habeas petition seeking reinstatement of credit and stating,in dicta,that w hatever is left of sibron is too little for a deportee to invoke,even if the deportee is complaining about a conviction,and not a parole revocation,like spencer,or a prison disciplinary sanction,like diaz hose ins,cir en banc holding that the deportation of the alien rendered her habeas petition seeking a stay of deportation moot.
we recognize that steele does not necessarily compel our holding because of the different factual scenarios presented.in steele,the petitioner challenged the board determination that he committed an aggravated felony.at.the ina bars aggravated felons from entering the united states for ten years.a a ii.thus,a determination that the steele petitioner conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony could allow the petitioner to reenter the united states.
by contrast,chong does not contest the board finding that she committed an aggravated felony.therefore,the board unchallenged finding that chong committed an aggravated felony would bar chong from reentering the united states.moreover,if we reversed the board finding that chong committed a particularly serious crime,it seemingly would be too late for the attorney general to withhold removal,since chong already has been deported.nevertheless,we suppose that,were we to reverse the board decision,the attorney general could exercise his discretion and grant withholding of removal and allow chong to reenter the united states.accordingly,we hold that chong inability to reenter the united states for ten years after her deportation is a sufficient collateral consequence stemming from the board order of removal to render chong petition justiciable under article iii.
b.the merits 
turning to the merits of the appeal,chong argues that the board violated her due process rights,the ina,and ins regulations.we address these arguments in turn.
did the board actions comply with due process 
chong claims that the board violated her due process rights by not giving her notice that it would decide whether she committed a particularly serious crime without remanding to the ij and by not providing her with an opportunity to be heard on the particularly serious crime issue.we review de novo whether the board violated chong due process rights.see ins,cir.
aliens facing removal are entitled to due process.chlomos united states dep t of justice,ins,cir.the supreme court has observed 
we are dealing here with procedural requirements prescribed for the protection of the alien.though deportation is not technically a criminal proceeding,it visits a great hardship on the individual and deprives him of the right to stay and live and work in this land of freedom.that deportation is a times a most serious be doubted.meticulous care must be exercised lest the procedure by which he is deprived of that liberty not meet the essential standards of fairness.
bridges wixon.the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d citation omitted.specifically,due process requires that chong be entitled to factfinding based on a record produced before the board and disclosed to her be allowed to make arguments on her own behalf and have the right to an individualized determination of her interests.see abdulai ashcroft,cir.
chong contends that the board violated her due process rights by affirming the ij decision without remanding to the ij for an individualized hearing.we disagree.an individual due process right to be heard does not ensure a hearing in all contexts,as such a requirement would grind judicial and administrative gears to a screeching halt.elliott kiesewetter,cir.instead,administrative bodies can preserve an individual due process right to be heard in many different ways.id.
in this case,chong received a live hearing before the ij,at which point she was afforded the opportunity to argue that her drug convictions did not rise to the level of particularly serious crimes,and to present evidence to the ij supporting her position.the ij created a record of the proceedings,which was then transmitted to the board for review.in deciding that chong had committed a particularly serious crime,the board looked at the specific facts of chong in the individualized determination that abdulai than blindly following a categorical rule,that all drug convictions qualify as particularly serious crimes.at.due process requires no more.see id.at see also ladha ins,cir holding that once an alien receives a full and fair hearing in front of an ij,due process is satisfied.
holding otherwise would give chong the proverbial second bite at the apple.once an alien has had a chance to offer evidence and raise arguments on the particularly serious crime issue during a removal proceeding,we can see no persuasive reason for requiring that she receive a second hearing on the question.nor do we think that due process necessitates such a redundant procedural measure.
chong also argues that the board violated her due process rights by not giving her the opportunity to submit evidence to the board.in fact,the board did not prevent chong from submitting evidence relevant to the particularly serious crime analysis.however,since chong believed that the board would remand her case to the ij for a hearing,chong did not submit any evidence to the board.perhaps the board should have provided notice to chong that it would decide the particularly serious crime issue without remanding to the ij,thereby indicating to chong that she should submit any evidence she wished to be considered.but the board failure to provide notice to chong does not constitute a due process violation.chong had the opportunity to present any evidence concerning the particularly serious crime determination to the ij,and the board had the administrative record before it when deciding chong appeal.this procedure satisfies due process.see abdulai,at see also ladha,at holding that once an alien receives a full and fair hearing in front of an ij,due process is satisfied.
did the board err in interpreting the ina 
chong argues that the board violated b b by not granting her an individualized hearing to determine whether she committed a particularly serious crime.we accord chevron deference to the board interpretation of the ina.ins,d.our inquiry,therefore,is limited to determining whether the ina is silent or ambiguous with respect to what constitutes a particularly serious crime,and,if so,whether the board answer is based on a permissible construction of b b.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
the ina is silent concerning how the board should determine whether an alien has committed a particularly serious crime when a court has convicted the alien of an aggravated felony for which the court sentenced the alien to less than five years imprisonment.the statute simply notes that the attorney general is not precluded from determining that,notwithstanding the length of sentence imposed,an alien has been convicted of a particularly serious crime.b b.in other words,where a court has sentenced an alien to less than five years for an aggravated felony,the statute grants the attorney general discretion to determine whether that alien has committed a particularly serious crime.
the board has explained that when determining whether a crime is particularly serious,
consideration of the individual facts and circumstances is appropriate this inquiry does not involve an examination of the respondents family or community ties,or the risk of persecution in the alien native country.to make this determination,we look to the conviction records and sentencing information.
further,we do not engage in a retrial of the alien criminal case or go behind the record of conviction to redetermine the alien innocence or guilt.
in re,interim decision,wl bia.as this language demonstrates,in re simply requires that an individualized examination or determination of the particularly serious crime issue be conducted,not that an individualized hearing be held.we conclude that the board interpretation of b b is reasonable because it guides and channels the attorney general discretion to determine whether an alien like chong has committed a particularly serious crime,thereby helping to ensure that the attorney general does not make this determination in an arbitrary or inconsistent manner.
moreover,we conclude that the board interpretation of b b as necessitating only an individualized examination of the particularly serious crime issue,rather than an individualized hearing,is a permissible one.as we noted supra in part,when an alien already has been provided the opportunity to mount arguments and present evidence on the particularly serious crime question during a live removal hearing,due process does not require a second hearing on the issue.all that the constitution mandates is an individualized determination,which the board construction affords.abdulai,at.thus,we reject chong argument that the board violated b b.
to the extent that chong contends that the board violated its precedent by not conducting an individualized determination of her case,we disagree.in fact,the board did conduct an independent determination of the facts and circumstances of chong case.the board noted that although chong sentence was below the term that requires an aggravated felony to be considered a per se particularly serious crime,the district court departed from the minimum sentence due to chong assistance to the ins.the board stated this is different from a sentence reduction due to a minor role in the offense or other mitigating factors.the board examined the complaint against chong and asserted that over several years,chong handled money derived from selling drugs and arranged telephonic connections for people involved in the conspiracy to promote the distribution of large amounts of heroin.this examination of the record and sentencing information is all that board precedent requires.
did the board violate ins regulations 
finally,chong claims that the board violated of the ins regulations.in this case,the ij certified his decision to the board.when an ij knows at the time he issues a decision that he will certify the case to
