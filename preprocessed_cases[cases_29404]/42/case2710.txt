noel malonga,a native and citizen of the republic of the congo the congo,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying withholding of removal.he claims past persecution and a clear probability of persecution upon return on account of his ethnicity and political opinion.we grant the petition for review and remand for reconsideration of whether he faces a clear probability of persecution based on political opinion.
factual background 
in malonga mukasey,cir malonga i,we described the basic facts of this case.we now revisit the factual background,first summarizing the relevant documentary evidence concerning the various regimes and conflicts in the congo and then recounting the basis of malonga claim.
situation in the congo 
the record paints the congo as a country dominated by a series of totalitarian regimes punctuated,particularly in recent years,by violent conflict.in,marien ngouabi led a military coup and held the presidency until his assassination in.in,denis became president,which according to state department reports,launched two decades of turbulent,politics bolstered by rhetoric.is a northerner of mbochi ethnicity.
in the,the country ostensibly transitioned to a multiparty democracy,but political stability remained elusive.numerous opposition political parties were formed at the time,including the mouvement congolaise pour la démocratie et le dévélopment intégral congolese mouvement for democracy and integral development,hereinafter mcddi.in,southerner pascal lissouba was elected president.violent civil unrest subsequently broke out in june and november over the results of hotly disputed legislative elections.risk of insurrection subsided after the parties accepted the decision of an international board of arbiters in february.lissouba attempted to eliminate faction as the country headed for a new round of elections in,igniting four months of civil war.eventually seized the presidency,toppling the lissouba government.
fighting between forces loyal to and several southern rebel groups engulfed the country in.the rebel militias included the cocoyes,who supported lissouba,and the ninjas,who are of mostly lari ethnicity and were affiliated with bernard kolelas the founder of the mcddi.the conflicts were largely concentrated in the south,including the pool region surrounding the capital of brazzaville.
civilians found themselves caught in the crossfire,subjected to both indiscriminate violence and instances of deliberate brutality by all factions.undisciplined troops and security forces associated with the government reportedly detained,beat,raped,disappeared,and killed civilians,arbitrarily searched homes,and engaged in widespread looting.government were also known to single out individuals,mostly southern men,for arrest and even death on suspicion that they supported the ninjas or the cocoyes.the record paints the rebels as little better.militias,particularly the ninjas and other groups based in the southern pool region,executed civilians thought to back the government based on their ethnicity.the militias of the lari ethnic group reportedly looted property,raped women,and killed civilians,even members of their own ethnicity.in all,the war left nearly a third of the population displaced and thousands dead.
the government signed a cease fire with most rebel groups in late,leading to a measure of calm.for example,the state department observed in its country conditions report that it had received no accounts of government violence toward southern ethnic groups in the previous year and that politically motivated disappearances and killings also ceased.lissouba and kolelas themselves were effectively forced into exile and tried in absentia for war crimes.
state department country conditions reports and other articles in the record acknowledge the conflicts exhibited ethnic overtones,and other courts have recognized many of the recent conflicts to be in nature.see passi mukasey,cir noting,for example,that brazzaville and the pool region exhibited what appeared to be some of the most severe ethnic and political violence mapouya gonzales,cir strong ethnic overtones are present in congolese politics,and the civil war was no different.documentary evidence suggests that political and the most significant tension has split roughly along geographical lines,pitting northerners against the more prosperous southerners.state department reports,however,also caution against oversimplifying the unrest,and politics more generally,as north versus south.each,lissouba,and drawn heavy support from his own ethnic group in his immediate entourage.nevertheless,the reports advise that the correspondence between and political cleavages was inexact and only approximate,and that actual support of the current and recent governments included persons from a broad range of ethnic and regional backgrounds.
in,the latest year represented in the record,media reports documented renewed conflict in southern congo between government forces and the ninjas following reelection.the ninjas attacked government military posts in the pool region,allegedly responding to government plots to arrest the militia leader.civilians were once again swept up in the fighting and suffered abuses by both sides,though particularly by the government,including killings,rapes,abductions,looting,and other destruction of property.
malonga claims 
malonga is a native of the southern pool region,and is of lari ethnicity,a subgroup of the larger kongo tribe.the kongo account for approximately percent of the country population and constitute the main tribal group in the south.the lari group can be identified by accent,dialect,and surname and are concentrated geographically in the pool region.
malonga is or has been a member of several political groups and parties although several of malonga affiliations coincide with his roots,the record also suggests a broader,motivation behind his nearly four decades of opposition to the regimes of three different presidents.
in,at age fourteen,malonga participated in a demonstration against the ngouabi regime.according to malonga,who was then the of the armed forces,sent the military to disperse the protest.soldiers beat malonga as they broke up the demonstration and he suffered injuries that required hospital treatment and left scars on his legs and back.in,malonga joined in a second demonstration but escaped unharmed when the military again responded violently.
the next incident occurred in,when malonga claims police broke up an political meeting he had attended.he was detained for hours without food or water and was beaten,which caused him to bleed from his mouth.malonga claims to have been released by a police inspector who knew his father.malonga also claims to have suffered severe headaches afterward,for which he sought treatment in and.
following graduation from university in,malonga went to work for the government,which by then was headed by.he testified a government job was his only option as a degree holder.he apparently retained a government post through the transition to the lissouba regime until his departure in.
in,while a director of a farm,malonga ordered his employees to strike as part of a larger strike against the government.malonga alleges that he was immediately demoted as punishment,transferred back to brazzaville,and forced to sit at a desk with nothing to do.
politics liberalized not long after,and malonga joined and became active in the mcddi party.when the lissouba government proved repressive,malonga in an demonstration organized by the mcddi and other opposition groups in june.soldiers dispersed the protest with gunfire,killing four people.malonga suffered some bruising in the resulting rush but was not seriously injured.he maintains lissouba forces came looking for him later that night,prompting him to run from his home in the diata district of brazzaville,which he states was a stronghold of lissouba supporters.when the soldiers could not find him,they marked his house with an x,allegedly indicating that it should be destroyed.they also wrote we will have your skin,which malonga interpreted as a death threat.malonga subsequently experienced death threats from lissouba supporters at work.
malonga had received a scholarship to continue his education in the united states the year before and was preparing to depart around this time.a superior of a northern ethnicity refused to sign his departure papers,referring to the kongo and the mcddi as troublemakers and telling malonga,you have to stay here in the country to face the consequences of what you are doing.malonga claims his departure was delayed until he was able to obtain permission from a member of his own tribe and who came from the same geographical region,outside the authorized channels.he entered the united states as an exchange visitor in august.he completed his masters degree in.
sometime in,after malonga arrival in the united states,his house in brazzaville was destroyed and his possessions were looted.as described above,civil conflict stemming from disputed elections had broken out in recent months.malonga claims lissouba supporters targeted his home as well as the homes of other pool natives.
malonga subsequently lost contact with his family during the conflicts of the mid to late.he testified that his wife and child disappeared in and that he believes his parents are dead.specifically,malonga testified that his father was shot in,and a letter from his brother confirms their father died in brazzaville in early.he also believes his family was targeted because of ethnicity or because of his political activities.
malonga testified that he fears returning to the congo because he believes he would be arrested and potentially executed by the government.he avers that the kongo have suffered and continue to face persecution,particularly at the hands of and the current government.he also believes he would be a target because of his political affiliations and activities and has stated that he would continue to press for democracy if returned.
procedural background 
in september,the bia affirmed the immigration judge ij decision denying malonga petition for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.malonga petitioned this court for review.in malonga i,we denied the petition in part and granted it in part.we held that we lacked jurisdiction to review the ij determination that malonga asylum application was untimely filed.at.we also denied the petition as to cat relief because the record did not compel a conclusion contrary to the agency.id.at.
we granted the petition and vacated the bia decision as to withholding of removal.first,we held that the ij had applied an incorrect legal standard in defining past persecution and remanded for findings under the appropriate standard.id.at.second,we addressed the ij finding that the lari ethnic group of the larger kongo tribe was not a particular social group because the kongo constitute a substantial minority of the population.id.at.applying the standard adopted by the bia in in re acosta,bia,and in re,bia,we held that the lari group of the kongo tribe could constitute a particular social group.malonga i,at.
on remand for the claim,the bia dismissed the appeal.it observed that the size of the kongo tribe was important to its consideration of his claim.it further noted that malonga had mainly testified that his problems were due to his political involvement and the region where he was from,where the lari were located.it also stated that he had largely failed to differentiate between problems he suffered because of his political activities and those due to his ethnicity.consequently,the bia determined that malonga politics appeared intertwined with his ethnic identity.as discussed further below,the bia implicitly assumed that malonga was credible but concluded nonetheless that he did not suffer past persecution.specifically,it found that the mistreatment he suffered did not rise to the level of persecution and,alternatively,that most incidents,particularly those in the,did not occur on account of a protected ground.the bia also held that he did not establish a clear probability of future persecution.
we review the bia decision as the final agency action.see kebede gonzales,cir per curiam.however,to the extent the bia adopted the reasoning of the ij,we will consider both the bia and ij opinions.see rafiyev mukasey,cir.we evaluate questions of law de novo and afford substantial deference to the bia interpretation of immigration law and regulations.cherichel holder,cir.we consider administrative findings of fact under the deferential standard.miah mukasey,cir.we will not overturn an agency decision unless the petitioner demonstrates that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it.bracic holder,cir quotation omitted.
the attorney general must grant withholding of removal if malonga proves his life or freedom would be threatened in the congo on account of one of five protected grounds,including political opinion or social group.b a beck mukasey,cir.if malonga establishes that he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground,he is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.b i beck,at.without a showing of past persecution,malonga must independently demonstrate a clear probability of future persecution to obtain withholding of removal.beck,at.the standard is more onerous than the standard of asylum.ladyha holder,cir.in the absence of a statutory definition for persecution,we have held that it is an extreme concept that involves the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom,on account of a protected characteristic.sholla gonzales,cir.
past persecution 
malonga first argues that the bia failed to consider all incidents of past mistreatment.it is well established that the bia need not list every possible positive and negative factor in its decision and has no duty to write an exegesis on every contention,averianova holder,cir quotation omitted.the agency is only required to consider the issues raised,and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted,cir quotation omitted.the bia did not identify or discuss all individual events,including malonga demotion,the threat we will have your skin,and the purported death threats at work.we nonetheless conclude that it recognized and considered the breadth of malonga claim.the opinion recitation of facts suggests that the bia generally understood that the claim comprised both threats as well as actual harm to malonga,his belongings,and his relatives.ngengwe.mukasey,cir remanding for further analysis where the agency did not fully consider the actions of the petitioner alleged persecutors.the bia also stated that it considered malonga problems in the congo in the aggregate,suggesting that the bia reflected upon more than the specific examples it called out in its analysis and indicating it reviewed the cumulative effect of the mistreatment.see,at affirming the denial of relief in part where the opinion showed the agency considered the petitioner contentions cumulatively.
malonga next asserts that the record compels the conclusion that he endured past persecution.upon careful consideration of the record,we disagree.taken as a whole,we can not say the record shows more than periodic instances of mistreatment that do not rise to the level of persecution and other incidents that can not be clearly connected to a protected ground.
the bia specifically held that the beatings and detention in the did not rise to the level of persecution,and we can not say the record conclusively establishes the contrary.limited detentions,even lasting two or three days,do not typically amount to persecution.see eusebio ashcroft,cir.although the beatings and injuries malonga suffered are not insignificant,the presence of physical harm does not require a finding of past persecution.tawm ashcroft,cir.it is also important to consider whether an act of violence is an isolated occurrence,or part of a continuing effort to persecute on the basis of a factor enumerated in the statute.generally speaking,evidence of isolated violence does not compel a finding of persecution.ngure ashcroft,cir.here,each instance of physical abuse was relatively isolated,occurring immediately after malonga participation in political demonstrations,and both occurred more than a decade before the next instance of mistreatment.therefore,these incidents do not reflect an ongoing effort to seek out malonga out for harm on account of a protected ground.equally as important,malonga remained in the congo for sixteen years following the last incident,without further physical abuse or injury and with the ability to pursue an education and a career with relatively little interference for a number of years.these factors cut against a finding of persecution.see quomsieh gonzales,cir holding no past persecution where the petitioner endured a detention and beating that resulted in cracked knee joint but remained in the country thirteen more years without similar incident kondakova ashcroft,cir observing the fact that petitioner remained in the country for a year and finished her education following alleged kidnapping of her daughter weighed against a finding of past persecution.
we conclude the remaining mistreatment malonga endured before leaving the congo is also insufficiently severe,either alone or in combination,to compel a finding of persecution.malonga does not allege that the demotion prevented him from earning a living or even caused economic hardship to support a conclusion of economic persecution.see makatengkeng gonzales,cir discussing economic persecution.further,his forced idleness at work,while likely demoralizing,does not amount to mental or emotional persecution,as he argues.see shoaira aschcroft,cir considering psychological damage as persecution.
likewise,the threats malonga experienced following the demonstration do not require a finding of past persecution.assuming the warning we will have your skin is properly considered a threat of death,threats that are exaggerated,or lacking in immediacy,as this was,do not support a finding of persecution.corado ashcroft,cir holding that a single specific,credible,and immediate death threat on account of political opinion could constitute persecution see also ladyha,at holding no past persecution despite the fact that assailants threatened petitioner at knifepoint and stated they would show him who was king of the city.furthermore,malonga has failed to point to any detail concerning the death threats at work,and such vague descriptions are insufficient to necessitate reversal.notably,despite the various threats and his superior hostility toward his ethnic and political groups,malonga was able to leave the country not long after with the government knowledge.he has also not alleged that any of these threats caused him to flee the congo rather,he arrived in the united states,more or less as scheduled,to complete a course of study.these considerations weigh against a finding of persecution.see alanwoko mukasey,cir observing that petitioner was not fleeing persecution on arrival in the united states,which contributed to a finding of no past persecution.
finally,the record does not compel the conclusion that the events occurring after malonga left the congo were on account of a protected ground.it is well established that h arm arising from general conditions such as anarchy,civil war,or mob violence will not ordinarily support a claim of persecution.mohamed ashcroft,cir.to warrant relief,the applicant bears the burden of providing some evidence that the persecutors were motivated to harm him,at least in part,on account of a protected ground.id.at see also hassan ashcroft,cir.therefore,the harm suffered must be particularized to the individual rather than suffered by the entire population.mohamed,at.the fact that the mistreatment occurred during conflicts that can be broadly categorized as political or ethnic in nature does not establish the requisite particularized persecution.see id.at see also quomsieh,at feleke,cir.
regarding the destruction of his home during the unrest,malonga points to his assertions that lissouba supporters targeted his home and the homes of other pool natives and to a statement in his mother letter that lissouba forces came looking for him after he left.this evidence not so compelling as to disturb the bia finding.see,mohamed,at observing the only evidence that the petitioner was persecuted on account of clan membership was the petitioner testimony,when attack occurred at height of civil war,country reports indicated endemic banditry,and the petitioner testified that alleged persecutors attacked anyone in neighborhood thought to have money and valuables quomsieh,at tan attn y,app x,cir unpublished petitioner unsupported claim that mistreatment was on account of a protected ground did not compel a conclusion contrary to the ij finding that incidents were common crimes ombongi gonzales,cir recognizing that some property damage is necessarily collateral to widespread ethnic conflicts.rather,we conclude that several factors support the agency conclusion.first,only an attenuated temporal connection exists between this event and his most recent political activities a minimum of several months passed between his participation in the demonstration,the marking of his home for destruction and the alleged threats,and the actual demolition of his home.second,malonga was not in the country during this period and the letters from family or friends relating the incident years later do not attribute the attack to lissouba forces specifically or state that forces singled out his home or those of others like him in terms of politics or ethnicity.although,as noted above,his mother states lissouba forces were looking for him at one time,a close read of the record indicates this was after his home had been destroyed.third,some of these letters also indicate the district where his home was located was hard hit in general and malonga has acknowledged that whole areas of brazzaville were destroyed during the unrest.the record contains little other objective description of the conflicts,and none that supports malonga claims as to who destroyed his home and why.
nor can we clearly connect the disappearances and deaths of malonga family members during the conflicts of the late to a protected ground.acts of violence against family members on account of a protected basis may demonstrate persecution if they show a pattern of persecution tied to the petitioner.vonhm gonzales,cir quotation omitted.malonga now asserts that government forces murdered his father on account of a protected ground,but all the record shows is that his father was shot and died of his injuries.malonga affidavit acknowledges that his father death occurred during the context of the civil war in which thousands died,and the record demonstrates all factions in the conflicts committed serious abuses.no clear evidence otherwise ties this unfortunate event to ethnicity or to malonga political opinion.these facts do not justify reversing the bia.
clear probability of future persecution 
the bia also held that malonga did not face a clear probability of persecution on account of his ethnicity or his political opinion if returned to the congo.it stated in part 
while there is ongoing conflict in the congo,the respondent previous problems occurred many years ago and there is little evidence that there is any ongoing interest in the respondent either due to his ethnicity or his political activities.the respondent has failed to show any particularized fear or that his group,the lari,face a pattern and practice of persecution in the congo.
malonga first objects to the bia reference to fear in its discussion of future persecution,claiming the bia conflated the partially subjective analysis for asylum,see cubillos holder,cir,with the entirely objective one for withholding of removal,see.we review de novo whether the bia applied an erroneous legal standard.see makonnen,cir.although the bia might have been more precise in its articulation of the analysis,we are not convinced this alone warrants reversal.looking at the analysis as a whole,we read the bia statement to mean that malonga failed to show he will be singled out for persecution.the bia recited the clear probability standard for withholding of removal within the same paragraph and nothing else about the analysis suggests that the bia actually required malonga to prove a subjective element to warrant relief.even if the bia had improperly required him to do so,malonga testified that he did have such a subjective fear,and no one has questioned his credibility on this point.
further,the record does not compel the conclusion that malonga will more likely than not suffer persecution strictly on account of his ethnicity.none of the evidence malonga points to rebuts the bia observations that any problems he experienced because of his ethnicity happened a long time ago and that there is little evidence of the government interest in him on account of that ground.additionally,malonga has not articulated to this court any other reasons he would be singled out on account of his ethnicity separate from those due to political opinion,which he acknowledges is the more important of his two claims.
nor can we say this record compels the conclusion that the lari as whole face a pattern and practice of persecution.see b i ii.malonga suggests that we must infer that the lari face a pattern and practice of persecution because the kongo,the larger ethnic group to which they belong,constitute the main ethnic group in the regions where much of the fighting occurred between southern rebels and the government.to that end,the record clearly shows that civilians in the southern regions of the congo experienced significant,widespread abuses during the unrest of the and in.what is largely lacking from this record,however,is evidence of a persecutory motive behind most of these acts.we heed the state department advice against oversimplifying these conflicts and decline to assume one.statements in the various reports and articles indicate forces targeted some degree of violence at southern ethnic groups.none of these statements,however,identify the ethnicity of the victims as lari.more fundamentally,to establish a pattern and practice the persecution of the group must be systemic,pervasive,or organized.tolego gonzales,cir quotation omitted.the record does not demonstrate that the lari endured persecution during the conflicts or otherwise to the extent necessary to meet this high standard,even in light of specific instances of past mistreatment that malonga cites.
that said,the bia analysis regarding the probability of future persecution based on political opinion troubles us for two reasons.first,we can not tell from its opinion whether it considered malonga political activities after he left the congo.second,we think the bia pattern and practice analysis as to the lari fails to account for the risks malonga argues he would face as an actual or imputed political dissident.
in considering whether malonga will be singled out for persecution,the bia makes no mention of his continued membership in political groups in the congo or his involvement with additional expatriate political organizations while residing in the united states.although the ij recognized some of these affiliations,neither the ij nor the bia analyzed the nature or level of malonga participation in the various groups since his departure or if his current activities might put him at risk.given this,and reading the bia opinion as a whole,we interpret the bia observation that there is little evidence there is ongoing interest in him on account of his political activities as a conclusion based on past events.further,if malonga establishes that these activities have or are likely to draw the attention of persecutors,the bia observation that most of his problems happened years ago is of little consequence.because we can not determine from the agency analysis whether it recognized and considered these issues,remand for further consideration is appropriate.see,at noting agency must sufficiently show it considered issued raised myat thu att y,cir remanding when the ij failed to consider material documentary evidence relevant to a fear due to petitioner political activities outside native country woldu ashcroft,app x,cir unpublished per curiam remanding for reconsideration of a fear where the ij and bia failed to address relevant evidence and the ij relied on past treatment in native country to find no future persecution.we express no opinion as to whether these affiliations and activities warrant relief.
closely related is our concern that the bia failed to include political dissidents in its pattern and practice analysis.the bia simply held that the lari did not face such a pattern and practice.we understand malonga to argue that this analysis is insufficient for two reasons.first,it fails to account for the fact that he has been an actual political dissident,who,he claims,the record demonstrates face a substantial risk of persecution.second,he argues that he runs a separate risk of having a political opinion imputed to him because he is a lari from the pool region,whose residents are often assumed to oppose the government.regarding the latter,malonga points,for example,to the fact that during the conflicts,police executed five men whose identity cards indicated they came from the pool and were assumed to be members of the ninjas or cocoyes militias.he also draws our attention to a letter from his brother recounting reports that men of fighting age in the pool were being summarily executed.this evidence tends to show,to some degree,the persecution of individuals imputed to be political opponents of the government and its allies.it additionally suggests that individuals like malonga,particularly in terms of geographic ties,have been labeled as such and persecuted if the evidence does not compel the conclusion that the lari as a whole face a pattern and practice of persecution.
the attorney general counters that the bia concluded malonga ethnicity and political opinion claims were intertwined and so properly considered the lari as both the relevant ethnic and political group for purposes of the pattern and practice analysis.we think collapsing the analysis in this manner was inappropriate given the complex issues surrounding malonga political opinion claim.the pattern and practice analysis as we see it takes no account of malonga actual political activities or his many political affiliations,not all of which clearly coincide with his ethnicity.we also think the analysis does not account for the more subtle issue of imputed political opinion.we remand for further consideration in light of these concerns.see hailemichael gonzales,cir remanding when the ij failed to articulate reasoning sufficient to permit review makonnen,at remanding in part because the agency only considered whether the petitioner would suffer persecution on account of ethnic group,and not political group,where the two were closely related and it was likely that petitioner would not articulate a clear distinction between the two see also ayele holder,cir remanding where the ij failed to fully consider the petitioner family group claim,and if it did,improperly required evidence that the petitioner would be singled out.
for the reasons stated above,we grant the petition for review,vacate the bias holdings regarding a clear probability future persecution on account of political opinion,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.the bia should consider malonga current political activities and affiliations would cause him to be singled out for persecution.it should also consider whether a pattern and practice of persecution exists as to actual and imputed political dissidents,and whether malonga as a lari from the pool who has been an active political opponent of several regimes,is similarly situated to those individuals.on remand,the bia is free to supplement the record with more current materials regarding country conditions in the congo.
the court convincingly explains why the record does not compel a conclusion that noel malonga suffered past persecution on a protected ground,that he faces a clear probability of future persecution based on his ethnicity,or that there is a patt
