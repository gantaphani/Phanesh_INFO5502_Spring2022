petitioner harbi mohamad ismat hassan hassan seeks review of a final order from the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge decision to deny hassan claims for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act ina and relief under the convention against torture cat in his petition,hassan asserts that the immigration judge ij erred on several grounds.moreover,hassan argues that the bia improperly applied its streamlining regulations in affirming the ij decision without opinion.upon review,we conclude that none of hassan arguments are persuasive,and therefore we deny the petition for review.
background 
hassan is a palestinian who is a native of lebanon.he was born and raised in the palestinian refugee camp located in said,lebanon.he lived in the camp with his family,including his parents,six brothers,and three sisters.at his removal hearing,hassan testified that while living in the refugee camp,he joined hamas,which he claims is commonly known in the united states as the palestine liberation organization plo.hassan explained that he joined because his financial situation was very bad and the plo paid for his college tuition.joint appendix at,removal hr g tr.at.as a member of the plo,hassan worked as a driver and message courier.he stated that he never carried weapons.at removal hr g tr.at.
during his time in the refugee camp,hassan was approached by a radical and more violent organization,known as sabri al bamma pet.br.at.hassan testified that the group was organizing young men that were between the ages of and so they could be active with operations that were against the peace movement,like having the demonstrations and they wanted to train him to use weapons.at removal hr g tr.at.after he refused to join the group,hassan asserts that members of sabri al bamma threatened his life.specifically,hassan explained that sabri al bamma had murdered a plo official,for whom hassan worked,and the official wife.a member of sabri al bamma referred to the murder of the plo official and told hassan you are not as important as the guy that was in charge,so if you refuse to join with us,what happened to him will happen to you.at removal hr g tr.at.shortly thereafter,a company came to hassan school and offered him an opportunity to leave lebanon and come work in the united states.hassan paid for the trip by using money from a communal neighborhood fund.hassan testified that he did not tell his neighbors that he was coming to the united states,but instead told them that he needed the money for school because the expenses were very high in beirut.at removal hr g tr.at.
on july,hassan was admitted into the united states as a nonimmigrant exchange visitor authorized to stay until october.on february,the immigration and naturalization service ins served hassan with a notice to appear,charging him with being present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,in violation of a b of the ina,a b.at the removal hearing,hassan conceded his unlawful status,but requested asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat.in support of his request,hassan asserted that sabri al bamma was still looking for him and if he were ever to return to lebanon,he would be killed.on july,the ij heard hassan claims and denied his request.specifically,the ij found hassan testimony to be incredible based on several inconsistencies between his testimony,the asylum application,and the documents he submitted as evidence.moreover,the ij held that,even if the testimony was credible,hassan would not be entitled to relief because being wanted by a terrorist group in lebanon is not protected by the asylum laws of the country and it certainly does provide a basis for seeking withholding pursuant to the torture convention.at ij decision order at.hassan filed a timely notice of appeal to the bia setting forth his reasons and indicating he would file a separate written brief despite receiving an extension of the deadline,hassan brief was not filed timely,and therefore was not considered by the bia.at bia rejection of brief.on october,the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion pursuant to e.hassan now petitions this court for review of the denial of his asylum,withholding of removal,and cat claims.
ii.analysis 
appellate jurisdiction 
before proceeding to the merits of hassan claims,we must first address this court jurisdiction to entertain his petition for review.pursuant to a of the ina,we have jurisdiction to review the bia decision affirming an ij denial of asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat.ina a a.section d states,however,that a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.ina d d.we have stated that this requirement is jurisdictional,and thus where a petitioner has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,a federal court is without jurisdiction to consider his petition for review.perkovic ins,cir the government argues in its brief that we lack jurisdiction over hassan petition for review of the ij decision because hassan failed to file timely his brief with the bia,and therefore did not exhaust all administrative remedies.because the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion rather than summarily dismissing hassan appeal,we conclude the government argument is unconvincing.
it is well established that the bia may summarily dismiss any appeal or portion of any appeal in any case in which t he party concerned fails to specify the reasons for the appeal on the notices of appeal or other document filed therewith.d i a.the purpose of the rule is to ensure that the alien provide meaningful guidance to the bia by informing the bia of the precise issues contested on appeal.this specificity requirement may be satisfied in one of two ways by setting out the reasons on the notice of appeal itself or by filing a separate brief.ashcroft,cir internal quotation omitted emphasis added.the alien is not required to file a separate written brief,but instead may rely entirely upon the factual or legal basis stated in the notice of appeal where the bia has dismissed an appeal for failure to satisfy the specificity requirement,administrative remedies are unexhausted and a court has no jurisdiction to review the ij decision.sswajje ashcroft,cir.
in this case,hassan timely filed a notice of appeal to the bia from the ij decision,which outlined five specific grounds.see supra note.he then filed an untimely brief in support of his appeal.the bia did not take the brief into consideration,but affirmed the ij decision without opinion under e.the procedure is not a dismissal,but instead a review of the merits of an appeal.see denko ins,cir noting that cases receive full consideration from the bia.by affirming the ij decision without opinion under e rather than summarily dismissing it under d a,the bia found that hassan had satisfied the specificity requirement through his notice of appeal.furthermore,the five grounds outlined in his notice of appeal to the bia are the same arguments presented in his petition to this court.therefore,because the bia reached the merits of hassan appeal,we conclude that he properly exhausted all of his administrative remedies,and thus we have jurisdiction to entertain his petition for review.
b.the ij decision 
proceeding to the merits of hassan claims,we note that because the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency decision.denko,at.
adverse credibility finding 
the first issue which hassan raises in his petition is that the ij erred in denying his request for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat on the grounds that his testimony was incredible.we have held that c redibility determinations are considered findings of fact,and are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.sylla ins,cir.under that standard,findings of fact are treated as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.yu ashcroft,cir quoting b b.in this case,we can not say that review of the record compels a contrary result.
the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who can demonstrate an unwillingness to return to his or her home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b,a a.the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a.in this case,the sole ground for hassan asylum claim is his testimony that a member of sabri al bamma threatened to kill hassan if he did not join the organization and that sabri al bamma is still looking for him.the ij found hassan to be completely unbelievable and his testimony internally inconsistent,and thus denied his request for relief.at,ij decision order at.we have stated that though an adverse credibility finding is afforded substantial deference,the finding must be supported by specific reasons.sylla,at.moreover,we have noted that a n adverse credibility finding must be based on issues that go to the heart of the applicant claim.they can not be based on an irrelevant inconsistency.if discrepancies can not be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution,they have no bearing on credibility.id.internal quotations omitted.
in this case,the ij based his adverse credibility determination on several inconsistencies between hassan testimony,the asylum application,and the documents he submitted as evidence.first,hassan testified that sabri al bamma had murdered a plo official,for whom hassan worked,and the official wife.in support of that testimony,hassan submitted an undated newspaper article detailing the assassinations of the official and his wife.at.in his asylum application,hassan stated that the murders occurred in may.in his direct testimony at the removal hearing,however,hassan stated that the murders occurred in may,two months before he left lebanon for the united states.when asked about the inconsistency,hassan stated that it may have happened two months or fourteen months prior to his departure to the united states.the exact date of the assassinations is important because he did not join the plo until october,and thus was not working for the official in may.moreover,while the asylum application mentions the assassinations,it neglects to state that he was working for the slain official at the time of the murders.
second,the ij found hassan to be incredible based on his statements regarding his involvement with the plo.specifically,hassan testified on direct examination that he joined the plo in october because his family financial situation was bad and he needed to pay for his college education.hassan emphasized that he joined the plo not in the middle of my studies but before i started my studies.at removal hr g tr.at.the evidence revealed however that hassan started college in january,almost two years before joining the plo,directly contradicting his testimony.when asked how he afforded school before october,hassan stated at the hearing for the first time that his brothers who had emigrated to europe had paid for it,but could not do so any longer.furthermore,hassan stated that the duties he performed with the plo included driving officials and serving as a message courier,but that he never carried a weapon.his plo identity card,however,lists his rank as soldier,and a letter from the organization describes him as soldier and a loyal militant.at.hassan tried to reconcile the inconsistency by stating that the terms reflected the terminology the organization used rather than his actual responsibilities.lastly,hassan testified that when he came to the united states he used money from a community fund to pay for the trip,but he did not admit to his neighbors his plans.he told his neighbors that the money was needed for his education because expenses were very high in beirut.at removal hr g tr.at.he testified that if his neighbors knew he was leaving for the united states,he might have been prevented by the guards at the checkpoint of the refugee camp.in response to a question from the ij,hassan testified that the checkpoint is run by guards from the plo.earlier in the hearing,however,hassan stated the plo was the one that suggested he leave the country.at removal hr tr.at.
when taken together,all of these contradictions which go to the heart of hassan asylum claim lead to the conclusion that hassan is generally not credible.thus,we conclude the evidentiary record certainly does not compel a contrary credibility determination.therefore,we affirm the ij finding that hassan failed to demonstrate past persecution or a fear of future persecution moreover,given the credibility determination and because hassan has failed to establish eligibility for asylum,he can not satisfy the more stringent standards necessary for withholding of removal pursuant to ina b or relief under cat.pilica ashcroft,cir.
exclusion of evidence 
the next issue raised in the petition is that the ij erred by excluding an untimely filed letter from hassan parents,which states that members of the sabri al bamma are still looking for him.because we conclude that the exclusion of the letter did not amount to a violation of hassan right to due process,we deny relief on this ground.
in removal proceedings,an alien is entitled to a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on the alien own behalf.ina b b b b.evidentiary matters in immigration proceedings,however,are not subject to the federal rules of evidence,and we review evidentiary rulings by ijs only to determine whether such rulings have resulted in a violation of due process.singh ashcroft,cir internal citation omitted.we review alleged due process violations in removal hearings de novo.mikhailevitch ins,cir.a violation of due process occurs when the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.ladha ins,cir internal quotation omitted.
the regulations governing removal hearings state that though the ij may extend the filing deadlines,i f an application or document is not filed within the time set by the immigration judge,the opportunity to file that application or document shall be deemed waived.c.in his brief,hassan concedes that the letter was submitted after the filing deadline,but puts forth the unsupported argument that because the letter is significant,to deny it on the grounds of timeliness is an abuse of discretion.pet.br.at.the record reveals,however,that there was no good cause for failing to comply with the timing deadlines.hassan had more than eight months since he first filed his asylum application to procure the letter but did not even ask his parents for it until two weeks after the filing deadline had passed.furthermore,the significance of the letter is undercut by the fact that hassan testified to the same substantive point made in the members of sabri al bamma are continuing to look for him.compare at removal hr g tr.at with at ltr.from parents.
in sum,we conclude that hassan had a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf and the exclusion of the untimely filed letter did not violate his right to due process.
prejudgment 
hassan next argues that his right to due process was violated because the ij had prejudged the case.because we conclude that hassan argument is not supported by the record,we deny relief on this ground as well.
as we stated above,allegations of due process violations in removal hearings are reviewed de novo.mikhailevitch,at.we have stated that fifth amendment guarantees of due process extend to aliens in removal proceedings,entitling them to a full and fair hearing.ins,cir.though t he ij is afforded broad discretion to control the manner of interrogation in order to ascertain the truth,mikhailevitch,at internal quotation omitted,we recognize that a neutral judge is one of the most basic due process protections.ins,cir internal quotation omitted see also ahmed gonzales,cir it is undisputed that petitioners in such proceedings are entitled to an unbiased arbiter who has not prejudged their claims.due process is violated when the ij behave s not as a neutral interested in hearing the petitione
