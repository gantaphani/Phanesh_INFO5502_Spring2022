we consider whether a california conviction for misdemeanor child endangerment is a crime of child abuse for purposes of the federal immigration and nationality act ina.
in october,petitioner ernesto pacheco fregozo pacheco pleaded nolo contendere to one count of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and one count of child endangerment,both misdemeanors.according to the police reports officers observed pacheco car exit from a freeway at a high speed,and saw his wife,seated in the passenger seat,attempting to get the officers attention.after a short pursuit,the vehicle pulled into a high school parking lot and stopped.there,the officers observed his frightened wife and saw his two children screaming and crying in the backseat.the officers ordered pacheco from the car.after smelling alcohol on his breath and observing his demeanor,the officers suspected that pacheco was intoxicated.the children indicated that they were afraid that pacheco erratic driving would lead to a car crash.after pacheco refused field sobriety tests,he was arrested and booked on the charges of driving under the influence and child endangerment.pacheco was advised of the potential immigration consequences of a nolo plea,entered the plea as to both charges,and was sentenced to fifteen days in county jail and three years probation.
in november,the initiated removal proceedings,issuing a notice to appear that charged pacheco as removable as an alien present in the united states without having been admitted or paroled.see a a i.he appeared before an immigration judge and,through counsel,admitted the factual allegations contained in the notice to appear and conceded his removability as charged pacheco then applied for cancellation of removal pursuant to section of the ina.the government moved to pretermit the application on the ground that his misdemeanor child endangerment conviction under california penal code section b was a conviction of a crime of child abuse,rendering pacheco statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to section b c of the ina.see also a e i 
the immigration judge agreed with the government and denied pacheco application for cancellation of removal,holding that he was convicted of an offense involving child endangerment or child abuse or child neglect.pacheco thereupon appealed to the bia,which affirmed.the bia concluded that conviction under california penal code section b,a conviction it described as willful harm or injury to a child,satisfies the meaning of child abuse as contemplated under section a e i of the act.
pacheco timely appeals.we hold that a conviction under california penal code section b is not categorically a crime of child abuse within the meaning of the ina and so grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.
we review de novo the bia conclusions on questions of whether a particular state conviction is a removable offense under the to the extent that deference is owed to the bia interpretation of the statutes and regulations it is charged with administering.see holder,cir.to determine whether a state conviction constitutes a removable offense,the bia must determine first the elements of the offense the petitioner has been convicted of committing,and second whether the conviction falls within the definition of a removable offense under the ina.see holder,cir en banc.the first inquiry requires the bia to construe a state criminal statute.as the bia has no statutory expertise in such state law matters,we review de novo its determination of the elements of the offense for which the petitioner was convicted.see id.the second inquiry requires the bia to construe the ina by defining a particular removable offense and applying that definition to a petitioner state conviction.if,in resolving the second issue,the bia has interpreted an ambiguous ina statutory term,and rendered its interpretation in a precedential decision intended to carry the force of law,we defer under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,to the bia definition so long as it is reasonable.see,at citing united states mead,d.
under section b of the ina,a nonpermanent resident is eligible for cancellation of removal if,among other matters,he has not been convicted of an offense under section a of the act.b c.among the offenses listed in section a are c rimes of domestic violence,stalking,or violation of protection order,and crimes against children.a e.specifically,the statute provides that a ny alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of domestic violence,a crime of stalking,or a crime of child abuse,child neglect,or child abandonment is deportable.a e i.
where,as here,the immigration statute refers to generic crimes,we apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches set forth in taylor united states,d,to determine whether a particular state conviction falls within the generic federal definition.see nijhawan holder,d keisler,cir.under the categorical approach,we compare the elements of the statute of conviction with a federal definition of the crime to determine whether conduct proscribed by the state statute is broader than the generic federal definition,looking only at the fact of conviction and the statutory definition.id.looking beyond the title of the statute to the offense elements,gonzales,cir en banc,i f the statute of conviction criminalizes conduct that would not satisfy the federal definition of the crime at issue,then the conviction does not qualify as a predicate offense under the categorical approach,at citing united states,cir en banc.
unlike the term crime of domestic violence,the term crime of child abuse is not defined in the ina,and our case law has not defined the term as it is used in that statute see gonzales,cir per curiam.the bia has,however,recently supplied a definition of crime of child abuse as set forth in section a e i of the ina.see matter of,bia.because matter of is a precedential opinion of the bia intended to carry the force of law,under chevron,we defer to the bia interpretation of crime of child abuse,if it is reasonable.see,at.
before examining matter of further and applying it to the facts of this case,we pause to consider a procedural we should remand to the bia to apply its matter of decision rather than doing so ourselves.
the bia had not yet decided matter of when it issued its decision in pacheco appeal.in pacheco appeal,the bia relied instead on its decision in matter of,bia,which adopted black law dictionary definition of child abuse as a ny form of cruelty to a child physical,moral,or mental.we subsequently held that the definition of crime of child abuse supplied in matter of was dictum and was not adopted in a manner that constitutes a statutory interpretation that carries the force of law,and so did not deserve chevron deference.see,at.we remanded to the bia to issue a precedential decision that would authoritatively define crime of child abuse.see id.the board decision in matter of is the product of that remand.
the government position is that the matter of definition is not only consistent with matter of,but is an expansion of the matter of other words,matter of potentially reaches broader conduct than did matter of.the government maintains that if we disagree,a remand to the bia would be appropriate.
we are convinced that a remand is not necessary in this case.aside from according chevron deference to the board interpretation of a crime of child abuse in the ina,which we do,we review de novo whether the california conviction is a removable offense.this inquiry involves parsing the elements of a state criminal statute to determine whether it criminalizes conduct that falls outside of the generic federal offense,a task for which,as we have noted,the bia lacks any particular statutory expertise that would be brought to bear on remand.see gonzales,at cir distinguishing ins ventura,d per curiam.morever,accepting as true the government contention that matter of is consistent with and broader than matter of,it follows necessarily that if,as we determine,there is no categorical match under matter of,there is no categorical match under the narrower
