the united states appeals the sentence imposed on magdaleno hernandez following his conviction under a for being an alien found in the united states following deportation.the question we must answer is whether the date that the offense commenced,for purposes of calculating the criminal history score,is the date that hernandez entered the united states,or the date that he was found in the united states by immigration authorities.relying on our decisions in united states disantillo,cir,and united states lennon,cir,the district court concluded that the relevant date was the date that hernandez was found by immigration authorities.we conclude that disantillo and lennon are distinguishable and hold that the date that the offense commenced for purposes of calculating the criminal history score is the date that hernandez entered the united states.we therefore vacate the sentence and remand for the district court to determine the date of entry and resentence accordingly we have jurisdiction pursuant to and.
hernandez,a native and citizen of mexico,legally entered the united states in when he was years old.from to,hernandez suffered five of bad checks,driving under the influence,attempted grand theft,forgery,and possession of forged notes.in,hernandez pled nolo contendere to a charge of oral copulation by acting in concert with force and was sentenced to eight years in state prison.on january,hernandez was paroled to immigration authorities and deported to mexico.
hernandez stayed in mexico for approximately one year before reentering the united states illegally.he lived with his sister family,and then with his girlfriend,in norristown,pennsylvania.in march,police officers were called to hernandez residence following an altercation between hernandez and his girlfriend.officers arrested hernandez after they saw cocaine in his pocket.hernandez pled guilty to possession of cocaine and,following his hearing on that charge,he was arrested by immigration authorities.
hernandez was indicted on one count of being found in the united states following deportation,in violation of a and b.he pled guilty,and a presentence investigation report psr was prepared.
a defendant criminal history is calculated pursuant to of the united states sentencing guidelines ussg.section provides,in pertinent part,that a ny other prior sentence that was imposed within ten years of the defendant commencement of the instant offense is counted in the criminal history score.ussg e.the psr relied on hernandez confession to authorities that he immediately returned to the united states after his deportation in,and his statement that he had been living and working in norristown for approximately six years at the time of his psr interview,to conclude that the criminal conduct in this case began at least as early as january.the psr accordingly included in the calculation of hernandez criminal history score his convictions that dated from.hernandez objected,arguing that the effective date of the offense was august,because that was the date the indictment charged he was found in the united states,and that his convictions that occurred more than ten years before this date should not be included in the calculation of his criminal history score.the government argued that it was undisputed that the latest hernandez reentered the united states was january,therefore,that all of his convictions after january,should be included in the calculation of his criminal history score.
the district court agreed with hernandez that the relevant question for determining the date of the offense was when he was found by immigration authorities.the government informed the court that immigration authorities first became aware that hernandez was in the country in may,and he was sentenced on the cocaine charge in august.relying on those dates,the court concluded that hernandez criminal history category was iii,resulting in a guideline range of to months.the court sentenced hernandez to a term of months.this timely appeal and followed.
we review the district court interpretation of the guidelines de novo.united states navarro,cir.the district court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.id.
the government contends that the district court erred in concluding that hernandez instant offense did not commence until he was discovered by immigration authorities in may.if the district court had relied on the date the psr estimated that hernandez reentered the united states,january,to calculate hernandez criminal history,his five convictions between and would have been included in the criminal history calculation.
section a contains three separate offenses,phrased in the disjunctive illegal,attempted illegal reentry,and being found illegally in the united states.lennon,at.hernandez was convicted of the third offense,being found in the united states.we considered the date of the found in offense in disantillo and lennon,but neither case addressed the issue we face here.
the question in disantillo was whether the statute of limitations had run prior to the return of an indictment for illegal reentry.the defendant,disantillo,was arrested and deported in when he was sixteen years old.he reentered the united states in on an immigrant visa,but,because of the earlier deportation,the government contended that his visa was improperly obtained and,in,prosecuted him for illegal reentry.disantillo argued that the indictment was barred by the statute of limitations for,because the limitations period began to run at the time he entered the united states in.the government countered that the limitations period began to run when disantillo was found in the united states in.we rejected the government construction of the statute,reasoning that,u nder the government formulation,violation of is a continuing offense effectively tolling the statute of limitations for as long as the alien remains illegally in the country.disantillo,at.
we relied on the fact that disantillo reentered the united states through an official port of entry,reasoning that congress inclusion of the found in offense in the illegal entry statute indicated its intent to create 
a distinction between surreptitious crossing of the united states border and entry at a recognized ins port of entry congress must have included the word found in to alleviate the difficult law enforcement burden of finding and prosecuting this class of illegal aliens,who are already aware that they are in violation of the law as evidenced by their surreptitious entry,before the five year statute of limitations runs.
id.at.because disantillo entered through an official port of entry and filed a report with the ins every year,the government had sufficient opportunities to discover disantillo offense.id.at.reasoning that t he critical event giving rise to this prosecution and making the offense complete was disantillo entry,we concluded that the crime of illegal entry through a recognized ins port of entry after being arrested and deported is not a continuing offense.id.we therefore held that an alien may not be indicted under more than five years after he entered or attempted to enter the united states through an official ins port of entry when the immigration authorities have a record of when he entered or attempted to enter.id.at.
the question in lennon was when the offense of being found in the united states was committed for purposes of determining which guidelines version was applicable.lennon,the defendant,was deported in,and she illegally reentered the united states in,using a pseudonym.she was apprehended by the ins in and pled guilty to being found in the united states in violation of.lennon argued that the guidelines,rather than the guidelines,should have been used to calculate her sentence because her found in offense occurred when she illegally entered the united states in.
although lennon position seemed consistent with disantillo,we distinguished disantillo on the basis that 
t he logic of immigration authorities should be imputed with knowledge of an alien presence in the united not extend to a case such as this,where lennon affirmatively concealed her identity.to hold otherwise
