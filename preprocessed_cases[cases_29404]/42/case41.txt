we must decide in this case whether petitioner pierre thomas satisfied the applicable statutory criteria for obtaining derivative citizenship in consequence of his mother naturalization.those criteria were set forth in the derivative citizenship statute that was in effect at the time that thomas was still a minor.thomas concedes that he is removable as an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony if he did not satisfy those criteria.because we conclude that he did not satisfy them,we deny his petition.
the following facts are not in dispute.thomas was born in haiti and was lawfully admitted to the united states in,at the age of five,as a nonimmigrant visitor.he was authorized to remain in the united states for six months,but he and his parents remained in the country beyond that date.after his father died in,thomas continued to live in the united states with his mother for the remainder of his childhood.
at some point while thomas was a child,his mother obtained lawful permanent resident status.on july,when thomas was fourteen years old,thomas mother filed an application for voluntary departure on thomas behalf under the family unity program that application was approved on august,giving thomas authorization to remain in the united states for two years.then,in,thomas mother filed a form petition,pursuant to a b i i,to classify thomas as the child of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.that petition was approved on october.
on may,thomas mother became a naturalized united states citizen.three days later,thomas turned eighteen years old.thomas did not apply to become a lawful permanent resident during that period that followed his mother naturalization or at any other point.instead,he continued living in the united states without a lawful admission for permanent residence.
in,thomas was convicted in massachusetts state court for armed robbery.then,in,the united states initiated removal proceedings against thomas pursuant to section a a iii of the ina a a iii,which provides that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.thomas contested removal on the ground that he became a united states citizen in,by operation of the derivative citizenship statute then in effect.the immigration judge ij assigned to thomas case rejected that contention and,on october,ordered him removed.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed that decision on february,and thomas was removed to haiti in april of that year.
thomas current petition is for review of the denial by the bia of his motion to reopen the proceedings against him.thomas made that motion after he was arrested on a charge of illegal reentry upon his return to the united states in april.
because the motion was filed more than days after the bia removal order,the bia denied his motion to reopen on timeliness grounds.see c c i providing that,subject to limited exceptions,a motion to reopen shall be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.on appeal,however,the government has expressly disavowed reliance on the time bar in this case and has urged us to reach the merits.we thus deem the government to have waived any timeliness argument and will proceed to the merits of thomas citizenship claim.see b a.
thomas petition hinges on the proper construction of the derivative citizenship law that was in effect before thomas turned eighteen years old.that law,former section a of the ina,provided that 
a child born outside of the united states of alien parents becomes a citizen of the united states upon 
the naturalization of the surviving parent if one of the parents is deceased 
such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years and 
such child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent naturalized under clause of this subsection,or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
a,repealed by child citizenship act of,pub,a,stat,codified at a 
thomas and the government agree that thomas mother,as his lone surviving parent,was naturalized while thomas was under eighteen.the parties further agree that thomas was not residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of his mother naturalization.the only question we must address,therefore,is whether thomas,upon his mother naturalization,thereafter beg an to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
under the bia interpretation of former section a,the answer is that thomas clearly did not.the bia has concluded that the phrase begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years,is most reasonably interpreted to mean that an alien must obtain the status of lawful permanent resident while under the age of years.matter of nwozuzu,bia.in other words,according to the bia,the latter clause of paragraph in former subsection a contains a shorthand reference to the requirement of the first clause.id.at.thus,as thomas concedes,thomas citizenship claim would fail under the bia interpretation because he was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence prior to his birthday and thus never satisfied either clause.
thomas argues that we should reject the bia interpretation of that section.he contends that we should join the second circuit in concluding that the bia interpretation,under which the second clause of former paragraph a is merely a shorthand reference to the first clause,is contrary to the plain language of the statute because the phrase reside permanently in the second clause unambiguously means something broader than resid e pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence in the first clause.see nwozuzu holder,cir.but see united states,cir.adopting the bia interpretation 
thomas further contends that he satisfied the requirements of that broader,second clause because he satisfied the criteria for residing permanently that the second circuit set forth in nwozuzu.according to nwozuzu,b egins to reside permanently does not require lawful permanent resident status but merely requires some objective official manifestation of the child permanent residence.at.
in the end,as we will explain,thomas can not satisfy the statutory criteria even under his preferred,broader reading of reside permanently.and that is because he offers no explanation of how he can be said in light of the words thereafter begins in the key clause to have done what he needed to do by the time he needed to do it.but before explaining our conclusion in that regard,we first pause to explain the difficulty in construing the two words that are the focus of the dispute between thomas and the bia.
if one knew nothing else,it would not be altogether surprising if the phrase reside permanently was,as the bia contends,just a shorthand for resid e pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.those two words appear right after the longer phrase,in the same section,and one certainly might use those words colloquially as a shorthand description of what came before.
but there are some contrary indications that point towards thomas preferred reading.the phrase reside permanently is not defined in the ina,but the phrase lawfully admitted for permanent residence is.and the definition of that longer phrase includes residing permanently as a component part,thus suggesting they are not synonyms 
similarly,the terms permanent and residence are separately defined in the ina,each without reference to lawful admission.permanent is defined in the ina as a relationship of continuing or lasting nature,as distinguished from temporary,but a relationship may be permanent even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance either of the united states or of the individual,in accordance with law.a.residence is defined in the ina as the place of general abode the place of general abode of a person means his principal,actual dwelling place in fact,without regard to intent.id.a.thus,the ina s
