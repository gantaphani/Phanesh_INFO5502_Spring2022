we must decide,in this asylum case under the real id act,whether an immigration judge adverse credibility determination may be supported exclusively by background evidence in the record.
pavittar singh,a native and citizen of india,entered the united states on or about january,as a nonimmigrant visitor,with authorization to remain in the united states for six months.however,on april,the department of homeland security served singh with a notice to appear,charging him as removable for failure to comply with the conditions of his nonimmigrant status.specifically,singh was charged as because he was employed for wages at a convenience store without authorization of immigration and customs enforcement ice.singh then sought relief from removal by applying for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.
in due course,singh appeared before an immigration judge ij and testified that he had suffered persecution on account of his membership in the nirankari sect of the sikh faith.he asserted that on january,terrorists entered his family shop in india,derided his nirankari beliefs,and demanded money.additionally,singh testified that after he reported this incident,the police refused to investigate and instead accused him of harboring sikh separatists.singh claimed he suffered additional police harassment when,on january,he was arrested,accused of harboring terrorists at his wedding,and beaten while in custody.singh also claimed that on october,he was yet again accosted by sikh terrorists,who took his property and threatened to kill him if he supported the nirankari mission.he testified that a few days later the police again arrested him,accused him of supporting sikh terrorists,and beat him.
however,the ij found singh testimony not credible and denied his applications for relief.while acknowledging that singh testified consistently,the ij relied on background evidence in the record to conclude that his testimony was implausible.the ij noted that an amnesty international report submitted by singh not only failed to support his claim that the armed opposition continues to operate,but also,by showing that armed militants were no longer active,undermined his allegation that such militants recently attacked him.the ij also found the reports submitted by the government further suggested that militant activity had ended years ago.thus,she found,singh claim that he was attacked by sikh militants in and was not plausible.
the board of immigration appeals bia dismissed singh appeal from the ij decision,agreeing with her that his account is implausible because the documentary evidence demonstrates that the armed opposition in punjab ended in the.noting that the bia must defer to ij credibility findings unless they are clearly erroneous and that i mplausible testimony can support an adverse credibility finding,the board agreed with the ij finding that singh was not credible.
the only issue presented on appeal is whether the ij adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence.
the standard of review of bia determinations is well settled.as we have explained,w hen the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and law rather than adopting the ij decision,our review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent that the ij opinion is expressly adopted.shrestha holder,cir quoting hosseini gonzalez,cir.however,when,as here,the bia phrasing seems in part to suggest that it did conduct an independent review of the record,but the bia analysis on the relevant issues is confined to a simple statement of a conclusion,we also look to the ij oral decision as a guide to what lay behind the bia conclusion.id.quoting avetova elisseva,cir.
credibility determinations are findings of fact,which are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b rizk holder,cir singh kaur,cir.under,our task is to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the bia finding,not to substitute an analysis of which side in the factual dispute we find more persuasive.molina morales,cir quoting marcu,cir.thus,a credibility determination will only be reversed if the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it.rizk,at quoting elias zacarias,alterations in original.
singh concedes that because he filed his application after may,the real id act governs the determination of his credibility.see shrestha,at.
singh asserts that the adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence,because under the real id act his specific testimony can not be discredited solely by reliance on background documents.whether the real id act permits such background documents to serve as the sole basis for an adverse credibility finding appears to be a question of first impression.however,it is easily resolved by the clear language of the act itself,which forecloses singh argument.
the two cases singh relies on for support zheng ashcroft,cir,and singh gonzales,cir,overruled on other grounds by maldonado lynch,cir en banc are id act cases that do not consider the act significant restriction of appellate review of credibility determinations see bingxu jin holder,cir the real id act significantly restricted appellate review of adverse credibility findings,and only the most extraordinary circumstances will justify overturning an adverse credibility determination.quoting shrestha,at jibril,at kaur gonzales,cir see also xiu xia lin mukasey,cir per curiam explaining that the real id act freed an ij from the various requirements courts of appeals imposed on credibility determinations.
moreover,the real id act explicitly allows the bia and ij to base their credibility determinations on background evidence in the record.considering the totality of the circumstances,and all relevant factors,a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on,among other things,the inherent plausibility of singh account and the consistency of singh statements with other evidence of record including the reports of the department of state on country conditions without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of singh claim.b b iii angov.lynch,cir explaining that this court and the bia permissibly rely upon state department country reports all the time citing b b iii.
the ij thus acted within the confines of the real id act by considering the totality of the circumstances and basing her credibility determination on the inherent implausibility of singh account and its inconsistency with record evidence,including the amnesty international report.the ij considered evidence submitted by singh and the government and found such evidence did not support singh claim that the armed opposition continues to operate.she noted that the amnesty international report affirmatively indicated that the armed sikh militancy ended in the.ultimately,based on singh testimony and the documents submitted by both singh and the government,the ij found implausible singh account that he was attacked by sikh militants.the bia similarly concluded that singh account was rendered implausible by the documentary evidence that demonstrates that the armed opposition in punjab ended in the.
given the language of the real id act,the ij finding and the bia conclusion of implausibility based on record evidence is permissible 
our precedent also forecloses singh argument that the bia decision was based on speculation.
though singh is correct that an adverse credibility determination can not be based on complete speculation and conjecture,here the ij and bia supported the determination with specific citations to record evidence.see part,supra see also shrestha,at requiring that the ij state explicitly the factors supporting his or her adverse credibility determination and avoid b oilerplate opinions that are devoid of statements that evidence an individualized review of the petitioner contentions and circumstances quoting castillo,cir yan xia zhu mukasey,cir concluding that an ij implausibility determination was impermissible when based on the ij pure speculation,rather than any record ev
