petitioner rita maria carrion garcia,a native of the dominican republic,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision affirming the denial of her application for withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture cat.we have jurisdiction under a,and we deny the petition for review.
carrion garcia gives the following account of her personal history.she was born in santo domingo in the dominican republic,where she lived with her parents until age,when she moved to live separately with her children.carrion garcia relationship with the children father ended in,but her children moved to the united states to live with him in july after a robbery at carrion garcia home.
carrion garcia met ernesto valdez in,and they began dating.their relationship became intimate in,and she moved in with him in august,after her children had already moved to the united states.their relationship began to change in october when he started swearing at her,calling her a prostitute,and spending time with new friends who were using drugs.valdez began physically abusing carrion garcia in november.the abuse was extreme.he would hit her and kick her in the ribs and stomach,and would rape and sodomize her when he returned home drunk.
valdez threatened carrion garcia,saying that he would kill her if she left him or filed a police report against him.ashamed of the abuse and concerned by the threats made by valdez,carrion garcia did not consider filing a police report challenging his abuse.carrion garcia also knew of a neighbor who had been abused by her husband.when the neighbor called the police,her husband was only held in jail until the next day when he returned home and hit her again.
in january,carrion garcia left valdez to escape the abuse.she traveled to three separate locations in the countryside over the course of several weeks,staying with friends and family,and each time valdez found her,apologized,and begged for her forgiveness.when she refused his entreaties to return with him to santo domingo,he became furious,threatened her,and frightened her.
following the third such encounter,carrion garcia returned to her mother home,and her mother helped gather money from relatives for carrion garcia to leave the dominican republic.because carrion garcia had a visa for mexico,she decided to travel to toluca,mexico,with a friend.they later traveled to nogales,mexico,where carrion garcia was unable to find employment,and she decided to enter the united states.
carrion garcia was caught trying to enter the united states four times.she first entered the united states in may by crossing a border fence,and was caught by customs and border protection cbp officers.a cbp officer who spoke spanish interviewed her,and she did not have difficulty conversing with him.she gave the cbp officer a false name,date of birth,and claimed that she was mexican.carrion garcia later testified that she gave false information so that she would not be returned to santo domingo.she was removed to mexico.fifteen days later she crossed the border again and was immediately apprehended by cbp officers.carrion garcia gave the same false information to the cbp officer who interviewed her,and claimed that her parents were mexican citizens.the same events transpired on her third attempted entry into the united states.
on her fourth attempt to enter the united states,carrion garcia was again apprehended by cbp officers,and interviewed by a officer.she gave again false identifying information,and was taken to tucson where she was detained for three days.carrion garcia then appeared in district court represented by a attorney.carrion garcia gave her attorney a false name and told her she was from mexico.a spanish interpreter was also present during her court appearance,and carrion garcia acknowledged that she understood both her attorney and the proceedings.although the district court judge told carrion garcia that she must tell the truth,carrion garcia gave the false name to the judge and said that she was from mexico so that she would not be sent back to the dominican republic.carrion garcia was convicted of illegal reentry and spent thirty days in jail,after which she was returned to nogales.however,a mexican border patrol officer who reviewed her information discovered that carrion garcia was not from mexico.she then claimed that she was from el salvador,and was brought to the detention center in eloy,arizona.
after a reasonable fear interview,the department of homeland security referred carrion garcia withholding of removal application to an immigration judge ij.carrion garcia presented additional evidence to support her withholding of removal and cat claims,including her mother affidavit,a police report filed by her mother on june,and an affidavit from a third person who resided in the dominican republic and who now lives in new york.also,carrion garcia submitted the expert testimony of wayne westhoff regarding family violence and women health in the dominican republic.westhoff testified that domestic violence in the dominican republic is widespread,and that police are uninterested in being of assistance because of the cultural aspect of not interfering with domestic or family issues.a country report submitted by carrion garcia supports westhoff expert opinions.after a hearing and in consideration of the evidence presented,the ij found that carrion garcia was not credible,and denied her application for withholding of removal and protection under the cat.the bia affirmed the denial of relief.
we review factual findings,including adverse credibility determinations,for substantial evidence.shrestha holder,cir.factual findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see smolniakova gonzales,cir.this standard is very deferential,requiring only such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,richardson perales,citation omitted.because the bia affirmed the ij findings of fact while adding its own reasons,we review both decisions.chand ins,cir.we review questions of law de novo.de martinez ashcroft,cir.
we first address the adverse credibility determination made by the ij and affirmed by the bia,which affects both of carrion garcia claims.after the enactment of the real id act,a trier of fact may base an adverse credibility determination on the totality of the circumstances,including,for example,the applicant responsiveness,consistency between written and oral statements,the internal consistency of those statements,and any inaccuracies or falsehoods without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim,or any other relevant factor.shrestha,at quoting b b iii.the ij must provide a specific cogent reason for the adverse credibility finding,gui ins,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,but we will only overturn the ij conclusion when the evidence compels a contrary result.monjaraz munoz.ins,cir.
here,substantial evidence supports the ij adverse credibility determination,which the bia affirmed.the ij based his determination mainly on two factors.the first was carrion garcia various lies to officials and to the district court judge,especially about her identity and country of origin.the second was that she equivocated during her interview with the ij.these factors are generally sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination.see don gonzales,cir admission of prior dishonesty can support an adverse credibility determination.
although carrion garcia claims that she can not remember whether the four cbp officials told her to tell the truth,it is evident that she understood that she was lying in each interview.she also lied to her attorney and to the district court judge,who had made it clear to carrion garcia that she was under oath.
carrion garcia argues that the nature of her withholding claim based on physical and sexual abuse did not sufficiently inform the ij and bia consideration of her falsehoods.see kebede ashcroft,cir paramasamy ashcroft,cir describing the particular difficulties that m
