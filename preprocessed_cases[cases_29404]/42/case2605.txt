on march,abel mehari nigussie,an ethiopian citizen of allegedly eritrean origin,entered the united states as a nonimmigrant using a fraudulent passport.he was detained at the los angeles international airport and interviewed by an immigration and naturalization service ins officer and found to be inadmissible.on april,the ins issued nigussie a notice to appear,charging that he procured entry into the united states by fraud or by willfully misrepresenting a material fact under a c i of the immigration and nationality act act.the notice to appear also charged that nigussie violated a a i i as an immigrant not in possession of required suitable travel documents.
through counsel,on july,nigussie moved to change venue from los angeles to chicago.nigussie admitted the factual allegations contained in the notice to appear and conceded the charges of deportability,but refused to designate a country of deportation.in his change of venue motion,nigussie declared his intent to file for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.the immigration judge ij in los angeles granted nigussie motion for change of venue on august.on april,more than a year after arriving in the united states,nigussie filed his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat in chicago.
in an evidentiary hearing on january,before an ij in chicago,nigussie again admitted and conceded the charges against him and refused to designate a country of removal.on that same day,the ij issued a decision denying nigussie application for asylum,finding it untimely under a b because he filed it more than one year after entering the united states and because he failed to demonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances justifying an extension of the deadline under a d.
in an alternative holding,the ij addressed nigussie asylum application on its merits and denied it because of nigussie lack of credibility and the absence of corroborating evidence.the ij also denied nigussie application for withholding of removal and relief under the cat based on the same adverse credibility finding.
on january,nigussie appealed the ij decision,asserting that the ij failed to consider evidence in his favor and that the court caused the delay in filing the application for asylum.under its streamlining procedure,e,the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the results of the ij decision without opinion on june.this petition for review followed wherein nigussie challenges the ij untimeliness finding and his determination on the merits as to nigussie application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat.for the following reasons,we deny nigussie petition for review.
ii.analysis 
asylum application 
we lack jurisdiction over the bia decision to bar,based on untimeliness,nigussie asylum application.as we recently decided in zaidi ashcroft,wl cir.july.lexis,the plain language of a of the act prohibits our review of such matters.id.at we now join our sister circuits in holding that the no court shall have jurisdiction to review language of a is sufficiently specific to show that congress intended to preclude judicial review of agency action under a.see also vladimirova ashcroft,wl cir.july.lexis,at.
although we may not consider the merits of nigussie asylum claim,a does not bar our review of his application for withholding of removal or relief under the cat.see zaidi,at.lexis,at citing b and niam ashcroft,cir vladimirova,at.lexis,at tarrawally ashcroft,cir.
withholding of removal and cat claims 
to succeed on his withholding of removal claim,nigussie must establish a clear probability that he will suffer persecution if returned to his home country.zaidi.lexis,at citing niam,at.if nigussie can establish that he was persecuted in the past,there is a presumption,subject to rebuttal by the government,that the persecution will continue upon his return.id.citing b i.
under the cat implementing regulations,the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.torture,as defined by the cat,means 
a ny act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

when a petition is streamlined,as is the case here,the ij decision becomes that of the bia.uwase ashcroft,cir.thus,judicial review is limited to the decision of the ij.krouchevski ashcroft,cir.
the ij determinations with regard to nigussie application for withholding of removal and relief under the cat are both reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.see oforji ashcroft,cir.under this highly deferential standard of review,we must affirm the ij findings if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.ins,and,d awad ashcroft,cir.we will not overturn an agency determination unless the evidence compels that contrary conclusion,at and.krouchevski,at.
here,the ij rejected nigussie claims because he found nigussie lacked credibility and failed to provide corroborating evidence supporting his application.an ij credibility determinations also receive highly deferential review as long as they are.pop ins,cir.see generally nasir ins,cir.that is,the credibility determinations must be supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.ahmad ins,cir quotations omitted see also krouchevski,at.an agency credibility findings should not be superseded simply because an alternative finding could also be supported by substantial evidence.ahmad,at.in sum,an ij credibility determination should only be overturned under extraordinary circumstances.id.
nigussie evidentiary hearing testimony 
in his january,merits hearing before the ij in chicago,nigussie testified that he was a native of ethiopia.his parents,however,were born in eritrea.he,like them,was an orthodox christian and then converted to the jehovah witness faith in.his mother is dead,and he has two surviving brothers and three sisters,at least four of whom still live in ethiopia.the fifth sibling,a sister,is apparently in kenya.
nigussie testified that at the start of the war in may of many ethnic eritreans were rounded up and taken during the night by ethiopian security agents nigussie father was one of them.he has not seen his father since and does not know of his whereabouts.after his father arrest,government functionaries brought nigussie utility bills that his father owed to ensure payment before his father deportation.fearing arrest if he went to pay the bills,he did not do so and does not know if his siblings did either.
nigussie then voluntarily left ethiopia for kenya.while on his way to kenya,police detained nigussie in yabelo,ethiopia.he was imprisoned for days.afterwards,the authorities deported nigussie to moyale,kenya but did not send him to a refugee camp.it appears from his testimony that he was allowed to cross the border into kenya,whereupon kenyan police arrested him.he was then detained for a couple of days in a jail,but again not sent to a refugee camp,because,according to nigussie,there was no immigration office in moyale.after his release,he was told by authorities to stay in moyale.
while in moyale,nigussie states he met a girl,and the two traveled to nairobi.in nairobi,immigration officials seized nigussie ethiopian passport and forced him to sign a statement renouncing his ethiopian citizenship.although he remained in kenya for eighteen months,nigussie refused to register voluntarily with refugee camps because he believed the kenyan government was
