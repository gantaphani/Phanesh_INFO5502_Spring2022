opinion of the court 
petitioner mohammed nasir khan seeks review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the decision of the immigration judge ij who denied khan request for a continuance of his removal proceeding.we must decide at the outset whether we have jurisdiction.
background 
khan is a native and citizen of bangladesh.he entered the united states as a business visitor on september,with permission to remain for a period not to exceed one month.on march,khan voluntarily reported to the offices of the department of homeland security dhs to register in compliance with dhs special registration program dhs placed khan into removal proceedings that same day by serving him with a notice to appear in which it charged him with removability under ina a b for overstaying his visa.
on october,khan appeared pro se for a hearing before an ij who adjourned the proceeding so that khan could seek counsel.on november,khan again appeared before the ij,this time with counsel.khan conceded his removability as charged and did not apply for asylum or other substantive relief.instead,he applied for voluntary departure and submitted a written motion seeking a continuance of the removal proceeding or,in the alternative,a termination of the proceeding on the ground that his wife also an alien from bangladesh had a pending application for an alien employment certification labor certification with the united states department of labor dol 
khan and his wife,rehana begum,were married in bangladesh in they have a united states citizen minor child.on april,a prospective employer in pennsylvania filed a labor certification for permission to employ begum as a household cook at a private residence.khan wife timely applied for the labor certification under ina i,i life act,which had a sunset date of april,as relevant to the instant case,the life act provides that a legal permanent resident alien spouse and minor children are eligible,by virtue of their relation to the alien,to apply for adjustment of status if otherwise qualified.see i b d.
at the november,hearing,khan counsel represented to the ij that it usually takes about days to get a response from the regional on an application for a labor certification.app.at.the ij denied the requested continuance,reasoning that begum application for a labor certification was merely pending,no visa petition had yet been filed,and therefore khan was not prima facie eligible to adjust his status.the ij also denied khan alternative request to terminate the removal proceedings altogether,rejecting khan suggestion that termination was warranted because dhs had failed to follow its own regulations in requiring khan to register under the special registration program.the ij noted that khan,through counsel,had conceded his removability as charged and declined to rule on khan due process challenge to the registration program.the ij ordered khan removal to bangladesh but granted him a window to depart voluntarily.
khan timely appealed to the bia,raising two arguments the special registration procedure is repugnant to the constitution and the ij erred in refusing to grant a continuance on the ground that begum application for a labor certification was pending.app.at.khan noted that begum labor certification already had been approved at the state level and was pending only before the federal regional office of the dol.khan argued that he should not be faulted for the government delay in processing labor certifications.on october,the bia summarily affirmed the ij order without opinion and permitted khan thirty days to depart voluntarily.
khan timely filed this petition for review.the government filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that this court lacks jurisdiction and,alternatively,for summary affirmance.
as we noted above,this case presents at the threshold the question whether this court has jurisdiction over the petition for review.the bia issued a final order summarily affirming the ij removal order,which the ij entered after denying khan motion for a continuance.thus,the bia order falls within our jurisdiction to review a final order of removal,a.
the government argues we lack jurisdiction to review the ij denial of khan request for a continuance because such denial constitutes a discretionary determination.motion to dismiss at.the government relies upon the language of ina a b ii,a b ii,which provides in pertinent part 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any other decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general,other than the granting of asylum relief under section a of this title.
id.emphasis added.
as the government suggests,the question whether we have jurisdiction in the present case turns on whether the ij authority to grant khan a continuance of the removal proceeding is specified under this subchapter,and therefore precluded from review.id.we have previously explained that,t he language this subchapter in the foregoing provision refers to subchapter ii in chapter of title of the united states code,which consists of subchapter.ashcroft,cir.
there is no statutory provision within the subchapter that explicitly confers discretion on an ij to grant a continuance.the only provision in the subchapter which might be construed to confer such discretion is a,which grants authority to a n immigration judge to conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.a.arguably,a tribunal authorized to hear a matter has inherent authority to continue the hearing to another time.in any event,a federal regulation explicitly confers discretion upon the ij to grant a continuance the immigration judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.
significant for present purposes is the issue whether the ij decision on such a motion can be reviewed by this court.the courts of appeals are divided on the question whether an express grant of discretionary authority in a federal regulation implemented pursuant to the subchapter amounts to authority specified under this subchapter.
we look first to whether this court has spoken on this issue.in bakhtriger elwood,cir,we engaged in an extensive examination of the authority of the courts of appeals to review discretionary decisions in asylum cases prior to enactment of the real id act of.we examined the kinds of challenges that are cognizable in criminal alien removal habeas petitions,id.at,and concluded that habeas review does not incorporate an examination of the exercise of discretion but must be confined to questions of constitutional and statutory law.id.at.that decision is inapplicable here because the present case does not involve a criminal alien and therefore our review is not restricted to constitutional challenges or errors of law.id.at.in bakhtriger,we did not have occasion to consider the applicability of the specified under this subchapter language of a b ii.
thereafter,we did consider this language in soltane dep t of justice,cir.in that case the issue before us was whether jurisdiction to review the ij denial of a preference visa to certain special immigrants under b was barred by a b ii.id.at.because the language of b stated that a visa shall issue if certain requirements are met,we could not read b as having specified that the granting of the visas in question be in the discretion of the attorney general.id.at.
we also considered the language of a b ii in.in,we held that c,which governs the grant of conditional permanent resident status based on marriage to a united states citizen,by its terms explicitly assigns discretion to the attorney general and therefore a b ii precluded review by this court of the denial of a waiver under c.id.at.
the only other precedential opinion in which we have considered a b ii is our recent decision in jilin pharmaceutical usa,chertoff,cir.in jilin,we held that explicitly provides the attorney general with discretion to revoke the prior approval of a visa petition and therefore such revocation is shielded from court review pursuant to a b ii.id.at.
in none of the cases referred to above,soltane,and jilin,did we address the issue before this court in the instant,whether a b ii bars jurisdiction when there is no statute expressly granting discretion to the attorney general but discretionary authority is extant under a federal regulation.accordingly,the issue before us is one of first impression for this court.
the eighth and tenth circuit courts of appeals have interpreted a b ii to mean that a court of appeals has no jurisdiction to review the denial of a petitioner motion for a continuance of a removal proceeding.yerkovich ashcroft,cir onyinkwa ashcroft,cir.in yerkovich,the court felt itself bound by its earlier decision in van dinh reno,cir,which had broadly construed the preclusive effect of a b ii.see at.both yerkovich and onyinkwa based their decisions that review of the denial of a motion for a continuance is barred on the ground that,which implements an ij statutory authority under a to conduct proceedings,confers discretion upon the ij to grant a continuance.therefore,they reasoned,the plain meaning of a b text bar ring courts from reviewing relief specified under this subchapter encompasses orders of the ij denying continuances.yerkovich,at quoting samirah,cir accord onyinkwa,at 
courts that have held to the contrary have ruled that discretionary authority to grant a continuance can not be considered specified under this subchapter where the language that expressly provides for such authority appears only in a regulation.see ahmed gonzales,cir.sanusi gonzales,cir per curiam zafar att y,cir.as the court stated in zafar,because denials of motions to continue are not discretionary acts specified under this sub chapter to the attorney general,as enumerated in a b ii,we have jurisdiction to review them.at accord ahmed,at sanusi,at see also gonzales,cir agreeing with the result,but not the reasoning,of zafar.
the courts of appeals for the fifth and ninth circuits have adopted similar reasoning in concluding that the language of a b ii does not bar review of the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings,a proceeding comparable to a motion to continue in its invocation of the ij discretion.in zhao gonzales,cir,the court stated,
one might mistakenly read a b ii as stripping us of the authority to review any discretionary immigration decision.that reading,however,is incorrect,because a b ii strips us only of jurisdiction to review discretionary authority specified in the statute.the statutory language is uncharacteristically pellucid on this score it does not allude generally to discretionary authority or to discretionary authority exercised under this statute,but specifically to authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general.
id.at quoting a b ii see also ashcroft,cir because c neither grants nor limits the attorney general discretion to deny motions to reopen,it can perhaps be said to have left such authority to the attorney general by default.but default authority does not constitute the specification required by a b ii.
in its recent opinion in sanusi,at,the second circuit reviewed the conflicting opinions and weighed in on the side of those courts that hold the courts of appeals have jurisdiction to review for abuse of discretion a claim that an ij wrongly denied a motion for a continuance in an immigration proceeding.id.at.the court surveyed the statutory landscape and noted its agreement with those circuits that have held that the decision by an ij or the bia to grant or to deny a continuance in an immigration proceeding is not a decision specified under the relevant subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general.id.at alteration in original citations omitted accord ahmed,at.the court then stated 
although the presiding officer at a hearing traditionally has discretion to grant or to deny continuances requested by the parties appearing before him,we can not conclude that the decision to grant or to deny a continuance in immigration proceedings is specified under the relevant subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general.indeed,continuances are not even mentioned in the subchapter.we therefore hold that a b ii does not deprive us of jurisdiction to review decisions by ijs to grant or to deny continuances,which accords with our general presumption in favor of judicial review.see ins cyr,d stating that despite specific provisions,in immigration cases there still exists a strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action.
sanusi,at alteration in original footnotes omitted.
in our view,the second,fifth,ninth and eleventh circuit courts of appeals have adopted the correct reading of a b ii.as we have previously observed,t he key to a b ii lies in its requirement that the discretion giving rise to the jurisdictional bar must be specified by statute.in other words,the language of the statute in question must provide the discretionary authority before the bar can have any effect.soltane,at quoting spencer enterprises,united states,cir.indeed,to specify means t o state explicitly or in detail,american heritage college dictionary ed,and a states nothing at all about an ij power to grant or deny a continuance.
in,the sixth circuit agreed with the eleventh circuit that we have jurisdiction to review the ij denial of a continuance but reached this conclusion through different reasoning,at.in contrast to the eleventh circuit,the sixth circuit interpreted the power to conduct proceedings conferred by a to include the power to deny a continuance.id.at noting that a necessary component of the power to conduct proceedings is the ability to decide when it is appropriate to delay a proceeding until a later time.therefore,unlike the eleventh circuit,the sixth circuit concluded that the power to deny continuances is indeed specified under this subchapter within the meaning of a b ii.id.however,the sixth circuit agreed with the ultimate holding of the eleventh circuit on the ground that a b ii only stripped this court of jurisdiction for decisions within subchapter ii it left to the discretion of the attorney general.id.emphasis added.the abu khaliel court held that because a leaves discretion to the ij rather than the attorney general,we have jurisdiction to review the ij decision to deny a continuance.id 
although we agree with the sixth circuit that we have jurisdiction to review an ij denial of a continuance,we do not adopt its conclusion that an ij discretionary power to grant or deny a continuance is specified in a.because the ij authority to rule on a continuance motion is not specified under to be in the discretion of the attorney general,we hold that a b ii does not deprive this court of jurisdiction.
because the bia summarily affirmed without opinion,we review the ij decision.dia ashcroft,cir en banc.an ij may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.we review the denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion.ashcroft,cir.the ij decision should be reversed only if it is arbitrary,irrational or contrary to law.tipu ins,cir.in,we explained that t he question whether denial of a continuance in an immigration proceeding constitutes an abuse of discretion can not be decided through the application of rules it must be resolved on a case by case basis according to the facts and circumstances of each case,at quoting baires ins,cir.
khan argues that the denial of his continuance request amounted to an abuse of discretion and deprived him of due process of law because it effectively denied him the benefit of seeking to adjust his status under the life act.khan contends that a continuance was warranted because he had done everything in his power to comply with the law and should not have been faulted for the government delay in processing his wife labor certification.
khan cites subhan ashcroft,cir,for the proposition that the ij abused his discretion in refusing to grant a continuance.the court in subhan assumed,without deciding,that a b ii generally bars jurisdiction over the denial of a motion for a continuance.id.at the court held,however,that the jurisdictional
