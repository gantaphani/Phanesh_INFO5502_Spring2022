in june,agent gil balli,a narcotics investigator with the federal bureau of investigations,received a tip from a cooperating informant that an illegal alien named mauricio borjas,who resided at an apartment at a plaza,was involved in activity in and around omaha,nebraska.the informant described the suspect as a hispanic male in his with a slim build who drove either a green compact car or a black grand prix or grand am.balli relayed this information to agent ovidio de la fuente of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement to advise him that borjas may be in the united states illegally and to request that de la fuente check into the individual immigration status.
agent balli and another officer set up surveillance on a black grand prix parked outside the suspect apartment building.shortly thereafter,an individual matching the suspect description left the apartment building,got into the black grand prix,and drove out of the parking lot at a high rate of speed.the officers followed the suspect in their unmarked cars,and,after observing several instances of erratic driving,agent balli activated his lights and siren to initiate a traffic stop.
balli approached the vehicle,displayed his badge,and identified himself in spanish and english.upon request,the driver produced identification,although it differed from the name that the informant had provided speaking in spanish,balli told the suspect that he had reason to believe that he was in the country illegally and involved in illegal activity.the suspect agreed to cooperate with the investigation and went with agent balli to his unmarked police car.after again advising the suspect of the nature of the investigation,balli requested permission to search the vehicle,as well as the suspect apartment and the accompanying detached garage.the suspect agreed,provided agent balli with directions to the apartment,and identified which keys on his key ring opened the apartment and garage.a contemporaneous search of the suspect uncovered in cash,one,and one.
while balli was speaking with the suspect,agent de la fuente arrived on the scene,having conducted a records check on mauricio borjas.as part of that records check,de la fuente obtained a copy of borjas file,complete with a set of fingerprints,a photograph,and a list of the four different aliases mauricio was known to have employed.upon his arrival at the scene,de la fuente showed the photograph to balli and the suspect.according to de la fuente,the suspect just put his head down when he was presented with the photograph,despite previously maintaining that his name was victor sanchez.
while was being transported to the police station,agent balli and several other omaha police officers left the scene and proceeded to his apartment.there,they knocked and announced their presence and after receiving no response used keys to enter the apartment and begin their search.inside a kitchen cabinet,officers found a digital scale and a cell phone box containing approximately grams of methamphetamine.inside the kitchen drawers,officers found two identification cards bearing the names jabier gamez and jose eladio,a cox communications bill addressed to girlfriend,maria garcia,and titles to a green ford thunderbird lx and a black pontiac grand prix.on a shelf in the bedroom closet,officers found a caliber handgun along with a letter addressed to maria garcia and mauricio borjas garcia.inside a cardboard box in the detached garage belonging to the apartment,an officer found a ziplock bag containing grams of crystal ice methamphetamine along with some drug packaging materials.
the handgun and the packaging materials were sent to the douglas county crime lab to be tested for fingerprints.the investigator conducting the test was unable to recover any identifiable fingerprints from the packaging material but was able to lift a latent fingerprint from the trigger guard on the gun.the fingerprint matched that of an individual named luis,who the investigator learned went by several aliases,including victor.upon comparing the fingerprint cards of luis and,the investigator determined that the fingerprints were identical.
about a week after the traffic stop,de la fuente transported to the immigration office for further questioning.during that interview,told de la fuente that he had last entered the united states in january and had been continuously unemployed since that time.de la fuente also took two pieces of identification from a mexican driver license issued may,and a mexican voter card de la fuente observed certain irregularities with both cards and concluded that they were both counterfeit.during a investigation,agent de la fuente sent the fingerprint card from file to the omaha police department crime lab for a comparison with fingerprints the comparison showed that they were a match.
