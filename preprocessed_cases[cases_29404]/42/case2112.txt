in june of,while mansour was still incarcerated,the ins commenced deportation proceedings against him by issuing an order to show cause.the ins claimed that mansour was deportable under ina a now codified as amended at a b i.section a states that any alien convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance,except for a single offense of marijuana possession under grams,is deportable.mansour admitted the ins factual allegations and conceded his deportability,as well as the ins classification of him as an aggravated felon.
in august of,the ins moved to administratively close the deportation proceedings pending a possible resentencing of mansour,and the immigration judge ij granted the motion.the record does not reveal whether or not mansour was actually resentenced.by the time deportation proceedings resumed,mansour had retained new counsel who was not familiar with had happened on the resentencing issue.
the ins filed a motion to recalendar the deportation proceedings.shortly after mansour was released from prison in july of,the ij granted the motion.the ij subsequently found mansour deportable as charged.mansour argued that,although he was deportable,he was eligible for discretionary relief under ina c.c.section c,later repealed,provided that a liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general.c repealed.an alien who ha d been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and ha d served a term of imprisonment of at least years,however,was ineligible for such discretionary relief.id.
in january of,the ij ordered mansour deported to iraq,finding that he was statutorily ineligible for c relief because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony and had served at least five years in prison.the bia affirmed the ij decision.mansour petition for review was subsequently dismissed by this court for lack of jurisdiction.see mansour ins,cir.section a of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,provides that a ny final order of deportation against an alien who is deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in the immigration and nationality act section a a iii,b,c,or d,or any offense covered by ina section a a ii for which both predicate offenses are covered by ina section a a i,shall not be subject to review by any court.id.at citation omitted brackets in original.because the ins issued mansour final order of deportation as a result of a felony conviction covered by a of aedpa,this court held that it had no jurisdiction to review his deportation order.see id.at.

in june of,mansour became engaged to vanessa ramos,a citizen from el paso,texas.mansour claims that while he was in el paso attending his engagement party,he became drunk and accidentally travelled to mexico.when he attempted to reenter the united states,mansour falsely declared that he was a citizen.border officials soon discovered that he was not a citizen.although mansour was a legally admitted permanent resident when he first came to the united states in,the final order of deportation resulting from his drug conviction rendered mansour inadmissible.mansour was then paroled into the united states,where he pled guilty in june of to one count of making a false claim of citizenship,in violation of.he received a sentence of six months home detention and three years probation.

the dhs,which took over the functions of the ins in,argued that mansour motion should be denied pursuant to k,which excludes from eligibility for special relief a liens issued a final order of deportation or removal who then illegally returned to the united states.in may of,the bia denied the motion,concluding that there were no deportation proceedings to reopen because mansour brief foray into mexico had effec
