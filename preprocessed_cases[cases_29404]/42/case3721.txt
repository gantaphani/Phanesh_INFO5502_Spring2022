ramos was born and raised in puerto cortes,honduras.ramos problems with the began in january,when he was sixteen years old.during his first encounter with the,a gang member approached him and a friend outside of ramos home.the member told them that it was time to join,took out a gun,and told the boys to come with him to rob some people.when ramos and his friend did not respond or move,the man warned them that if they wanted to live,he would be waiting.later that year,another member returned to ramos and his friend and again delivered the message that it was time to join.the gang member showed the boys his gun and told them that they could either join the or be killed.
in january,ramos fled to mexico.he was detained by mexican authorities and returned to honduras the same month.after ramos returned to puerto cortes,members threatened to kill him or a member of his family if he tried to escape from honduras again.he avoided further encounters with the before fleeing honduras in may.
ramos entered the united states on may.on may,he was detained by border patrol agents and served with a notice to appear,charging him with removability for being an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.ramos conceded removability and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat during his removal hearing,ramos testified about his three encounters with members in puerto cortes.
in response to questioning by the ij,ramos also testified that he did not join the because he would have lost contact with his family,would have been obligated to steal,and probably spend most of his life in jail.of the group of ramos friends who were recruited by the,two joined the gang,one or two were killed,others were hiding in honduras,and some fled to the united states.ramos was afraid that members would kill him,but he never went to the police for help.two of ramos brothers,ages nineteen and twenty,remained in puerto cortes.the did not bother the old,but started looking for the old after ramos fled.ramos old brother lives with his parents,but has not had problems with the gang because he is too young.a old sister also lives with ramos parents.
the ij found ramos credible,but,even after crediting his testimony as true,denied asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.the ij held that ramos could not establish eligibility for asylum or withholding because he did not face persecution on account of his membership in a cognizable social group or any political opinion.alternatively,the ij held that ramos did not suffer past persecution or have a fear of future persecution the ij further denied cat relief because ramos did not face a clear probably of torture in honduras.

congress vested the attorney general with the discretion to grant asylum to refugees.b a.the ina defines refugee,in relevant part,as 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
a a.while asylum is a discretionary form of relief,the attorney general must grant withholding of removal if the alien life or freedom would be threatened in the country to which he would be removed because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a.thus,to be eligible for either form of relief,the persecution feared must be on account of one of the five protected grounds.hanna keisler,cir asylum nadarajah gonzales,cir withholding of removal.
particular social group 
ramos claims for asylum and withholding of removal are predicated,primarily,on his membership in a particular social group young honduran men who have been recruited by the,but who refuse to join.recently,the bia issued a precedential opinion in which it held that salvadoran youth who have resisted gang recruitment are not a cognizable social group under the ina.in re,at.
we have not yet had the occasion to address whether the bia determination,in a published disposition,that a group is or is not a particular social group is entitled to chevron deference.after holder,cir en banc,however,our path is clear.
generally,w e accord chevron deference where there is binding agency precedent either in the form of a regulation or a published bia case.mukasey,cir quoting kharana gonzales,cir,overruled on other grounds by gonzales,cir en banc.chevron deference to published bia decisions is appropriate as the bia gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication,at.quoting ins,d.
we review de novo the bia interpretation of a statute other than the ina,but whether an offense constitutes a crime of moral turpitude is governed by the same traditional principles of administrative deference we apply to the board interpretation of other ambiguous terms in the ina,at.in,we explained that moral turpitude is an ambiguous phrase,id.at,and noted previous decisions in which we deferred to the bia construction of other ambiguous terms,including particularly serious crime,gonzales,cir,conviction,ins,cir,and persecution,fisher ins,cir en banc,at.because we defer to precedential bia decisions that give meaning to ambiguous terms,we there held that the bia construction of moral turpitude though a process of adjudication is entitled to chevron deference.id.at.
particular social group,like moral turpitude,is an amorphous term.the bia defined the general contours of the term in in re acosta as a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic,bia,overruled on other grounds by in re mogharrabi,bia.the bia has expanded on this definition by directing courts to further consider a group social visibility and particularity.in re,bia.nonetheless,the bia must still determine in the first instance whether a specific group is a particular social group within the meaning of the ina.gonzales thomas,d per curiam.the matter requires determining the facts and deciding whether the facts as found fall within a statutory term.id.at.because the bia determination that a certain group is or is not a particular social group is part of its effort to give an ambiguous statutory term concrete meaning,we hold that chevron deference is due
