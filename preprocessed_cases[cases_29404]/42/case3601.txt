in april,raul villavicencio was ordered removed to mexico by an ij.the ij ordered villavicencio removed on the grounds that a conviction for spousal battery under california penal code section e was a conviction for a crime of domestic violence,making him removable under a e i and a conviction for violating a court protection order under california penal code section a was a conviction for violating a protection order that involved threats of violence,making him removable under a e ii.the ij determined that,because of a conviction for making criminal threats under california penal code section,which the ij determined to be an aggravated felony,villavicencio was not eligible for relief of cancellation of removal,voluntary departure,or adjustment of status.
in the process of reaching his conclusions that villavicencio should be removed and was not eligible for the relief sought,the ij explained to a group of aliens including villavicencio that each alien had the right to appeal,stating,if you do not like the decisions we make,there is a higher court that is called the bia that reviews the decisions of ijs like myself but o nce you waived your right to appeal,you can not appeal that decision in the future.villavicencio,through counsel,twice reserved his right to appeal.the ij removal order similarly recited that villavicencio had reserved the right to appeal.but no appeal to the bia was thereafter pursued.villavicencio was removed to mexico on may.
villavicencio was indicted in july on one count of illegal reentry after deportation in violation of on the basis of villavicencio prior removal to mexico in,and one count of making a false claim to united states citizenship in violation of.villavicencio filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,contesting the validity of the prior removal on grounds.he argued that neither offense relied on by the ij was a removable offense.not having appealed the ij removal order to the bia,villavicencio argued that he should be excused from d s exhaustion requirement due to ineffectiveness of his counsel and because the government could not show that villavicencio validly waived his right to appeal.he also argued that he was prejudiced by being improperly removed.the district court concluded that villavicencio did not exhaust his administrative remedies and could not show prejudice.the district court therefore denied the motion to dismiss the indictment on those bases.
at trial,the government called immigration and customs enforcement agent patricia vargas,the custodian for villavicencio immigration file,as a witness.through agent vargas,the government introduced a warrant of removal from villavicencio file.villavicencio objected to the warrant admission on the basis that it violated his rights under the confrontation clause because agent vargas had neither prepared the warrant of removal nor observed personally villavicencio removal.over villavicencio objection,the district court admitted the warrant of removal.villavicencio was convicted on both counts.
at sentencing,the government sought a enhancement to the advisory united states sentencing guidelines ussg calculation pursuant to ussg on the ground that villavicencio prior conviction under california penal code section for making criminal threats was a conviction for a categorical crime of violence.villavicencio argued that section was not categorically a crime of violence because it reached threats to property and threats to commit crimes that were only potentially capable of causing injury.the district court concluded that a violation of section was not a crime of violence and sentenced villavicencio to months in custody and three years of supervised release.villavicencio timely appeal of his conviction and the government timely of his sentence followed.
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment under when the motion is based on an alleged deprivation of due process in the underlying removal proceedings.united states,cir.to prevail in a collateral attack on the underlying removal order in a motion to dismiss,villavicencio must,as a threshold matter,show that he exhausted his administrative remedies.d see also united states,cir.
villavicencio concedes that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies.villavicencio urges us to excuse his nonexhaustion,however,contending that due process requires that noncompliance with d exhaustion requirement will only bar a collateral attack on a prior removal order if the defendant waiver of the administrative appeal was considered and intelligent.see,at see also united states,holding that due process requires judicial review of the underlying deportation proceedings when waiver of the right to appeal was not considered or intelligent.villavicencio contends that it is the government burden to demonstrate a considered and intelligent waiver by clear and convincing evidence,united states,cir,and that the government can not meet this burden because there is no evidence in the record that villavicencio understood his right to appeal and waived it.villavicencio argues that his counsel decision not to pursue an appeal can not be attributed to a considered and intelligent decision made by villavicencio villavicencio waiver argument does not follow,and fails to persuade us.villavicencio never waived his right to appeal to the bia at all rather,his counsel expressly reserved that right twice during the removal hearing but declined to exercise that right before expiration of the time to appeal.see except when certified to the board,the decision of the immigration judge becomes final upon waiver of appeal or upon expiration of the time to appeal if no appeal is taken,whichever occurs first.emphasis added.the ij instructed villavicencio that if you want to appeal your decision you must reserve your right to appeal.once you waived your right to appeal,you can not appeal that decision in the future.the ij later asked counsel,so you going to reserve appeal to which counsel responded,yes we will.the ij removal order was annotated to reflect that villavicencio had not waived his right appeal the word waived was crossed out from the phrase appeal waived,and reserved by alien was handwritten directly below.in light of villavicencio and his counsel unmistakable actions during the removal proceedings,we can not conclude,as villavicencio urges,that his and his counsel actions were tantamount to villavicencio waiving his appeal rights,much less that there was an ineffective waiver because villavicencio did not comply with d exhaustion requirement,and his waiver argument is inapposite and does not excuse the nonexhaustion,we hold that villavicencio may not collaterally attack the unexhausted removal order.
we review alleged violations of the confrontation clause de novo.see united states tuyet nguyen,cir.villavicencio argues that the warrant of removal is testimonial and that the government reliance on the warrant to prove that villavicencio was physically removed from the united states violated his constitutional right to confront an adverse witness.we have previously held that a warrant of removal is nontestimonial and that its admission therefore does not violate the confrontation clause,united states,cir.villavicencio contends that and its antecedents were abrogated by the supreme court decision in massachusetts,which held that certificates of analysis stating that a tested substance was cocaine were testimonial and could not be admitted without of the document author.id.at.we disagree that abrogat
