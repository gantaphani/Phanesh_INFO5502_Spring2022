petitioner gilberto santos quiroa seeks review of a decision from the board of immigration appeals bia finding that the rule applies to his application for suspension of deportation and bars him from receiving relief.for the reasons explained below,we agree with the bia that the rule applies to santos quiroa.accordingly,the petition for review will be denied.
background 
the legal landscape 
we begin with a primer on the principles of immigration law at play in this case,including a discussion of some important changes that took effect on april.
before april,a noncitizen could be placed into deportation proceedings under current law,they called removal proceedings.compare a b describing various classes of deportable aliens,with describing removal proceedings.per the,law,a noncitizen who entered the united states without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the attorney general or is in the united states in violation of this chapter or any other law of the united states is deportable.a b deportation proceedings were initiated by serving the noncitizen with a document known as an order to show cause osc.an osc put the noncitizen on notice of the allegations of deportability the government was making against him,and it directed him to appear at a hearing on those charges if a noncitizen failed to appear at his deportation hearing after having received notice of it,he could be ordered deported in absentia.see b a 
a noncitizen found to be deportable could apply for various forms of relief,including what was once called suspension of deportation.see a.to qualify,a noncitizen needed to show that he 
has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application,and prove that during all of such period he was and is a person of good moral character and is a person whose deportation would,in the opinion of the attorney general,result in extreme hardship to the alien or to his spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
id.a.the requirement of most import to this case is the first one that the noncitizen have been physically present in the country for at least seven years prior to applying for suspension of deportation.
in,congress passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div,stat,which took effect on april.concerned that aliens would often delay their deportation proceedings until they accrued sufficient continuous presence in the united states to qualify for relief from deportation,afful ashcroft,cir quoting suassuna,cir,as part of the iirira congress altered the suspension of deportation procedure by enacting what has become known as the rule.the rule provides,in pertinent part,that any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end when the alien is served a notice to appear b d 
that iirira referred to ntas but not oscs raised a question as to whether the rule applied to oscs at all.see afful,at.congress answered that question in the affirmative when it passed the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara,tit.ii,a,stat.see afful,at.nacara section set forth transitional rules regarding applications for suspension of deportation.one of these rules provided that the rule shall apply to orders to show cause issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this act.nacara a see also afful,at.
thus,following passage of nacara,the rule was explicitly applied to oscs.the effect of the rule is that a noncitizen ceases accruing time in the united states towards qualifying for eligibility for suspension of deportation upon the receipt of the osc charging him with being deportable.this represents a sharp break with the previous regime,under which a noncitizen continued to accrue time towards the continuous presence requirement even after having been placed into deportation proceedings.
whether and how the rule applies to santos quiroa takes center stage in this appeal.
santos quiroa deportation proceedings 
the facts of this case are generally uncontested.on july,gilberto santos quiroa,a native and citizen of guatemala,crossed the border into arizona.he did so without having been inspected by an immigration officer,making his entry in violation of united states law and rendering him deportable.santos quiroa was apprehended almost immediately,and deportation proceedings began the following with service upon him of an osc.the osc charged santos quiroa as being deportable for having entered the united states without inspection,and it indicated that a hearing would be scheduled and notice thereof mailed to an address santos quiroa had provided.
santos quiroa was released on bond a little over a week later,having told immigration authorities he would be living at an address his brother in providence,rhode island.notice of the deportation hearing was mailed to that providence address on august and instructed santos quiroa to appear before an immigration judge ij in phoenix,arizona,on december.although the notice had been sent by certified mail and the signed receipt was returned to the immigration court,santos quiroa was a on december.accordingly,the hearing proceeded without him.the ij found santos quiroa deportable as alleged in the osc and ordered him deported in absentia.a copy of the ij decision was mailed to santos quiroa at the providence address.this notice advised santos quiroa that the deportation order was final unless he filed a motion to reopen in accordance with the law.
santos quiroa case lay fallow for several years.in november at least according to santos quiroa appellate brief,which does not cite to the administrative record in support of this fact he was detained by immigration and customs enforcement ice,notified of the deportation order against him,and released with an order of supervision for the boston district.because the government does not contest this factual assertion,and it does not affect our analysis,we take santos quiroa at his word.
despite the order of supervision,santos quiroa case went dormant again,this time for more than a decade.over the next ten years santos quiroa got married and fathered two children.his immigration proceedings heated up again on september,when,represented by counsel,santos quiroa filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings with the immigration court in phoenix.in his motion,santos quiroa asserted that neither he nor his brother received the written notice of the december,deportation hearing.based on the alleged lack of notice,santos quiroa argued that his case should be reopened and a new hearing scheduled the department of homeland security dhs opposed santos quiroa request.
the ij denied the motion,finding that the written notice of the deportation hearing sent by certified mail to the address santos quiroa had provided constituted sufficient notice under the immigration and nationality act ina.santos quiroa appealed to the bia,which agreed with the ij take and dismissed his appeal on august.
nothing else happened on the case until ice detained santos quiroa on june.represented by new counsel,santos quiroa filed another motion to reopen.in this motion which we will call his second motion to reopen even though it did not mention the earlier motion,santos quiroa again said that his case should be reopened because he never received notice of the december,deportation hearing see b c ii providing that an in absentia order of deportation may be rescinded if,upon a motion to reopen filed at any time the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with this title.alternatively,santos quiroa asked the ij to reopen his deportation proceedings sua sponte on the grounds that he is eligible for discretionary relief from deportation,such as withholding of removal and voluntary departure.dhs again opposed,arguing the second motion to reopen is and without merit anyway.
although santos quiroa filed his second motion to reopen with the immigration court in phoenix,it was granted by an ij in puerto rico.that ij written order allowing the motion set forth a handwritten list of reasons that referenced various immigration forms,statutes,regulations,and bia decisions.the ij did not explain why any of these things led her to grant santos quiroa second motion to reopen.instead,the order simply states that he was eligible for certain types of relief from deportation.
dhs did not appeal the grant of santos quiroa second motion to reopen.on july,a different ij in arizona this time granted a motion to change venue to boston.
santos quiroa filed written pleadings with the immigration court on september,in which he conceded the factual allegations against him in the osc and admitted that he is removable.the pleadings indicated that he would be applying for asylum,withholding of removal,protection under the convention against torture cat and voluntary departure.santos quiroa also applied for suspension of deportation.this particular form of relief remained available to him despite its having been superseded by the newer withholding of removal procedure because it was on the books when deportation proceedings commenced against him in.
at a december,merits hearing before an ij in boston,santos quiroa withdrew his requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.this left for adjudication only his applications for suspension of deportation and voluntary departure.
in his memorandum,santos quiroa had argued that he was eligible for suspension of deportation because the law in effect in required a noncitizen to be continuously physically present in the united states for seven years before applying for suspension of deportation.santos quiroa said that he easily met this requirement because he entered the united states on july,and has not left since.dhs argued that the rule applies so that santos quiroa time in the united states is deemed to have ceased accruing on the day he was served the osc.since the osc was served on the day after he entered the country,dhs argues that for the purposes of suspension of deportation santos quiroa has accrued only one day of physical presence 
the ij agreed with dhs.first,he found that santos quiroa successful second motion to reopen prevented the in absentia deportation order from becoming a final order of deportation.then,citing aguirre holder,cir,the ij concluded that the rule applied retroactively to santos quiroa because his deportation proceedings remained pending on the date the rule went into effect.thus,he found the rule cut off santos quiroa physical presence after one day,rendering him ineligible for suspension of deportation and resulting in his application being pretermitted the ij also went on to deny santos quiroa request for voluntary departure as a matter of discretion,and ordered him removed to guatemala.
santos quiroa appealed the pretermission of his application for suspension of deportation to the bia he argued that the rule does not apply retroactively to him because,in his view,he had already been subject to a final order of deportation when the rule first came into effect.citing aguirre,at,santos quiroa argued that a pending case is one that is either active or temporarily inactive.then,relying on the ninth circuit otarola board of immigration appeals,cir,he concluded that his application for suspension of deportation must be governed by the law in effect prior to the advent of the rule,under which he had accrued well in excess of the seven years of physical presence required for him to be eligible for suspension of deportation.dhs stuck to its guns and maintained that the rule cut off his accrual of time towards eligibility for suspension of deportation at just one day.
the bia issued a written opinion dismissing santos quiroa appeal.although neither party had raised any issue with the ij allowance of the second motion to reopen,a footnote in the bia decision appears to call that decision into question.nevertheless,the bia indicated that it did not have jurisdiction to review it because dhs chose not to appeal the reopening of the proceedings.in any event,the bia stated that it would not presume that the ij granted the motion on legally defective grounds.it also went on to note that new pleadings were taken after the second motion to reopen had been granted,and that it would,therefore,treat the ij as having rescinded the december,in absentia deportation order.
despite all that,the bia proceeded to find that whether santos quiroa deportation proceedings were pending or final on april,was irrelevant to his eligibility for suspension of deportation.it began by citing in re nolasco tofino,for the proposition that the rule applies to each and every osc regardless of the date of service upon the noncitizen.the bia went on to note that while the ninth circuit has held that rule law applies to noncitizens whose orders of deportation became final before april,the first circuit had not yet decided the question.the bia,disagreeing with the ninth circuit,held that whether a noncitizen deportation proceedings were final or pending on april,has no effect on the rule.in its view,the plain language of the iirira mandates the rule application to all oscs,regardless of the date of issue and irrespective of whether deportation proceedings were pending or final on april.
turning its focus to santos quiroa,the bia concluded that n either the entry of the december,final order of deportation order sic,nor the july,order reopening the proceedings and rescinding the deportation order,has changed or negated the effect of the order to show cause on santos quiroa eligibility for suspension of deportation.because santos quiroa was served with an osc on the day after he entered the united states,the bia concluded that the rule made it so that he accrued only one day of the seven years of physical presence necessary to become eligible to apply for suspension of deportation.accordingly,it dismissed santos quiroa appeal.
santos quiroa then filed his petition for review with this court.
standard of review 
the bia written decision set forth its own analysis of the rule and discussed how it applies to santos quiroa case.while it did mention the ij findings at the outset,the bia conducted its own legal analysis and reached its own conclusion.accordingly,we review the bia decision,not the ij.see romilus ashcroft,cir ordinarily,this court reviews the decision of the bia.
santos quiroa petition for review focuses on the applicability and application of the rule to the uncontested facts of his case.his petition presents us with pure questions of law,triggering de novo review.aguirre,at.even under the de novo standard,however,we have recognized that because immigration law frequently implicates some expertise in matters of foreign policy,bia interpretations of the statutes and regulations it administers are accorded substantial deference.elien ashcroft,cir citing aguirre aguirre,d.as such,w hen a statute is silent or ambiguous we uphold the implementing agency statutory interpretation,provided it is reasonable and consistent with the statute.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
discussion 
the parties positions 
santos quiroa presents us with a argument as to why the bia erred in finding him ineligible for suspension of deportation.he begins with the premise that the rule applies only to deportation proceedings pending on or brought after april.he gets this idea from transitional rules implemented as part of the iirira that specify instances in which certain noncitizens remain subject to,rule,law.in santos quiroa view,noncitizens who were subject to a final order of deportation on april,are unaffected by the rule.
from there,santos quiroa moves on to the second part of his argument and says that his in absentia order was a final order of deportation.he says the bia erred when it found in that footnote mentioned above that his second motion to reopen resulted in the deportation order rescission.this misstep,santos quiroa urges,caused the bia to view the deportation proceedings against him as pending on april,and incorrectly apply the rule to his request for suspension of deportat
