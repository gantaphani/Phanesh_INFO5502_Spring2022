sundar krishnapillai sundararajan,a native and citizen of sri lanka,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals the bia or board sustaining the denial of his requests for asylum,restriction on removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture.based on his own experiences in sri lanka and on the adverse treatment of other ethnic tamils like himself,sundararajan contends that he faces likely persecution at the hands of both the sri lankan authorities and terrorist insurgents if he is forcibly returned.however,the immigration judge found sundararajan testimony regarding his own experiences to be incredible and denied his claims based largely on the adverse credibility finding,and the board affirmed that decision.because the ij decision,as supplemented by the board,is supported by substantial evidence and is not tainted by any legal error,we deny sundararajan petition for review.
sundararajan requests for relief are founded on a belief that he is at risk of harm from both the armed forces of the sri lankan government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte,a terrorist organization based in northern sri lanka that for more than thirty years has been waging a violent campaign to create an independent state for sri lanka tamil minority.sundararajan,himself an ethnic tamil,gave the following account of the events that brought him to the united states in his testimony and in the narrative statement attached to his asylum application.
sundararajan was born in in navatkuda,a town in the batticaloa district in eastern sri lanka.he has worked both as a farmer and heavy truck driver.he married in and now has three children,aged five through thirteen.his wife and children remain in sri lanka.
in or,sundararajan and his family lost their home and most of their belongings in the midst of heavy fighting between the ltte and the sri lankan army.for a time,they lived in a refugee camp in nearby vantharumoolai,but their fear of random arrests and detention by the sri lankan army eventually led them to depart for the coastline village of navalady.the devastating tsunami of december took the life of sundararajan brother and destroyed the hut his family was living in,along with what few possessions they had left.
in the wake of the tsunami,sundararajan and his family including his parents left the coastal region and eventually relocated inland to an area then controlled by the ltte.for a year,they lived there in peace.but then fighting broke out between the ltte and the sri lankan military,people living in the area became subject to arrest and torture by the army,and the government imposed an economic embargo on this and other areas controlled by the ltte.to help maintain its control of the area,the ltte organized a compulsory training program,in which at least one member of each family was expected to participate.sundararajan testified that he was contacted on multiple occasions about taking the training and at first demurred.eventually,he felt that he had no alternative but to agree.after telling the ltte that he would participate in the training,he advised his parents and his wife to move to an area and told them that he would join them when he escaped from the ltte.on the following day,a date in april,the ltte picked him up and took him to a training camp at kokati cholai,a rural area.the camp was surrounded by a fence and patrolled by armed guards.sundararajan testified that after spending two days in the camp,he managed to get away at four in the morning by telling the guards one of whom he knew that he was going out to buy cigarettes at a nearby shop that opened at that early hour.he left the area and joined his family in arasady,a zone,where a priest gave them shelter in a church.he spent one or two months there.but the ltte came looking for him,and sundararajan wife was warned that he would be killed if he did not report back to an ltte political office.
with his wife and parents urging him to flee sri lanka for his own safety,sundararajan by himself to colombo,on the west coast of the country.there he stayed in a private lodge for nearly a month,until he was arrested in a by sri lankan police.despite his protestations to the contrary,he was accused by the authorities of being an ltte member and was beaten into unconsciousness.after seven or eight days in police custody,he was finally released when his wife arrived with documents showing that he was married with three children and convinced the police that he was not an ltte member.
seeing the arrests and abuse that other young tamils like himself were experiencing in colombo,sundararajan decided that he could not remain there.a friend arranged temporary employment for him in singapore,and he left sri lanka on september.but on arrival in singapore,he discovered that he could remain for no longer than two weeks.sundararajan met with an agent,who in exchange for provided him with a forged passport and made arrangements for him to travel to canada via the united states.he was told that if he was stopped by immigration officials in the,he could always ask for asylum.
sundararajan flew to the united states via seoul,south korea on a forged singaporean passport.he arrived in this country on october.in response to questioning by customs officials,sundararajan said that he was a tourist on his way to canada.but when officials determined that his passport was fraudulent,sundararajan admitted that he was fleeing sri lanka and had purchased the false passport for.he was refused admission into the united states and was taken into custody.he subsequently obtained counsel and filed a form application for relief in the form of asylum,see,restriction on removal,b a,and withholding of removal pursuant to the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,cat.his application was referred to an immigration judge ij,who conducted an evidentiary hearing in january.sundararajan was the sole witness at that hearing.
in addition to his testimony before the ij,sundararajan offered several documents to show that he and his family had been the targets of abuse in sri lanka.these materials were sent to the united states by sundararajan wife,who was contacted by sundararajan cousin at the behest of his counsel.not included among the documents was any statement from sundararajan wife,although she had been a witness to some of the events described in his asylum application and testimony,including his forced enrollment in ltte training and his detention in colombo.when questioned on this point by the ij,sundararajan would testify that he was not in regular contact with his wife,and although he knew her whereabouts in sri lanka,it would take at least fifteen days for a letter to reach her.
the documents forwarded by sundararajan wife included the following.a translated extract from the information book of a police station in sri lanka describes a complaint that his wife filed with the police following his departure from sri lanka.sundararajan wife alleged that people had come to her residence looking for her husband in previous weeks.in one instance,some men came to the residence at ten in the evening,woke everyone up,demanded to know her husband whereabouts,threatened her,and then left.she had also received telephone calls threatening the lives of herself and her family members.her husband,she said,had left the country due to the same type of harassment she and her children were experiencing.w e live with fear and insecurity,she stated.also submitted was a receipt indicating that a complaint of threat had been filed with the human rights commission of sri lanka at its regional office in batticaloa.we are told that the complaint was filed on sundararajan behalf however,the receipt does not reveal the content of the complaint.finally,there is a translated letter dated november,from the reverend father jeremiah arasarathinam,the director of a home for senior citizens in batticaloa.he indicates that sundararajan wife and three children had undergone tremendous difficulties during the past few years under the hands of an unknown armed group.their house had been damaged,they had moved their residence due to threats,and they had spent the last three months at the senior citizens residence as refugees.due to death threats given by some unknown group to sunthararajah sic,he fled the country due to fear about months ago and i have come to understand that he is presently in america.
also in the record is the december report of the united nations office of the high commissioner for refugees unhcr regarding from sri lanka.the report notes a general deterioration in the security situation in sri lanka during the preceding year due to an uprising within the ltte and an escalation in violence between the ltte and the sri lankan armed forces,with predictable consequences for the civilians who are increasingly being drawn into the conflict.the report also describes in some detail the in which ethnic tamils find themselves.
in addition to the situation of widespread insecurity and the impact of the armed conflict in the north and east,tamils in and from these regions are at risk of targeted violations of their human rights from all parties to the armed conflict.harassment,intimidation,arrest,detention,torture,abduction and killing at the hands of government forces,the ltte and paramilitary or armed groups are frequently reported to be inflicted on tamils from the north and east.
those suspected of ltte affiliation are at risk of abuse by either the authorities or paramilitary groups.on the other hand,they may be targeted for abuse by the ltte if they do not lend their support to the insurgents the ltte has been implicated in some targeted killings,mostly of tamils suspected of opposing the ltte.the report also notes the difficulties faced by tamils in and from colombo.in addition to being at heightened risk for security checks and the like by the authorities,tamils in colombo are especially vulnerable to abductions,disappearances,and killings.the report characterizes the overall situation in sri lanka as one of generalized violence and events seriously disturbing public order.for those citizens who have been singled out for abuse by the ltte,the report paints a grim picture.t here is no realistic flight alternative given the reach of the ltte and the inability of the authorities to provide assured protection.the point is made more emphatically with respect to tamils who,like sundararajan,hail from the north and east of sri lanka 
in relation to tamils from the north or east fleeing generalized violence,there is no internal flight alternative within the north or east given the situation of armed conflict.nor would it be possible safe to travel to other areas in light of the closure of the highway to civilians,lack of other travel routes,and the risks entailed in traveling out of the north and east.tamils who are able to reach colombo could be vulnerable to arbitrary arrests,detention and other forms of human rights abuses tamils have faced there.it may be noted that tamils originating from the north and east,in particular from areas,are perceived by the authorities as potential ltte members or supporters,and are more likely to be subject to arrests,detention,abduction and even killings 
footnote omitted.the report thus recommends that n o tamil from the north or east should be returned forcibly until there is significant improvement in the security situation in sri lanka.it makes the same recommendation for tamils from colombo.
the state department country report on human rights practices in sri lanka,makes some of the same observations as the unhcr report,without reaching the conclusion that tamils should not be returned involuntarily to the country.it acknowledges that the ltte has engaged in targeted killings,kidnapping,hijackings of truck shipments,and forcible recruitment,including of children.the report also acknowledges the abuses that occur on the part of the authorities,including arbitrary arrests and detentions most often of tamils and the endemic use of torture to extract confessions.impunity,particularly for cases of police torture,was a severe problem,in.although in far less detail and degree,the country report does acknowledge the particular hardships faced by ethnic tamils.it indicates of the internally displaced persons in sri lanka,some of them primarily tamils are unable to resettle due to ongoing conflict between the ltte and the government and the zones associated with that conflict.
various and sundry newspaper articles,communiques from human rights organizations,and internet postings submitted by sundararajan make similar points.
the adverse conditions these documents describe for the citizens of sri lanka,and for tamils in particular,are consistent with the experiences that sundararajan recounted in his asylum application and in his testimony before the ij.
but,after hearing sundararajan testimony and considering the other evidence he submitted,immigration judge gabriel videla denied his application for asylum and other relief in a cogent decision.t he most troubling point in this case is the respondent credibility and i have tried very hard to overlook the credibility problems present in this case and unfortunately i can not do so.the ij noted inconsistencies in sundararajan testimony as to the timing of two key events,both of which had occurred within one year of the january hearing.first,sundararajan had wavered as to whether he was picked up and taken to the ltte camp for training in march or april.and second,sundararajan testified that he was arrested by the police in colombo on august,but that date was off by several months from the date of may,that the ij derived from the chronology of events from sundararajan internment and escape from the ltte camp,to his brief reunification with his family,and then his relocation to colombo that sundararajan had set forth at the hearing.the inconsistency as to the date of his arrest struck the ij as particularly significant.now i can understand a discrepancy of a day or two,or even a month,but this is a serious discrepancy because it is over three months and,when the respondent was confronted with this,he really never came up with a responsive answer and,to me,this individual testifying before the court does not appear to be testifying from actual experience.judge videla also found sundararajan testimony that he had escaped from the ltte camp by telling the guards that he was going out to buy cigarettes implausible.
if these individuals were so intent in coming after the respondent that they made not one contact or two contacts,but three contacts,and they forcefully took him away with armed individuals and they put him in a camp surrounded by a fence and patrolled by their people who had weapons,i very respectfully find it difficult to believe that the respondent would just be allowed to go buy cigarettes through the front gate at in the morning and simply never go back.it does not make sense.
finally,the ij noted the inconsistency between sundararajan testimony that he left sri lanka on september,and the asylum application which his attorney had prepared and that he had reviewed and signed,which repeatedly indicated that he departed sri lanka on july.he rejected the possibility that the date on the application was a mistake,as sundararajan attorney suggested.based on these inconsistencies,the ij concluded that sundararajan was not a credible witness.
given sundararajan lack of credibility as a witness,the ij found it reasonable to expect that he would present additional evidence to corroborate his account,including for example a letter from his wife,who according to his testimony was a witness to some of the events he had described.but he had not done so,although such evidence was reasonably available to him.sundararajan had,for example,mentioned a letter he had received from someone in new york describing the difficulties his wife was experiencing in sri lanka.yet sundararajan had inexplicably thrown the letter away despite the fact that his asylum application was pending and he understood the need for documents supporting his claims.
notwithstanding the lack of credible evidence that sundararajan had experienced past persecution in sri lanka,the ij went on to consider the possibility that he might be persecuted upon his return to that country given his tamil ethnicity.the ij acknowledged that the situation for tamils in sri lanka is quite dire,but without additional evidence suggesting that sundararajan in particular would be singled out,the judge was unwilling to assume based on sundararajan ethnicity alone that he was likely to be persecuted.although the background evidence of human rights violations and torture in sri lanka was quite significant,the judge did not find it sufficient to establish a pattern and practice of persecuting tamils in sri lanka that would relieve sundararajan of presenting proof that he in particular would face such abuses upon return to his homeland.
judge videla concluded for these reasons that sundararajan had not proven that he had a fear of persecution in sri lanka such that he was eligible for asylum.because his claim for restriction on removal was subject to a higher burden of proof,it followed that he had not established his eligibility for that relief either.and because the judge had found sundararajan testimony lacking in credibility,his request for relief under the cat also failed.specifically,sundararajan had not shown that he was likely to be arrested upon his return to sri lanka and that,if he were arrested,he would be physically mistreated.
the bia sustained the ij adverse credibility determination.the board agreed with sundararajan that his inconsistent testimony as to whether the ltte took him to the training camp in march or april of was a minor inconsistency,most likely a slip of the tongue which,prior to enactment of the real id act of,stat,would not have justified an adverse credibility finding.even under the new legislation,we can not find that the applicant slip is sufficient to doubt his entire claim,although it could,in viewing the totality of the circumstances,provide additional evidence for an adverse credibility finding.but the board believed that the ij was fully justified in citing the discrepancy in sundararajan testimony as to the date of his arrest in colombo as a reason to doubt his credibility.the board rejected sundararajan contention that the ij,in reasoning that he should be able to accurately recall the date of so traumatic episode as his arrest and subsequent detention,was simply speculating as to the traumatic nature of that event.the very fact that the applicant relies on this incident to support his claim of fear from governmental forces in sri lanka is sufficient to conclude that it was a traumatic event for him,leading in part to his departure.the board similarly rejected sundararajan contention that the ij was speculating when he found the account of his escape from the ltte camp implausible.it is not merely speculative to say that the applicant claim of being forcefully removed from his home and forced to remain in a camp run by the ltte is at odds with his statement that he escaped when allowed to go to the store to buy cigarettes.finally,the board concluded that sundararajan had not adequately explained the discrepancy between his testimony and his asylum application as to when it was that he left sri lanka.all of these inconsistencies taken together are sufficient to support the immigration judge adverse credibility finding.
the board went on to sustain the ij demand for evidence to corroborate sundararajan account as well as his conclusion that sundararajan had failed to present adequate corroboration.in the board view,the ij had considered what evidence sundararajan had tendered,but found it inadequate to substantiate his story.in particular,the board noted that the background evidence of the civil strife and human rights abuses to which sundararajan pointed,although it was important generalized evidence of the types of abuses occurring in sri lanka,was not sufficient to rehabilitate his suspect credibility about his own past personal experiences.the board thus sustained the ij conclusion that sundararajan failed to prove he was the victim of past persecution.
the board also rejected sundararajan contention that,regardless of his own experience in sri lanka,he was entitled to relief in view of a pattern or practice of persecution of tamils in sri lanka.the board acknowledged the ongoing civil strife between the ltte and sri lankan armed forces and recognized that human rights violations do occur on a large scale in sri lanka,but it found the evidence of those abuses insufficient to establish a pattern or practice of persecution on the basis of race,ethnicity,or another protected ground.it also found the evidence insufficient to establish a likelihood that sundararajan would be tortured if returned to sri lanka.
finally,the bia rejected sundararajan contention that a remand was necessary because the ij had neglected to adjudicate the additional claim that he would face harm in sri lanka as a failed.the board found no error in the ij omission to address this claim specifically,even assuming that failed asylum seekers are a social group who could be said to share an immutable characteristic,such that they could claim a right to asylum.the board saw this claim as dependent on sundararajan credibility,and w e affirm the immigration judge adverse credibility determination.
we review the ij decision as supplemented by the board own analysis,bakarian mukasey,cir.we examine the ij factual determinations deferentially and will uphold them so long as they have the support of substantial evidence,ingmantoro mukasey,cir.at the core of both the ij decision and the board order upholding it was the determination that sundararajan had failed to show that he has a fear that he will be persecuted if returned to sri lanka.we will disturb that determination only if the evidence of likely persecution was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite degree of persecution.chatta mukasey,cir quoting ins,d.
adverse credibility determination 
as was true before the bia,sundararajan first challenge is to the ij determination that his testimony was not credible.he contends,contrary to the board decision,that the adverse credibility determination was unfounded,and in support of that contention he cites three aspects of the reasoning employed by the ij the board that he believes were flawed.first,the board represented that he contradicted himself as to the date of his arrest in colombo he originally alleged that he was arrested in may of,but later testified the arrest occurred on august.in fact,sundararajan points out,he never cited may as the month of his arrest,only august.he adds that the unhcr report supports his testimony that his arrest would have taken place in august second,he contends that the ij,in discounting as implausible his account of escaping from the ltte camp,mischaracterized his testimony and assumed facts that were not borne out by the record.in particular,the ij assumed that he had been taken forcibly to the camp and that the camp was secure,such that he would not have been permitted to simply walk out of the camp in order to buy cigarettes.in reality,sundararajan represents,he never testified that he was taken to the camp by force,and although the camp was both fenced and patrolled,he testified that people were free to come and go from the camp.third,although he acknowledges the discrepancy between his testimony and his asylum application as to the date of his departure from sri lanka,he insists that the discrepancy was adequately explained.he testified that he was in custody when his attorney prepared the application and consequently was only able to consult with his counsel over the telephone,thus suggesting that the mistake was simply the result of miscommunication or oversight rather than prevarication 
the ina,as amended by the real id act of,sets forth the parameters for the immigration judge credibility determinations 
considering the totality of the circumstances,and all relevant factors,a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on the demeanor,candor,or responsiveness of the applicant or witness,the inherent plausibility of the applicant or witness account,the consistency between the applicant or witness written and oral statements whenever made and whether or not under oath,and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made,the internal consistency of each such statement,the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record including the reports of the department of state on country conditions,and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements,without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim,or any other relevant factor 
b b iii.as the terms of the statute make clear,the ij is no longer required to link inconsistencies,inaccuracies,and falsehoods in a witness testimony to the heart of the immigrant claim before relying on those defects as a reason to discredit a witness testimony.mitondo mukasey,cir.the ij does remain obliged to distinguish between inconsistencies and the like that are material and those that are not.kadia gonzales,cir.obviously,the ij,having heard the testimony first hand,is far better situated to assess the credibility of a witness than we are.garcia ins,cir quoting estrada ins,cir.only in extraordinary circumstances will we upset his credibility assessment,musollari mukasey,cir.
having reviewed the decisions of the ij and the board along with the evidentiary record,we discern no basis on which to disturb the ij decision not to credit sundararajan testimony.to begin,there was an inconsistency in his testimony as to whether his arrest in colombo occurred in may or august.it is true that sundararajan never mentioned may as the date of his arrest,as the board suggested.it was,instead,the ij who derived that date from the sequence of events to which sundararajan had testified.but the ij inference in that regard was nonetheless grounded in sundararajan testimony,and the ij explicitly set forth the bases for inferring that sundararajan had been arrested in may.sundararajan has not shown that the ij calculation of the may date was,and we find that it is consistent with the chronology to which sundararajan testified.so when sundararajan testified that he was arrested in august,rather than may,he implicitly contradicted the chronology he had already set forth in his testimony.the unhcr report is of no help to sundararajan in explaining the discrepancy the report simply confirms that tamils were at heightened risk of security checks,arbitrary searches,harassment,and the like as the result of new governmental regulations imposed in april and december.the report supports the notion that sundararajan could have been arrested within the april to december time period,but it does not point to either may or august as the likely date.we also note that sundararajan confessed to confusion and an inability to recall the date of his arrest and the chronology of events leading up to it with specificity when pressed on this point by the ij.because of the tension i could remember it properly actually,i ca calculate the months because i was thinking clearly.i ca remember the months.however,his confusion,although understandable,does not ameliorate the doubts raised by the inconsistencies in his testimony,let alone compel the ij and the board to credit his testimony.
we also conclude that the ij was on solid ground in doubting sundararajan account of escaping from the ltte camp.it is true that sundararajan,both on by the government and during supplemental questioning by the ij,the confining nature of the camp.but when specifically asked by the ij as to whether he was taken to the camp against his will,he testified expressly that they forcibly took me.he also testified that the people who took him had weapons.moreover,the camp was,by sundararajan own account,both fenced and patrolled by guards.under those circumstances,the ij not unreasonably concluded that sundararajan and other guests of the ltte would not have been free to come and go as they wished,and that sundararajan would not have been permitted to leave the camp at,never to return.sundararajan himself described his departure using various forms of the word escape,which suggests that the ltte had him in its custody.
as for the discrepancy between sundararajan asylum application and his testimony regarding the date of his departure from sri lanka,the ij was by no means compelled to accept the explanation that the date on the application was a mistake owing to sundararajan inability to consult with his attorney in person during the preparation of the application.sundararajan counsel speaks the tamil language and on the application form itself verified that it had been read to his client in his native language,and sundararajan acknowledged that he had reviewed the application before signing it.as the ij pointed out,the date of his departure is discussed more than once in the application,and it consistently states or implies that sundararajan left sri lanka in july rather than september as he later testified,making it less likely that sundararajan would have overlooked any error,see also listing his last dates of residence and employment in sri lanka as july.
both the ij and the board accurately recited the governing criteria for credibility determinations,and the ij decision not to credit sundararajan,as affirmed by the board,is reasonable and consistent with the record evidence.perhaps a different factfinder might have credited sundararajan,but we can not say that it was unreasonable for judge videla not to do so.see balogun ashcroft,cir.
corroboration 
after concluding that sundararajan account of his experiences in sri lanka was not credible,the ij determined that it was reasonable to expect him to provide corroboration of the events to which he testified,including some sort of statement from his wife.sundararajan had failed to supply such corroboration,in the ij view,and that failure contributed to the ij conclusion that sundararajan had presented insufficient evidence to support the notion that he would be persecuted if returned to sri lanka.sundararajan faults this portion of the ij analysis for overlooking what corroborative evidence he did present to the court.he notes that the unhcr report and other background evidence he presented do substantiate the types of abusive practices by both the ltte and sri lankan authorities that he described in his testimony.and as for substantiation of his own allegations,he reminds us that he submitted proof that a complaint was made on his behalf to the human rights commission of sri lanka,a letter from reverend jeremiah arasarathinam,and an extract from a police station book.the ij decision was silent as to these three documents.finally,he contends that he adequately explained why he could not produce a letter or other evidence from his wife he testified that she had been staying with reverend arasaratnam in the past,but that,at the time of the hearing,she was moving from place to place in order to avoid the sri lankan armed forces and he did not know how to reach her.
given the modifications to the immigration and nationality act effected by the real id act,an immigration judge now enjoys substantial leeway to demand corroboration of an asylum applicant allegations whether or not the judge finds the applicant credible.rapheal mukasey,cir.only if such evidence is beyond the reasonable ability of the immigrant to obtain is the judge precluded from demanding corroboration.b eke mukasey,cir.
we find no error in the immigration judge expectation that sundararajan produce additional evidence to corroborate his account of past persecution.we note that the judge adverse credibility determination was made independent of the lack of corroboration only after he had deemed sundararajan,as we have discussed,that finding was not the judge look for corroboration of his account.it was not unreasonable for the judge to look for corroboration from sundararajan wife in particular,given that she was a witness to some of the harassment and coercion he allegedly experienced from the ltte and it was she who allegedly got him out of jail in colombo.although it is true that sundararajan seemed t
