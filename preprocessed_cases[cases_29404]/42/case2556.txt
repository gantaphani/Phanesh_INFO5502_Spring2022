feng dong,a native and citizen of china,claims that she was persecuted under china policy when chinese officials forced her to abort her pregnancy.she applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture.the immigration judge ij denied all relief,and the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirmed.the ij gave multiple reasons for denying dong petition,all ostensibly relating to credibility.because most of those reasons are either not supported by the record or are not central to her claim,we grant dong petition for review,vacate the ij decision,and remand for further proceedings.
dong,who is from fujian province,testified at her removal hearing that in september,when she was,she confirmed at a local hospital that she was one month pregnant.she then told her boyfriend,and they decided to get married.a week or two later,two men and two women from the village planning office visited dong at home and asked her to accompany them to the hospital,for the stated reason that they wanted to confirm that she was not pregnant.dong,her mother,and the four officials walked about to minutes to the hospital.there,not surprisingly,the officials learned that dong was pregnant.when dong refused to get an abortion,the officials told her that because she was not married and had not reached the legal age for marriage they would perform the abortion and then put her in jail.although dong told the officials that she wanted to keep her child,she underwent an abortion that day.
in response to questions from the ij,dong said that she did not know why the officials came to her house,but she speculated that they had been tipped off about her pregnancy by someone at the hospital where she had recently confirmed that fact.the ij asked dong why,if the officials already knew of her pregnancy,they would ask her to go to the hospital to check if she was pregnant.dong speculated that the officials used this as an excuse to get her to the hospital for the abortion.
in the end,dong did not marry her boyfriend.she remained in her hometown until january or february of,when she paid to a smuggler for a false green card,a social security number and passport,and travel to the united states.she made her way to hong kong and then flew from there to the united states.at the newark airport,immigration officials determined that she was not eligible to enter and detained her,finding that she lacked valid travel documents and had misrepresented her identity.the next day,during an interview by an officer of the former immigration and naturalization service ins,dong said that the purpose of her trip to the united states was for fun,but added that she feared returning to china because of the policy.at her hearing she explained that she was afraid to tell the truth to the interviewer because she did not trust the united states government.she also explained that she did not apply for political asylum at the airport because she did not know the law in the united states.
dong testified at her hearing that she did not want to return to china because she did not want to be persecuted again.dong believed that she would be imprisoned in china because i came into the united states illegally and that way it violated their regulation.also,she thought that she would be jailed because after she left china she was not present for the required annual pregnancy check in her hometown.
the ins initiated removal proceedings.in october,dong requested a change of venue to chicago.with that request,dong attorney represented that she sought asylum,but he did not file a formal asylum application for her until july.by then,more than a year had passed since dong arrival in the united states,and as a result she concedes that she was statutorily barred from asylum relief.see a b.because dong has not argued here that her attorney informal statement satisfied the rule,we express no opinion on this point,or on the question to what extent an applicant for asylum in her position might perfect an existing application after the expiration of the period.
in december dong had a hearing before an ij on her request for withholding of removal,see b,and her claim under the convention against torture.on appeal,dong has abandoned her request for relief under the torture convention.the ij denied her request for relief.he recognized that if dong could prove that she was forced to abort a pregnancy,she would establish a fear of persecution.he concluded,however,that dong did not qualify for relief because her testimony was not sufficient to establish that it was more likely than not that she would be subject to persecution if she returned to china.the ij never actually said that he found dong not to be credible,but he commented that it was difficult to believe dong account relating to events central to her claim.the ij gave two reasons for concluding that her testimony concerning her abortion was not plausible 
the court does not believe that four village officials would bother to come all the way to the respondent house on foot in order to ask the respondent to go with them to the hospital to check if the respondent is pregnant.such does not seem to be plausible.it is not plausible that four village officials would walk to minutes from their office to the respondent house and then walk another to minutes to the hospital with the respondent for a routine hospital examination to find out if the respondent was pregnant.
the ij gave no reason for why he thought that the village officials might not be enforcing the population control rules,or why walks of this length in rural china were unlikely.
the ij also found that dong testimony was inconsistent with the state department country report in four ways.we note in passing that although the ij identified the document that concerned him as a country report,the language that he quoted in his order is from china profile of asylum claims and country conditions april,profile.first,dong testified that she,as a female,could get married around,but the ij noted that the profile states that the minimum age for marriage in china is for males and for females.the ij also found that the profile contradicted dong testimony,because the profile reported that in fujian province,the consulate general is not aware of any forced abortions of illegitimate children or children of couples with an early marriage on visits to fujian province,consulate general officials found that strong persuasion through public and other pressure was used,but they did not find any cases of physical force actually employed in connection with abortion or sterilization and it has been reported that if a couple conceived a child before the legal marriage,the child would be treated as if it were born out of wedlock.
the ij also said that he had particular difficulty with dong claim for six additional reasons she presented fraudulent documents upon entering the united states she did not apply for asylum at the airport she did not apply for asylum within a year of her arrival she did not corroborate her claim with supporting documents she did not submit an affidavit from her mother and she remained in china for four years after her alleged abortion without any problems.
dong appealed the ij decision,and the bia summarily affirmed.
dong is eligible for withholding of removal if she can show that there is a clear probability that she would be persecuted if forced to return to her native country.ins stevic,d see b lin ashcroft,cir.if dong can establish that she suffered past persecution,she is entitled to a presumption,subject to rebuttal by the government,that her life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the original claim.b i see zheng gonzales,cir zaidi ashcroft,cir vladimirova ashcroft,cir.dong alleged that she was persecuted based on her forced abortion.congress has expressly addressed forced abortion in,which states that a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.see also zhang ins,cir.thus,if the ij had credited dong claim that she was forced
