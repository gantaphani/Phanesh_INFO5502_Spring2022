this appeal is another chapter in the history of immigration proceedings involving edy uzor edy.specifically,this appeal involves the somewhat confusing intersection between edy own ongoing efforts to avoid removal to nigeria and the separate efforts of her united states citizen son,chy chy ikenokwalu chy chy,to secure an immediate relative visa on her behalf.because common issues arise at the intersection of these separate proceedings,and because edy proceedings were reopened by the board of immigration appeals board based on developments in chy chy separate proceedings,we have consolidated edy and chy chy appeals.
background 
although edy entered the united states in and has changed status numerous times including twice being awarded permanent resident status and twice having that status revoked,we do not review the entirety of her saga in this opinion.rather,we begin our discussion of edy and chy chy cases in.we note,however,that decisions subsequent to are related to a board determination that resulted in a revocation of permanent resident status for edy.in that decision,the board found that edy had entered into a sham marriage with william horton,a man of purportedly diminished mental capacity,in order to secure immigration benefits.
chy chy instituted proceedings to obtain a visa for edy on april,by filing an petition for an immediate relative visa listing edy as the beneficiary.at that time,in edy own proceedings,there was pending before the board an appeal from an immigration judge ij decision finding edy removable and denying her requests for a stay of deportation or voluntary departure.on september,the immigration and naturalization service service in chy chy case initially granted chy chy petition to obtain an immediate relative visa for edy.on december,the board in edy case affirmed the ij denial of relief,finding that edy was removable to nigeria and ineligible for voluntary departure or suspension of deportation because she failed to establish that she was of good moral character.in the december,decision,the board referenced the fact that edy had unsuccessfully attempted to marry a man in the early and had subsequently entered into a sham marriage with william horton the man with diminished mental capacity in order to secure immigration benefits.edy filed a notice of appeal with our court on january.
on may,the service in chy chy case provided chy chy with a notice of intention to revoke the previously granted immediate relative petition for edy based on the information about the sham marriage that was revealed in the december,board decision in edy case.on july,counsel for chy chy submitted a letter to the service in response to the notice of intention to revoke.included with the letter were various affidavits,documents,and reports purporting to demonstrate that edy marriage to william horton had not been a sham marriage.also included was the result of a polygraph examination dated june,in which edy answered five questions regarding the legitimacy of her marriage to william horton.
on november,edy appeal from the board decision in her own case was submitted to a panel of our court for consideration.on january,we affirmed the board finding of removability,denial of voluntary departure,and denial of suspension of deportation.see ins,cir.in our opinion,we noted that edy had pending before the board a motion to reopen.she requested that we take judicial notice of her pending motion to reopen or otherwise accept documents related to her motion.we declined to do so because her motion was not part of the administrative record before our court.id.at the materials and arguments advanced by edy in support of her motion to reopen are beyond our limited jurisdiction.the motion to reopen in edy case was based on the immediate relative petition for edy that chy chy had procured through his own proceedings.
subsequently,on march,the board granted edy motion to reopen.the board in edy case determined that the approved petition from chy chy case comprised new evidence warranting a reopening of edy case to consider an adjustment of status for edy.the board order granting the motion to reopen did not reference the fact that the service had,on may,issued the notice of intent to revoke the immediate relative petition in chy chy case.
on august,edy received a hearing with an ij as directed by the board pursuant to the grant of her motion to service,acting in chy chy proceedings,revoked the newly granted immediate relative petition.the service stated that the revocation was based on the marriage fraud bar of c,which precluded the grant of immediate relative benefits to edy.in reaching this conclusion,the service did not rely on the board decision in which edy was found to have entered a sham marriage with william horton for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit.rather,the service relied upon the evidence submitted by counsel for chy chy and the evidence submitted in the case.evidence submitted in but not considered in included the results of the polygraph examination purportedly supporting edy claim that her marriage to william horton had been a bona fide marriage and not a sham.on august,chy chy filed a notice of appeal with the board concerning the revocation of the immediate relative petition.
on november,when edy was to have her hearing with an ij in her own case,edy attorney was unavailable due to a medical emergency.as a result,the ij received various exhibits but granted a continuance so that edy could proceed at a later date with the benefit of counsel.on april,the board in chy chy case affirmed the revocation of the immediate relative petition without providing chy chy a briefing schedule or hearing.on july,chy chy filed with the board a motion to reopen and establish a briefing schedule.
eventually,on september,edy had her hearing before an ij in her reopened case.at the time,as noted above,the board in chy chy case had affirmed the revocation of the immediate relative petition.also,chy chy had filed his motion to reopen in the case concerning an immediate relative visa for edy,and his motion to reopen was pending with the board.as a result of the fact that chy chy motion to reopen was pending,edy asked for a continuance of her own hearing,arguing that uncertainty surrounding chy chy case warranted further delay in her own,reopened case.on september,the ij in edy case issued an oral decision denying relief to edy and denying her request for a continuance.the ij was aware of the fact that chy chy motion to reopen was pending in chy chy case,but nevertheless determined that,because there was no currently pending immediate relative petition,edy was not entitled to an adjustment of status.the ij ordered edy removed to nigeria,stating 
t he court notes that under the circumstances because there is no valid approval,that the respondent is not eligible for adjustment of status.the government has also interposed and has argued to the board,previously,that the respondent is barred from a new visa in view of the fact that section c of the act,section c may be an impediment to the exercise of that discretion and the court notes further that the government has inferred here because of the respondent protracted conduct that the government believes that even if the respondent were to have an approved application in the adjustment aspect of the case,that there may well be an argument that the respondent does not merit the relief of the exercise of discretion in granting her application.at any rate,the court notes that at the present time the respondent is not eligible for adjustment of status because she does not have an approved pending before the court and therefore,the respondent request for a continuance is denied.the government request for an entry of an order of removal,at this time,will be granted.
edy appealed to the board,and on october,the board affirmed without opinion.
meanwhile,chy chy motion to the board to reopen in the case involving an immediate relative visa for edy apparently languished.chy chy and edy were represented by attorneys from the same law firm,and the pending motion to reopen in chy chy case was submitted on be
