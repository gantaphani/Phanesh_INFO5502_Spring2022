oscar adahir,a citizen of mexico,pled guilty to violating a and b by being unlawfully present in the united states after having previously been deported.he appeals his sentence,contending the district court erred in applying a increase in calculating the advisory sentencing range after concluding that a prior conviction for unlawful sexual contact under minnesota law was a crime of violence within the meaning of section b a ii of the federal sentencing guidelines also contends that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of b and are unconstitutional but acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by united states we vacate sentence and remand for because we agree that his prior minnesota conviction was not a crime of violence within the meaning of the guidelines.
entered a plea of guilty to violating a and b by being present in the united states after he had been deported.at the sentencing stage,the district court applied a enhancement under section b a ii of the sentencing guidelines to the base offense level of,after concluding that prior,conviction in minnesota for fourth degree criminal sexual was a crime of violence.the district court applied a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,and an additional one point reduction pursuant to the government motion,which produced an offense level of.criminal history category of iv resulted in an advisory sentencing range of to months.the district court had found that prior conviction for illegal after deportation warranted an increase under section b c but did not apply it,since the increase was greater the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,two years of supervised release,and a assessment.
we first consider argument that his minnesota conviction was not a crime of violence.he raises two issues.the first is that the district court impermissibly relied on certain state records in concluding that he was charged and pled guilty to a violation of subsection c of.ann,rather than to a violation of section with no specification of any of its numerous subsections.second contention is that even if he was convicted of violating subsection c,it is not a crime of violence.
section b a ii directs that i f the defendant previously was deported,or unlawfully remained in the united states,after a conviction for a felony that is ii a crime of violence a increase should be applied a crime of violence is defined in that section to include forcible sex offenses and any offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.
in determining whether a conviction was for a crime of violence,we consider each aspect of the offense definition,including alternative bases for conviction,and determine whether the least culpable act constituting a violation of that statute constitutes a forcible sex offense for purposes of.at least one subsection of the minnesota statute at issue criminalizes conduct that would not be a crime of violence accordingly,if was convicted only of a violation of section,our inquiry would end.but the government contends that the state records of conviction establish that he was convicted under subsection c of section.
when a prior conviction was based on a guilty plea,courts may consider the charging document,any written plea agreement,a transcript of the plea colloquy,any explicit factual finding by the judge to which the defendant assented,or a comparable judicial record to determine the offense for which the defendant was convicted contends that the district erred in considering the minnesota complaint against him because that complaint contains a police report describing alleged details of his offense,and it was signed by a police officer.
as a general matter,courts can not consider police records in determining the nature of a prior conviction however,under minnesota law,a complaint written by a police officer can be the charging document a complaint must be written and made under oath and with certain exceptions not pertinent here,proceedings on a minnesota complaint will not go forward without the written approval,endorsed on the complaint,of the prosecuting attorney authorized to prosecute the offense charged.a factual account,which would commonly be considered a police report,is contained in a complaint but is not evidence that can be considered at trial and courts should not consider it in determining the nature of a prior conviction.we may,however,consider the counts stated in the complaint to determine the offense with which the defendant was charged.
the record in our case contains the minnesota complaint against.after the complaint lengthy narration of facts,which is the equivalent of a police report,there is a paragraph in bold print giving notice that intentional failure to appear for a court appearance may result in additional charges.beneath that,four separate counts are set forth,including count,which charged with criminal sex or coercion,in violation of subd.c,penalty years.within count,it was alleged that o n or about october,and continuing through october,within the county of carver,defendant engaged in sexual contact with another person sic used force or coercion to accomplish the sexual contact.at the end of the complaint,there is a signature of the officer making the complaint,and there is a signature beneath a printed heading stating prosecuting attorney signature.this document is the charging instrument under minnesota law,and the district court did not err in considering it.
additionally in the record is a document titled certificate of conviction,which reflects that counts and against were dismissed but that he was convicted of count.the certificate of conviction references c as the and beneath the heading offense description states criminal sex or coercion.finally,the record contains a petition to enter plea of guilty in felony or gross misdemeanor case pursuant to rule that is signed by and in which he acknowledges that he has been charged with the crime of crim.sex.ii.these documents are sufficient to establish that was charged with and convicted of a violation of subsection c of.ann.we turn to whether a conviction under this subsection is a crime of violence within the meaning of the sentencing guidelines.
in,when was convicted in minnesota.ann.c provided 
a person who engages in sexual contact with another person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the fourth degree if any of the following circumstances exist 
c the actor uses force or coercion to accomplish the sexual contact 
sexual contact was defined to include 
the following acts committed without the complainant consent and committed with sexual or aggressive intent i the intentional touching by the actor of the complainant intimate parts,or iv the touching of the clothing covering the immediate area of the intimate parts 
force was defined as 
the infliction,attempted infliction,or threatened infliction by the actor of bodily harm or commission or threat of any other crime by the actor against the complainant or another,which a causes the complainant to reasonably believe that the actor has the present ability to execute the threat and b if the actor does not have a significant relationship to the complainant,also causes the complainant to submit 
coercion was defined as 
w ords or circumstances that cause the complainant reasonably to fear that the actor will inflict bodily harm upon,or hold in confinement,the complainant or another,or force the complainant to submit to sexual penetration or contact,but proof of coercion does not require proof of a specific act or threat 
if we were to consider only the minnesota statute definition of force,it would indicate that a conviction for sexual contact accomplished by force qualifies as a forcible sexual offense within the meaning of.however,the minnesota supreme court upheld a conviction under.c in circumstances that call such a conclusion into question.
