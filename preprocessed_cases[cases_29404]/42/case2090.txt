background 
statutory background 
this case hinges on the effect of the various amendments to and eventual repeal of ina c.two statutes are particularly relevant to this case the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which took effect on april,and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,which took effect in relevant part on april.in united states,cir,this court summarized the complex history of these statutes as follows 
prior to the enactment of the aedpa,c of the ina codified at c allowed the attorney general to exercise his discretion and waive the deportation of a lawful permanent resident alien,meeting certain requirements,who was excludable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony,except the attorney general had no discretion to admit 
an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years.
c ins cyr,d explaining that although c on its face only applies to exclusion proceedings,it had been interpreted as allowing lawful permanent residents to seek a waiver of deportation an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,however,would have remained eligible for discretionary waiver of deportation if he had served less than five years of imprisonment.c.
section d of the aedpa narrowed the attorney general discretion,prohibiting the attorney general from waiving the deportation of a lawful permanent resident,who was excludable by reasons of having committed any criminal offense covered in section a a iii aggravated felony,b controlled substance conviction,regardless of whether he had served five years of imprisonment.aedpa,d,stat.a a iii and b.
section of the iirira repealed c of the ina and replaced it with,which prohibits the attorney general from cancelling the removal of an alien who has ever been convicted of any aggravated felony.a iirira,a b,stat.with some exceptions,this provision did not become effective until april,and by its terms applied to removal proceedings that commenced on or after that date.id.at a.
despite the seemingly complete repeal of c relief effected by iirira,the supreme court determined in ins cyr,d,that c relief remains available for a certain group of aliens.the ninth circuit explained the effect of cyr and provided the following summary of the most recent developments in c history in abebe gonzales,cir 
i n the supreme court decided that c relief remains available for aliens who pled guilty prior to aedpa iirira and who would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.cyr,at.in august,the department of justice doj published proposed amendments to its regulations that were meant to codify the requirements for former c relief in the wake of aedpa,iirira,and cyr.august.the doj noted that,among other things,an applicant must,at a minimum meet the criteria that he is deportable or removable on a ground that has a corresponding ground of exclusion or inadmissibility.id.at.the final rule was published on september.f.
section f of the doj regulations is called the or rule and is designed to ensure consistency between the invocation of c in the context for which such relief was not initially intended and its invocation in the context for which such relief was initially intended.matter of wadud,i n,bia although of the ina has been interpreted to include availability for relief in deportation proceedings as well,the board has consistently held that section c can only be invoked in a deportation hearing where the ground of deportation charged is also a ground of inadmissibility.in its current form,the rule is the last of five independent grounds set forth in f that can result in the denial of an alien application for a waiver of inadmissibility.the text of the regulation reads,in relevant part,as follows 
an application for relief under former section c of the act shall be denied if 
the alien has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
the alien has not maintained lawful domicile in the united states,as either a lawful permanent resident or a lawful temporary resident for at least seven consecutive years immediately preceding the filing of the application 
the alien is subject to inadmissibility or exclusion from the united states under paragraphs a,b,c,e,or c of section a of the act 
the alien has been charged and found to be deportable or removable on the basis of a crime that is an aggravated felony or 
the alien is deportable under former section of the act or removable under section of the act on a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section of the act.
procedural background 
as an initial matter,the ij determined that morgan satisfied the first two requirements for c eligibility set forth in f he was a lawful permanent resident and had maintained a lawful domicile in the united states for at least seven consecutive years before he applied for c relief.f.the ij primary rationale for nonetheless finding morgan ineligible was that,a t the time of his plea,respondent conviction in ohio for aggravated assault was not a deportable offense.the ij reasoned that,w ithout a deportable offense,respondent did not need,and was not eligible for,c relief.in other words,respondent did not have any expectations of relief at the time that he pled guilty.the ij then cited the supreme court decision in cyr for the proposition that,s ince c relief was not available at the time of morgan plea,he can not seek c relief now.
morgan appealed the ij decision to the bia,arguing that the ij erred in reasoning that his crime was not defined as an aggravated of violence at the time of his guilty plea,and therefore he could not have pled guilty upon reliance of c availability.the bia rejected morgan appeal on two separate grounds.first,the bia noted that,s ince the issuance of the immigration judge decision,the board has held that an alien convicted of an aggravated of violence is not eligible for relief under section c of the act because this ground of removability does not have a statutory counterpart in section a of the act.citing matter of,i n bia,and matter of blake,i n bia.the bia also held that morgan is precluded from c eligibility because he pled guilty to his aggravated felony crime after the april,effective date of d of aedpa.citing h.morgan timely appeals the bia decision.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
where,as here,the bia reviewed the ij decision de novo and issued its own separate opinion,we review the bia opinion as the final agency determination.see grijalva gonzales,cir citing zaitona ins,cir.the question whether an alien conviction renders him removable is a,purely legal question the courts of appeal ordinarily must review such questions de novo.sanusi gonzales,cir brackets and ellipsis omitted.in contrast,we grant substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the ina and accompanying regulations.sad ins,cir.the bia interpretation of the statute and regulations will be upheld unless the interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.
