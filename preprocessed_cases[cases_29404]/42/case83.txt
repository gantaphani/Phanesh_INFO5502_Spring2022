petitioner marla panoto and her husband both indonesian citizens,petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming an order of an immigration judge ij denying her request for asylum.because the bia gave an insufficient explanation of why panoto failed to demonstrate that she suffered past persecution in indonesia,we grant her petition for review,vacate the bia order of removal,and remand the case for further proceedings.
facts background 
panoto is a christian from indonesia,a predominantly muslim country.according to the ij decision panoto testified that she experienced persecution as an indonesian christian and attributed the following incidents to her religious identity.
on christmas eve in,a member of panoto congregation found a black box outside their church.police officers determined that the item was a bomb and removed it before it could detonate.panoto testified that local authorities did not investigate the event further.
approximately six months later,in june,panoto was riding on a ferry boat when it was hijacked by muslim extremists.once aboard,the hijackers shouted for the christian passengers to come forward.panoto witnessed the militants slit an elderly christian woman throat,killing her.one extremist then yanked panoto by the hair and slapped her,commanding that she state her faith.panoto did not reply,and just as he was about to attack her,another hijacker called him away.
petitioners left indonesia shortly after the ferry hijacking,arriving in the united states at the end of september.the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against them in.panoto submitted her application for asylum in january.
both petitioners testified and submitted evidence at a removal proceeding on september.in an oral decision issued the same day,the ij deemed panoto statutorily ineligible for asylum because she had failed to apply within one year of arrival and had not demonstrated circumstances affecting her ability to meet the filing deadline.see a b,d.the ij observed that panoto manifested a penchant for misrepresent ation on asylum applications by submitting an application for asylum under a false name in and providing fraudulent documentation when she entered the united states in.assuming panoto offered credible testimony about the bomb outside her church and the ferry incident,the ij concluded that her account did not rise to the level of past persecution nor had she demonstrated that she would be persecuted if she returned to indonesia.the ij denied panoto application for asylum and granted her request for voluntary departure.
panoto appealed to the bia.bypassing the ij timeliness and credibility determinations,the bia presumed statutory eligibility and reached the merits of panoto application.the bia agreed that panoto mistreatment,even if credited,did not involve harm severe enough to potentially constitute persecution and that she had failed to present probative evidence establishing a fear of future persecution.the board affirmed the ij decision and dismissed panoto appeal.this petition for review followed.
ii.analysis 
where the bia affirms the ij ruling but adds its own discussion,we review both decisions.lin gonzales,cir.we defer to the ij findings of fact and the agency determination as to whether particular circumstances support a claim of persecution.decky holder,cir.we will uphold a decision so long as it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.thapaliya holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,we can not conscientiously affirm the agency determination if the evidence point s unerringly in the opposite direction such that a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.decky,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.consequently,we must remand the case where the agency fails to offer legally sufficient bases for its determination.sok mukasey,cir.
an applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of one of five statutory grounds race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a sunarto ang holder,cir.the petitioner must establish a causal link between the harm she suffered or expects to suffer and her statutorily protected ground.b b i.a showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that the applicant fear of future persecution is.b sunarto ang,at.
no precise definition of persecution exists,and the question of what constitutes persecution is resolved on a basis.ruiz mukasey,cir.we have repeatedly held that persecution,as the term is used in the immigration law,involves a level of harm that surpasses unpleasantness,harassment,and even basic suffering.sombah mukasey,cir quoting nelson ins,cir.after showing that the harm endured rises to that level,the applicant for asylum must further establish that government action or acquiescence caused or resulted in the mistreatment giving rise to her claim.orelien gonzales,cir.
neither the ij nor the bia addressed the government role,if any,in the two specific incidents of mistreatment that panoto suffered.instead,the ij and the bia held that the mistreatment panoto endured,even if credited,did not involve harm severe enough to constitute past persecution.making the same assumption of truthfulness as the ij and bia did,our question is whether learning that a bomb was planted outside one place of worship and,six months later,experiencing a violent hijacking at the hand of extremists could involve harm acute enough to establish past persecution.we conclude that these incidents are sufficiently extreme,close in time,and particularly targeted at christians to clear the threshold.
we have held that bona fide threats of death can involve harm severe enough to constitute persecution.un gonz√°les,cir remanding to agency for reconsideration of past persecution finding where petitioner presented evidence of one explicit death threat with perhaps one or more implicit ones amouri holder,cir observing that threats of murder easily qualify as sufficiently severe harm for purposes of persecution analysis.this is especially so when,as here,the assailant threatens the petitioner with death,in person,and with a weapon.sok,at.panoto presented testimony regarding two events.neither can be dismissed as a hollow threat,ang gonzales,cir,or merely ugly,discriminatory,and regrettable,susanto gonzales,cir.the christmas eve bomb planted at panoto church was a serious attempt to murder and inflict terror on parishioners.while panoto ultimately suffered only minor physical injuries during the highjacking,she also witnessed the murder of a fellow christian passenger in graphic fashion immediately before a militant seized panoto and demanded to know her religion.panoto reasonably understood that the militants intended to murder her next if she also identified as christian.in determining whether an act or acts involve harm potentially rising to the level of persecution,the ij and bia must take a realistic and mindful look at what transpired.
these events occurred close in time to one another and shortly before the petitioners left indonesia,in contrast to other scenarios considered by this court.for example,in sunarto ang,this court affirmed the bia determination that an ethnically chinese petitioner from indonesia failed to show harm severe enough to establish past persecution where the petitioner testified that a group of muslims beat his father in and a mob stabbed the petitioner during the jakarta riots.at.the two events,sixteen years removed from one another,were too isolated and sporadic to establish persecution,particularly where the petitioner suffered no further mistreatment in the nine years that he remained in indonesia after the riots.id.at see also thapaliya,at holding that petitioner failed to establish past persecution based on a single attack which occurred one year before he left for the united states and noting,isolated beatings have been commonly rejected as grounds for persecution kho keisler,cir observing that petit
