we consider here whether we have jurisdiction to review a decision by a member of the board of immigration appeals bia or board unilaterally to affirm without opinion a decision of an immigration judge ij pursuant to the bia streamlining procedures codified at e rather than to refer the case to a panel of the bia.
petitioner mirdash kambolli,a native and citizen of albania,seeks review of a july,decision of the bia affirming without opinion a november,decision of ij michael straus denying kambolli request for asylum,as well as for withholding of removal under section b of the immigration and naturalization act of ina,as amended,b,and the united nations convention against torture cat see in re kambolli,file no.a bia june,see in re kambolli,file no.a immig,hartford.
on appeal,kambolli argues that the ij erred in finding that kambolli neither suffered past persecution nor possessed a fear of future persecution and therefore was not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the ina the ij erred in denying kambolli cat claim and the board member who reviewed the ij decision erred in unilaterally affirming it without opinion,rather than referring it to a panel of the bia.we first address the merits of kambolli asylum,ina withholding,and cat claims and then examine whether we have jurisdiction to review the board member streamlining decision,which is a question of first impression in this circuit.
i.the ij decision to deny asylum and withholding of removal under the ina 
when the bia affirms an ij decision without opinion pursuant to the streamlining provision codified at e,we review the ij decision as the final agency determination.see,yu sheng zhang doj,cir.we first address kambolli challenge to the ij denial of his application for asylum.under the ina,the attorney general may grant asylum to persons meeting the definition of refugee.see b providing discretion to attorney general id.a defining refugee.we review an ij factual findings for substantial evidence.see,majidi gonzales,cir see also b b a dministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.
kambolli based his request for asylum on the following allegations,which are drawn from his application and his testimony before the ij.after the fall of albania communist government in,kambolli joined the democratic party,which contended with the socialist party for political supremacy in the country.active in democratic party politics,kambolli became a local party leader and eventually ran in his village for an office that he describes as being equivalent to an american mayoralty.he defeated the incumbent socialist party mayor,but the incumbent refused to surrender the office on the ground that he did not accept the results of the election.as required by albanian law,kambolli appealed to the region governor,a socialist party official who summarily rejected the appeal.because of local corruption,kambolli allegedly knew that recourse to the courts would be futile.
thereafter,kambolli returned home and there was threatened by four policemen who came to his house.the officers,one of whom kambolli recognized as a local socialist,told him to abandon his quest for office or leave albania otherwise,kambolli was informed,the police would damage him or his family.kambolli then moved with his family to another albanian city,where he stayed a few months,until coming to the united states and overstaying his visa 
in support of his claim that he suffered persecution,kambolli alleged also that his house was vandalized by socialist party operatives democratic party members are often harassed and occasionally killed on account of their political activity and he is a sufficiently party leader that he would be attacked if he returned to albania.in addition to the relevant testimony and newspaper articles recounting conditions in albania,the state department profile of asylum claims and country report was introduced into the record before the ij.
the ij found that the mistreatment kambolli allegedly suffered,while unfortunate,did not rise to persecution because there was no evidence in the record that he was at all harmed in albania for any reason.largely because kambolli and his family were left alone after moving elsewhere in albania,the ij determined that kambolli had no fear of future persecution,stating that there simply not enough evidence to show that he be singled out if he had to return to albania.accordingly,the ij rejected kambolli asylum claim and also denied his request for withholding of removal under the ina reviewing the ij legal conclusions de novo,we hold that the ij correctly denied kambolli asylum on a finding that the facts testified to by kambolli did not constitute persecution and that kambolli did not demonstrate a fear of light of the following facts established in the record there was a lack of physical harm to kambolli kambolli successfully evaded trouble by relocating within albania and kambolli only direct with authorities consisted of a single threatening meeting with local police see,fatin ins,cir alito,p ersecution does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair,unjust,or even unlawful or unconstitutional.
because kambolli did not demonstrate his eligibility for asylum,the ij did not err in determining that kambolli failed to meet his burden to establish entitlement to withholding of removal under the ina.see abankwah,at.
ii.kambolli cat claim 
as kambolli did not raise his cat claim on appeal to the bia,he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before the board and therefore has waived his cat claim on appeal to this court.see d a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.foster ins,cir w e require p etitioner to raise issues to the bia in order to preserve them for judicial review.quoting ins,cir emphasis and second alteration in original.kambolli petition for review must therefore be denied to the extent it seeks review of his cat claim.
iii.jurisdiction to review the bia member decision to affirm the ij order unilaterally 
kambolli argues that the board member reviewing his appeal erred in unilaterally affirming the ij decision without opinion pursuant to e,instead of referring the case to a panel.the argument is,in essence,that because the ij made significant errors,affirmance without opinion by a single board member acting alone under the board streamlining reference to a bia not appropriate.we consider here whether an aggrieved applicant challenge to a single member decision to dispose of a case unilaterally presents a reviewable question separate from the applicant general request for review of the underlying merits of the claims he presented to the ij.
origin,development,and practical details of the streamlining program 
the department of justice promulgated the streamlining regulations,which are codified at e,in response to a crushing backlog of immigration appeals.see executive office for immigration review board of immigration appeals streamlining,enacting streamlining rules and noting that bia received fewer than new appeals and motions in and received in excess of new appeals and motions in board of immigration appeals procedural reforms to improve case management,amending streamlining rules and noting that the pending caseload on september,totaled cases see also id.at raising concern that many appeals have been filed precisely to take advantage of the delay under the prior policy of referring all cases to panels,because cases have routinely remained pending for more than two years,and some cases have taken more than five years to resolve.the backlog has since been reduced by about half.see note,post.
the bia streamlining regulations for adjudicating those appeals of ij orders not dismissed for procedural default or similar reasons,those appeals receiving merits review by the bia are set forth at e.under the regulations,
t he board member to whom a case is assigned shall affirm the decision of the service or the immigration judge,without opinion,if the board member determines that the result reached in the decision under review was correct that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial and that 
a the issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel factual situation or 
b the factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.
conversely,the regulations provide that a case 
may only be assigned by the single member originally assigned to dispose of the appeal for review by a panel if the case presents one of these circumstances 
i the need to settle inconsistencies among the rulings of different immigration judges 
ii the need to establish a precedent construing the meaning of laws,regulations,or procedures 
iii the need to review a decision by an immigration judge or the service that is not in conformity with the law or with applicable precedents 
iv the need to resolve a case or controversy of major national import 
v the need to review a clearly erroneous factual determination by an immigration judge or 
vi the need to reverse the decision of an immigration judge or the service,other than a reversal under e 
e emphasis added 
the streamlining program has uniformly withstood challenges based on the due process clause,see yu sheng zhang doj,cir collecting cases from sister circuits upholding program and concluding that the regulations provide due process because even after streamlining,an applicant for asylum or withholding of removal remains entitled to a full hearing on his asylum claims,a reasoned opinion from the ij,the opportunity for bia review,and the right to seek relief from the courts see also,hang kannha yuk ashcroft,cir falcon carriche ashcroft,cir.our sister circuits have split,however,on the question of whether courts of appeals are vested with jurisdiction to review the board decision to have a particular case decided by a single member rather than by a bia panel compare ngure ashcroft,cir decision to streamline a particular case is committed to agency discretion and not subject to judicial review,and tsegay ashcroft,cir concluding that appellate review is precluded because bia summary affirmances provide no rationale,the regulations were not intended to grant aliens substantive rights,and review would be impractical and would defeat the streamlining purpose with smriko ashcroft,cir remanding case to bia for panel review,and haoud ashcroft,cir holding that,in a case in which a decision without opinion left unclear whether affirmance was based on an application discretionary ground for denial that can not be on the may be of appeals can not know if it possesses jurisdiction and therefore must remand to bia for explanation of ratio decidendi,and chong shin chen ashcroft,cir remanding a decision without opinion to the bia for determination of a novel legal issue by a panel of the bia.
b.our review of a bia member affirmance without referral to a panel 
the threshold question we must address is what recourse a petitioner has,if any,upon a board member decision to resolve an appeal himself and not to refer the case to a panel.
we observe preliminarily that an alien right to an administrative appeal from an adverse asylum decision derives from statute rather than from the constitution.yu sheng zhang,at noting that e ven a criminal defendant has no constitutional right to appeal citing furman united states,cir.kambolli is therefore afforded an opportunity to appeal the ij decision only because congress and the attorney general have chosen to provide an appeals process by statute and regulation.
the supreme court has held repeatedly that,in general,decisions by administrative agencies are subject to judicial review,see lincoln vigil,d discussing basic presumption of review under the administrative procedure act apa quoting abbott labs.gardner,d,and decisions made pursuant to the ina are often subject to this general rule.see ins cyr,d holding that despite specific provisions of the iirira,in immigration cases there still exists a strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action see also ins doherty,d scalia,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part citing shaughnessy pedreiro.and stating that although the ina abrogates the apa detailed hearing procedures for immigration cases,the apa judicial review provisions nonetheless apply to hearings under the ina.
the ina allows a court considering a final order of removal pursuant to to review all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.id.b see also under the apa,a preliminary,procedural,or intermediate agency action or ruling not directly reviewable is subject to review on the review of the final agency action.it is therefore the default rule that absent a provision of law to the contrary,action by an ij or the bia may be reviewed when the bia final action comes before this court.
an exception to the default rule covers decisions committed to agency discretion.smriko,at internal quotation marks omitted see also a b denials of discretionary relief.the issue before us is whether there exists a meaningful standard against which a court of appeals may assess the decision of a single bia member unilaterally to affirm an ij decision without opinion rather than refer it to a bia panel.lincoln,at.under a,a provision of the apa,review is not to be had in those rare circumstances where the relevant law is drawn so a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.quoting heckler chaney,d we conclude that e does not provide such a standard.
another argument against our we conclude is that a board member acting pursuant to e is prohibited from making any record whatsoever of his reasoning when deciding to act alone and affirm an ij decision without opinion pursuant to the streamlining regulation,
i f the board member determines that the decision should be affirmed without opinion,the board shall issue an order that reads as follows the board affirms,without opinion,the result of the decision below.the decision below is,therefore,the final agency determination.see cfr e.an order affirming without opinion,issued under authority of this provision,shall not include further explanation or reasoning.
e ii emphasis supplied.a reviewing court therefore has no can have no the process of the bia member.in addition,the prohibition on explanation clearly indicates that the authors of the regulations did not envisage review of the reasoning behind a bia member choice of unilateral affirmance without opinion over reference to a bia panel 
petitioner argues that e itself provides a sufficient benchmark for a reviewing court to evaluate a decision to affirm unilaterally without opinion.under subsection e,certain categories of cases may be directed to panels,and subsection e describes those cases in which a bia member shall affirm without opinion.according to petitioner,a reviewing court can therefore review the record against the factors in subsection e to see if a unilateral decision without reference to a bia panel was truly warranted.if the reviewing court finds that a board member erred in not determining that,for example,there existed a need to settle inconsistencies among the rulings of different immigration judges,e i,remand would be appropriate for consideration by a bia panel 
we reject this therefore conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review decisions by bia members to affirm ij decisions without opinion without reference to a bia for the reasons articulated by our sister circuits reaching the same result see ngure,at tsegay,at.any review by a court of appeals of bia members decisions to decide cases without referral to panels would undermine the bia streamlining scheme,inasmuch as board members,who are prohibited by regulation from explaining a decision to act alone under e and produce only a brief order when acting alone under e,would be enco
