in this petition for review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision,we consider whether the protection of witnesses provisions of the united nations convention against transnational organized crime,opened for signature,catoc are.we hold that those provisions are not.accordingly,the petition for review is denied.
background 
petitioner,john doe,a native and citizen of ghana,was a lawful permanent resident of the united states when he was arrested after admitting he expected to receive a package addressed to him that contained a quantity of heroin.following his arrest,doe admitted to participating in an international drug smuggling ring.doe cooperated with federal agents to arrange a controlled delivery of the heroin to another individual in this country.the controlled delivery led to the arrest of one of the individuals who had hired doe to receive the heroin.that individual was ultimately convicted and imprisoned.
doe pled guilty to an information including a count related to his heroin smuggling activities.the department of homeland security issued a notice to appear,alleging that doe was removable from the united states based on his conviction for an aggravated felony and controlled substance offense.doe attorney inquired about an s visa available to certain who assist with criminal investigations,but the assistant united states attorney assigned to doe case elected not to request such a visa on doe behalf in exchange for his cooperation.in immigration court,doe admitted the factual allegations in the notice to appear and conceded removability,but sought protection from removal under the united nations convention against torture cat and the catoc.
at the conclusion of the removal proceedings,the immigration judge denied doe request for protection under the cat and noted that the request for protection under the catoc was outside the immigration court jurisdiction.doe appealed to the bia,raising his cat and catoc claims,as well as two new arguments based on the danger doctrine and equitable estoppel.the bia rejected all four claims and dismissed the appeal.the bia concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider claims for relief under the catoc because the attorney general had not delegated authority over such requests to immigration judges or to the bia.
doe now seeks review of the decision of the bia affirming the decision of the immigration judge.because doe does not challenge the agency denial of cat relief,equitable estoppel,and relief under the danger doctrine,those arguments are not before us and we address only his assertion that he is entitled to relief as a criminal informant under the catoc.see yueqing zhang gonzales,cir.on appeal,doe primarily contends that the catoc is a treaty that he can enforce through a private right of action in this court,independent of any delegation of authority to the bia.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
although in most circumstances,we lack jurisdiction to adjudicate petitions for review from aliens such as doe who have been convicted of a controlled substance offense,see a c,because his petition raises a legal issue,we have jurisdiction to hear his claim pursuant to a d.
in deciding a petition for review of a bia order,we ordinarily review the bia decision alone.where,as here,the bia has adopted and supplemented the immigration judge decision,however,we review that decision as supplemented by the bia.see santoso holder,cir per curiam.
where a petitioner raises a question of law,we review agency determinations de novo.padmore holder,cir per curiam.although we accord significant deference to bia interpretations of the statute it administers,bah mukasey,cir,we will not defer to the bia interpretation of the catoc because it has not been charged with administration of its provisions,see michel,cir holding that deference to bia interpretations is not afforded where the bia is not interpreting laws it administers.we therefore review the bia decision on doe catoc claim de novo.see swarna al awadi,cir explaining that we review treaty interpretation by a lower court de novo.however,even though our review of the bia decision is de novo,we do not ignore the government views entirely.the supreme court has explained that the meaning attributed to treaty provisions by the government agencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement is entitled to great weight,though it is not conclusive.sumitomo shoji,avagliano,see also pierre gonzales,cir in construing treaty language,respect is ordinarily due the reasonable views of the executive branch.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.thus,while the bia interpretation of the catoc is not entitled to deference,the views of the executive branch agencies,such as the department of state,that were and are charged with the negotiation and enforcement of the treaty are entitled to great weight.sumitomo,at.
b.the witness protection provisions of the catoc are not self executing 
this court has not determined whether the witness protection provisions of the catoc are and,therefore,enforceable in agency removal proceedings or in the courts.see rranci attorney general,cir remanding the issue to the bia for guidance see also musau carlson,app x,cir.the bia has determined that those provisions are not.see in re gk,bia.as noted above,we review this conclusion de novo,without deference to the bia interpretation.
as the supreme court explained,courts have long recognized the distinction between treaties that automatically have effect as domestic law,and those that while they constitute international law commitments do not by themselves function as binding federal law.medellín texas.a treaty is equivalent to an act of the legislature,and hence,when it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.w hile treaties may comprise international commitments,they are not domestic law unless congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be and is ratified on these terms.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also united states bahel,cir i n order for a treaty to be,and thus not require independent action from congress,the treaty terms must reflect such an intention by both the president,who negotiated it,and the senate,which provided its advice and consent.
to determine whether a treaty is,we begin with the text.mora new york,cir.aspirational language is the hallmark of a treaty because it describes only a commitment to take future action through the member states political branches to comply with the treaty.medellín,at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.such is the case when the treaty provides that the parties undertake to comply,as opposed to shall or must comply,with its terms.id.however,even mandatory language may not be conclusive evidence that a provision is if the context and treaty objectives indicate otherwise.see mora,at explaining that treaty interpretation requires consideration of not only the text of the treaty,but also the context in which the written words are used.
the catoc stated purpose is to promote cooperation to prevent and combat transnational organized crime more effectively.catoc.article,titled protection of witnesses,provides 
each state party shall take appropriate measures within its means to provide effective protection from potential retaliation or intimidation for witnesses in criminal proceedings who give testimony concerning offences covered by the convention 
doe argues that article mandate,that the united states shall take appropriate measures to protect witnesses,indicates a obligation.but we believe that this provision,when taken in context,reflects only a undertaking.under the catoc,the signatories commit to provide effective witness protection,to encourage cooperation to prevent and combat transnational organized crime.effective protection is not specifically defined.rather,article explains later that such protection may consist of,inter alia,physical protection,relocation,of the witness identity and location,and the use of testimony.it is therefore left to the signato
