the department of state dos and the ins,who are responsible for general oversight and enforcement of the ippctp provisions,b,issued regulations for the administration of the program in march of.irish peace process cultural and training program interim rule,codified at pt.the regulations delegate responsibility for operation of the program to a program administrator pa.b.the responsibilities of the pa include,inter alia,identifying job opportunities for program participants,recommending employers for participation in the program to the dos,which has final authority for approving employers,and issuing letters of certification to aliens approved for the program.id.ngit was selected as the.

after they were approved to participate in the ippctp,murray and gould began working in august at kitty hawk kites in nags head,north carolina.after the terrorist attacks of september,and business at kitty hawk kites slowed,murray and gould told ngit that they wanted to transfer to las vegas airports lva,a school in las vegas,nevada owned by steve smith.ngit corresponded with smith to verify that lva qualified for the program,and recommended it for approval to the dos.the dos then approved lva as an ippctp employer.
appellants moved to las vegas and began work at lva in october of.their complaint alleges that in early december of,they began to have concerns about smith conduct.he did not pay them and told them that business was too slow he said that they would be paid when they brought in new clients.he also demanded that they clean his home and his car,tasks unrelated to their responsibilities.his training methods exposed appellants to unnecessary hazards,and he boasted about his experiences with drugs and prostitutes.as this behavior continued,the complaint alleges,appellants relationship with smith deteriorated by january,to the point that smith refused to provide appellants with work and did not respond to their attempts to contact him.appellants nonetheless continued to advertise smith business in the hopes of securing new clients and getting paid.
on january,appellants informed ngit of their concerns about smith.on february,appellants again complained to ngit about smith behavior,said that he had violated his obligations under the ippctp,and requested a transfer to a third employer.
later that same day,smith called ngit and alleged that neither murray nor gould had ever worked for him,that both of them were working for many different employers,and that murray was getting his pilot license.ngit asked smith to put these claims in writing,and the following day he sent a fax stating that he had not seen either murray or gould for four months,that they had never worked for him,that they were both working for others in the las vegas area,and that murray was getting his pilot license in order to open a business in yemen.he also stated that t heir views are opposing united states policy and that they had said that terrorism in this country can not sic be beat and so long as the usa supports israel it will only get worse.smith urged ngit to forward this information to the ins and the fbi and concluded that c onsidering our nations sic state of security of foreign terrorism sic,this is of grave concern.
ngit notified the dos and ins of smith accusations.at the request of the dos and ins,ngit sent all of its documentation regarding appellants to those agencies,along with a cover letter that characterized smith statements as allegations and noted that,based on ngit records,there was no reason to believe that murray and gould had not been working at lva.within a few days,the ins took appellants into custody.after appellants told the ins that they were no longer in smith employ,the ins determined that appellants were out of status with the ippctp,because more than thirty days had passed since the end of their approved employment,and initiated removal proceedings against them.on april,ngit formally informed appellants that they were out of status and had been terminated from the program based on the fact that they had not worked for smith since december of.at an immigration hearing on may,appellants were ordered removed.
murray and gould brought this suit against ngit for negligent misrepresentation,defamation,negligence,and breach of contract,claiming psychological injuries,loss of working privileges,and legal expenses as a result of their arrest,incarceration,and deportation.the negligence claim asserts that ngit breached five duties allegedly owed to appellants to investigate smith allegations before conveying them to the dos or ins to reinstate appellants in the ippctp after discovering that smith allegations were false to facilitate a second change of employer to mediate appellants employment dispute with smith and to investigate the bona fides of smith business.ngit moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion.this appeal followed.

appellants claims are largely based on ngit transmittal to the dos and ins of smith allegations that murray and gould posed a possible terrorist threat.ngit asserts as a defense that this transmittal is protected by official immunity.we agree.
