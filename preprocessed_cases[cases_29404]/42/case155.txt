on march,an immigration judge ij granted petitioner liu jin lin application for asylum as to certain grounds and denied it as to other grounds.the department of homeland security dhs and lin both appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia.on september,the bia sustained dhs appeal and vacated the ij grant of asylum,and affirmed the ij rejection of lin other grounds.lin timely petitions for review of the bia decision on limited grounds.we deny the petition.
lin placement in removal proceedings and application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat 
lin is a native and citizen of china who entered the united states on november,on a k fianc√©e visa.in october,lin filed an application with dhs for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.on november,she was issued a notice to appear and placed in removal proceedings.lin conceded her removability,but sought relief based on the claims in her application.
b.the hearing before the ij 
an ij conducted a hearing on lin application on march,at which lin testified and presented voluminous materials.the ij found that lin testified candidly and credibly.
lin testified that she was born in changle city,in fujian province in china,on january,and came to the to feel more free and have human rights.lin was married in quincy,massachusetts on october,shortly before she applied for asylum,and had two children who were born in the a son born in,and another son born in.at the hearing before the ij,lin stated that she wanted four or five children.she said that if she were deported to china,her husband and children would come with her,and that she would have to register her children in a household register because otherwise they would not be allowed to go to school,receive benefits,have housing,or get a job.lin testified that she was afraid that if she went back to china,she would be forced to undergo sterilization because she had violated the family planning law.
we describe those documents submitted in support of lin asylum application upon which she focuses in her brief to this court.this evidence included written statements from several of lin relatives in china describing how they had been forced to undergo sterilization after having multiple children in china between and,as well as a statement from lin describing how she had been forced to abort a pregnancy in because she had already given birth to one child in china.the ij gave letters from lin relatives limited weight because they were not subject to.
lin relied heavily on a document from the family planning office of guhuai town,changle city,fujian province stating that if she and her husband were deported back to china by the government,based on the chinese family planning regulations,one must undergo iud insertion after having one son and sterilization surgery after having two sons,and also pay a social stipend fee.she submitted documents containing similar information from a residents committee and a villagers committee in fujian province.lin father obtained these documents at her request in order to support her asylum application 
finally,lin submitted a annual report from the congressional executive commission on china and a profile of asylum claims and country conditions from the department of state profile.the profile stated that officials in china are not aware of the alleged official policy,at the national or provincial levels,mandating the sterilization of one partner of couples that have given birth to two children,at least one of whom was born abroad.
c.the ij grant of lin asylum application 
on march,the ij issued a decision on lin claims.the ij identified four bases on which lin asserted that she had a fear of persecution should she return to china fear of forced sterilization because she had two sons born in the fear of economic persecution because of her two sons fear of forced iud implantation because of her two sons and fear of forced abortion and sterilization if she had additional children in china.
with respect to the first basis,the ij found that there is absolutely no evidence in this record that the respondent would be punished on account of having children born to her in the united states,or for having violated the family planning policies or procedures in china,and that the respondent fears that she would be sterilized do not appear to have been established,through objective evidence,to be reasonable.as for the second basis,the ij concluded that lin had not established that any fines levied upon her or her husband would in and of themselves constitute persecution.
regarding the third basis,the ij found lin had established to this court satisfaction that she would be expected to undergo,at a minimum,iud insertion and possibly sterilization but she has not established with a certainty that the local officials in her province,in her town or in her husband town would force her to undergo this process.nonetheless,the ij also determined that lin certainly is reasonable in fearing that she would be subject to,at a minimum,having an iud inserted and being prevented by the authorities from giving birth to future children.the ij noted that lin wishes to continue to increase the size of her family and to give birth to additional children,and concluded that t he freedom to determine family size is fundamental to one existence.deprivation of that right can not be denied to be persecutive in nature.
as to the fourth basis,the ij explained that i f the respondent were to become pregnant in china with a third child,it does appear that within her own family,individuals have been forcibly subjected to sterilizations or abortions.and although those have not happened within recent history,there is no evidence that conditions have changed with respect to that.
based on the third and fourth grounds described above,the ij granted lin asylum application 
d.the bia reversal of the ij grant of asylum 
dhs appealed the ij grant of asylum,and lin the ij denial of her asylum claim based on her fear,should she return to china,of being sterilized and economic persecution on account of her sons.
the bia affirmed the ij denial of lin claim for asylum based on her fear of sterilization due to having children,explaining that 
the totality of the background country evidence in the record,which includes the highly probative department of state profile of asylum claims and country conditions profile,did not establish that the respondent faces an objectively reasonable possibility of being forcibly sterilized,or otherwise persecuted,in china for having two children while in the united states.
the bia noted that the profile stated that state department officials had found no cases of physical force employed to effect sterilization in fujian province,and that officials were aware of no national or provincial policy in china mandating the sterilization of a parent who has had two children,at least one of whom was born abroad.the bia affirmed the ij decision to give greater weight to the profile than the other documentary evidence lin had presented see also chen holder,slip op.at cir.june,dismissing petition for review from denial of similar asylum claim based on fear of sterilization due to children.
the bia also affirmed the ij rejection of lin claim that she had a fear of economic persecution upon returning to china.the bia noted that lin had not presented evidence about her family financial circumstances,and that the profile indicated that social compensation fees varied widely.see also id.at discussing similar economic persecution asylum claim.
the bia reversed the ij conclusion that lin fear of having an iud implanted upon her return to china constituted a fear of persecution.as the bia explained,
the ij did not identify individualized or background country evidence,and we find none in the record,that can support her ultimate determination that the respondent,as the mother of two children born in the united states,faces an objectively reasonable risk of having implanted an intrauterine device iud by chinese authorities through persecutory means,or of suffering persecutory harm if she were to refuse to have an iud implanted.
the bia also rejected the ij conclusion that lin had a fear of forced abortion or sterilization based on the possibility that she would again become pregnant in china.the bia determined that respondent fear that she would suffer persecution based on the future additional births is too speculative to be considered.
the bia sustained dhs appeal,vacated the ij grant of asylum,and rejected the claim for withholding of removal 
in her petition for review to this court,lin does not challenge the denial of her claim for asylum based on the first ground identified by the ij,her fear of sterilization because she had two children in the nor does she present any challenge regarding the second basis,as to her fear of economic persecution due having sons.
instead,lin focuses on the third and fourth bases for her asylum claim.she argues that the bia erred by impermissibly conducting de novo review of the ij factual findings and erroneously concluding that lin had not demonstrated a fear of persecution based on her fear of forcible iud insertion,and forced abortion and sterilization if she has additional children in china.
where,as here,the bia issued its own opinion,we review that opinion,as well as any portion of the ij opinion that the bia adopted.vilela holder,cir.the bia determinations are subject to substantial evidence review,meaning we will uphold them unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,b b.we review legal challenges,such as the claim that the bia impermissibly engaged in de novo factfinding,de novo.rotinsulu mukasey,cir.
to be eligible for asylum,an applicant must be a refugee,b a,who is unwilling or unable to return to her home country due to persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,id.a a.while a showing of past persecution generates a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution,rebenko holder,cir,lin has not claimed she was subject to past persecution in china.a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo an abortion or involuntary sterilization or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.a b.
lin fear of persecution based on iud implantation 
lin argues that the ij found she would be subject to forcible iud insertion if returned to china,and that the bia applied the wrong standard in rejecting this finding.the bia reviews an ij factual findings for clear error,d i.lin mischaracterizes the bia analysis.
the ij found only that lin is reasonable in fearing that she would be subject to,at a minimum,having an iud inserted,but the ij also found that lin had not established with certainty that the local officials in her province,in her town or in her husband town would force her to undergo this process.nonetheless,the ij concluded these facts alone allowed a finding that the insertion would amount to persecution.the bia reversed this as clearly erroneous.the bia noted there was no individualized and no background country evidence to support the conclusion of persecutory means.the bia also found that the ij committed clear error in finding that chen,with two children,would not be allowed to have more children in china.there was no support in the record that those similarly situated to chen,that is,chinese citizen parents of children,have been subjected to such treatment.the bia determined that the record did not support a finding that lin faces an objectively reasonable risk of having implanted an intrauterine device iud by chinese authorities through persecutory means,or of suffering persecutory harm if she were to refuse to have an iud implanted emphasis added.
insertion of an iud does not alone support a claim of persecution.t o rise to the level of harm necessary to constitute persecution,the insertion of an iud must involve aggravating circumstances.in re m f w l g,bia see also he chen holder,app x,cir endorsing ij conclusion that iud insertion is not necessarily a procedure designed to amount to persecution on account of the chinese family planning policy huang attorney of,cir mandatory measures short of abortion or sterilization,such as insertion of an iud or required gynecological screenings,do not,on their own,rise to the level of persecution xia fan huang holder,cir concluding that the bia interpretation that a forced iud insertion is not a per se ground for granting asylum is entitled to deference.
as the bia noted,the record provides no support for the finding that any aggravating circumstances would be involved in any implantation even lin does not argue that such a finding would be supportable and that claim is waived.as said,the ij found that lin had not even established with certainty that she would be forced to undergo iud implantation.the bia did not err in reversing the ij grant of asylum based on this finding.see hui lin huang holder,cir a finding may be rejected under clearly erroneous review as speculative in those instances where the ij lacks an adequate basis in the record for the determination.
lin fear of persecution based on the possibiity of having additional children in china and being subject to forced abortion or sterilization 
lin asserts that the ij found she would have additional children if returned to china,and that she would be subjected to a forced abortion or sterilization by chinese authorities,and that the bia wrongly applied de novo review in rejecting these findings as speculative.while the bia reviews an ij factual findings for clear error,d i,the question of whether the possibility of events occurring gives rise to a fear of persecution under the circumstances of the alien case is a conclusion that the bia reviews de novo,huang,at id.at see also hui lin huang,at.we review the bia rulings on this question under a deferential substantial evidence standard.vilela,at huang,at.
lin is wrong about the findings that the ij made and the conclusion the bia reached.the ij found only that lin wished to give birth to additional children,and that her chinese family members who had no children had been forcibly subjected to sterilizations or abortions.the bia reasonably determined that respondent fear that she would suffer persecution based on the future additional births is too speculative to be considered.this conclusion was the proper subject of de novo review by the bia.see wang mukasey,cir distinguishing between the finding that a petitioner may have additional children and the conclusion that the risk of future persecution based on such births was speculative.
lin documents from a family planning council and two committees in fujian province stating that a parent must undergo iud insertion after having one son and sterilization after two sons do not establish her burden.as the bia noted,these documents do not state that these procedures will be forced or specify what penalties will result from failure to comply.see in re s y g,bia.we have also noted that similar documents from local fujian commissions are insufficient to establish a fear of persecution,given other evidence that family planning enforcement efforts in fujian province are lax and uneven.zheng mukasey,cir quoting in re j w s,i n,bia internal quotation marks omitted.
lin argues that the congressional executive commission report and the profile demonstrate that china punishes family planning violators with forced sterilizations and abortions.far from showing such a policy exists,these documents actually show that such forced procedures occur only in some cases or occasionally.the profile states that consulate general officials visiting fujian did not find any cases of physical force employed in connection with abortion or sterilization.
substantial evidence supported the bia conclusion that lin speculative fear of future persecution based on possible additional births was not sufficient for her to establish a fear,as required for a grant of asylum.a a.
since lin asylum claim fails,so too does her claim for withholding of r
