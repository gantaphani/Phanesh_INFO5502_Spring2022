francisco cardenas delgado,a legal permanent resident of the united states since,appeals from the board of immigration appeals bia decision affirming an immigration judge ij decision that he is ineligible for relief from removal under former immigration and naturalization act c,c,because his conviction for an aggravated felony was the result of a trial.cardenas delgado argues that this was error because it is impermissibly retroactive to apply the repeal of c relief to him.we grant cardenas delgado petition for review.
the supreme court recent decision in vartelas holder,makes it clear that the essential inquiry of retroactivity analysis is to determine whether the new law attaches new legal consequences to completed conduct and that evidence regarding reliance is not required to prove that a new law is impermissibly retroactive.the repeal of c relief impermissibly attaches new legal consequences to the trial convictions of aliens like cardenas delgado by rendering these aliens ineligible for relief as a result of convictions that the repeal of c.
background 
cardenas delgado is a native and citizen of mexico who was admitted to the united states in as a lawful permanent resident.he is married and has three children.
in february,cardenas delgado was convicted,as a result of a jury trial,of sale of cocaine,in violation of california health and safety code.he was sentenced to three years in prison for that conviction 
as a result of this conviction,over fifteen years later,on june,cardenas delgado was charged in a notice to appear with being removable under a a iii of the immigration and nationality act,a a iii,based on a conviction for illicit trafficking in a controlled substance,which is an aggravated felony under a b.at a hearing on september,cardenas delgado admitted the factual allegations and conceded that he was removable,but said that he would seek a c waiver.
on september,cardenas delgado submitted an application for a c waiver.the ij ordered that cardenas delgado application for c relief be pretermitted on the grounds that he was ineligible for c relief because his conviction for the sale of cocaine was the result of a jury trial.the ij therefore ordered the removal of cardenas delgado.
on appeal to the bia,cardenas delgado argued that he was eligible for relief under c at the time of his trial conviction and that it was impermissibly retroactive to deny him eligibility for such relief after the repeal of c.on june,the bia affirmed the ij decision without an opinion.
standard of review 
where,as here,the bia affirms the ij decision without opinion,we review the decision of the ij as if it were that of the bia.see ge ashcroft,cir.we review de novo,and without chevron deference to the bia,whether a change to an immigration law is impermissibly retroactive.camins gonzales,cir.
discussion 
cardenas delgado contends that,at the time of his trial for the aggravated felony,he would have been eligible for discretionary relief under c because he served less than five years in prison,and he argues that the ij and bia erred by retroactively applying the repeal of c to him.the key issue is whether electing to go to trial instead of pleading guilty precludes the defendant from establishing that the denial of c relief was retroactively applied to him.in order to fully understand these issues,it is first important to understand the history of c and the fundamental legal principles governing retroactivity analysis for civil statutes.
i.the statutory framework and history of c 
section of the immigration and nationality act of excluded from the united states several classes of aliens,including those convicted of offenses involving moral turpitude or the illicit traffic in narcotics.stat.ins cyr.however,c contained a provision granting the attorney general broad discretion to admit excludable aliens.it stated aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general.c repealed.
in,congress expanded the pool of aliens who were deportable,establishing that an alien would be deportable upon conviction for any aggravated felony.see anti drug abuse act of,stat,a a iii.congress subsequently enacted three statutes that reduced the size of the class of aliens eligible for discretionary relief from deportation.
first,in,congress amended c to prohibit discretionary relief for anyone convicted of an aggravated felony who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years,stat.amending c.it is significant that,at that time,even an alien deportable because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony was eligible for discretionary relief if he served a term of imprisonment of less than five years.see c.cardenas delgado was convicted of his aggravated felony the following year,and served less than five years in prison.
second,in congress adopted d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.codified in relevant part at.this act rendered all aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation under c.see stat.amending c.
third,also in,congress passed the illegal reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.this act repealed c entirely,see b,stat,and replaced it with cancellation of removal,which is not available to any alien convicted of an aggravated felony regardless of the term of imprisonment imposed or served.see.
ii.retroactivity jurisprudence established by the supreme court in landgraf and cyr 
in landgraf usi film products,a landmark retroactivity case,the supreme court recognized that a presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our republic.landgraf,at.the court noted that the presumption against statutory retroactivity has consistently been explained by reference to the unfairness of imposing new burdens on persons after the fact.id.at.the court further noted that,s ince the early days of this court,we have declined to give retroactive effect to statutes burdening private rights unless congress had made clear its intent.id.
the court therefore established a procedure for determining whether a civil statute may apply retroactively.first,when a statute is enacted after the events at issue in a suit,the court must determine whether congress expressly provided that the statute should apply retroactively.landgraf,at.if the answer is yes,then the inquiry is complete and the statute applies retroactively.id.if the answer is no,then the court must proceed to the second step and determine whether the statute would have a retroactive effect.id.if the statute would operate retroactively,then the court must apply the traditional presumption against retroactivity and prohibit retroactive application of the statute.id.
the landgraf court also explained that a determination of whether a statute operates retroactively turns on whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.id.at.this assessment comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.id.at.the court also highlighted justice story classic explication of when legislation is retroactive every statute,which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,must be deemed retrospective.id.at quoting society for propagation of the gospel wheeler,cas.the court noted that,in hard cases,familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations offer sound guidance in applying the test for retroactivity.id.at.
in ins cyr,the supreme court applied landgraf in the context of an immigration case when considering the statutory elimination of c relief.id.cyr,a lawful permanent resident,pleaded guilty on march,to a charge of selling a controlled substance.id.at.that conviction made him deportable.id.under the law applicable at the time of his conviction,however,cyr would have been eligible for a c waiver.id.nevertheless,removal proceedings against him were initiated after both aedpa and iirira became effective,and the government asserted that cyr no longer was eligible for a waiver.id.
the supreme court held that the repeal of c would not apply to cyr.cyr,at.it reached this conclusion by applying the analysis outlined in landgraf.applying the first step of landgraf retroactivity analysis,the court first asked whether congress had clearly expressed an intention to make iirira b retroactive,and concluded that it had not.cyr,at.
the supreme court therefore proceeded to the second step of the landgraf framework and began by explaining that t he inquiry into whether a statute operates retroactively demands a commonsense,functional judgment about whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that iirira elimination of any possibility of c relief for people who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for such relief clearly attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the court noted that p lea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government,resulting in defendants waiving constitutional rights in exchange for government benefits such as prompt punishment and the preservation of prosecutorial resources.id.at.given the frequency with which c relief was granted in the years leading up to aedpa and iirira,the court reasoned that preserving the possibility of such relief would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.id.at.the court recognized that r elying upon settled practice,the advice of counsel,and perhaps even assurances in open court that the entry of the plea would not foreclose c relief,a great number of defendants in cyr position agreed to plead guilty.id.at.therefore,the court concluded that it would surely be contrary to familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations to hold that iirira subsequent restrictions deprive them of any possibility of such relief.id.at quoting landgraf,at.
iii.is the repeal of c relief impermissibly retroactive as applied to cardenas delgado 
in the case currently before us,it is undisputed that congress did not express an intent to make the repeal of c relief retroactive.we therefore focus on the second part of the landgraf framework.cardenas delgado argues that reliance is not a requirement for proving that the repeal of c relief is impermissibly retroactive,and that he should be able to contend that the denial of c relief is retroactive even though he elected to go to trial.
in the wake of cyr,courts have disagreed about whether some kind of reliance on prior law is required in order to successfully bring a retroactivity challenge to a new immigration law.relying on a third circuit case,atkinson att y,cir,cardenas delgado argues that reliance is not required and the change in legal consequences for events completed before the repeal of c constitutes an impermissible retroactive effect.in atkinson,the petitioner had not been offered a plea agreement and had been convicted by a jury of an aggravated felony in.id.at.he received a sentence of less than five years,leaving him eligible at that time for c relief.id.at.the bia held that he was not eligible for c relief because cyr applied only to aliens who had entered into plea agreements and not to aliens who,like atkinson,had been tried and found guilty.id.at.
the third circuit disagreed and granted the petition for review.id.at.the court rejected the proposition that cyr supported the conclusion that there must be reliance on the prior state of the law in order to hold that the elimination of c relief is impermissibly retroactive.id.at.the court reasoned that the supreme court had never held that reliance on the prior law is a requirement to determine that a law is impermissibly retroactive.id.at.
the atkinson court therefore held that even aliens who had not been offered plea bargains and had been convicted of aggravated felonies following a trial would be eligible for c relief if the alien was convicted at a time when that conviction would not have rendered him ineligible for c relief.id.at.the court reasoned that eliminating the availability of relief would be impermissibly retroactive because it would attach new consequences the certainty of deportation rather than the possibility of deportation to events the conviction completed before the repeal of c.id.at.
similarly,based on its interpretation of landgraf,hughes,and cyr,the fourth circuit held in an iirira case that reliance whether subjective or objective is not a requirement of impermissible retroactivity.see olatunji ashcroft,cir.instead,the fourth circuit concluded,the standard is whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment id.at quoting landgraf,at.
however,in contrast to the third and fourth circuits,we have held on more than one occasion,either implicitly or explicitly,that a petitioner must prove some kind of detrimental reliance on law to succeed in a retroactivity challenge to a new immigration law.for example,in armendariz montoya sonchik,cir,without explicitly stating that reliance was a requirement to prove impermissible retroactivity,we denied the petition for review when we determined that the petitioner could not establish reliance on the prior availability of the c waiver.
in saravia paguada gonzales,cir,where the petitioner had sought c relief,we concluded that the alien had failed to show the required reliance on prior law and that an alien could not establish impermissible retroactivity by showing that a change in the law attached new legal consequences to past conduct.similarly,in hernandez de anderson gonzales,cir,we recognized that there was a split in authority regarding the proper interpretation of cyr and stated expressly disapproving the conclusion of the third and fourth circuits,this court has held that aliens claiming that iirira repeal of relief from deportation is impermissibly retroactive as applied to them must demonstrate reasonable reliance on law.id.at.
however,after the development of this split in authority,the supreme court recently decided a case that undercuts ninth circuit law and demonstrates that no form of reliance is required in order to successfully challenge the denial of c relief on grounds that the repeal of such relief is retroactive.subsequent to the bia decision in cardenasdelgado case and the filing of his brief in this appeal,the supreme court decided yartelas holder.in yartelas,the supreme court held that it was impermissible to retroactively apply another iirira provision,a c ii,to a lawful permanent resident whose conviction was obtained prior to the enactment of iirira.id.at.when vartelas pleaded guilty to a crime involving moral turpitude in,an alien in his situation was permitted to travel abroad for brief periods without jeopardizing his lawful permanent resident status.id.at.however,congress subsequently enacted iirira,which rendered lawful permanent residents who had a conviction like vartelas removable if they traveled abroad and returned to the united states.id.at.vartelas traveled to greece in to visit his parents.id.upon his return to the united states,he was treated as inadmissible under iirira and placed in removal proceedings.id.
relying on both landgraf and cyr,the supreme court held that the new provision of iirira was impermissibly retroactive because it attached a new disability denial of reentry in respect to past events vartelas offense,plea,and conviction.id.at.in the course of its opinion,the supreme court made it clear that neither actual reliance nor reaso
