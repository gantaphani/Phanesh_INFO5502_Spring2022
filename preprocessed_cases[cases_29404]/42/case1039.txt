boyko tanov petitioner arrived in the united states on may,conceded excludability through counsel,and was placed in exclusion proceedings.in a decision an immigration judge ij found petitioner excludable from the united states,but granted his application for asylum and withholding of deportation.the immigration and naturalization service ins appealed,and the board of immigration appeals bia reversed the ij decision because petitioner had failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution.six years later,after the passage of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of nacara,title ii,stat,petitioner moved to reopen his exclusion proceedings,asserting that he was entitled to suspension of deportation under section of nacara.the ij granted petitioner motion to reopen but later denied his application for suspension of deportation.the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the bia and deny the petition.
background 
petitioner,a citizen of bulgaria,arrived in the united states in without a valid and unexpired immigrant visa.the ins detained and interviewed him at the airport.petitioner filed a timely application for asylum and withholding of deportation based upon his alleged opposition to the communist party.he filed a second,amended application for asylum in october,asserting that he belonged to a political action group which the bulgarian secret police had dissolved.the purpose of the group,he claimed,was to alert the world about bulgaria human rights violations,persecution of innocent people,and repressive conditions.petitioner also claimed that the police continually harassed him due to his political beliefs and that authorities had repeatedly interrogated and threatened him and his family.he also said he was not allowed to practice his religion openly in bulgaria.
at his hearing before an ij in early,in addition to making the representations noted above,petitioner described being beaten by the police for two days in and being threatened every two or three months thereafter.the ij granted asylum to petitioner and issued him an,ruling that there is enough evidence to indicate that he has participated in activities in the past and that he has been questioned and detained for those reasons by the current government.
the ins appealed,and the bia reversed the ij decision because petitioner had failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution.the bia noted that the former government in bulgaria had been overthrown in and the bulgarian communist party had since renounced rule.the bia did not believe that a reasonable person in petitioner circumstances would fear persecution for one of the five grounds specified in the act.the bia ordered petitioner excluded from the united states.petitioner did not seek review of that decision in this court.
in,almost three years after being excluded,petitioner filed a motion with the bia seeking reconsideration of its decision.the bia denied the motion to reconsider.once again,petitioner did not seek review from this court.although ordered excluded,petitioner never left the united states.
on november,congress passed nacara,which permitted certain qualified aliens from bulgaria and other designated countries the opportunity to apply for suspension of deportation.believing that nacara made him eligible for suspension of the exclusion and deportation that had been ordered by the bia almost seven years earlier,petitioner filed a motion to reopen his immigration proceedings seeking that suspension.the ins opposed the motion,arguing that nacara applied only to aliens deportable from the united states,not those who were excludable.in november,the ij granted petitioner motion to reopen and denied the relief sought.the bia affirmed without opinion the ij decision to deny suspension of deportation under nacara.although petitioner received an extension of time to file a brief in support of his appeal to the bia on this point,he never did so.he subsequently filed this petition.
regarding his asserted right to remain in this country,petitioner makes three arguments.first,he contends that as an excludable alien,one who is detained while attempting to enter the united states and given special permission to remain here pending a determination of his right to enter,he is eligible to obtain suspension of deportation under nacara.next,he argues that he was in fact admitted into the united states as that term has been used in the immigration and nationality act of ina because he was inspected,admitted,and paroled into the united states on several occasions.having been admitted,he is not barred from consideration for suspension of deportation.finally,petitioner argues that nacara distinction between excludable and deportable aliens is irrational and fails to comport with the equal protection clause.
ii.standard of review 
where,as here,the bia has summarily adopted or affirmed the ij decision without opinion,this court reviews the ij decision.twum ins,cir.we review de novo the bia application and interpretation of law.diallo ins,cir.with respect to appellant claim that nacara violates his fifth amendment equal protection rights,this court applies the rational basis test.fiallo bell,d see also ins,cir distinctions drawn between similarly situated groups of aliens are subject to rational basis review.
iii.discussion 
petitioner is ineligible for relief under nacara 
when petitioner first arrived and sought admission into the united states,the ina governed immigration proceedings.section of the ina provided the attorney general with the discretionary authority to suspend the deportation of certain qualified aliens.in order to be eligible for suspension of deportation,an alien had to meet requirements related to continuous presence in the united states,good moral character,and hardship resulting from deportation.see.when petitioner arrived in this country in,however,he was ineligible for this suspension because he was in exclusion proceedings and later ordered excluded from the united states.see leng may ma barber,d noting that suspension of deportation has never been made available to aliens ordered excluded see also sale haitian ctrs.council,d discussing the distinction between deportable and excludable aliens.although petitioner was paroled into the united states pending the completion of his exclusion proceedings,which is oftentimes the case with excludable aliens,such parole is not regarded as an admission of the alien.d a see also leng may ma,at.
in,congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div,title,stat.among other things,on its april,effective date,iirira eliminated the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens and replaced the suspension of deportation provision of ina with cancellation of removal,a new form of discretionary relief available to all aliens.see simeonov ashcroft,cir.iirira also implemented a new rule.under that rule,for purposes of calculating an alien continuous presence in the united states,and thus determining whether the alien had been here long enough to be eligible for suspension of deportation,the time would stop accruing when the alien was served with a notice to appear or when the alien committed certain offenses.sherifi ins,cir.notably,iirira was prospective in its outlook.it did not affect those aliens who were already excludable under the scheme,nor did it change the eligibility requirements applicable to them for suspension of deportation.patel mcelroy,cir holding that a s a matter of statutory construction for aliens placed into proceedings prior to iirira effective date,suspension of deportation under former ina section is available to aliens in deportation but not in exclusion proceedings emphasis added.
later in congress enacted nacara,in part to prevent the mass deportation of aliens who had arrived from some former soviet bloc and central american nations.see romero ins,cir citing ram ins,cir explaining that aliens from the nacara countries took unusual risks in escaping oppressive regimes and countries.among other
