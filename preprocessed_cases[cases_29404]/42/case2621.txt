petitioner viollca brucaj seeks review of an adverse decision of the board of immigration appeals the bia or board that denied her request for asylum.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we grant the petition,reverse the decision of the bia and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
brucaj is an ethnic albanian,a native of kosovo and a citizen of the federal republic of yugoslavia she was born in kline,kosovo,where she lived until april.brucaj resided with her parents and two older brothers.
on april,serbian soldiers under the general leadership of slobodan milosevic came to brucaj village and killed a number of people,including her cousins.brucaj watched the onslaught from a window in her home however,she and her family could not leave because serbian soldiers had surrounded her village.
the next day,serbian solders arrived at brucaj home.the soldiers accused brucaj father of storing illegal weapons.they handcuffed brucaj mother and father.then,with her parents present,the soldiers brutally brucaj and beat her with their fists and the butts of their weapons.brucaj father also was beaten in the same manner.
the soldiers demanded to know where brucaj brother,pjerin,was living.brucaj told them that pjerin lived in detroit,michigan.the soldiers stated that they wanted pjerin back in kosovo so they could kill him.brucaj testified that she believed the soldiers had targeted her family because her father was a member of the democratic party of kosovo 
at some point during this ordeal,brucaj lost consciousness.when she regained consciousness,she found that the soldiers had left her on a roadside in albania.the noklaj family found her and took her to their home in albania where she stayed for several months.while she was there,she made contact with her brother pjerin.over time,pjerin sent her money,and brucaj eventually was able to buy a united states passport for.in october of,brucaj fled to the united states.upon her arrival at chicago airport,brucaj was detained by immigration officials.
brucaj has not heard from her parents since the ordeal in april of.she stated that her brother,ardjian,joined the kosovo liberation army in early and that he was taken by a group of soldiers warring against albanians brucaj does not know if he is alive.pjerin,who still resides in detroit,testified that he has attempted to find their parents through the red cross and the internet but has been unable to locate them.pjerin also stated that he had spoken by cell phone with their other brother,ardjian,approximately one year prior to brucaj asylum hearing however,pjerin had not heard from ardjian since that time.
administrative proceedings 
shortly after her arrival in the united states,the immigration and naturalization service instituted removal proceedings against brucaj.at her initial hearing,brucaj conceded that she was an alien who had sought to procure entry to the united states by fraud or willful misrepresentation of fact,and she sought asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat.
both brucaj and pjerin testified at her asylum hearing to the events set forth above.additionally,the government submitted the state department country report on human rights practices in yugoslavia.this report noted that v irtually no town or settlement escaped the effects of the milosevic regime campaign of ethnic cleansing in,with reports of dozens,sometimes hundreds,of civilians murdered in each town.it also explained that,beginning in june of,after the nato campaign that forced the withdrawal of yugoslav and serbian forces,the united nations interim administrative mission in kosovo unmik began to establish civil authority over kosovo.see.kosovo has been governed separately from since that time.the report noted that unmik generally adhered to international human rights standards in its administration of the province however,serious problems remained,largely as a result of interethnic tensions.the report also recounted that,in october of,elections in kosovo were conducted and were considered a general success,although serbs did not participate.see.furthermore,the report stated that over kosovar albanians returned to the province during the year only a few ethnic serbs and other minorities returned.according to the report,it appears that much of the violence in kosovo is now directed at serbs.see.
on the merits,the ij denied brucaj asylum claim.the ij never made an explicit credibility determination however,the ij appeared to believe brucaj testimony regarding the events of april because the ij found that these events established past persecution.see.h owever,he concluded,the presumption of a fear of future persecution wa s rebutted by changed country conditions.id.the ij explained 
the respondent and her family suffered harm from the platforms set forth by former leader,milosevic.milosevic has been removed from power and is currently being prosecuted for the war crimes he committed and supported during his tenure.the federal republic of yugoslavia has been recognized by the international community and has a new president.see country report at page.
id.the ij then noted the respondent has failed to establish her eligibility for asylum accordingly,she also fails to meet the more stringent standard of clear probability of persecution required for relief in the form of withholding of removal.id.at.although brucaj had argued that she should be granted asylum on humanitarian grounds as well,the ij did not discuss this basis for relief in his opinion 
brucaj appealed the ij decision to the bia.on september,a single member of the board issued a per curiam order that affirmed the ij decision.the bia first noted that,although brucaj had suffered past persecution,it agreed with the ij that the changed country conditions rebutted the presumption of future persecution.
unlike the ij,the bia also considered brucaj claim that she was entitled to humanitarian asylum based on the past persecution alone.see b iii a.the bia reasoned that a lthough the respondent suffered harm amounting to persecution,she has failed to present any evidence to support her assertion that she would suffer severe psychological harm if she were to return to yugoslavia.
analysisa.standard of review 
in cases such as this,where the board opinion merely supplements the immigration judge opinion,the latter opinion as supplemented by the board opinion becomes the basis for review.niam ashcroft,cir.we review the asylum determination under the substantial evidence test the decision may be overturned only if the record compels a contrary result.georgis ashcroft,cir.
asylum based upon past persecution 
in order to be eligible for asylum,brucaj must establish that she is a refugee within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act,a.one means of meeting this burden is to come forward with evidence of past persecution.see,begzatowski ins,cir.if brucaj establishes past persecution,she is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that she has a fear of future persecution and therefore should be granted asylum.see ambati reno,cir.the government may rebut this presumption if it establishes,by a preponderance of the evidence,that t here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality b i a.
in this case,both the ij and the bia found that brucaj suffered past persecution,and she is therefore entitled to the presumption that she will suffer future persecution.however,the ij also found that the government had rebutted the presumption by establishing that there had been a fundamental change in regime.the ij reasoned that brucaj past persecution was part of the ethnic cleansing of albanians in kosovo orchestrated by the regime of milosevic.furthermore,because milosevic had been removed from office and a new government had been installed,brucaj was not likely to suffer future persecution as a result of her albanian ethnicity.
we believe that the ij conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.the country report discusses the dismantling of milos
