roberto lopez francisco lopez appeals his conviction following a jury trial for being an alien found in the united states after deportation,in violation of.we agree with the district court that does not require the government to prove the existence of an order of deportation as an element of the crime in cases where the defendant has been deported or removed.we affirm lopez conviction despite the erroneous admission of lay opinion testimony by a key government witness because lopez fails to show a reasonable probability that the exclusion of that testimony would have affected the outcome of his trial nor does he demonstrate that the remaining evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury verdict.we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying lopez motion for a new trial.
on february,lopez,a native and citizen of mexico,was arrested outside lukeville,arizona and transferred to the border patrol station in tucson for processing.lukeville is on the united states mexico border.the following day,border patrol agent craig harris interviewed and fingerprinted lopez at the tucson station.on february,according to the government,lopez was transported by bus to the nogales,arizona port of entry and removed from the united states across the border to mexico.on june,an ice officer arrested lopez outside his home in los angeles.
during the trial,the government introduced as exhibit a notice to alien ordered verification form i from lopez a file the form is used to record the removal of an individual from the united states during the expedited removal process this form has two parts.the top half of the form,the notice to alien ordered removed,warns that if the removed alien attempts to enter,enters,or is found in the united states he can be prosecuted for a felony under and could face severe penalties.the officer who serves this warning enters his signature on that portion of the form.in lopez case,agent harris served the warning.agent harris name is typed on the signature line next to his signature along with his title,border patrol agent,and his office location,tucson,arizona.
the bottom half of the form,the verification of removal,is the portion designed to record the physical removal of the alien across the border.the verification of removal includes the following information about the alien departure departure date,port of departure,manner of departure,and signature and title of the verifying officer.in addition,it bears a photograph of the alien removed,his signature,his right index fingerprint,and the signature of the official taking that fingerprint.here,all portions of the form were completed.thus,lopez name,photograph,signature,and fingerprint appear on his verification of removal.the departure date is listed as february,the manner of departure is described as afoot,and the port of departure is identified as nogales,arizona.the form bears signatures from two officers a border patrol agent who verified the removal and the official who took lopez fingerprint.neither of these signatures is legible,however,and none of the government witnesses could identify the officers who signed the form.
agent harris was the government key witness to lopez physical removal,an element of the offense the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.removal was the only element seriously contested at trial.agent harris testified that the alien fingerprint is placed on the verification of removal in nogales as the alien step s off the bus from tuscon and right before he is removed back to mexico.after the alien is fingerprinted,he is walked to the border.on cross,defense counsel questioned agent harris about his inability to decipher the signatures on lopez verification of removal or otherwise identify the agents who signed it.on redirect,the prosecutor asked agent harris,based upon your training and experience by looking at lopez verification of removal,do you believe he was actually deported from the united states agent harris responded,yes.i believe he was.it is undisputed that agent harris was not at the nogales border when lopez was removed nor was harris qualified as an expert under federal rule of evidence.
although lopez unsuccessfully challenged the validity of his removal order in a motion to dismiss the information,the government did not introduce the order of removal form i at trial.at the close of the government case,lopez moved for a directed verdict under federal rule of criminal procedure in part because the government failed to introduce a removal order.the district court denied the motion,ruling that an order of deportation or removal is not a necessary element of a section offense so long as evidence of physical removal has been introduced.
lopez raises several issues whether requires proof of an order of removal or deportation as an element of the offense when the defendant has been deported or removed whether the verification of removal and agent harris opinion testimony that lopez was in fact deported were properly admitted and,if not,whether those errors require us to reverse lopez conviction and vacate his sentence.
the district court ruled that does not require the government to prove that an order of removal or deportation was issued where the alien has been deported or removed.we agree.we review de novo a district court interpretation of a statute,and we begin with the text of the statute.see united states havelock,cir en banc.the statute provides that an alien who enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in the united states shall be guilty of a crime if he previously has been denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed or has departed the united states while an order of exclusion,deportation,or removal is outstanding.a.lopez argues that the last clause,while an order of exclusion,deportation,or removal is outstanding,applies to the entire subsection.as the district court concluded,however,the statutory language requires as an element of the offense an outstanding order of exclusion,deportation,or removal only when an alien has departed the united states.if the alien has been denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed,then no order is required.the phrase is worded in the passive voice because the alien is the subject of the enforcement action.the second clause presupposes that the alien departed on his own initiative,in which case,the fact of his return alone can not support a conviction under section because returning alone is not the criminal act punished by section a.indeed,as a general rule,it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the united states.arizona united states.rather,the criminal act is returning to the united states after the government has ordered the alien excluded,deported,or removed.hence,the order of deportation,removal,or exclusion becomes a necessary element that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt if the alien returns after he has departed on his own.adducing sufficient proof that the order was issued is the only way to demonstrate that the government has,in fact,ordered the alien removed and that his return without permission violates the statute.
the ninth circuit model criminal jury instruction supports this interpretation.the model instruction,properly given to the jury here,identifies five elements.as to the first element,the government must prove 
first the defendant was removed deported from the united states the defendant departed the united states while an order of removal deportation was outstanding 
cir.model crim.jury instr.all brackets in original.the separate double brackets indicate that the court should give the jury either one of the instructions,but not both.so if the defendant was deported or removed,the court moves on to the second element of the offense.if he instead departed,the government does not meet its burden with respect to element one unless it also proves that the defendant departed while an order of removal or deportation was outstanding.see united states gonzalez villalobos,cir in a prosecution for illegal reentry under a,the government must prove,inter alia,that the defendant was previously denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed or has departed the united states while an order of exclusion,deportation,or removal wa s outstanding.a see also cir.model crim.jury instr.
the cases lopez cites for the proposition that an order of removal or deportation is an element of the crime that must be proven to the jury under all circumstances are inapposite.true,we have said that o ne of the elements of a conviction under is a prior removal order.united states vidal mendoza,cir.but vidal mendoza as well as united states barajas alvarado,cir,and other cases cited by lopez involve collateral challenges to the validity of an order of deportation under d,not whether a deportation or removal order must be introduced at trial.these cases stand for the uncontroversial proposition that the validity of a removal or deportation order is always a predicate to the crime because the deportation must be valid,legal,and comport with due process requirements to sustain a conviction under section.this does not necessarily mean that where the government proves that the alien was actually physically removed,the government must also prove the existence of a deportation or removal order.
indeed,if actual physical removal or deportation is proven,a valid order of removal or deportation may be presumed in the absence of a collateral challenge in the form of a motion to dismiss the indictment,or,as here,the information.b b requiring a motion alleging a defect in the indictment or information to be made before trial see,united states lopez velasquez,cir en banc reviewing a district court grant of a motion to dismiss an indictment under section based on the invalidation of the deportation order underlying the indictment.implicitly recognizing this rule,lopez filed a motion to dismiss the information due to unlawful deportation,which challenged the validity of his underlying removal order.the district court denied this motion,finding that although lopez did not sign the removal order as required by b i,he suffered no prejudice.lopez did not appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss.
lopez asserts that our decision in united states bahena cardenas,cir,requires the government to prove that an order of removal or deportation was outstanding as an element of every b offense.lopez points us to our description in that case of what the government must show to prove physical removal the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that bahena cardenas physically left the country sometime between the time he was ordered removed and the time he was found in the united states.id.at.in bahena cardenas,the issue was whether the government could meet its burden of proving actual physical removal by introducing a warrant of deportation signed by the agent who witnessed the defendant departure from the united states.we concluded that the warrant of deportation is nontestimonial and therefore does not implicate crawford washington.at.because a warrant of deportation is admissible to prove physical removal in a deportation case,we upheld the conviction.bahena cardenas is squarely in line with our holding as to proof of removal or deportation orders,and does nothing to disturb the legal requirement that actual physical removal from the united states must be proven.
it is that the government is required to prove physical removal from the united states as an element of the crime under.see bahena cardenas,at.we must decide whether the government presented sufficient evidence of lopez physical removal by submitting the verification of removal along with officer oki testimony as the temporary custodian of lopez a file and eliciting opinion testimony from agent harris.to determine the admissibility of the verification of removal,we review de novo the district court interpretation of the federal rules of evidence,but once we determine that the evidence does fall within the given rule,we review the district court decision to admit it for abuse of discretion.united states durham,cir.because lopez failed to object to agent harris opinion testimony at trial,we review its admission for plain error.puckett united states.
the district court did not err by admitting lopez verification of removal.a verification of removal comports with the requirements of the confrontation clause and is admissible under the public records exception to the rule against hearsay.
we have previously held that a warrant of removal is nontestimonial.bahena cardenas,at united states orozco acosta,cir reaffirming bahena cardenas after melendez diaz massachusetts.
we have not yet addressed a confrontation clause challenge to the admissibility of a verification of removal as opposed to a warrant of removal.however,reasoning by analogy to bahena cardenas and orozco acosta,we conclude that like a warrant of removal,a verification of removal is nontestimonial.both documents record the alien physical removal across the border and are made for the purpose of recording the movement of aliens.compare orozco acosta,at describing a warrant of removal,with form i.the only functional difference between the two is that a verification of removal is used to record the removal of aliens pursuant to expedited removal procedures,while the warrant of removal records the removal of aliens following a hearing before an immigration judge.see noting that a form i,warrant of removal,is based upon the final administrative removal order in the alien case explaining that removal proceedings shall in general be conducted by an immigration judge,and that such proceedings shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be admitted to the united states or,if the alien has been so admitted,removed from the united states,except where otherwise specified in the chapter.
in bahena cardenas,we concluded that a warrant of is nontestimonial because it is not made in anticipation of litigation,and because it is simply a routine,objective cataloging of an unambiguous factual matter.at.in orozco acosta,we reaffirmed our holding in bahena cardenas,once again reasoning that warrants of are nontestimonial because they are not made in anticipation of litigation,they are simply a routine,objective,cataloguing of an unambiguous factual matter,and they have inherent reliability because of the government need to keep accurate records of the movement of aliens.orozco acosta,at internal quotation marks omitted.
these same considerations lead us to conclude that a verification of removal is nontestimonial in nature as well.first,there is no evidence that a verification of removal is completed in anticipation of litigation.second,a verification of removal is simply a routine,objective,cataloguing of an unambiguous factual matter.id.a verification of removal records the fact that an individual alien was removed from the united states.the alien name,photograph,fingerprint,and signature all appear on the form,as do the departure date,the port of departure,and the manner of departure.it is signed by a verifying officer and requires that officer to indicate his title as well.that it is the removed alien fingerprint on the form is evidenced by the signature of the officer who took the fingerprint.thus,a verification of removal catalogues the unambiguous factual matter whether an alien has been removed just as a warrant of does.verifications of removal are also routine.they are completed for all aliens removed pursuant to expedited removal procedures.third,a verification of removal has the same inherent reliability because of the government need to keep accurate records of the movement of aliens as a warrant of.it is equally important for the government to record which aliens have been removed under expedited removal procedures as it is to record which aliens have been removed in other circumstances.both documents are placed in the alien a file.there is no daylight between the function of these two documents that would suggest one should be deemed nontestimonial while the other is deemed testimonial.
although lopez recognizes that the confrontation clause analysis applies equally to a warrant of and a verification of removal,he contends that a verification of removal is,nevertheless,inadmissible hearsay.under federal rule of evidence,a record or statement of a public office is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if it sets out a matter observed while under a legal duty to report,but not including,in a criminal case,a matter observed by personnel.a ii.we review de novo whether a verification of removal falls into the public records exception to the hearsay rule.united states marguet pillado,cir.
again,reasoning by analogy to our precedent permitting admission of warrants of,we reject lopez assertion that the general prohibition against admitting records created by law enforcement personnel codified in federal rule of evidence a ii applies to verifications of removal.in united states loyola dominguez,cir,we reaffirmed that warrants of deportation are admissible in section prosecutions even though they describe a matter observed by border patrol agents.see united states hernandez rojas,cir holding the same.because warrants of deportation reflect ministerial,objective observation s and do not implicate the concerns animating the law enforcement exception to the public records exception,they are not precluded by that exception.loyola dominguez,at internal quotation marks omitted.we have noted that the purpose of the law enforcement exception is to exclude observations made by officials at the scene of the crime or apprehension,because observations made in an adversarial setting are less reliable than observations made by public officials in other situations.united states hernandez rojas,cir.excluding a verification of removal would not further this purpose because the observation made by a law enforcement officer in verifying the removal of an alien is not made at the scene of a crime or apprehension nor made in an adversarial setting.rather,like a warrant of deportation,a verification of removal records the movement of aliens across the united states border.the form thus shares the same inherent reliability because of the government need to keep accurate records of the movement of aliens,that we found important to our conclusion that warrants of deportation are not inadmissible hearsay.
lopez misplaces his reliance on slight differences in the two types of forms,arguing that the observations recorded on a verification of removal are more subjective.while it is true that subjective observations of law enforcement officers are excluded as inadmissible hearsay,the slight differences in the two forms can not obscure the plain fact that neither form leaves room for subjectivity.both forms require law enforcement agents to verify the removal of aliens from the united states and attest to that verification.the question answered by the officer signing either form is the same objective one whether or not the alien was removed.
lopez also argues that the differences between the two forms are relevant to the first prong of the public records exception whether the matter was observed while under a legal duty to report.he argues that because a warrant of deportation includes a signature line for the officer who witnessed the removal,while a verification of removal does not,any removal recorded on the latter form can not be said to have been observed and is therefore inadmissible.lopez argument falters,however,when one considers that warrants of deportation,which are admissible,provide an option for an officer to indicate that he either witnessed the removal or that he verified the removal.if verifying the removal constitutes an observation sufficient to satisfy the requirements of rule,the same principle applies to verifications of removal,rendering them also admissible under rule.
the verification of removal also meets the requirement that the document was a record of matters observed pursuant to a duty imposed by law.united states pintado isiordia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we have not interpreted the duty imposed by law requirement to mean that a statute or regulation expressly imposes duties to observe,report,and keep records.rather,it suffices if the nature of the responsibilities assigned to the public agency are such that the record is appropriate to the function of the agency.christopher mueller laird kirkpatrick,federal evidence ed collecting cases.recording and maintaining verifications that an individual has been deported falls under the rubric of responsibilities assigned to the department of homeland security therefore,completing the verification of removal form is appropriate to the function of the agency.
having determined that a verification of removal falls within the public records exception to the hearsay rule,we examine whether it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to admit it here.it was not.at trial,the prosecution properly authenticated the verification of removal by calling deportation officer ron oki,the temporary custodian of lopez a file,as a witness.in united states estrada eliverio,cir,we squarely held that documents from an a file may be authenticated under federal rule of evidence which requires the proponent to produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.a.specifically,under rule b,public records may be authenticated based on evidence that a a document was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law or b a purported public record or statement is from the office where items of this kind are kept.b.in estrada eliverio,we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting several a file documents,including the defendant warrant of removal or deportation,under rule b.there,a border patrol agent testified that such documents are kept in,that the documents offered were copies of documents from defendant,that the agent was the custodian of that,and that the documents admitted were true and correct copies of the documents in the,which the agent had personally seen.at.in lopez case,officer oki testified to the same that he was the temporary custodian of lopez a file,that a verification of removal is a document that is included customarily in a files,and that the verification of removal introduced as exhibit was a true and correct copy of a document from lopez a file.moreover,as we explained in estrada eliverio,fre does not require personal knowledge of a document creation,but rather only personal knowledge that a document was part of an official file.at.officer oki testimony indicates that he had the requisite personal knowledge,and therefore his testimony was sufficient to make a prima facie case for authenticity.id.
the district court clearly erred by admitting agent harris lay opinion on the question of lopez physical removal.however,the erroneous admission of that testimony does not warrant reversal.under plain error review,an appellate court may,in its discretion,correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states marcus,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.lopez has met the first two requirements,but not the remaining two.
on redirect,the prosecutor asked agent harris,b ased upon your training and experience by looking at lopez verification of removal,do you believe he was actually deported from the united states agent harris responded,yes.i believe he was.
lopez argues that this testimony was inadmissible under federal rule of evidence because agent harris lacked personal knowledge.he also argues it was inadmissible under feder
