carlos alberto flores lopez petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge decision finding that his conviction for resisting an executive officer in violation of section of the california penal code cpc is a categorical crime of violence,rendering him removable under section a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.we have jurisdiction under a d,we grant the petition for review,and we remand to the bia for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
flores lopez was born in el salvador and was admitted to the united states as a legal permanent resident in on or around his eleventh birthday.in,he pled guilty to resisting an executive officer in violation of cpc and was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment.
the procedural history of flores lopez removal proceedings is somewhat convoluted.on february,the immigration and naturalization service initiated removal proceedings against flores lopez by filing a notice to appear.the notice charged flores lopez with removability under ina a a iii,a a iii,as an alien convicted of a crime of violence aggravated felony.
flores lopez first appeared before the immigration judge ij on march.his case was repeatedly postponed until october,when a hearing was scheduled on contested issues of removability and eligibility for cancellation of removal.two days before the hearing,flores lopez submitted a motion to terminate removal proceedings,arguing that cpc was not a categorical crime of violence.
at the october,hearing,the department of homeland security dhs offered an abstract of judgment,a charging document information,a motion for discovery,and a probation report as evidence that flores lopez had been convicted of violating cpc.flores lopez responded that dhs had failed to meet its burden of proving that he was removable.pursuant to his motion to terminate,flores lopez argued that cpc was not a categorical crime of violence because the statute could be violated through the use of de minimis force and the government had failed to prove that flores lopez had used more than de minimis force in committing the offense.
dhs requested that the case be postponed so that it could respond to flores lopez motion in writing and so that it could further prepare.the ij denied the motion for a continuance and proceeded to consider removability.the ij concluded that dhs had failed to sustain its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that flores lopez had been convicted of a crime of violence and terminated the removal proceedings.
dhs filed a timely appeal to the bia,arguing both that cpc was a crime of violence and that the ij had erred by refusing to grant dhs a continuance to file a written response to petitioner motion to terminate.dhs also contended that flores lopez was removable on two additional grounds and requested that the bia remand the matter to the ij so that dhs could lodge an additional charge against flores lopez.
the bia remanded the proceedings to the ij to allow dhs to lodge the additional charge.however,on flores lopez motion for reconsideration of the remand order,the bia vacated its decision.instead,it sustained dhs appeal of the ij decision and held that a conviction under cpc qualifies categorically as a crime of violence.on that basis,the bia remanded the proceedings to the ij to enter a new decision.
on september,on remand from the bia,the ij entered an order of removal against flores lopez.flores lopez appealed,arguing again that cpc is not a categorical a crime of violence,and the bia summarily dismissed the appeal.this petition for review followed.
whether an offense is an aggravated felony under a is a legal question reviewed de novo.estrada rodriguez mukasey,cir internal quotation omitted.we review only the bia decision,except to the extent that it expressly adopts the ij opinion.see garrovillas ins,cir.where the bia issues its own decision but relies in part on the immigration judge reasoning,we review both decisions.see alaelua,cir.here,we review both the original bia decision,overturning the ij cancellation of removal,and the second bia decision,dismissing flores lopez appeal.
flores lopez is removable if his california conviction for resisting an executive officer is an aggravated felony,specifically a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.see a a iii a f.to determine whether the california conviction is a crime of violence,we apply the categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,d,looking only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.cpc provides 
every person who attempts,by means of any threat or violence,to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon such officer by law,or who knowingly resists,by the use of force or violence,such officer,in the performance of his duty,is punishable by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars,or by imprisonment in the state prison,or in a county jail not exceeding one year,or by both such fine and imprisonment.
the statute may be violated in two ways by attempting through threats or violence to deter or prevent an officer from performing a duty imposed by law or by resisting by force or violence an officer in the performance of his or her duty.in re manuel,cal th,d,cal.the two ways of violating cpc have been called the attempting to deter prong and the actually resisting an officer prong.people lopez,th,d.because the proscribed conduct under cpc encompasses two categories of conduct,cpc is only a categorical crime of violence if both categories constitute crimes of violence.
an offense is a crime of violence if it is 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
the term crime of violence suggests a category of violent,active crimes.leocal ashcroft,d.we have squarely held that the force necessary to constitute a crime of violence must actually be violent in nature.singh ashcroft,cir citing united states ceron sanchez,cir internal quotation omitted.specifically,the physical force requirement of demands a greater degree of force than the mere offensive touching necessary to sustain a conviction of battery.see ortega mendez gonzalez,cir.
petitioner argues that a conviction under cpc is not a crime of violence because it requires only the use of de minimis force,as opposed to the physical force necessary to constitute a crime of violence.we agree.the language of cpc provides that in order to convict a person under the statute,the state must prove that the person used or threatened to use violence for a conviction under the attempting to deter prong or that he or she used force or violence for a conviction under the actually resisting prong.to determine whether the words violence and force constitute the type of physical force necessary for an offense to be a crime of violence,we consider not only the language of the statute but also how that statute is defined in judicial opinions.ortega mendez,at citing united states bonat,cir.
here,the use note to the cpc model jury instructions points to the definition of force or violence as used in the law of battery see caljic.the battery definition provides that force and violence are synonymous and mean any unlawful application of physical force against the person of another,even though it causes no pain or bodily harm or leaves no mark and even though only the feelings of such person are injured by the act.caljic.this definition is precisely the definition that we considered in ortega mendez.at analyzing whether an offense under cpc,california battery statute,was a crime of violence.there,we held that the instruction comports with the case law for battery and that such conduct,involving mere offensive touching,does not rise to the level of
