saul,a previously deported mexican citizen,was convicted of being found in the united states after having without the permission of the attorney general in violation of.this appeal presents issues relating to the government overlooking serna presence in state jails,his reindictment,and dates as to when he was found in the united states.serna contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds and the evidence offered at trial was insufficient to support his conviction.we disagree with both contentions and therefore affirm serna conviction.
serna legally entered the united states in and obtained permanent resident status in.in,he was convicted of burglary of a habitation and sentenced to eight years on each of three counts,which he served concurrently.upon completion of his sentence,serna was deported from the united states at brownsville,texas on july.
serna illegally the united states sometime in august of through brownsville,texas.he obtained a texas driver license on august,and took up residence in houston.at some point,the houston police department hpd learned that serna was in houston and began investigating him for the contract murder of an hpd officer.on january,an undercover informant working for the hpd photographed serna at a houston club.on july,ins agent carlos gonzales created a report of investigation on serna detailing his criminal history and immigration status.the report stated that as of august,serna list s his address as king,houston,texas.it further stated that the current ins investigation of serna was predicated upon information received from houston police officer,hernandez,indicating that had once again reentered the united states after having been deported 
on august,a federal grand jury indicted serna for having been found present in the united states,at houston,texas o n or about january,in violation of a and b.three days later,the hpd arrested serna on a state arrest warrant.on february,approximately six months after his arrest,an ins agent interviewed serna in state prison but did not notice that he had a federal charge pending against him.the government thus failed to pursue the indictment against serna until february,when the state paroled him into federal custody and ins officials for the first time connected him to the august,federal indictment.serna made his initial appearance in federal court on march.one month later,the government filed a superseding indictment against him,charging him with having been found in huntsville,texas o n or about february,the date on which he was interviewed by the ins in state prison.
serna moved to dismiss the indictment for violation of his federal constitutional right to a speedy trial on may.at a pretrial conference held on the record,the district court denied serna motion.although the court did not orally assign reasons for its determination,the record indicates that its decision was made after consideration of the supreme court decision in doggett united states,d,and this court own precedent in united states bergfeld,cir.
on june,one week after the pretrial conference,the district court held a bench trial on stipulated facts.at that trial,serna stipulated to the following set of facts that he was a citizen of mexico that he was deported in following his conviction and sentence for burglary that he was encountered at the texas department of criminal justice on february,that a record search revealed no evidence of his filing for to the united states and that a fingerprint analysis matched his fingerprints to those on the warrant of deportation and conviction.serna also introduced three exhibits which the district court admitted into evidence without objection a time line of events produced by his attorney,an undated letter from ins agent carlos gonzalez to an assistant united states attorney referred to only as peck,and a letter from gonzalez to ausa dated july.at the time of the introduction of the exhibits,serna counsel explicitly represented to the court that the exhibits were not going to be relevant in the trial but were related to an earlier motion of an unclear nature made by serna which the judge had denied.in admitting the exhibits,the district court noted that it was for the purposes of preserving the record for appellate rights in case serna decided to appeal this denial of the earlier motion.
after briefly examining the evidence and the joint stipulation of facts,the district court found serna guilty on the charge as stated in the superceding indictment.serna was sentenced to serve months in the custody of the bureau of prisons and a term of supervised release.the court denied serna request for a downward departure based upon the time served for his state conviction.serna timely appealed.he now argues that his conviction should be reversed on one of two grounds.first,he contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss his indictment on speedy trial grounds.second,he asserts that,in any event,the evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to support his conviction.
as we have noted,serna first was indicted in august of the government,however,did not begin to pursue this indictment until march or april of serna argues that this and eight or delay constitutes a violation of his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.
in describing how the right to a speedy trial is protected by the constitution,the supreme court has held that the dismissal of the indictment may be warranted where the right is violated.barker wingo,d.the right attaches when a person is arrested,indicted or otherwise charged.doggett united states,at.to determine whether a defendant right to a speedy trial has been denied so as to justify the dismissal of the indictment,a court must evaluate and balance four factors the length of the delay,the reason for the delay,the defendant diligence in asserting his sixth amendment right,and prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.united states cardona,cir citing barker wingo,at.this court reviews a district court findings in applying the elements of this balancing test for clear error.bergfeld,at.
the supreme court has most recently elaborated upon these four speedy trial factors in doggett.there,the court noted that the first length of the a triggering mechanism for determining whether the court is required to balance the remaining three barker factors.id.at.see robinson whitley,cir.although the doggett court did not specify a length that would suffice per se,it observed that the lower courts had generally found a delay sufficient to warrant judicial examination of the claim.doggett,at.this rule is followed by our circuit as well.bergfeld,at.here,both sides concede that the delay between indictment and appearance in court exceeded one year accordingly,it is clear that we must engage in a barker balancing.see robinson,at noting that once a court determines that the length of the delay is sufficiently long to trigger the barker analysis,it must make findings regarding the remaining three factors and balance all accordingly.
in applying a barker balancing,the court must weigh the first three barker of the delay,reason for the delay,and defendant diligence in asserting his any prejudice suffered by the defendant due to the delay in prosecution.see id.at.obviously,in this balancing,the less prejudice a defendant experiences,the less likely it is that a denial of a speedy trial right will be found.ordinarily,the burden of demonstrating such prejudice rests on the defendant.id.doggett noted,however,that a defendant can be relieved from bearing this burden in circumstances where the first three barker factors weigh so heavily in favor of the defendant that prejudice is to be presumed.id.citing doggett,at.in such cases,the defendant is relieved of the burden of proving actual prejudice and will receive relief unless the government shows that the presumption is extenuated,as by the defendant acquiescence in the delay,or rebuts the presumption with evidence.doggett,at.in this appeal,serna foremost contention is that the barker factors weigh so heavily in his favor,he is e
