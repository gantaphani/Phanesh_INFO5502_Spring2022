while detained by immigration authorities,francisco castenada persistently sought treatment for a bleeding,suppurating lesion.although a public health service phs physician assistant and three outside specialists repeatedly advised that castaneda urgently needed a biopsy,petitioners a phs physician and a commissioned phs officer denied the request.after castaneda was released from custody,tests confirmed that he had metastatic cancer.he then filed this suit,raising medical negligence claims against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca,and constitutional claims against petitioners under bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents.when castaneda died,respondents,his representative and heir,were substituted as plaintiffs.the district court denied petitioners motion to dismiss the bivens action,rejecting their claim of absolute immunity under a,which provides the ftca remedy against the united states provided by b and for damage for personal injury,including death,resulting from the performance of medical or related functions by any phs commissioned officer or employee while acting within the scope of his office or employment,shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same against the officer or employee.emphasis added.the ninth circuit affirmed.
held the immunity provided by a precludes bivens actions against individual phs officers or employees for harms arising out of constitutional violations committed while acting within the scope of their office or employment.
a the court inquiry begins and ends with a text,which plainly precludes a bivens action against petitioners by limiting recovery for harms arising from the conduct at issue to an ftca action against the united states.the breadth of a words exclusive and any supports this reading,as does the provision inclusive reference to all civil proceedings arising out of the same.because the phrase exclusive of any other civil action is easily broad enough to accommodate both known and unknown causes of action,the court reading is not undermined by the fact that a preceded bivens.the later enacted westfall act further supports this understanding of a.in amending the ftca to make its remedy against the united states exclusive for most claims against government employees for their official conduct,the westfall act essentially duplicated a exclusivity language,b,but provided an explicit exception for constitutional violations,b.this shows that congress did not understand the exclusivity provided by b or the substantially similar a to imply such an exception.
b respondents arguments to the contrary do not undermine the court conclusion.
respondents heavy reliance on carlson green,is misplaced.carlson is inapposite to the issue in this case whether petitioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations because the carlson petitioners invoked no official immunity.instead,the case considered the separate question whether a remedy was available under the eighth amendment for alleged violations of the cruel and unusual punishments clause notwithstanding that a federal remedy was also available under the ftca.
contrary to respondents contention,a does not incorporate a bivens exception through its to b and that section to the ftca,which includes the westfall act exception for constitutional claims,b a.because a refers only to t he remedy provided by sections b and emphasis added,only those portions of the ftca that establish its remedy are incorporated by a reference to.section b is not such a provision.
respondents claim that the westfall act bivens exception,b a,directly preserves a bivens action against phs officers and employees is belied by the fact that the provision by its terms applies only to the specific immunity set forth in p aragraph.moreover,if a forecloses a bivens action against phs personnel,respondents reading of b a would effect an implied repeal of the more specific a.repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed absent a clear and manifest legislative intent to repeal.hawaii office of hawaiian affairs.nothing suggests that congress intended b to repeal a more comprehensive immunity.
respondents contention that other features of show that a does not make the ftca remedy exclusive of all other actions against phs personnel is rejected.neither c nor f indicates that an injured party may maintain a bivens action against an individual phs officer or employee in these circumstances.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents the question whether a,as added,stat,precludes an action under bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,against public health service phs personnel for constitutional violations arising out of their official duties.when federal employees are sued for damages for harms caused in the course of their employment,the federal tort claims act ftca,generally authorizes substitution of the united states as the defendant.section a makes the ftca remedy against the united states exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding for any personal injury caused by a phs officer or employee performing a medical or related function while acting within the scope of his office or employment.based on the plain language of a,we conclude that phs officers and employees are not personally subject to bivens actions for harms arising out of such conduct.
francisco castaneda was detained by immigration and customs enforcement ice at the san diego correctional facility sdcf beginning in march.according to the complaint later filed in the district court,when castaneda arrived at sdcf he had on his penis an irregular,raised lesion that measured roughly two centimeters square castaneda promptly brought his condition to the attention of medical personnel working for the division of immigration health services,reporting that the lesion was growing in size and becoming more painful and that it frequently bled and emitted a discharge.petitioner esther hui,a civilian phs employee,was the physician responsible for castaneda medical care during his detention at sdcf.petitioner commander stephen gonsalves,a commissioned phs officer,was a health services administrator at sdcf during the relevant period.
between march and january,castaneda persistently sought treatment for his condition.as his disease progressed,the lesion became increasingly painful and interfered with his urination,defecation,and sleep.in december,castaneda additionally reported a lump in his groin.a phs physician assistant and three outside specialists repeatedly advised that castaneda needed a biopsy to ascertain whether he had cancer.petitioners denied requests for a biopsy and other recommended procedures as elective.app.instead,castaneda was treated with ibuprofen and antibiotics and was given an additional ration of boxer shorts.
after a fourth specialist recommended a biopsy in january,the procedure was finally authorized.instead of providing treatment,however,ice released castaneda from custody on february.a week later,biopsy results confirmed that castaneda was suffering from penile cancer.the next day,castaneda had his penis amputated,and he began chemotherapy after tests confirmed that the cancer had metastasized to his groin.the treatment was unsuccessful,and castaneda died in february.
three months before his death,castaneda filed suit against petitioners in the united states district court for the central district of california.as relevant,castaneda raised medical negligence claims against the united states under the ftca and bivens claims against petitioners for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of his fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendment rights after castaneda death,respondents castaneda sister,yanira castaneda,and his daughter,vanessa castaneda by and through her mother,lucia pelayo amended the complaint to substitute themselves as plaintiffs.yanira and vanessa castaneda are respectively the representative of and heir to castaneda estate.
petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them,contending that a gives them absolute immunity from bivens actions by making a suit against the united states under the ftca the exclusive remedy for harms caused by phs personnel in the course of their medical or related duties.the district court denied the motion,concluding that a text and history evidence a congressional intent to preserve bivens actions.castaneda united states,supp.petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal 
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the district court judgment that a does not preclude respondents bivens claims.castaneda united states,the court cited carlson green,for the proposition that a bivens remedy is unavailable only when an alternative remedy is both expressly declared to be a substitute and can be viewed as equally effective,or when special factors militate against direct recovery.looking to the statute text and history,the court noted that a does not mention the constitution or recovery thereunder and found it significant that was enacted prior to this court decision in bivens.drawing further support for its view from the statute legislative history and from subsequent congressional enactments,the court of appeals concluded that a does not expressly make the remedy under the ftca a substitute for relief under bivens.
for essentially the reasons given in carlson,at,the court of appeals also determined that the ftca remedy is not equally effective as a bivens remedy.unlike the remedy under the ftca,the court reasoned,a bivens remedy is awarded against individual defendants and may include punitive damages.additionally,bivens cases may be tried before a jury,and liability is governed by uniform federal rules rather than the law of the state in which the violation occurred.after further concluding that no special factors militate against finding a remedy available in these circumstances,the court held that respondents bivens action could proceed.
as the ninth circuit recognized,its holding conflicts with the second circuit decision in cuoco moritsugu,which construed a to foreclose bivens actions against phs personnel.we granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.
our inquiry in this case begins and ends with the text of a.see harris trust and sav.bank salomon smith barney.the statute provides in pertinent part that 
t he remedy against the united states provided by sections b and of title for damage for personal injury,including death,resulting from the performance of medical,surgical,dental,or related functions,including the conduct of clinical studies or investigation,by any commissioned officer or employee of the public health service while acting within the scope of his office or employment,shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same against the officer or employee or his estate whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.a emphasis added.
section a grants absolute immunity to phs officers and employees for actions arising out of the performance of medical or related functions within the scope of their employment by barring all actions against them for such conduct.by its terms,a limits recovery for such conduct to suits against the united states.the breadth of the words exclusive and any supports this reading,as does the provision inclusive reference to all civil proceedings arising out of the same.we have previously cited a to support the contention that congress follows the practice of explicitly stating when it means to make ftca an exclusive remedy.carlson,at.the meaning of a has become no less explicit since we last made that observation.
our reading of a text is not undermined by the fact that the provision preceded our decision in bivens.contrary to the view of the court of appeals,that a bivens remedy had not yet been recognized when a was enacted does not support the conclusion that congress,in making the remedy provided by the ftca exclusive of any other civil action,did not mean what it said.language that broad easily accommodates both known and unknown causes of action.
the later enacted federal employees liability reform and tort compensation act of westfall act,stat,further supports this understanding of a.the westfall act amended the ftca to make its remedy against the united states the exclusive remedy for most claims against government employees arising out of their official conduct in providing this official immunity,congress used essentially the same language as it did in a,stating that the remedy against the united states is exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding,b.notably,congress also provided an exception for constitutional violations.pursuant to b,the immunity granted by b does not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the government brought for a violation of the constitution of the united states.b a.the westfall act explicit exception for bivens claims is powerful evidence that congress did not understand the exclusivity provided by b or the substantially similar a to imply such an exception.given congress awareness of immunity provisions like when it enacted the westfall act,see united states smith,it is telling that congress declined to enact a similar exception to the immunity provided by a.
in advocating a contrary reading of a,respondents rely heavily on our opinion in carlson,as did the court of appeals.carlson,however,is inapposite to the issue in this case.there are two separate inquiries involved in determining whether a bivens action may proceed against a federal agent whether the agent is amenable to suit,and whether a damages remedy is available for a particular constitutional violation absent authorization by congress.see united states stanley,t he availability of a damages action under the constitution for particular injuries is a question logically distinct from immunity to such an action on the part of particular defendants even in circumstances in which a bivens remedy is generally available,an action under bivens will be defeated if the defendant is immune from suit.see,at remanding for determination of respondents immunity after implying a cause of action under the fourth amendment.
because petitioners in carlson invoked no official immunity,the court did not address that question.instead,it considered whether a remedy was available under the eighth amendment for alleged violations of the cruel and unusual punishments clause notwithstanding that a federal remedy was also available under the ftca,at.many of our subsequent bivens decisions likewise addressed only the existence of an implied cause of action for an alleged constitutional violation.see,wilkie robbins,declining to devise a new bivens damages action for retaliating against the exercise of ownership rights bush lucas,declining to authorize a new nonstatutory damages remedy for federal employees whose first amendment rights are violated by their superiors 
this case presents the separate question whether petitioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations.to determine a defendant amenability to suit,we consider whether he or she may claim the benefits of official immunity for the alleged misconduct.because petitioners invoke only the immunity provided by a,the question in this case is answered solely by reference to whether that provision gives petitioners the immunity they claim 
as noted,the text of a plainly indicates that it precludes a bivens action against petitioners for the harm alleged in this case.respondents offer three arguments in support of their claim that it does not.none persuades us that a means something other than what it says.
respondents first contend that a incorporates the entirety of the ftca,as amended by the westfall act,through its reference to b section b in turn refers to the provisions of chapter,which constitute the ftca,including the westfall act exception for claims brought for a violation of the constitution of the united states,b a.through this series of,respondents would read that exception for
