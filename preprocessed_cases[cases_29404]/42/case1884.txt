returning to this court for the third time,this case arises out of an illegal alien smuggling conspiracy that caused the deaths of nineteen undocumented aliens secreted in the trailer of a driven by defendant tyrone mapletoft williams from harlingen,texas,to victoria,texas.five days after receiving the case at the close of williams trial for various alien smuggling offenses in violation of the jury returned the verdict form with both an entry of guilty and an express statement of hopeless deadlock on counts through.the government appeals,and we now confront questions relating to the scope of williams second trial,if any.
in the evening of may,williams and fatima holloway,one of the fourteen individuals charged in the conspiracy,loaded approximately illegal aliens into williams.with williams driving,they departed harlingen,texas,for the trip to robstown,texas.during the trip the aliens began banging on the sealed trailer,screaming to be released due to heat exhaustion and suffocation.holloway suggested that williams turn on the refrigeration unit in the trailer,but he refused.shortly after passing a border patrol checkpoint,williams noticed that the aliens had clawed a hole in the back door of the trailer and that his tail light was dangling from the door.angered,williams contacted the other individuals allegedly part of the conspiracy and demanded more money.they directed williams to proceed to houston,texas,extending the trip by approximately miles.
upon reaching refugio,texas,williams backed his trailer into a dark area and entered a nearby convenience store,where he purchased four or five small bottles of water.williams continued north,stopping next in victoria,texas,where he parked the trailer in a dark field near another convenience store.williams made three trips into the store,each time purchasing water.then,williams asked holloway to enter the store to purchase water,which she did.when holloway returned to the store a second time,again to purchase more water,one of the undocumented aliens from williams trailer ran into the store,shirtless,shouting that someone was trying to kill him.as holloway returned to the trailer,she noticed that the doors were open and that some of the aliens were walking into a nearby field.williams grabbed the water from holloway,forced her into the cab,and sped away,abandoning the trailer.nineteen undocumented aliens died from dehydration and suffocation.
williams and the other individuals were charged together in a indictment with various alien smuggling offenses in violation of.count charged williams and the others with conspiracy to conceal,harbor,shield from detection,and transport illegal aliens.counts through charged williams,both as a principal and as an aider and abettor,with unlawful concealment of illegal aliens.
counts through are the focal point of this appeal.counts through involved aliens that were allegedly injured during the unlawful transportation.specifically,counts through charged that williams 
did knowingly and in reckless disregard of the fact that the aliens identified in counts through herein,were aliens who had come to,entered,and remained in the united states in violation of law,did transport,move,attempt to transport,and attempt to move said aliens in furtherance of such violation of law within the united states,namely,from a location at or near harlingen,texas to another location at or near victoria,texas and other places,by means of a rig,for the purpose of commercial advantage and private financial gain.during and in relation to said violation,the defendants caused serious bodily injury to a person and placed in jeopardy the life of a person.
counts through mirrored counts through,except that counts through involved aliens that died as a result of the transportation.
because nineteen aliens died,williams and most of the were subject to the death penalty under a b iv.after complying with department of justice protocol,the government filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty against williams,and the district court severed williams case from the other defendants.williams sought discovery of the government practices,alleging that the united states selectively prosecuted him on account of his race the government objected,asserting that williams had not carried his burden under united states armstrong and united states bass the district court ordered discovery into the government practices and issued a sanctions order,creating an affirmative defense based on selective prosecution.we granted the government petition for mandamus,vacating the discovery order and the sanctions 
williams then renewed a previously denied motion to have the phase determined by a qualified jury and to have a new,jury decide punishment,if necessary.the district court granted williams request,finding good cause due to t he case management problems that have arisen in this case because of the government interlocutory appeal of this court discovery rulings.at the conclusion of a status conference on friday,february,the district court announced that the trial would begin at on monday,february,with a qualified jury.the next day,a saturday,this court ordered a stay of the trial until it could rule on the government second petition for writ of mandamus.on february,this court rendered its second published opinion in this case,holding that the district court improvised a procedure at odds with the federal death penalty act.we vacated the order and directed that the case proceed promptly to trial with a single,jury for both phases of the case 
jury selection began on february,with a jury panel of citizens.trial began on march,and the united states presented testimony and evidence from approximately eighty witnesses,including many foreign nationals requiring translation.the jury received the case on march.
both the jury instructions and the verdict form are critical to the questions presented in this case.with respect to counts through,the jury instructions provided 
title,united states code,sections a a ii and a b i,make it a crime for anyone to transport an alien within the united states for the purpose of commercial financial advantage and private financial gain,knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien is here illegally,and in furtherance of the alien violation of law.
for you to find the defendant guilty of this crime,you must be convinced that the government has proved each of the following beyond a reasonable doubt 
first that certain undocumented aliens had entered or remained in the united states in violation of law.
second that the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the aliens were in the united states in violation of the law 
third that the defendant transported or attempted to transport the aliens within the united states with intent to further the alien unlawful presence 
fourth that an offense was done for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.
you will also be asked to determine if the government has proved the following beyond a reasonable doubt if,during and in relation to said violation defendant caused serious bodily injury to a person and placed the life of a person in jeopardy.
these instructions tracked the fifth circuit pattern jury instructions,except that the district court included one of the facts necessary for the offense was done for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial an element of the basic transportation offense.
also following the fifth circuit pattern jury instructions,the instructions explained how williams could be found guilty as an aider and abettor,and the instructions required the jury to make an independent determination of williams role in the offense 
you will also be asked to determine whether the defendant acted as a principal,as an aider and abettor,or both.a principal is the immediate perpetrator of a crime that is,the one who directly commits the offense.the principal is the actual offender rather than one who merely assists another in committing an offense.an aider and abettor is one who helps the principal during the commission of the crime,but may not have committed the crime with his or her own hands.
the instructions did not define what it meant or how it could be that a single defendant could be both a principal and an aider and abettor in the commission of a single crime 
the verdict form tracked the jury instructions.the government concedes that it was drafted differently in this case.as the court of appeals for the district of columbia explained,
when a greater and lesser offense are charged to the jury,the proper course is to tell the jury to consider first the greater offense,and to move on to consideration of the lesser offense only if they have some reasonable doubt as to guilt of the greater offense 
here,in contrast,the order was reversed.the jury was first asked to enter a finding of guilt on the basic transportation offense,which included the financial gain element.then,the jury was asked two additional questions whether the defendant acted as a principal,an aider and abettor,or both and whether the defendant actions caused any of the statutory injury factors.
with respect to counts through,the verdict form stated 
we,the jury,unanimously find the defendant,
tyrone mapletoft williams 
guilty or not guilty 
the jury is instructed that,should you find the defendant not guilty,you do not need to answer the questions immediately following and may proceed to the next count.
we,the jury,further unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that during and in relation to said violation the defendant,tyrone mapletoft williams was 
a principal 
an aider and abettor 
both,a principal and an aider and abettor 
we,the jury,further unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that during and in relation to said violation name of victim 
with respect to counts through,the verdict form was identical,except that it instructed the jury to also determine if the death of a person resulted from the offense conduct.the verdict form contained the additional line 
five days after receiving the case,the jury returned two notes,both indicating that,with respect to counts through and certain aspects of counts through,the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.specifically,the first note provided 
judge gilmore,
it appears that this jury is hopelessly deadlocked on counts and.we have agreed on on counts and but are hopelessly deadlocked on the on those counts.
following an allen charge,the jury returned the second note 
judge gilmore,
arguments have been made,evidence has been reviewed,and we have discussed all at length.there is and has been no movement.we are deadlocked as before.
judge gilmore polled the jury,and only three of the jurors believed that it would be useful to continue deliberating.the other nine reiterated that they were hopelessly deadlocked.
the jury verdict form contained only an entry of guilty on the first line provided in counts through.besides the two notes,the jury gave no other indication of how it resolved any issue in this case.williams moved for a mistrial on whatever they have reached a verdict on.the court determined that the jury returned a verdict of guilty on aiding and abetting the commission of the transportation offense in counts through,and it entered a judgment on that verdict.the court declared a mistrial on counts through.
the government disputed the district court interpretation of the jury work.at a status conference on april,the government announced its intention to retry williams on counts through.the district court denied the government request,stating that the government could retry williams only on counts through.the government filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied,holding that the double jeopardy clause barred retrial on counts through because the evidence presented by the government at trial was found to be insufficient by the unanimous jury to establish that the injury factors should enhance the sentence.the court relied upon bullard estelle,in which we held that the double jeopardy clause bars a second enhancement proceeding when the evidence at the first enhancement proceeding was insufficient to establish that the defendant committed one or more of the prior offenses necessary for enhancement.the district court held that the government presented insufficient evidence to establish the injury factors,a conclusion the court reached from the circumstance that,in her words,the jury remained silent on the in counts through.the government timely appealed.
the government right to appeal in criminal matters is controlled by.that section provides,in part 
in a criminal case an appeal by the united states shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision,judgment,or order of a district court dismissing an indictment or information or granting a new trial after verdict or judgment,as to any one or more counts,or any part thereof,except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the united states constitution prohibits further prosecution 
by its own terms,is to be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes,as it is intended to remove all statutory barriers to government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the constitution would permit.we examine the consequences of the ruling by the district court,unbounded by the label given it.a district court judge can not circumvent the government right to appeal under by taking action that has the effect of a dismissal yet never actually entering a decision,judgment,or order.
here,the district court never entered an order dismissing counts through of the indictment rather,the court entered a judgment on the jury verdict of guilty on the aiding and abetting offense alleged in counts through,refused the government request to retry williams on the greater aggravated offenses in those counts,and denied the government motion to reconsider that refusal.if the government can not proceed on the greater aggravated offenses in counts through,then the district court entry of judgment and denial of the government motion for reconsideration effectively remove s a discrete basis of liability,which has the practical effect of a dismissal if the government can not proceed on the greater aggravated offenses,then williams is not subject to the higher penalties,including death,provided for in a b i,iii,and iv.we have jurisdiction under 
our task is to determine whether the government can retry williams for various alien smuggling offenses and,if so,what the scope of that second trial will be both parties agree that the jury convicted williams on counts through of aiding and abetting the commission of the transportation offense,although for widely divergent reasons.to williams,the conviction for aiding and abetting triggers the double jeopardy clause which precludes a second trial on the greater aggravated offenses in counts through.to the government,the aiding and abetting conviction does not preclude retrial on the greater aggravated offenses in those counts.the government seeks to keep the aiding and abetting conviction in its hip pocket,should a second trial,if any,result in a complete acquittal.
regardless of whether we agree with williams that there was a conviction for aiding and abetting,that conviction would not preclude a second trial on the greater aggravated offenses in counts through.it is plain that,following apprendi,the injury factors in a b iii and iv are elements of greater aggravated offenses,as the government contends,rather than mere sentencing factors,as determined by the district court 
the transportation offense carries a punishment of five years imprisonment proof of the injury factors in both a b iii and iv increases the statutory maximum beyond that provided in a b ii.with a b iii,the maximum penalty increases to years if the government proves that during the commission of the offense,the defendant caused serious bodily injury to,or placed in jeopardy the life of,any person.likewise,with a b iv,the maximum penalty increase to life in prison or death if the government proves that during the commission of the offense,the defendant caused the death of any person.following apprendi,each additional specific injury that be alleged in the indictment,submitted to the jury,and found beyond a reasonable doubt.in short,each additional fact is an element of a greater aggravated offense 
given that the injury factors are elements of greater aggravated offenses,the presence or absence of a conviction on the lesser immaterial in light of the jury express statement of deadlock on the injury factors.if there were no conviction for aiding and abetting,then williams first trial ended with a hung jury,which does not preclude a second trial.if we assume that there was a conviction,then we would have a conviction on a lesser offense and a hopelessly deadlocked jury on the greater offense.in such a case,we agree with the eighth circuit that where the jury expressly indicates that it is unable to reach an agreement on the greater charge,a conviction on a lesser included offense does not constitute an implied acquittal of the greater offense and presents no bar to retrial on the greater offense.
williams,relying on green united states,argues that the conviction on the basic transportation offense,even as an aider and abettor,implies that the jury acquitted him of everything else.we disagree.in green,the supreme court recognized that a jury silence can be considered an implied acquittal.there,the supreme court held that a jury verdict on murder,coupled with silence on the greater offense murder,was no different than if the jury had returned a verdict which expressly read we find the defendant not guilty of murder in the first degree but guilty of murder in the second degree.on such facts,the double jeopardy clause precludes retrial of the greater offense williams reliance on green falls short where,as here,the jury was not silent on the greater aggravated offenses.both jury notes,as well as the subsequent poll,plainly indicate that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked on the injury factors in counts through.a statement of hopeless deadlock is neither a statement of silence,nor a statement of acquittal.
as things stand,the government,if it chooses,can retry williams on counts through and on the greater aggravated offenses the transportation offense a a ii with the additional injury factors a b iii and iv in counts through.we now turn to the remainder of counts through,which concern williams role in the transportation offense.specifically,we examine whether the jury convicted him of aiding and abetting the commission of the transportation offense when it returned both an entry of guilty,as to the elements of the offense,but a statement of hopeless deadlock,as to his role in the offense.we conclude that the jury failed to convict williams of any offense.thus,the government may retry williams on the basic transportation offense in counts through either a principal or as an aider and abettor.
first,the district court erred in this case when it engrafted onto the elements of the transportation offense a a ii an element of a greater aggravated,that the offense was committed for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.the financial gain fact is an element of a separate,greater offense in short,there are two offenses transporting and transporting for financial the former is a lesser included offense of the latter 
although the district court gave the jury a correct explanation of the four elements of transporting for financial gain,that was error because the government proceeded on two theories regarding williams role in the offense that of a principal and that of an aider and abettor.as we have previously held,when the government proceeds on an aider and abettor theory,the question of financial by the defendant or immaterial and should not be introduced into the picture lest it cause confusion.
that confusion stems from the interplay between the defendant role in the offense and the possible maximum sentences.if the defendant role in the transportation offense is only that of an aider and abettor,then the maximum punishment is years imprisonment under a b ii.yet if the defendant commits the offense as a principal and for financial gain,then the maximum punishment is years imprisonment under a b i.an aider and abettor,even one who commits the offense for the purpose of financial gain,is only subject to a maximum of years imprisonment because the district court only presented the jury with the transporting for financial gain offense,the government was forced to seek a separate question on williams role in that offense.on that question the jury was hopelessly deadlocked,which precludes the district court from sentencing williams.without a determination of williams role in the offense,we can not say whether the maximum term of imprisonment is years under a b ii or years under a b i.
second,we can not sustain a conviction for aiding and abetting because the jury did not unanimously agree that williams role in the offense was that of an aider and abettor.the jury was asked to make this finding but both jury notes confirm that they could not reach unanimous agreement on one or the other conviction in the federal system,however,requires a unanimous verdict this rule of unanimity extends to every element of the offense a lack of unanimity on williams role in the offense may not be fatal,however,as the unanimity requirement is not absolute.for instance,unanimity is not required as to the particular means used by the defendant to commit a particular element of the offense here,in light of the jury express and unequivocal statement of guilty,we could extend that means exception to the rule of unanimity to the defendant role in the offense.
we do not think the rule of unanimity ought to be extended so far.mere agreement on some form of culpable conduct is not sufficient to convict williams under.unlike the general aiding and abetting statute the alien smuggling statute distinguishes for purposes of punishment between a principal and an aider and abettor.under the general aiding and abetting statute,a person who aids and abets the commission of an offense is treated the same as a principal actor whoever commits an offense against the united states or aids,abets,counsels,commands,induces or procures its commission,is punishable as a principal.cabining the defendant role into a particular box is unnecessary.in fact,the jury will seldom be asked to make an independent determination of whether the defendant committed the offense as a principal or as an aider and abettor.both are sufficient for conviction both are treated the same for punishment.
we need not decide today whether,under the general aiding and abetting statute,the jury lack of unanimity on the defendant role in the offense is sufficient for conviction.the alien smuggling statute distinguishes between a principal and an aider and abettor for purposes of punishment.as the government proceeded on both tracks regarding williams role in the transportation offense,the jury must unanimously agree on at least one.the evidence in this case can tell two different stories.to some,williams could have appeared as a principal actor in the conspiracy driving the refusing to activate the trailer refrigeration unit,despite advice from holloway refusing to release the aliens and ignoring the aliens pleas for release.to others,williams could have appeared to be a mule,a mere pawn in the larger smuggling conspiracy calling the other individuals for instructions demanding more money purchasing water bottles for the aliens and leaving the scene once the aliens forged their own escape.all we have is hopeless deadlock on the specific question,and this is insufficient for conviction.
we recognize that,as a legal matter,any juror convinced that williams acted as a principal was also convinced that williams acted as an aider and abettor.but we decline to stretch the rule of unanimity so far as to imply a conviction.we do not know why the jury was unable to agree all we know is that they could not agree.neither the charge nor any response to the jury notes instructed the jury on how a single person could be both a principal and an aider and abettor in the commission of a single offense or explained that,as a legal matter,a juror convinced williams was a principal necessarily believed that williams was also an aider and abet
