we granted en banc consideration of petition for review to reconsider our decision in sun wen chen.for the reasons that follow,we now adopt the reasoning of the court of appeals for the second circuit and overrule the holding in sun wen chen.
factual background.
guang,a native and citizen of china,entered the united states in,and filed an application for asylum two months after arriving.in that petition,he claimed he was entitled to asylum based on china coercive birth control policy.he stated that his wife had been forced to have an intrauterine device iud inserted,and that she had been forced to undergo an abortion.according to,his wife treatment in china allowed him to establish his own persecution,thus allowing him to qualify for asylum under the broadened definition of refugee contained in amendments to a.
asylum petition 
according to the allegations in asylum petition,he and his wife were married in a traditional wedding ceremony in china in,before his wife reached the legal age for marriage under chinese law.petition also stated that his wife had given birth to a son approximately a year after their marriage.problems purportedly started four months after their son was born when family planning officials forced his wife to have an iud inserted and ordered her to undergo an iud inspection every four months.
in,and his wife officially registered their traditional marriage with government authorities.according to,they had to pay a fine when they registered their marriage because their child was born too soon after their wedding to comply with china family planning policy 
in,the couple arranged for a private doctor to remove the iud.thereafter,wife again became pregnant,and went into hiding to avoid family planning officials.claimed that family planning officials eventually found his wife when she was approximately six months pregnant.those officials forced her to accompany them to a birth control service station where labor was induced and the fetus was aborted.after the abortion,decided to leave china even though his wife health had deteriorated after the abortion,and even though they wanted to have more children.in a letter she submitted in support of asylum petition,wife claimed that the family intends to reunite and have more children presumably in the united states if is granted relief.
b.the asylum hearing.
during his asylum hearing,testified about incidents that he had not included in his asylum petition.for example,on,he testified that a second iud had been forcibly inserted into his wife in,after the forced abortion alleged in his petition.also testified during that he had been living at home until his departure from china,but was frequently away in november and december of.his testimony was somewhat contradictory,and it is not clear whether he was claiming to be away from home because of his work or because he was in hiding.in any event,he testified that his wife informed him that birth control cadres were looking for him while he was away.they purportedly threatened to arrest him and demanded that he appear at their offices and promise not to have any more unauthorized children.they also purportedly threatened to forcibly sterilize him.
the ij denied relief after concluding that testimony was implausible and overall unpersuasive.the ij was particularly troubled by the fact that testified extensively about the family planning cadres harassment and threats after the second abortion,but those incidents were not mentioned in his asylum petition,or in the letter that his wife submitted in support of it.the ij viewed that as a serious omission central to claim.the ij reasoned that,h ad this event occurred it is extremely unrealistic that would not have included such information in his application and his wife would not have included such information in her letter.
the ij was also troubled by the fact that asylum application mentioned nothing about a second iud being inserted in after his wife underwent a forced abortion,although he testified about that incident at the hearing.the omission was all the more suspect because wife also failed to mention it in her letter.the ij reasoned 
the omission can not be taken lightly in light of the fact that she made reference to an iud insertion in.it is inconceivable that she would mention an iud insertion in and fail to mention the most recent insertion of an iud in.
the ij also characterized testimony on as somewhat delirious and incoherent.was not able to provide the specifics requested by the court and counsel for the government,and the ij concluded that was making up new stories as he went along.the ij explained once was taken outside the script his testimony was clearly disjointed and he could not explain matters and rather than explaining he kept adding,unfortunately to his detriment.
the ij was also troubled by testimony about the population control measures in his region because it was inconsistent with background materials that said there was no evidence of forced abortions in the region of china where he and his wife lived.
c.the bia decision.
on appeal,the bia was also troubled by discrepancies between testimony before the ij and assertions in his asylum petition.the bia noted that petition made no mention of visits by birth control cadres in the months following the abortion,or threats of arrest and forced sterilization.in the bia view 
the omission itself is so substantial that if it were credible,it could form the basis of an asylum application.see a providing the definition of a refugee which includes persons who have a fear that they will be forced to undergo sterilization.in other words,the omission is directly related to threats and pursuits of persecution made against.hence,we can not characterize the omission as minor or,in this instance,excusable.the respondent also changed his testimony as to where he was residing in the last months of,at first saying he lived at his own household,but then saying he was sometimes hiding elsewhere,after he had testified to his own sterilization threat.consequently,we do not find that the immigration judge adverse credibility finding is clearly erroneous and we agree that the respondent did not meet his burden of proof for asylum.
this petition for review followed.
ii.legal background.
the immigration and nationality act ina or act gives the attorney general discretionary authority to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee.originally,the act defined refugee as 
a any person who is outside any country of such person nationality or,in the case of a person having no nationality,is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided,and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
in,congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira.section a of iirira added the following language at the end of a 
for purposes of determinations under this chapter,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
congress enacted a for the express purpose of overturning the bia decision in matter of chang.see.i,at the primary intent of this section is to overturn several decisions of the bia,principally matter of chang and matter of g.in matter of chang,the petitioner had requested asylum based upon his fear that he would be forcibly sterilized if returned to china.in affirming the ij rejection of his claim,the bia explained 
we can not find that implementation of the one couple,one child policy in and of itself,even to the extent that involuntary sterilizations may occur,is persecution or creates a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.to the extent that such a policy is solely tied to controlling population,rather than as a guise for acting against people for reasons protected by the act,we can not find that persons who do not wish to have the policy applied to them are victims of persecution or have a fear of persecution within the present scope of the act.
the bia had an opportunity to apply the newly expanded definition of refugee in matter of,bia en banc.there,an alien,whose wife and three children had remained in china,petitioned for asylum arguing that he was persecuted in china on account of his opposition to china birth control policies.id.at.according to the petitioner,the persecution consisted of his wife being sterilized against her will after the birth of their third child.the ij rejected the claim explaining i n effect,the applicant seeks to ride on his wife coattails or claim asylum because of alleged adverse factors to his wife,including forced sterilization.he,himself,has never been persecuted and he can not show either past persecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution.id.at quoting the ij decision alteration in.
on appeal,the bia acknowledged that the ij decision was consistent with matter of chang.however,the board noted that subsequent to the immigration judge decision,the law was amended to specifically address coercive family planning practices in the context of applications for asylum,and matter of chang,has been superseded the immigration and naturalization service ins actually agreed with the petitioner before the bia and took the position that past persecution of one spouse can be established by coerced abortion or sterilization of the other spouse.id.at.accordingly,the board held that the applicant in this case has established eligibility for asylum by virtue of his wife forced sterilization.id.at given the lack of opposition to the merits of the claim,the board was able to reach that conclusion without any explanation,examination of statutory text,or inquiry into congressional intent.see id.at in view of the enactment of section a of the iirira and the agreement of the parties that forced sterilization of one spouse on account of a ground protected under the act is an act of persecution against the other spouse,the applicant has established past persecution.
thereafter,the courts of appeals that were called upon to interpret a initially accepted the holding in.however,until recently the rule was not contested by the government.see,gonzales,cir the bia interprets this provision to cover the spouse of a person subjected to a forced abortion or sterilization,and the government does not challenge this interpretation.citing cao gonzales,cir in a case where forced sterilization abortion is the basis of a male petitioner claim,we allow him to stand in the shoes of his wife in claiming persecution.citing zhang gonzales,cir accepting the holding without discussion and rejecting the government position that subsequent of the marriage nullifies spouse status based on wife persecution he ashcroft,cir accepting the rule without discussion and then reversing adverse credibility finding see also zhang,cir however difficult the problems of identifying legitimate spousal persecution claims,we are obliged to defer to the bia interpretation of a,overruled by lin,
in,in a case remanded from the court of appeals for the second circuit,the bia reaffirmed the rule of matter of,bia.by then,however,the department of homeland security dhs had reversed the prior position of the ins and request ed that the board replace the spousal eligibility rule adopted in matter of with a approach grounded in the other resistance clause of section a of the act.id.at.in response,the board opined that t here is no clear or obvious answer to the scope of protections afforded by the iirira amendment to partners of persons forced to submit to an abortion or sterilization.id.at.the board then applied what it described as general principles requiring nexus and level of harm,and concluded that w hen the government intervenes in the private affairs of a married couple to force an abortion or sterilization,it persecutes the married couple as an entity.id.at.however,the board ultimately relied upon nothing more than its own view of the impact of coercive family planning measures on the marital relationship and affirmed the rule of.accordingly,the board held that the broadened definition of refugee set forth in a protect s both spouses.id.at.
soon thereafter,we decided sun wen chen.a divided panel of this court held that the board spousal eligibility rule as articulated in and was entitled to chevron deference because the majority perceived an ambiguity in a at n othing in the statute evince s congressional intent to establish a particular policy regarding spousal eligibility.the majority then concluded that the board interpretation was a permissible construction of the statute and thus entitled to deference.in the majority view,it was not unreasonable for the board to conclude that the scope of the harm resulting from the enforcement of a policy by forced abortion and involuntary sterilization extends to both spouses.id.at.
the dissent argued that the majority had erred in applying chevron,because a is not ambiguous.in the dissent view,congressional intent could readily be determined from the text of the statute,and therefore there was no need to defer to the agency construction of the statute.rather,in the dissent view,a unambiguously broaden ed the definition of refugee to include a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization.the dissent argued that the omission of any reference to a spouse was not accidental or insignificant.id.at mckee,dissenting emphasis in original.thus,the dissent concluded that analysis should begin and end with the text of the statute because there was no textual gap for an agency interpretation to fill.id.moreover,even assuming the statute contained some latent ambiguity,the dissent believed that the board interpretation of a would still not be entitled to deference because it was not a reasonable interpretation of the statute.id.at.
not long after the panel decided chen,the en banc court of appeals for the second circuit reviewed the board decision in as well as that court own precedent.in shi liang lin united states department of justice,cir en banc,the en banc court rejected the board interpretation of a,agreeing instead with the dissent in chen.in denying shi liang petition for review,the court of appeals for the second circuit held that a clearly and unambiguously states congressional intent to limit refugee status to one who is actually subjected to the coercive family planning procedure.id.at the court noted that the amendment repeatedly refers to a person who has been victimized,and concluded that,u nder the language used by congress,having someone else,such as one spouse,undergo a forced procedure does not suffice to qualify an individual for refugee status.id.at.t
