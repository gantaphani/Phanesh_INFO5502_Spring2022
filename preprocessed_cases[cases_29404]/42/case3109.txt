the panel denied in part and dismissed in part diego petition for review of the board of immigration appeals decision concluding that his conviction for attempted sexual abuse under oregon revised statutes is an aggravated felony that warranted termination of his asylee status.
in determining that diego conviction is an aggravated felony under a a,the panel applied the process articulated in descamps united states,and clarified in lynch,cir.en banc.
first,the panel held that the oregon statute is not a categorical match to the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor because the oregon statute criminalizes more conduct than the generic federal offense.second,the panel held that,in light of the statutory text,shepard documents,and state court decisions,subparagraphs a a through c are divisible.third,under the modified categorical approach,the panel concluded that diego was convicted under subparagraph a a,and that this subparagraph is categorically a generic federal sexual abuse of a minor offense,and by extension an aggravated felony under a a.

ikuta,circuit judge 
the board of immigration appeals bia concluded that federico diego de diego was an aggravated felon because of his conviction for attempted sexual abuse under oregon law.see or.stat.the bia therefore determined that diego was deportable,terminated his asylee status,denied his request for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident,and denied waiver of inadmissibility.diego petitions for review of these decisions.we deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part 
in order to explain diego arguments,we begin by reviewing the relevant legal framework.
the immigration and nationality act ina provides that the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who has applied for asylum in accordance with applicable procedures if the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general determines that such alien is a refugee b a.a grant of asylum,however,does not convey a right to remain permanently in the united states.id.c.rather,an alien asylee status may be terminated if the attorney general determines that the alien is ineligible for asylum.see id.c b.an alien is ineligible for asylum if the attorney general determines that the alien,having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,constitutes a danger to the community of the united states.id.b a ii.for purposes of the particularly serious crime determination,the ina provides that an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be considered to have been convicted of a particularly serious crime.id.b b i.under the ina,an aggravated felony includes sexual abuse of a minor,id.a a,and an attempt to commit such abuse,id.a u.an alien who has been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime is also ineligible for withholding of removal,id.b b ii,and may be denied other discretionary relief,such as adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident,id.b,or waiver of inadmissibility,id.c.
in order to determine whether a predicate state conviction is an aggravated felony for purposes of the ina,we apply a process set forth in descamps united states.see lynch,cir.en banc.
at the first step,we ask whether the elements of the alien state statute of conviction criminalize more conduct than,or the same conduct as,the elements of a generic federal offense included in the definition of aggravated felony set forth at a.see id.quoting lynch,cir.under this categorical approach,if the elements of the state crime are the same as or narrower than the elements of the federal offense,then the state crime is a categorical match and every conviction under that statute qualifies as an aggravated felony,at.by contrast,if the elements of the state statute of conviction criminalize more conduct than the elements of the generic federal offense,then the state statute is overbroad and is not a categorical match.id.at.
if the statute is overbroad,we proceed to step two and determine whether the state statute of conviction is divisible or indivisible.id.we employ a process to determine whether a state statute is divisible.first,we consider the statute text.descamps,at.if the text is drafted with a list of disjunctive items that comprise alternative elements,such that the statute effectively creates several different crimes,id.at quoting nijhawan holder,then the statute is divisible,see mathis united states.if the statute merely lists alternate means of satisfying a single element,then it is indivisible.see,at.
if distinguishing between alternative elements and alternative means in a disjunctively phrased state statute is difficult,descamps,at,we proceed to the second phase,examining the shepard documents to see whether the statute displays alternative elements instead of alternative means of committing the same crime,at.the shepard documents include the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented,shepard united states,as well as the clerk minute order,see united states snellenberger,cir.en banc per curiam,abrogated on other grounds by young holder,cir.en banc,and other documents that reflect the crime elements,descamps,and are of equal reliability to those the supreme court has approved,snellenberger,at.
in the third and final phase,we verify that our interpretation of the state statute of conviction is the same as the interpretation of the relevant state courts,at.in other words,we must verify that our interpretation of elements versus means is consistent with how the state would instruct a jury as to this offense.id.
if this analysis leads us to conclude that the statute is divisible,we proceed to the third step for determining if a state statute of conviction is an aggravated felony the modified categorical approach.at this step,we look to the shepard documents again,but this time to determine what crime,with what elements,a defendant was convicted of.mathis,at.once we identify the crime of conviction,we then compare that crime,as the categorical approach commands,with the relevant generic offense.id.stated otherwise,we repeat step one the categorical approach but limited to the actual crime of conviction described in the relevant subpart of the divisible criminal statute.if this crime elements are the same as or narrower than a generic federal offense that is defined as an aggravated felony under a,then the crime is a categorical match and a conviction for that offense constitutes an aggravated felony.see,at.
we now turn to the facts of this case.diego,a native and citizen of guatemala,entered the united states without inspection in december.about one year after his arrival in this country,he applied for asylum and withholding of removal,which an immigration judge ij granted in june.the bia affirmed the ij decision in september,but diego never filed an application to adjust his status to that of lawful permanent resident.
in february,diego was arrested in oregon after a young woman reported to the police that diego had entered her home in the middle of the night and inappropriately touched both her and a minor female in the home.according to the young woman,diego had awakened her,touched her breasts through her clothes,and attempted to pull down her pants.the young woman instructed diego to leave,but diego instead went to the living room of the home where he came upon,a friend of the young woman sister.when the young woman found diego with his arms wrapped around,she called the police.told police that diego had put his lip against the side of her mouth and touched her upper thigh.
in march,the state of oregon indicted diego on two counts of burglary in the first degree,one count of theft in the third degree,one count of sexual abuse in the third degree and,as relevant here,one count of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree in violation of section of the oregon revised statutes.count of the indictment charged that on or about february,in washington county,oregon,diego did unlawfully and intentionally attempt to subject,a person less than years of age,to sexual contact.
diego subsequently failed to attend one of his court hearings and was indicted for failure to appear.ultimately,diego pleaded guilty to the two counts of burglary in the first degree,one count of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree,and one count of failure to appear in the first degree the state dropped the remaining charges.diego petition to enter plea stated that he wished to plead guilty to count,attempted sexual abuse in the first degree,and i plead guilty and request the court to accept my plea and to have it entered on the basis of o n in washington county,i entered an apartment and while inside,i attempted to subject to sexual contact.
in september,diego was served with a notice to appear,alleging in pertinent part that he was removable as an aggravated felon,see a a iii,due to his conviction for attempted sexual abuse in violation of section.diego admitted the factual allegations in the notice to appear but denied removability.applying the modified categorical approach,the ij concluded that diego attempted sexual abuse conviction constituted an aggravated felony for purposes of a a.
after the ij ruled that diego was removable,the government moved to terminate diego asylee status and withholding of removal.diego,in turn,sought adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident under b and waiver of inadmissibility under c withholding of removal under b and relief under the convention against torture cat.because diego had been convicted of an aggravated felony,the ij determined that diego was no longer eligible for asylum,see b a ii,b i,and granted the government motion to terminate his asylee status,see id.c b.the ij then held,in the alternative,that diego case did not warrant the exercise of discretionary relief under b and c.finally,the ij determined that diego conviction rendered him ineligible for withholding of removal,and that diego had not established eligibility for relief under the cat.
the bia dismissed diego appeal in may,holding that the ij had not erred in concluding that diego conviction pursuant to section was for sexual abuse of a minor and therefore constituted an aggravated felony under a a.the bia determined that the oregon statute of conviction was divisible,that the indictment reflected that the victim was younger than fourteen,and that under ninth circuit precedent the criminal conduct was per se abusive.the bia also held that the ij had correctly determined that diego was ineligible for asylum and appropriately granted the government motion for termination of diego asylee status.
diego timely petitioned for review.he contends that the ij and bia erred in concluding that his conviction for attempted sexual abuse under section constitutes an aggravated felony,and by extension erred in terminating his asylee status and denying his application for adjustment of status and waiver of inadmissibility.
we have jurisdiction to decide questions of law raised in a petition for review,see a d,including whether diego conviction for attempted sexual abuse in the first degree is an aggravated felony.we review de novo the bia determination that diego conviction is an aggravated felony,and we do so without deference to the agency interpretation of state or federal criminal law.sandoval yates,cir.we lack jurisdiction to review decisions that the ina specifies to be in the discretion of the attorney general,a b ii,or any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony,id.a c.thus,we lack jurisdiction to consider any discretionary aspect of the agency decision to deny diego application for adjustment of status and waiver of inadmissibility under b and c,as the attorney general discretion is specified in the statute.see holder,cir.holding that we lack jurisdiction over the discretionary use of power under c spencer,united states,cir.holding that provisions providing that the attorney general may take certain action vest unreviewable ultimate authority in the discretion of the attorney general.
we now apply the relevant legal principles to the facts of this case.diego argues that his oregon conviction for attempted sexual abuse,or.stat,is a not an aggravated felony for purposes of a a because his crime of conviction is not a categorical match to the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor.section provides 
a person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree when that person 
a subjects another person to sexual contact and 
a the victim is less than years of age 
b the victim is subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor or 
c the victim is incapable of consent by reason of being mentally defective,mentally incapacitated or physically helpless or 
b intentionally causes a person under years of age to touch or contact the mouth,anus or sex organs of an animal for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of a person.
we analyze diego argument by using the process articulated in descamps and clarified in.we begin the descamps analysis by asking whether section criminalizes the same or less conduct as the elements of the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor,at.
we have provided two definitions of sexual abuse of a minor.first,for purposes of a a,congress has enumerated the elements of the offense of sexual abuse of a minor at.holder,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.under,a person commits sexual abuse of a minor if a person knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who is at least years old,but less than,and at least four years younger than the defendant.id.second,a crime may qualify as the federal generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor if the conduct prohibited by the criminal statute is sexual,the statute protects a minor,and the statute requires abuse.id.at.for purposes of this second definition,we have defined abuse as physical or psychological harm in light of the age of the victim in question.united states,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
on its face,section criminalizes more conduct than the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor because a person may violate the statute by subjecting adults to abusive sexual contact.for example,the statute criminalizes sexual contact with any person whether a minor or an adult who is incapable of consent by virtue of being mentally incapacitated.or.stat.a c.because the statute as a whole does not categorically match the generic federal offense,we must proceed to the second step of the descamps analysis.
we have already determined that section is a divisible statute,in that paragraphs a and b define two different crimes united states,cir,petition for cert.filed.we have not,however,considered whether paragraph a subparagraphs are similarly divisible,and so we turn to the process set forth in.at phase one,we consider paragraph a text,and note that it uses disjunctive phrasing.the statutory text joins the element of subjecting another person to sexual contact to one of three alternative enumerated circumstances.this phrasing suggests that the legislature created three different offenses subjecting a victim who is less than years old to sexual contact,or subjecting another person to sexual contact through the use of forcible compulsion,or subjecting another person who is incapable of consent for specified reasons to sexual contact.or.stat.a.
we confirm this statutory interpretation by examining the shepard documents to see whether the statute displays alternative elements instead of alternative means of committing the same crime,at.because count of diego state court indictment,which charged him with unlawfully and intentionally attempt ing to subject,a person less than years of age,to sexual contact,in violation of section,tracks subparagraph a a,but lacks any text referencing su
