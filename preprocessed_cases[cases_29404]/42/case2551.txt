fred ssali is a native and citizen of uganda.he entered the united states in may as a visitor and remained beyond the time authorized by his visa.after the immigration and naturalization service ins brought removal proceedings against him,ssali applied for asylum.an immigration judge the ij denied his application,and the board of immigration appeals the bia or the board affirmed.ssali sought review in this court and filed a motion to reopen with the bia.the bia denied this motion to reopen,and he separately petitioned for review of that denial.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we grant his first petition for review,reverse the judgment of the bia and remand for further proceedings.
backgrounda.ssali asylum application 
ssali prepared his own asylum application without the assistance of counsel.in the application,he stated that he had been tortured and detained without trial by ugandan soldiers and that he feared torture and persecution if returned to uganda.on the application,ssali checked boxes that identified his membership in a particular social group and his political opinion as the reason for the alleged mistreatment.he further explained that he strongly oppose d and criticize d the one party system dictatorship in uganda,and the banning of democracy.thus,he stated,he feared being subjected to torture and suffering because of baseless false accusations that i am a collaborator with ant i government personnel.id.he also claimed to be opposed to human rights violation in uganda.id.ssali identified himself as a member of the group human rights africa,which he described as a human rights group,and that his brother ben jjuko was a member of uganda freedom movement,a guerilla military group.he also claimed that his brother was tortured and detained without trial.
hearing before the ij 
ssali appeared at a hearing before the ij on may.he testified that he had left uganda out of fear for his life he stated that government soldiers wanted to kill him b ecause he was politically inclined and did not believe in the dictatorship at the time.two major events formed the basis for this fear.first,ssali described an incident that had taken place in may.government security officers entered ssali university dormitory room,blindfolded him and drove him to a small army camp.there,he was beaten,kicked and forced to kneel for extended periods of time.he also was questioned about recent bombings and about the group allied democratic front adf a group to which,he testified,he had never belonged.his captors told ssali that they believed he had information about the bombings because two university students with whom ssali was friendly were suspected of being adf activists.ssali was returned to his dormitory room late at night on the same day.ssali testified that he reported the incident to university police,who did not take any action,and that a hospital treated him for injuries.he testified that he still has scars on his knees from the incident.
second,ssali testified about events that occurred in december.a bus on which he was traveling was stopped at an army roadblock,and ssali was detained.he testified that,although he told the soldiers that he was traveling to western uganda to conduct research for an academic paper,the soldiers thought that he was traveling to help the adf.he testified that the soldiers asked him his tribal origin.ssali replied that he was muganda,a member of a tribe to which the parties refer as baganda or buganda,which is located in southern uganda.upon hearing that ssali was muganda,the soldiers became angry.ssali testified that the soldiers told him that these buganda are the people who are making our,our political thing fail.ssali testified that most baganda are members of the democratic party.
ssali then was blindfolded and driven two hours to a camp where he was beaten in order to elicit information about the adf.the same night,he was driven away from the camp and,when the vehicle in which he was being carried stopped with a flat tire,ssali escaped from the truck and to his father town,where he was treated for his wounds.
ssali stated that he was a member of the democratic party in uganda and that his father,who also was a member of the democratic party,had been active in politics in the.he testified that,after his departure in,someone had approached his father to ask his ssali.ssali also testified about the process of obtaining his visa and passport.
at the outset of ssali testimony,he stated that he did not have any siblings.however,on,he stated that he had two sisters and one brother and that his brother name was andrew edward kafeero.he also stated that he had an uncle who was killed in and that his uncle name was ben jjuko.
c.the ij decision 
the ij oral decision denied ssali motion for asylum the ij determined that the two incidents of beatings that ssali had described constituted mistreatment which rose to the level of persecution.the ij also found support in the record for the notion that uganda government continues to commit human rights abuses.nonetheless,the ij concluded that,based on several considerations,ssali claim for asylum was not persuasive.
the ij found that significant omissions or discrepancies had surfaced with respect to ssali application for asylum and his testimony at the hearing,and further noted that these irregularities had not been resolved at the hearing.for instance,ssali had noted on his asylum application that he was a member of human rights africa,but he had not mentioned that fact at the hearing.
the ij was puzzled by the fact that several significant aspects of ssali claim had not been brought out in his asylum application or in his direct testimony at the hearing,but rather had surfaced during the government of ssali.for instance,although ssali had noted on his asylum application that he had a brother named ben jjuko who had been detained and tortured by ugandan soldiers,he did not mention these facts during his direct testimony.instead,he had testified during that he had an uncle named ben jjuko who had been killed in.as well,ssali had not included his membership in the democratic party in his asylum application or his direct testimony but had only mentioned it on.
the ij also noted that the fact that ssali had been able to obtain a ugandan passport and an exit visa was inconsistent with ssali theory that government officials wished him harm.it surmised that perhaps ssali had encountered only regional prejudice,rather than hostility that could be attributed to the national government.finally,the ij found it significant that ssali had not documented any specific aspects of his claim by presenting corroborating evidence.
appeal to the bia 
the bia dismissed ssali appeal.in its written decision,the bia deferred to the ij adverse credibility finding in light of evidence that ssali significantly embellished his asylum claim by the time of the hearing to the point that we are unable to ascertain what is truthful.
the board agreed with the ij as to the existence of material discrepancies in ssali account which went to the heart of the asylum claim.for instance,the bia reasoned that ssali conflicting testimony regarding whether ben jjuko was his uncle or his brother cast doubt upon ssali credibility.according to the bia,ssali failure to mention his brother detention and torture during his hearing testimony further weakened his credibility because ssali asylum application had center ed on the torture and detention he and his brother underwent.id.the board found it hard to believe that ssali had failed to mention the crucial fact of his democratic party membership in his asylum application,in light of the fact that,at the hearing,he attributed his second detention to his democratic ties.it considered suspect the fact that ssali had not described the details of his two detentions in his asylum application.
the board did,however,regard ssali failure to testify regarding his membership in human rights africa as a minor omission tangential to his asylum claim.the board also stated that the ij should not have regarded ssali credibility as undermined by his ability to obtain a passport.
with respect to ssali asylum claim itself,the bia noted that his accounts of the two incidents in which he was detained by government soldiers were not implausible in light of background information on ugandan politics and the ugandan military.the board also stated,t he democratic party has been historically made up of southerners and catholics.while the respondent is from eastern uganda,he is a christian.id.
although ssali allegations generally were consistent with conditions in uganda,the bia was not persuaded by his account due to the fact that his asylum claim as presented to the ij differ ed significantly from the one that he put forth in the asylum application.the bia rejected ssali contention that the discrepancies could be attributed to his poor command of english it stated that,as a person from a former british colony educated in english,ssali was obviously fluent in english.id.indeed,the ij found it inconceivable that someone as fluent and as ssali would have failed to mention in an asylum application his democratic party membership or the details of his detentions.id.
because it believed his testimony was not credible,the bia concluded that ssali did not meet the burden of proof for an asylum claim.in its view,the ij had been reasonable in requiring corroborating evidence.because ssali had not corroborated particular facts showing persecution,the bia concluded that ssali had failed to meet his burden of proof in establishing either past persecution or a fear of future persecution.id.
e.ssali motion to reopen 
following the bia dismissal of his appeal,ssali married a united states citizen.ssali wife filed a form,seeking to classify ssali as a family member.subsequently,ssali filed a motion to reopen the proceedings against him.the government opposed the motion to reopen,and the bia denied it.
discussion 
in cases in which the bia writes an opinion that does not adopt or supplement the opinion of the ij,liu ashcroft,cir,the bia opinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining,niam ashcroft,cir.on the other hand,in cases in which the bia writes an opinion supplement ing the decision of the ij,the ij opinion as supplemented by the bia opinion becomes the basis for review.liu,at.the government contends that we should conduct the latter sort of review,and we agree.the bia analysis supplemented the ij credibility determinations it also made its own independent assessment of the evidence regarding the current conditions in uganda with respect to political and human rights.thus,we review the ij opinion as supplemented by the bia analysis.
we review the bia denial of a petition for asylum under the substantial evidence standard.see capric ashcroft,cir.the bia decision must be affirmed if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.internal quotation omitted.we shall grant the petition for review only if the petitioner shows that the evidence not only supports reversal of the bia decision,but compels it.liu,at quoting ins,d emphasis and alteration in original.
the credibility determinations made by the ij and the bia are entitled to highly deferential review,so long as they are supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.capric,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
to qualify for asylum,an applicant must show that he is a refugee,b that is,that he is a person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a.hence,to qualify for asylum,an applicant must establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution.capric,at.a showing of past persecution gives rise to a presumption of a fear of future persecution.see b.
the ij evaluates an alien claim for credibility,assessing internal consistency,plausibility and detail.capric,at.if determined to be credible,the testimony of the alien alone may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.id.internal quotations omitted.however,if an ij finds the alien testimony to be incredible,the alien must submit corroborating evidence otherwise,the asylum claim will fail.id.at.
ssali submits that the bia should not have made an adverse credibility finding in his case.upon review of the administrative record in this case,we must agree.the ij advanced several reasons for finding that ssali testimony was not credible,and the bia adopted most of these reasons.the reasons cited by the ij and expressly adopted by the bia are the following ssali did not mention his democratic party membership in his asylum application,but he testified to it at the hearing ssali stated in his asylum application that his brother was named ben jjuko,but he testified at the hearing that he had just one brother named andrew and that his uncle was named ben jjuko ssali stated at the hearing that an unknown man came looking for him at his father home after ssali left uganda,but ssali did not mention this fact in his asylum application ssali mentioned in his asylum application that some of his family members had been detained or tortured by ugandan soldiers,but he did not testify to these incidents at his hearing in light of the adverse credibility finding,the ij and the bia both also held ssali lack of corroboration of his claims against him.
the heart of ssali asylum case is his membership in the democratic party.the ij and the bia,however,did not believe ssali claims of democratic party membership because ssali did not mention the democratic party in his asylum application.furthermore,the bia recognized that the democratic party has been historically made up of southerners and catholics,but also stated in its opinion that ssali is from eastern uganda,id.we perceive from the context of the bia comments that it was considering ssali supposed residence in eastern uganda as a reason to be skeptical of his claim of membership in the democratic party.in truth,ssali is not from eastern uganda but from southern uganda,precisely the place the bia recognized as the base of the democratic party in fact,ssali expressly testified before the ij that he is from masaka,which is in southern uganda.
this very significant mistake suggests that the board was not aware of the most basic facts of ssali case and deprives its ruling of a rational basis.it is the sort of mistake that constitutes the kind of extraordinary circumstances under which a credibility determination should be overturned.see ahmad ins,cir.
by contrast,we think any discrepancy between ssali application and his testimony at the hearing was not as significant as either the ij or the bia perceived it to be.although ssali did not mention specifically his membership in the democratic party on his asylum application,he did explain that he was strongly oppose d and criticize d the one party system dictatorship in uganda,and the banning of democracy,and that he feared being suspected as a collaborator with ant i government personnel.indeed,the bia recognized that the democratic party was the strongest opposition party in uganda during the time period relevant to ssali claims of persecution.most importantly,ssali asylum application and his hearing testimony made the same point he alleged that he had been detained and tortured based on his political beliefs.
we turn next to an alleged incident in which an unknown man approached ssali father after ssali departure from uganda,an incident to which ssali did not refer in his asylum application.as the bia characterized it,such an incident shows a continuing interest in ssali by the government which could establish a fear of persecution whether or not he establishes past persecution.however,the bia thought that the failure to mention this incident in his asylum application adversely impacted on ssali credibility it reasoned that it would be inconceivable that someone so would omit entirely from his asylum application any details regarding the visit to his father of
