petitioner sahar ouda seeks judicial review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge denial of her application for asylum.for the reasons set forth below,the judgment of the bia is reversed and the case is remanded to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
sahar ouda is a stateless palestinian born in kuwait on february,in july of,ouda,her parents and her two younger brothers departed kuwait for bulgaria on visitors visas.they remained in bulgaria,where they overstayed their visas by two years.on december,ouda entered the united states by way of a nonimmigrant visitor visa with an expiration date of june.one month prior to the expiration of her visa,ouda filed an application for asylum.on july,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause and a notice of hearing,charging ouda as deportable for overstaying her visa.on the application form,ouda claimed mistreatment by the kuwaiti government as the basis of her request for asylum.she asserted that her life and liberty will be in danger if she goes back to kuwait or to egypt because i can not go anywhere.
at the initial deportation hearing,ouda,through counsel,conceded deportability on the basis that she overstayed her visa.however,she renewed her request for asylum and,in the alternative,for voluntary departure.when asked,she declined to identify a country to which her deportation should be directed,at which point the ins suggested egypt on the basis that she entered the united states with an egyptian travel document.
in november of,the immigration judge ij conducted a hearing on ouda application for asylum.there was some confusion regarding the country from which ouda was claiming asylum.ouda asserted that she was a refugee from kuwait,the country in which she was born and raised and from which she and her family were expelled.the ins took the position that ouda asylum claim arose from bulgaria,the country where she last resided before entering the united states.ouda argued that bulgaria should not be the focus of her asylum claim because she was never a citizen of bulgaria and bulgaria would not take her back in any event.in support of this last assertion,she provided a letter from the embassy of the republic of bulgaria,dated january,wherein the embassy refused her family request for a visa.the ij reserved ruling on this legal issue until after the hearing.
ouda then testified to the following during the gulf war,her father,who had taught in kuwait department of education for twenty years,was forced to continue teaching by the iraqi occupiers.when kuwait was liberated,the kuwaitis refused to let him return to his teaching position because he was perceived as a palestinian who supported iraq.notices were posted on all businesses stating that only kuwaiti citizens were permitted to return to work.because ouda father was unable to earn a living,he requested his pension fund from the department of education and was told that he could collect it only if he left the country.not only were the oudas unable to earn a living,they were also unable to attend school,obtain a driver license or drive a car.ouda explained that access to water was not open as it is in the united states,and if the oudas lined up to get water and people found out they were palestinians,the kuwaitis would dump their water.because they could not work,they were forced to sell furniture to buy was problematic in any event because there were signs up saying that only kuwaitis were allowed to buy food.at the time,many armed kuwaitis roamed the streets,announcing that if they found any palestinians on the road,they would kill them.numerous children who left their homes never returned.because of this,only ouda father was permitted to leave the house.on more than one occasion when he left the home to obtain food,he was threatened at gunpoint.on july,kuwaiti officials stamped a date july,on the oudas travel documents by which time they would have to leave the country the officials threatened that if the oudas were not gone by that date,they would be placed on the country border.just before the deadline,ouda old brother attempted to leave the house to get a haircut.he was abducted by kuwaitis,demeaned and beaten on his knees and feet because he was a palestinian.shortly thereafter,the oudas bribed a bulgarian to get them visitors visas to bulgaria and left the country prior to the deadline.an older brother and sister of ouda stayed behind to sell the family furniture because the family needed the money.one month later,when they applied for visas to bulgaria,their applications were denied.as of the time of the hearing,ouda siblings,who do not have telephones,were still believed to be in kuwait.ouda has spoken to her sister once since entering the united states.
in bulgaria,ouda family tried to extend their visas to no avail,and they were unable to apply for citizenship.apparently,however,the oudas learned that they could gain temporary resident status if they owned an ongoing business.accordingly,ouda father opened a store with what remained of his retirement funds.as long as the business was in operation,they were permitted to stay in bulgaria and run it.unfortunately,the oudas ran into another obstacle.the bulgarian mafia told them they did want anyone there but bulgarians and threatened to harm them if they did leave the country.the mafia attempted to extort protection funds from her father in lieu of torture and destruction of his business,but her father refused.the oudas again found their safety compromised on the streets of bulgaria consequently,they traveled only by taxi.on the rare occasions when ouda walked along the streets of bulgaria in muslim dress,people would taunt her and try to take off her scarf.because ouda father would not give protection funds to the mafia,the mafia beat up both of his sons,one of whom still retains scars from the experience.when the oudas reported their problems with the mafia to the authorities,they were told they had no status in bulgaria and should leave.the oudas problems continued until one day,the mafia burned their store down.immediately thereafter,the oudas obtained visitors visas to the united states and,after selling their personal belongings to purchase tickets to america,left bulgaria.
ouda testified that she has attempted to get visas to go to other countries but,based on her status as a stateless palestinian,has been denied entrance to egypt,bulgaria,kuwait,jordan and israel.she stated that she feared for her life if deported to kuwait.
the ij subsequently issued a written opinion wherein he denied ouda application for asylum and withholding of deportation and ordered her deported to bulgaria or any other country willing to accept her.in so ruling,the ij determined that bulgaria was ouda country of last habitual residence therefore,the focus of her asylum claim must be on bulgaria.with regard to ouda credibility,he stated 
in this particular case i have no reason to doubt the veracity of ouda.she appears to be,in the estimate of the court,to be credible and what she has testified to appears to be accurate,lacking of any outward indicia of fabrication,is consistent with her prior documents,and i do believe that her version as she indicates is,in fact,accurate.
nonetheless,he concluded that ouda had not demonstrated either past persecution or a fear of future persecution in bulgaria.he noted that ouda herself had never been harmed in bulgaria and that the bulgarian mafia extortion attempts were directed at her father because he was a store owner,a characteristic that is not protected by the asylum laws.
ouda appealed the denial of her asylum application to the bia,arguing that the ij had erred in finding that bulgaria was her country of last habitual residence,and contending that she had established eligibility for asylum in relation to kuwait.the bia ruled,in relevant part 
an alien may apply for asylum in the united states or withholding of deportation from any countries to which he or she may be deported.c.a stateless alien,who has no nationality,may seek asylum in relation to the country where she last habitually resided if he or she may be deported there.section a a of the act.
for purposes of deciding this appeal,we will assume that the respondent is correct that she may consider kuwait as the country where she last habitually resided.thus,if kuwait is a country to which the respondent may be deported,she may base an asylum claim on past persecution or a fear of future persecution in kuwait.however,the respondent herself stated that,at least as of the time of her hearing,kuwait will not accept her tr.at.the state department advisory opinion agrees that her chance of receiving the requisite kuwaiti approval to was quite slim exh,tab.accordingly,to the extent that the immigration judge may have erred in ruling that the respondent could only seek asylum with respect to bulgaria,such error is seemingly harmless,as it is unlikely that kuwait is a country to which the respondent may be deported.
moreover,assuming arguendo that the respondent and the state department are wrong,and the service is able to procure travel documents for the respondent from kuwait,we find that she has not established an asylum claim in relation to that country.we note that the respondent did focus her asylum claim on kuwait in her written application and her testimony.she does not contend on appeal that there is more evidence that she wished to present concerning persecution in kuwait.the only harm alleged in her written application related to the authorities picking up of her brother in following kuwait liberation at the conclusion of the gulf war.the respondent testified orally that she is not a member of any groups,political or otherwise tr.at.she further stated that she herself has never been arrested,detained,interrogated,imprisoned or beaten anywhere by any authorities tr.at.the only negative thing that happened to her in kuwait is that she was unable to continue her higher education.however,discrimination does not ordinarily amount to persecution within the meaning of the act.reno,cir korablina ins,cir ghaly ins,cir.thus,having reviewed the entire record de novo,we find that she has not established past persecution in kuwait.
because she has not established past persecution in kuwait,she enjoys no presumption to a fear of future persecution on account of her status as a palestinian in that country.b.rather,she has the burden of showing a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution if returned to kuwait.b i b.to make such a showing,the alien must establish that a reasonable person in his or her circumstances would fear persecution.matter of kasinga,i n,wl bia matter of mogharrabi,i n bia.see also ins,d.the lack of any evidence in this regard is not surprising in light of her position that kuwait will not allow her return.
the state department advisory opinion notes that,for the most part palestinians in kuwait who are there legally are settling into a relatively stable existence free from egregious human rights abuses exh.at tab.to the extent that the state department opinion may paint an overly optimistic picture,it is essentially all we have in this record regarding the current fate of palestinians in kuwait.the respondent has provided no objective evidence to meet her burden in this regard.we additionally note that of her siblings have remained in kuwait without any asserted harm.matter of,i n bia the reasonableness of an alien fear of persecution is reduced when his family remains in his native country unharmed for a long period of time after his departure.thus,in the unlikely event that the respondent could be deported to kuwait,we also find that she has not demonstrated a fear of persecution in that country.accordingly,as the respondent did not meet her burden of establishing an asylum claim in relation to kuwait,her appeal is dismissed.
it is from the bia decision that ouda appeals.
ii.standard of review 
the bia decision must be upheld if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.mikhailevitch ins,cir quoting ins,d.under this deferential standard,the court may not reverse the board determination simply because we would have decided the matter differently.id.citing klawitter ins,cir.the court may reverse,however,if the evidence presented by ouda not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it.id.emphasis in original.as such,the petitioner must show that the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite persecution or fear of persecution,at.
the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to a person who qualifies as a refugee within the meaning of section a a of the immigration and nationality act.the act defines a refugee as 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality or,in the case of a person having no nationality,is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided,and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,
a a.resolution of a request for asylum thus involves a inquiry whether the applicant qualifies as a refugee as defined in a a,and whether the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the attorney general.mikhailevitch,at quoting perkovic ins,cir.
the asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she qualifies as a refugee either because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has a fear of future persecution.b.the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a.acknowledging that the relevant statutes and regulations offer no working definition of persecution,we have previously held that the term encompasses more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,unaccompanied by any physical punishment,infliction of harm,or significant deprivation of liberty.mikhailevitch,at.the asylum applicant who satisfies the burden of establishing past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.id.at citing b i.the ins may rebut that presumption by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that since the persecution occurred,conditions in the applicant country have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a fear of being persecuted upon return.mikhailevitch,at.the ins must do more than show that circumstances in the country have fundamentally changed the ins must also show that such change negates the particular applicant fear of persecution.id.see also krastev ins,cir bia must conduct individualized fear analysis chand ins,cir whether or not a particular applicant fear is rebutted by a general change in country conditions requires an individualized analysis that focuses on the specific harm suffered and the relationship to it of information contained in a country report fergiste ins,cir general evidence of changed country conditions is insufficient to show that an applicant no longer has a fear of persecution charles gordon et,immigration law procedure d ed.
iii.analysis 
the bia found,as a preliminary matter,that ouda could not seek asylum from kuwait because she testified that kuwait would not accept her.the ins brief on appeal appears to support this ruling 
the petitioner argues that she should be granted asylum from kuwait,but the parties agree that the petitioner does not currently have travel documents or permission from the kuwait government to enter that country.the petitioner herself argued below that kuwait will not allow her to return.
however,the ins cites no authority for this purported linkage and the bia cites only c and a a.after consulting various immigration treatises and manuals,reviewing the asylum statutes and regulations,and researching the case law in all circuits,we can find no support for the proposition that an asylum applicant is precluded from seeking asylum in the united states should it prove to be the case that the countr
