mikhail gaiskov,a citizen of russia and permanent resident of the united states,seeks review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals the board or bia that determined that when gaiskov violated b,he engaged in sexual abuse of a minor and therefore committed an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act,a a the ina.that finding makes gaiskov removable from the united states.see a a iii.as explained below,the board did not err in its conclusion that gaiskov committed an aggravated felony.accordingly,we deny gaiskov petition for review.
background 
petitioner mikhail gaiskov is a citizen of russia and lawful permanent resident of the united states.on august,gaiskov pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct with a minor in violation of b the indiana statute provided 
a person at least eighteen years of age who with a child at least fourteen years of age but less than sixteen years of age,performs or submits to any fondling or touching,of either the child or the older person,with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of either the child or the older person,commits sexual misconduct with a minor,a class d felony.
b.based on this conviction,the government issued a notice to appear alleging that gaiskov was deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,namely sexual abuse of a minor.see a a defining the term aggravated felony as murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.in the course of the removal proceedings,gaiskov admitted the fact of the conviction but contended that a conviction under the indiana statute did not constitute sexual abuse of a minor as a matter of law.specifically,gaiskov argued that b covered sexual misconduct that is broader than how the board of immigration appeals and this court have interpreted the term sexual abuse of a minor.
on march,the immigration judge ij issued a written decision concluding that gaiskov had been convicted of an offense involving sexual abuse of a minor.at the outset,the ij determined that the board interpreted sexual abuse of a minor broadly,citing matter of.looking at the crime of conviction,the judge concluded that gaiskov conviction met the board definition of sexual abuse of a minor because its terms required that the touching be accompanied by the specific intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desires.the immigration judge reasoned that this requirement precluded a person being convicted for simple touching.as the immigration judge stated in his opinion,the sexually exploitive nature of the touching makes the contact with the minor a criminal offense that fit the definition of sexual abuse of a minor.
gaiskov appealed to the board.on june,the board issued a decision adopting and affirming the immigration judge decision.in its brief supplementary analysis,the board stated its belief that the law of the seventh circuit further foreclosed gaiskov contention that his crime of conviction did not constitute sexual abuse of a minor.the instant petition followed.
ii.discussion 
congress has stripped this court of jurisdiction to review an order removing an alien who commits an aggravated felony,see a c,a a iii.nevertheless,we retain jurisdiction to consider the limited question of whether we have is,whether gaiskov has been convicted of an aggravated felony under a a.ashcroft,cir citations omitted.
because the board decision adopted and affirmed the ij conclusion as well as providing its own analysis,we review both decisions.see giday gonzales,cir.we review the determination that gaiskov is removable because he is an aggravated felon de novo.ins,cir.however,in reviewing the board interpretation of the ina,we defer to the bia interpretation of the statute it administers.see also draganova ins,cir citing chevron,natural resources defense council,d.we must defer to the bia construction so long as it is consistent with the language and purposes of the statute.gattem gonzales,cir quoting ins,d.
the ina defines the term aggravated felony as murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a.however,congress has not further defined what crimes constitute sexual abuse of a minor.the attorney general,who is charged with the administration and enforcement of the ina,has delegated that task to the board.see gattem,at.in matter of,the board defined the term in a broad manner consistent with the definition contained in a,a statute concerning the rights of child victims and child witnesses in the context of federal proceedings.at.that statute defines sexual abuse as 
t he employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in,or assist another person to engage in,sexually explicit conduct or the rape,molestation,prostitution,or other form of sexual exploitation of children,or incest with children.
the board believed that this broad definition was best able to reflect the full range of criminal conduct that can be understood to constitute sexual abuse of a minor.see,at.but the board also emphasized that it was using only as a guide and did not intend for it to be a definitive standard that fixed the outer boundaries of the term meaning.see,at.this court has concluded that the bia use of the broad definition found in as an interpretive touchstone is reasonable.see ins,cir gattem,at approving of the board use of as an interpretive guide.
in this case,the immigration judge and board determined that gaiskov offense was within the range of conduct that defines as sexual abuse and that gaiskov was thus removable as an aggravated felon.to review that determination,we employ a categorical approach.see gattem,at.that is,we compare the crime of conviction with the more generic term used in a and then determine whether the conduct required for a conviction would categorically constitute sexual abuse of a minor.see taylor united states,d.
to obtain a conviction under b,the government must prove that the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time of the offense,that the defendant fondled or touched or submitted to fondling or touching by a fourteen or minor,and that the defendant did so with the intent to arouse or satisfy his sexual desire or the sexual desire of the child.in analyzing the board finding that this offense constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,we note that this court has taken a broad view of that classification in the immigration context.in gattem gonzales,we held that the board correctly determined that the petitioner conviction for sexual solicitation qualified as a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.at.the statute in gattem,ilcs a,did not require that the defendant physically touch the victim,let alone that the defendant touch the victim in a sexual manner.nonetheless,we found that an adult solicitation of a minor was abusive because it exploited the minor vulnerability to corrupt influences and took advantage of the minor less sense of judgment.gattem,at there exists an inherent risk of exploitation,if not coercion,when an adult solicits a minor to engage in sexual activity see also gonzales,cir citing gattem and holding that indecent solicitation of a child qualifies as an aggravated felony.
like the crime in gattem,the crime here exploits a minor vulnerability and less sense of judgment.gattem,at.an adult who touches a child with a sexual intent is,like the solicitor in gattem,exploiting a person who may well be incapable of fully appreciating the consequences of yielding to the defendant advances.id.but the statute here contemplates even more serious sexual abuse because it requires that the adult touch the child with the intent to arouse or satisfy sexual desire.we first note that the youth of the victims of this crime could prevent the victims from giving effective consent to sexual touching,and sexual touching without consent is abusive.moreover,the touching of a child with a sexual intent as opposed to the use of words,as in gattem implicates risks which attend sexual conduct generally,pregnancy,sexual assault,and the contraction of sexually transmitted diseases,risks which a fourteen or minor is likely to appreciate or minimize.an adult exploitation of a minor naivete or lack of judgment can reasonably be understood as abusive.
