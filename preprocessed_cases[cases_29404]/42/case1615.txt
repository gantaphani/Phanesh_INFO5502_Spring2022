relies heavily on our decision in moreland to support his argument that the district court procedurally erred by imposing a variant sentence instead of first applying applicable departure provisions from the guidelines.in moreland we stated that,
in imposing a sentence after booker,the district court must engage in a process.first,the court must correctly determine,after making appropriate findings of fact,the applicable guideline range.next,the court must determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors set forth in a and,if not,select a sentence within statutory limits that does serve those factors.in doing so,the district court should first look to whether a departure is appropriate based on the guidelines manual or relevant case law if an appropriate basis for departure exists,the district court may depart.if the resulting departure range still does not serve the factors set forth in a,the court may then elect to impose a sentence a variance sentence.
