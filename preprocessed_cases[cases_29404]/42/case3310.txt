alejandro israel villa anguiano villa petitions for review of the government reinstatement of a removal order issued in.villa contends that the immigration and customs enforcement ice agency of the department of homeland security dhs may not deport him on the basis of his prior removal order,because a federal district court found that due process violations in his immigration hearing rendered the removal order invalid as a predicate for criminal prosecution under.
we have jurisdiction under a to review a reinstatement order,see castro cortez ins,cir,abrogated on other grounds by fernandez vargas gonzales,d accord padilla ashcroft,cir,and retain jurisdiction under a d to consider constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review,see garcia de rincon dhs,cir.for the reasons stated below,we grant villa petition,vacate the reinstatement order,and remand to ice for further proceedings.
this case comes before us in an unusual posture.villa,who entered the united states from mexico at the age of one,became a lawful permanent resident in.following a conviction for voluntary manslaughter in and service of his stipulated sentence,villa was ordered deported in at a group hearing before an immigration judge in el centro,california.he was physically removed in but subsequently reentered the united states without permission in.on may,villa was arrested by local law enforcement following a traffic stop.the next day,the government determined that villa was subject to removal by reinstatement of the prior order,pursuant to a and.
villa concedes that he was provided notice and an opportunity to contest reinstatement on may,as required by b.his signature appears on the notice of to reinstate prior order form,beside the statement,i do not wish to make a statement contesting this determination.the government did not,however,proceed at that point with the actual removal.instead,the government decided to prosecute villa for illegal reentry.
before the district court on the illegal reentry charge,and now with the assistance of counsel,villa collaterally attacked his removal order.see d united states mendoza lopez,d permitting an alien to seek review of the deportation order used as a predicate element of an illegal reentry offense if he was denied judicial review of prior removal proceedings.he contended that due process violations in the underlying removal proceedings precluded him from obtaining judicial review of his deportation order.the government conceded that villa was eligible in for relief under immigration and nationality act ina c and that the immigration judge did not inform him of that fact.but,the government argued c relief was not plausible at the time of the immigration hearing,which predated ins cyr,d,and thus villa could not show prejudice.
the district court rejected the government arguments,finding that villa had demonstrated a deprivation of his right to counsel in the group immigration hearing and that villa was prejudiced by the resulting due process violation,because he was eligible for relief under c at the time of his removal proceedings,and was not so informed.consequently,the district court held,the outcome of his immigration proceeding was potentially affected by the denial of his right to counsel.the court held the removal order invalid as the predicate for criminal prosecution under and so,on october,dismissed villa indictment.
on october,the day after villa criminal proceedings were dismissed,immigration officials reinstated on today date the prior order of removal by an immigration judge,and villa was physically removed.villa was neither notified at that point that the order was going to be issued and executed nor given an opportunity to object,either in writing or orally,to the reinstatement.he was denied such opportunity despite the very relevant development that occurred in the five months since reinstatement proceedings were initiated namely,the district court determination that the removal order was constitutionally infirm.
ice was aware of the criminal prosecution from the outset.the record of alien,form i,dated may,indicated that villa was being held in dhs custody pending criminal prosecution for violation of.but the addendum to the form,dated october,reflects confusion regarding the result of that criminal case.the addendum correctly noted,on october,subject case was dismissed for violation of usc a deported alien found in the united states.it went on,however,to state erroneously that villa served days confinement in federal custody for violation of usc a deported alien found in the united states,implying that villa had been convicted of illegal reentry emphases added.the addendum nowhere indicated the grounds on which the indictment was dismissed or evidenced any awareness by ice officials that the district court had held the original removal order invalid.it concluded with the statement subject prior order of removal by an immigration judge will be reinstated on today date.villa was immediately removed.
this petition for review followed.
the ina reinstatement provision,a,specifically bars relitigation of the merits of the reinstated removal order determination of an alien removability or eligibility for relief accordingly,except where constitutional claims or questions of law arise in the context of reinstatement and the petitioner can demonstrate a gross miscarriage of justice in the original removal proceedings,garcia de rincon,at our review of a reinstatement order is limited to assessing ice determination of the factual predicates for reinstatement that petitioner is an alien,who was subject to a prior removal order,and who illegally reentered the united states.morales izquierdo gonzales,cir en banc.
under a,the regulation implementing a,the determination whether an alien meets the factual predicates for reinstatement is made by an immigration agent,not a judge an alien has no right to be heard by a judge prior to reinstatement of a removal order.see morales izquierdo,at,upholding the validity of under the ina and the constitution.an alien is,however,entitled to notice and an opportunity to make a written or oral statement contesting the determination.b.although we have held that this streamlined reinstatement procedure does not offend due process,we expressly left open the possibility that individual petitioners may raise procedural defects in their particular cases.morales izquierdo,at.
even though an alien is not entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge on the issue of reinstatement of a prior removal order,nothing in a or its implementing regulations deprives the agency of discretion to afford an alien a new plenary removal hearing.reinstatement of a prior order of removal is not automatic.alcala holder,cir.nor is it obligatory under a,if the attorney general finds an alien has reentered this country illegally after having been removed the prior order can be reinstated from its original date,provided the requirements of a and b have been satisfied.id.emphasis added accord galindo romero holder,cir.particularly when there is any question about whether the requirements of have been satisfied,and even when they have been,an ice officer may decide to forgo reinstatement of a prior order of removal in favor of initiating new removal proceedings,with the accompanying procedural rights to counsel and a hearing in immigration court.see b describing an alien rights in removal proceedings.
ice regularly exercises prosecutorial discretion in a broad range of discretionary enforcement decisions,including deciding to issue,reissue,serve,file,or cancel a notice to appear nta and seeking expedited removal or other forms of removal by means other than a formal removal proceeding in immigration court.memorandum from john morton,director,ice,on exercising prosecutorial discretion consistent with the civil immigration enforcement priorities of the agency for the apprehension,detention and removal of aliens,at june.immigration officers who have authority to institute immigration removal proceedings or to otherwise engage in civil immigration enforcement,id.at,are not only authorized by law but expected to exercise discretion in a judicious manner at all stages of the enforcement process,memorandum from doris meissner,commissioner,immigration and naturalization service,on exercising prosecutorial discretion,at.thus,ice agents,to whom a delegates the decision to reinstate a prior removal order,may exercise their discretion not to pursue streamlined reinstatement procedures.
villa does not contest the factual predicates for the reinstatement order.nor has he asserted a gross miscarriage of justice in the underlying immigration hearing,which could justify this court review of the constitutionality of the prior removal order instead,villa challenges the propriety of reinstating a removal order that has been invalidated on constitutional grounds for purposes of criminal prosecution 
this precise situation has not arisen in any reported cases of which we are aware.the government explained at oral argument a likely reason for that gap in many cases where the district court does dismiss the indictment ice officers go ahead and put the alien in regular removal proceedings.that is,rather than reinstating an order found to be an invalid predicate for a criminal reentry prosecution,the agency often exercises its discretion to initiate plenary removal proceedings with the requisite notice,hearing before an immigration judge,right to appeal to the board of immigration appeals,and right to seek judicial review in a court of appeals,following dismissal of a indictment because of a successful collateral attack on the underlying removal order.see.here,however,ice reinstated villa prior order and executed it as soon as his criminal case was dismissed,without providing villa an opportunity to explain the developments in district court or correct any misimpressions regarding those developments,and,it appears,without independently reconsidering its use of expedited proceedings in light of the constitutional infirmities in the underlying immigration hearing identified by the district court.
as explained,an incorrect statement on the addendum to the form i states that villa served time for a conviction.this statement indicates that the immigration agents responsible for executing villa reinstatement order were either unaware of,or misinformed about,the district court findings regarding the prior removal proceedings,and so almost surely did not take them into account in determining how to proceed.certainly,the form did not explain why villa criminal case was dismissed the government agreed,at argument,that the agency ordinarily would not have done what it did here.
to be sure,the pendency of reinstatement proceedings does not provide an alien with a new avenue to challenge the underlying removal order.as we made clear in morales izquierdo,allowing an alien to manufacture an opportunity to contest his earlier removal by reentering the country illegally,thereby triggering removal proceedings anew,would create perverse incentives.see at.but we have not considered a situation like the present one,in which the government itself invites judicial scrutiny of the underlying removal order by instigating a criminal prosecution under.we conclude that when,as a result of such scrutiny,a district court finds constitutional infirmities in the prior removal proceedings that invalidate the prior removal for purposes of criminal prosecution,the agency can not simply rely on a determination to reinstate the prior removal order.instead the agency must as it may well ordinarily do provide the alien with an opportunity after the criminal prosecution is dismissed to make a written or oral statement addressing the expedited reinstatement determination in light of the facts found and the legal conclusions reached in the course of the criminal case and independently reassess whether to rely on the order issued in the prior proceedings as the basis for deportation or instead to instigate full removal proceedings 
we so conclude for the following reasons the regulation implementing a requires the immigration officer effecting reinstatement to consider all relevant evidence,including statements made by the alien and any evidence in the alien possession.a.the alien must be allowed to make a statement contesting the reinstatement determination,and the officer shall consider whether the alien statement warrants reconsideration of the determination.b.
those regulatory requirements respect an unlawfully present alien right to be heard prior to removal,a right which the supreme court has long recognized as grounded in the due process clause due process,in turn,entitles an unlawfully present alien to consideration of issues relevant to the exercise of an immigration officer discretion.larita martinez ins,cir,for example,held that due process required the board of immigration appeals to consider all relevant evidence submitted on appeal when reviewing the wholly discretionary denial of an application for suspension of deportation 
for the requirements of a,b to function as the requisite procedural safeguards of the alien right to due process in the context of streamlined proceedings,see morales izquierdo,at,they must apply at the relevant time.the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d internal quotation marks omitted.for villa to have had a meaningful opportunity to address the proposed reinstatement of his removal order,then,he must have been afforded that opportunity at a time and in a manner that would allow him to present pertinent information.as the government indicated at oral argument,the district court invalidation of villa removal order as a basis for prosecution,due to constitutional infirmities in the original removal proceedings,is ordinarily pertinent to the agency decision as to whether and how to proceed with his removal.
moreover,the agency must consider all favorable and unfavorable factors relevant to the exercise of its discretion failure to do so constitutes an abuse of discretion.see an na peng holder,cir the bia abuses its discretion when it fails to consider all relevant factors bearing on the balance of equities or an application for relief xiao fei zheng holder,cir same united states in currency,cir a district court abuses its discretion if it fails to consider factors relevant to the exercise of its discretion.if the procedures used by ice do not assure that the obtain the requisite information before the decision is made,then it is unlikely that the decision made will be a proper one under the abuse of discretion standard.
the third circuit has considered a somewhat analogous circumstance,in which an alien contested reinstatement on the asserted grounds that his prior removal order was invalidated by a court and that he did not reenter the country illegally.see ponta garcia att y of the,cir.recognizing the petitioner atypical circumstances,the third circuit remanded the case to ice for consideration of the alien assertions.id.at citing a.the court observed that although reinstatement pursuant to the streamlined procedures adopted by congress will be uncontested in most cases,in the unusual instance in which a petitioner raises issues that could affect whether ice pursues removal without a prior hearing,more is required from the agency than it appears was done here.id.
the government acknowledges that,had it known of the district court findings,it quite possibly would have exercised its discretion not to pursue reinstatement of villa removal order.consequently,villa was prejudiced by the ice agents misinformation or lack of information regarding his criminal prosecution,as well as by the absence of an opportunity to contest the reinstatement determination at a meaningful time namely,before the reinstatement order finally issued and was executed,and after new,relevant circumstances had arisen.accordingly,we remand to ice to provide that opportunity and to reconsider its reinstatement determination in light of the district court findings regarding villa removal proceedings.we express no view as to the outcome of that determination on remand.
the petition is granted,the reinstatement order is vacated,and we remand to ice for reconsideration and further proceedings consistent with this disposition.
the alien,a convicted killer who illegally the united states after his prior deportation,has once again been removed after the district court dismissed his criminal charge because the removal order was technically flawed.congress has by statute strictly limited what process is due to a petitioner who after a prior deportation.our court sitting en banc has carefully limited the scope of our review of reinstated removal orders.see generally morales izquierdo gonzales,cir en banc.my colleagues in the majority nonetheless create a new procedural rule by judicial legislation,which the supreme court has held we may not do.
the majority holds that whenever the united states chooses to criminally prosecute an alien who unlawfully entered the country and fails in that prosecution,an immigration officer who has already complied with all of the statutory and regulatory requirements for reinstatement of a prior removal order must give the alien a new opportunity to implore the officer to decline reinstatement and instead open new removal proceedings.it might be a perfectly sensible rule if congress or the agency prescribed it.but neither congress nor the agency has done so.instead,the majority new rule has only one source the whole cloth from which the majority has woven it.
the supreme court has told us it is improper simply to impose deportation procedures because the reviewing court may find them preferable.landon plasencia,d.in an effort to impose its preferred procedures into ice process for reinstatement of removal orders,the majority has distorted constitutional due process requirements and undercut controlling en banc precedent.i respectfully dissent.
in,the government removed alejandro israel villa anguiano villa after he finished serving his sentence for voluntary manslaughter.villa does not dispute that he was the alien subject to that removal order.nor does he dispute that in,he knowingly the country without permission and remained until he was apprehended on may.and he can not dispute that the government provided him with notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the reinstatement of his prior removal order an opportunity he waived on may,when he signed underneath a checked box stating,i do not wish to make a statement contesting this determination.
the majority concedes that as of that date,the government needed no more to exercise its discretion to reinstate his prior order of removal and summarily deport him from the united states.however,the immigration officer could not remove villa immediately because the united states opted to prosecute villa for criminal under.the majority now holds that when the government chose to criminally prosecute villa and the district court later dismissed the charge after villa brought a collateral attack on the removal order,this created a new requirement that the immigration officer give villa yet another opportunity to be heard.the officer must extend this opportunity,says the majority,not so that villa may contest his eligibility for reinstatement,but rather so that he may argue the agency should exercise its prosecutorial discretion to instead open new removal proceedings.the majority must concede this requirement has no basis in either statutory or regulatory law.but it concludes ice nonetheless abused its discretion and remands so the agency must reconsider its prosecutorial decision,even though villa is long gone.
the reinstatement statute requires the department of homeland security to do nothing more to reinstate the removal order that villa knowingly flaunted.in a,congress explicitly insulate d the removal orders from review and generally foreclose d discretionary relief from the terms of the reinstated order.fernandez vargas gonzales,d.the statute provides in no uncertain terms 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter,and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
the department of homeland security has promulgated to implement the reinstatement statute.under the regulation,the immigration officer who issues the reinstatement order must analyze three criteria.
first,the officer must confirm that the alien has been subject to a prior order of removal.a.this requires the officer to obtain the prior order,which the officer in this case did.
second,the officer must confirm the identity of the alien that is,make sure that the person in question and the alien who was previously removed are in fact one and the same.id.a.villa does not dispute that the officer did this too.
third,the officer must confirm that the alien unlawfully reentered the united states.to do this,the officer must consider all relevant evidence and attempt to verify any claim that the alien was lawfully admitted,including a check of any databases available to the officer.id.a.villa,of course,made no such claim,and how could he subject to a removal order that required him to stay outside of the united states,villa nonetheless surreptitiously the country.he did so without the permission of the united states government.he therefore reentered the country unlawfully.
the district court proceedings could not render villa reentry lawful.the district court had jurisdiction only to determine whether villa was criminal,not whether it was lawful.the district court conclusion that villa did not commit a new crime in no way alters the inquiry for the immigration officer conducting a reinstatement,which is simply did this alien violate a removal order when he entered the united states the answer unquestionably is yes.villa unlawfully the united states.if the agency decides he must go,then he must go.
therefore,both the laws enacted by congress and the department of homeland security permissible construction of those laws allowed the immigration officer to reinstate villa prior order of removal,regardless of whether the district court concluded that villa also constituted a federal crime.on the limited review we may conduct of a reinstatement proceeding,this suffices to deny relief.morales izquierdo,at.
the majority implicitly agrees that under the law as it currently stands,villa is eligible for reinstatement.my colleagues must acknowledge that although a district court may determine that a removal order does not validly support a criminal prosecution,that same court has no jurisdiction to grant relief from an administrative order of removal.the majority also knows that under our en banc decision in morales izquierdo gonzales,we do not allow aliens who have defied removal orders and the united states to put themselves in a better position than aliens who respect our laws and wait patiently outside our borders seeking lawful admission.at.so without any statutory or regulatory foundation to grant relief,the majority falls back on a dubious procedural due process analysis.
if i understand the majority argument,it proceeds in three steps.first,the immigration officer has the discretion to choose to initiate new removal proceedings instead of reinstatement,even if the alien is,by statute,already susceptible to immediate reinstatement.second,if the district court dismisses the criminal charge for illegal because the alien demonstrated fundamentally unfair infirmities in the original deportation order,the immigration officer may be more likely to start new removal proceedings instead of choosing reinstatement.therefore,if the alien succeeds in his defense to the criminal charge,the due process clause now requires the immigration officer to give the defendant yet another opportunity to be heard not to argue that the alien is ineligible for reinstatement because a and both say villa clearly is eligible,but to instead argue that new removal proceedings would be th
