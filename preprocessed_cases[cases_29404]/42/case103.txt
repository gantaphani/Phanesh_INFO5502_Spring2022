as we must account for every idle word,so must we account for every idle silence.benjamin franklin words ring true for petitioner dione pereira lima,who struggles mightily to take back his words in the proceedings below,while simultaneously attempting to assert new claims of error.in this challenge to a final removal order requiring him to return to brazil,lima attempts to undo his attorneys concessions of removability.he further seeks to argue for the first time that the immigration judge violated his due process rights by denying his motion to continue the proceedings below and by failing to permit him to amend his written pleadings.we deny the petition for review.
background 
lima is a native and citizen of brazil who entered the united states on or about december.he adjusted status to that of lawful permanent resident on january.later that year,lima was arrested and charged with breaking and entering in the daytime in violation of.laws ch.brought before the malden district court on december,lima admitted facts sufficient for a finding of guilt.the court ordered the case to be continued without a finding for two years,and directed lima to pay restitution of approximately.
lima was arrested a second time in december,this time on suspicion of breaking into cars,and charged with another violation of.laws ch.on january,he appeared again in the malden district court and admitted to facts sufficient for a finding of guilt.this time,he received two years of probation 
lima convictions quickly resulted in consequences beyond probation.on february,the department of homeland security dhs served him with a notice to appear nta charging him as removable under the immigration and nationality act ina a a ii for being convicted,at any time after admission into the united states,of two crimes involving moral turpitude.a series of hearings and appeals regarding lima removability ensued.because of their relevance to our decision today,we provide the following summary of events.
after an initial hearing at which an immigration judge ij gave lima additional time to secure legal representation,counsel appeared on march.during the course of proceedings that day,counsel told the ij that lima has been convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude,which he has a breaking and entering of a house and breaking and entering of a vehicle.lima attorney went on to submit written pleadings conceding the nta allegations and admitting that lima was removable as charged.counsel explained that lima intended to apply for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij raised some concern as to whether lima would be eligible for asylum and asked whether he was trying to do anything with the convictions,to which counsel responded in the affirmative.he further stated that he would have lima come back in to submit the applications for asylum withholding of removal,and adjourned the proceedings until april.
upon his return,and in spite of his past representations,defense counsel reported now that lima would not be applying for asylum or withholding of removal after all.the ij scheduled the next hearing,at which lima was to appear in person,for may.sometime thereafter,lima discharged his original attorney and hired new counsel 
lima,with his new attorney beside him,appeared before the ij on may.addressing lima change in representation,counsel explained that lima did not agree with the course of action that his previous counsel wanted to take on the case and he seeked sic our office to represent him from this point forward.she never denied or disavowed lima first attorney admission that his conviction was for breaking into a house.she did,however,request a continuance so that lima could move to vacate both convictions in the malden district court.counsel stated that lima had not been advised of the immigration consequences of pleading to the criminal charges and would,therefore,seek to overturn them pursuant to the supreme court ruling in padilla kentucky 
the ij first noted that lima had previously indicated he would accept a removal order.he denied lima motion to continue,observing that he did not know how long it would take the massachusetts courts to dispose of lima padilla motions.the ij proceeded to find lima removable by clear and convincing evidence based on lima admissions,as well as his concession of removability.the ij then ordered lima removed to brazil.
lima appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,taking the position that the ij erred in not granting him a continuance to collaterally attack his state court convictions.notably,lima brief to the bia contains the explicit statement that lima is removable for two convictions for which lima is actively pursuing relief.this was the sole ground lima advanced in favor of reversal.the bia upheld the removal order on august.
that same day,the malden district court granted lima new trial motion with respect to his conviction the one for breaking into cars,according to his first attorney on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel under padilla with this victory in hand,lima filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings.the bia granted the motion on november,and remanded the matter to the ij.
the ij resumed proceedings on december,acknowledging as he did that one of lima convictions had been vacated since he entered the order of removal.dhs was not idle,however,and served lima with a new nta at this hearing.this second nta alleged lima removability under ina a a i because he had been convicted of a single crime involving moral turpitude,for which a sentence of one year or longer could have been imposed,within five years of his admission to the united states.this second nta refers to his conviction for breaking and entering a house.
unlike the first,this time lima denied that he was removable.he requested another continuance to give him additional time to file a motion to vacate his conviction.dhs objected,stating that the second nta did not set forth any new allegations and simply charged lima as removable based on his conviction alone.dhs stated that lima counsel should have been very well aware that was coming and took the position that lima already had ample opportunity to have both these charges vacated.
the ij agreed with dhs and denied lima motion to continue.the ij suggested that lima reserve his right to appeal and do the same thing that he did the last time,seek to have the remaining conviction vacated while his appeal was pending he proceeded to find lima removable by clear and convincing evidence in light of his previous concession that both of his criminal convictions were for crimes involving moral turpitude.
lima filed a second appeal with the bia.he contended this time that the government failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his december conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude.in his view,the government was required to present evidence that the felony he intended to commit after breaking into the house was itself a crime involving moral turpitude.because the government presented no evidence as to the nature of the contemplated crime,lima argued that it failed to prove his conviction was in fact for a crime involving moral turpitude.
notably,lima did not claim the ij abused his discretion in denying the motion to continue,or that the outcome of the immigration proceedings would have been any different had he been given the extra time he sought.he did not complain that his due process rights had been violated in any respect.further,lima lodged no argument that it was improper for his former counsel to have admitted the factual allegations contained in the original nta,that the conviction did not involve moral turpitude,or that he was not removable as charged in the original nta.neither did he contradict his first attorney statement that his conviction was predicated upon his breaking and entering a house.
the bia found it significant that,although lima was challenging his removability on the grounds that his conviction was not for a crime involving moral turpitude,his prior counsel had already conceded that both the and convictions were for crimes involving moral turpitude,rendering lima removable.the bia held lima to these concessions and affirmed the removal order.
lima timely petition to this court followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the bia did not simply adopt the ij decision as its own,but instead affirmed after providing its own analysis.accordingly,we focus our review on the bia decision rather than the ij.l√≥pez holder,cir.
we review questions of law de novo,including the bia conclusion that a noncitizen criminal conviction constitutes grounds for removal.patel holder,cir.nevertheless,we will defer to the bia reasonable interpretations of the ina,including its determination that a particular crime qualifies as one of moral turpitude,unless that interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or clearly contrary to law.da silva neto holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
factual findings,by contrast,are reviewed deferentially under the substantial evidence standard,meaning that we uphold those determinations unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.urizar carrascoza holder,cir quoting b b.while the ultimate question of removability is a question of law,we apply this deferential review to the component of the inquiry into a noncitizen removability based upon his concessions.id.at finding noncitizen concession of removability satisfied substantial evidence standard.
lima petitions for review of the bia finding that he is removable pursuant to a a i.that statute provides,in pertinent part,that any noncitizen who i is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after the date of admission,and ii is convicted of a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed,is deportable.a a i.the bia,after considering the evidence,determined that lima was removable based on his first attorney concession of removability.it is with this finding that we begin.
lima words concessions of removability 
we first account for lima words in the proceedings below.as noted,lima initial attorney conceded not only that he was removable for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude,but also that his conviction was for breaking and entering a house.and in lima brief filed with the bia in connection with his first appeal,successor counsel conceded his removability for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.on petition to this court,instead of telling us why we should not hold him to the concessions of removability,lima spends most of his brief arguing that his conviction was not for a crime involving moral turpitude and,therefore,he is not removable under ina a a i.
dhs takes a different view.it asserts,first of all,that lima is bound by his admissions through counsel that his conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude,and that he is removable.it additionally argues that because lima did not challenge removability before the ij in the initial proceedings or before the bia in his first appeal,it is too late for him to do so now.thus,dhs asks us to uphold the bia conclusion that lima conviction renders him removable.
to resolve this petition,we must determine whether the bia erred when it refused to disregard lima concessions.and,regardless of our answer to this question,we must then consider whether the bia finding of removability was supported by substantial evidence in the record.we begin with lima concessions.
a binding concessions 
as we have noted,the bia held lima to his first attorney admission of removability based on lima convictions for two crimes involving moral turpitude,and found him removable on that basis in actuality,the record reveals that lima made several separate admissions bearing on his removability.his initial attorney submitted written pleadings admitting to the charges in the first nta,and he stated before the ij that the two crimes of conviction were ones involving moral turpitude.this attorney also stated,on the record,that the conviction arose out of lima having broken into a house.and after changing attorneys,even his new counsel admitted lima removability in the initial appeal to the bia.
generally speaking,a party assertion of fact in a pleading is a judicial admission by which it normally is bound throughout the course of the proceeding.schott motorcycle supply,am.honda motor,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and an admission of counsel during trial is binding on the client if,in context,it is clear and unambiguous.levinsky,wal mart stores,cir.
these rules hold true in the immigration context.leblanc i,cir.where a noncitizen fails to demonstrate that his attorney conduct was so egregious as to warrant releasing him from his attorney concessions,those admissions are binding upon him.karim mukasey,fed.app,cir.furthermore,where a litigant has advanced no grounds to revisit a concession of removability,we have held that the concession is both binding on the noncitizen and establishes sufficient grounds for finding him removable.karim gonzales,cir.
lima assertion to this court that his conviction is not for a crime involving moral turpitude can not undo the clear and unambiguous concessions both of his attorneys have made to the opposite effect.indeed,lima does not claim that his first attorney admissions amounted to the type of egregious circumstances that would be necessary for us to set them aside.he fails to even address successor counsel concession of removability in his first brief to the bia.
simply put,lima offers no substantial reason why we should free him from his concessions of removability beyond his assertion that he wishes to amend his pleadings.our review of the record leads us to the ineluctable conclusion that his attorneys concessions of removability were considered tactical decisions made because lima did not have a meritorious defense to the charges of removability.indeed,the pleadings submitted during the march,hearing clearly indicate that lima counsel conceded removability with the intention of then applying for relief from removal.
we have previously stated that i t is not unusual or egregious for counsel to make tactical decisions that ultimately fizzle and redound to the client detriment.leblanc,at.nor does such a tactical decision constitute ineffective assistance of counsel a claim which,by the way,lima does not make even when it turns out to have been less than optimal.id.we conclude,therefore,that lima has failed to demonstrate that his attorneys concessions of removability were so egregious as to warrant releasing him from those concessions.karim,fed.app at.therefore,like the bia,we too hold lima to the words of his attorneys.
having reached this conclusion,we now turn to whether the bia properly relied exclusively on these concessions and the admissions of removability in finding lima removable.
b concessions as sufficient evidence of removability 
the government bears the burden of establishing the facts showing that a noncitizen is removable by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.urizar carrascoza,at.c a a.it has been further provided by regulation that 
if the respondent admits the factual allegations and admits his or her removability under the charges and the immigration judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain,the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.
c.thus,although the government must establish the facts to support a finding of removability,we have found that an ij may apply c to determine that removability has been established based on the noncitizen admissions.urizar carrascoza,at c see also karim,fed.app at explaining that an ij may rely on a noncitizen pleadings to determine removability.
our sister circuits have reached similar conclusions.in selimi,the seventh circuit held that the government was relieved of its burden to prove removability where the noncitizen conceded removability because the concession was in the nature of a judicial admission,and such an admission has the effect of withdrawing the issue from controversy,cir.along these same lines,the ninth circuit has he
