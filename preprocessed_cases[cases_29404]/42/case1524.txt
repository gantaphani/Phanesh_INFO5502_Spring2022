luz marina cantillano cruz cantillano cruz,a citizen of honduras,petitions for review of a final order of removal entered by the board of immigration appeals bia the bia affirmed an immigration judge ij conclusion that cantillano cruz was not eligible for asylum,withholding of removal,or protection under the convention against torture cat.cantillano cruz argued before the bia and ij that she feared persecution on account of her nuclear family ties to her husband johnny martinez martinez,whom she suspected had been murdered by his employer.the bia and ij rejected this argument and determined that any persecution suffered by cantillano cruz occurred because she had threatened to report the employer to the police,an act that did not qualify as a basis for her requested relief.
upon our review,we conclude that cantillano cruz familial relationship with martinez necessarily was one central reason for the persecution and fear of future persecution established by cantillano cruz,thereby meeting the statutory nexus requirement for asylum provided in the immigration and nationality act ina in b b i.accordingly,we grant cruz petition and remand her case to the bia for further proceedings.
in july,cantillano cruz and her minor son entered the united states without authorization and presented themselves to immigration officials to request asylum.several days later,the department of homeland security dhs served cantillano cruz with a notice to appear charging her as an alien present in the united states without admission,under the provisions of a a i.cantillano cruz conceded removability but filed applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.
at a hearing before the ij,cantillano cruz claimed past persecution and fear of future persecution based on her membership in a particular social group,namely,the nuclear family of johnny martinez.see b a,b a.she testified and presented other evidence in support of her claim.the evidence showed that in,cantillano cruz and martinez began living together,and that,although they were never married,were considered a married couple by members of their community.the couple had two children together.
between and,martinez worked for the honduran government as a border patrol agent.however,in,he obtained new employment working as the personal bodyguard to danny avila,who claimed to be a fisherman.for about five years,martinez accompanied avila on extended fishing trips.
martinez eventually learned that avila worked with organized crime groups in honduras and colombia that were engaged in the trafficking of drugs and firearms.in may,martinez told cantillano cruz that because of avila criminal conduct,martinez planned to quit his job and to return to his employment as a border patrol agent.one week later,in june,martinez accompanied avila on another fishing trip,but martinez did not return.
cantillano cruz and martinez uncle,calin isaias ramirez meza isaias,later visited the local boat dock to search for martinez.cantillano cruz found martinez clothes and motorcycle abandoned there.when cantillano cruz and isaias questioned avila about martinez whereabouts,avila told them to stop asking questions.after isaias stated that he and cantillano cruz would put in a police report,avila threatened that they would suffer the same fate as martinez.cantillano cruz and isaias visited the dock a few more times to ask about martinez,and encountered avila there more than one year after their first encounter.avila told them not to come back,and further warned that there were dangerous people around.
after cantillano cruz returned home from her final visit to the dock,avila contacted her and instructed her to go to a certain place to retrieve money owed to martinez.based on avila earlier threats,cantillano cruz declined his offer.
during a telephone call initiated by avila,cantillano cruz assured avila that she had no intention of contacting the police regarding avila or her husband disappearance.nevertheless,on different occasions in and,cantillano cruz observed avila and his associates loitering outside her home.during these incidents,they brandished and fired weapons,and threatened to kill cantillano cruz and her children.also,avila and his associates killed cantillano cruz dogs.
in july,two days after the last threatening encounter,cantillano cruz fled honduras with her younger child.because she could not afford to bring both children with her,she left her older child with martinez mother.after cantillano cruz left honduras,avila continued to inquire about her whereabouts.cantillano cruz testified that avila focused his threats on her because he knew that martinez probably had told her about avila criminal conduct.
upon considering cantillano cruz testimony and the other evidence,the ij concluded that she was credible.the ij also credited the testimony of thomas boerman,an expert on the subject of organized crime in honduras.among other things,boerman testified that avila likely targeted cantillano cruz because he suspected that martinez had told her about avila criminal activities.
in addressing cantillano cruz claim for asylum,the ij concluded that cantillano cruz was a member of a cognizable particular social group,namely,the nuclear family members of johnny martinez.even though the two never married,the ij concluded that they lived together as domestic partners and were considered a married couple.however,the ij further found that cantillano cruz failed to show that she had experienced persecution and feared future persecution on account of her membership in the nuclear family of martinez.
the ij instead determined that the main reason avila had threatened cantillano cruz was to deter her from contacting the police.the ij stated that although family ties likely motivated her search for martinez and her decision to confront avila,that concern for martinez could exist outside their familial relationship.the ij further observed that the only other family member who had been threatened was isaias,who also had confronted avila at the dock,and that neither martinez mother nor cantillano cruz older child had received such threats.additionally,the ij found that the evidence was insufficient to conclude that avila threatened cantillano cruz because she had learned about his criminal activities from martinez.the ij accordingly denied cantillano cruz application for asylum,as well as her application for withholding of removal 
the ij also rejected cantillano cruz request for protection under the cat.even though the ij assumed that avila had killed martinez and would find cantillano cruz upon her return to honduras,the ij concluded that avila had threatened cantillano cruz only about two times per year,and that the situation never escalated to violence.the ij further determined that avila had threatened to harm cantillano cruz only if she reported avila to police,which she had not done and did not intend to do if she returned to honduras.thus,the ij concluded that cantillano cruz failed to show that she likely would be tortured if she returned to honduras.
cantillano cruz appealed the ij ruling to the bia.the bia dismissed her appeal,adopting and supplementing the ij conclusions.according to the bia,avila threats constituted h arm meted out by a private actor for personal reasons or solely on general levels of crime and violence in honduras,which were insufficient bases to demonstrate eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.the bia also affirmed the ij denial of cantillano cruz request for protection under the cat.
cantillano cruz petitioned this court for review.we granted her unopposed motion for stay of removal proceedings pending our review.
cantillano cruz contends that the bia and ij erred in concluding that she was not persecuted because of her membership in the particular social group of the nuclear family of johnny martinez.citing our decision in lynch,cir,cantillano cruz submits that her familial relationship with martinez was intertwined with her actions resulting in avila threats toward her.cantillano cruz also submits that the bia and ij erred in their factual findings,contending that the re
