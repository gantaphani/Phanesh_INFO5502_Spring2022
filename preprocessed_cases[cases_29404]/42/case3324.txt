alvaro sanchez aguilar is a citizen of mexico who initially came to the united states as a child with his mother.although many of his immediate family members lawfully reside in the united states,he does not,and the federal government has formally removed him to mexico on five occasions.following his last removal,in,he returned to the united states without first obtaining permission to do so,as required by law.
in may,the government charged him with being an alien who,after having been removed in,and,was found in the united states in violation of.a jury convicted sanchez aguilar of that offense,and the district court sentenced him to the applicable statutory maximum of two years in prison.
sanchez aguilar raises two challenges to his conviction.the first,which he incorrectly frames as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,requires a brief summary of the procedural history of the case.
before trial,sanchez aguilar moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that each of his prior removal orders had been issued in violation of his due process rights.a removal order may not be used as the predicate for a prosecution if the proceeding that produced the order violated the alien due process rights and the alien suffered prejudice as a result.united states barajas alvarado,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the government conceded that four of sanchez aguilar removal orders were invalid under this standard.but the government argued that sanchez aguilar due process rights had not been violated in connection with the removal order,and the district court ultimately agreed.the court accordingly denied sanchez aguilar motion to dismiss the indictment,although it rejected the government request to introduce evidence relating to the,and removal orders under federal rule of evidence b.at trial,the jury heard evidence that sanchez aguilar had been removed from the united states only in.
the source of controversy on appeal is this sanchez aguilar had already been convicted,in,of violating based on the same removal order that forms the predicate for the conviction in this case.there is nothing inherently wrong with that under the found in prong of,the same removal order can serve as the basis for more than one conviction,so long as the government prove s that the defendant ha s been outside the united states after each conviction before he is again prosecuted for violating.united states meza villarello,cir per curiam.we adopted that rule,grounded in double jeopardy concerns,to avoid the specter of the government obtaining one conviction and then,after releasing the defendant from prison,arresting him at the prison gates for again being found in the united states.id.
in this case,the government did not prove at trial that sanchez aguilar had been outside the united states between his conviction and his arrest for the offense at issue here.but in fact he had been.it is undisputed that,upon completing his sentence for the conviction,sanchez aguilar was immediately removed to mexico on september.the jury never learned of that fact because the district court excluded any evidence relating to the removal order.
the question we must resolve is whether the government failure to prove at trial that sanchez aguilar left the united states after his conviction is of any significance.sanchez aguilar contends the government failure to prove that fact means there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction in this case.we view the matter differently.proof of sanchez aguilar post departure from the united states,although necessary to avoid double jeopardy concerns,was not an element of the offense submitted to the jury.see united states florez,cir proof of flight from justice necessary to avoid dismissal did not thereby become an element of the charged narcotics offenses.to obtain a conviction,the government needed to prove only that sanchez aguilar had been removed from the united states in,and that at some point thereafter he knowingly and voluntarily returned to the united states without first obtaining the requisite permission to do so.see united states romo romo,cir.the government introduced ample proof of those statutory elements at trial,and sanchez aguilar does not contend otherwise.thus,the government introduced sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction.
that leaves the question whether sanchez aguilar conviction violates his right not to be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.const.amend.v.since sanchez aguilar never raised a double jeopardy defense in the district court,we review the record only for plain error.see.b united states olano.we find none.under meza villarello,in order to ensure that his conviction in this case is for a different offence,the government had to show that sanchez aguilar left the united states after his conviction.at.but that fact was undisputed below and is not disputed on appeal.indeed,in a brief,sanchez aguilar conceded that he had been removed from the united states in september.so there was no error,much less plain error,in the district court refusal to vacate sanchez aguilar conviction based on a double jeopardy defense he never raised.
we reject sanchez aguilar contention that,in analyzing his double jeopardy defense,we are limited to reviewing the evidence presented to the jury.that contention can not be squared with precedent holding that double jeopardy is a question of law that must be resolved by the court,not the jury,even when the defense turns on disputed factual issues.see united states persico,cir united states macdougall,cir.when the defense must be addressed after trial and turns on disputed facts,district courts are empowered to hold evidentiary hearings to make the necessary factual determinations.see persico,at united states young,cir.if courts were limited to reviewing the evidence introduced at trial,as sanchez aguilar urges,evidentiary hearings to address double jeopardy issues would be neither needed nor authorized 
sanchez aguilar second challenge to his conviction is a collateral attack on the validity of the removal order.that attack can succeed only if sanchez aguilar shows that the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d.as alluded to earlier,this standard requires the defendant to establish both a due process violation in the underlying removal proceeding and resulting prejudice.barajas alvarado,at united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.we need not analyze prejudice because sanchez aguilar has not established a due process violation.
sanchez aguilar contends that his due process rights were violated because the immigration officer who interviewed him at the border did not tell him that he could request withdrawal of his application for admission,a form of discretionary relief which,if granted,would have allowed sanchez aguilar to leave the united states immediately without a removal order being entered.see a.in the context of removal proceedings for aliens who have already been admitted into the united states,we have held that due process requires the immigration judge to inform such aliens of potentially available avenues of relief.see united states arce hernandez,cir.but sanchez aguilar removal order was the product of an expedited removal proceeding authorized under b.such proceedings are generally reserved for arriving aliens who,like sanchez aguilar at the time,are seeking admission into the united states at the border.see b a i b i.
aliens like sanchez aguilar who seek entry at the border are entitled only to whatever process congress provides.barajas alvarado,at see united states ex rel.knauff shaughnessy.the statute and regulation governing expedited removal proceedings,b and,set forth the procedural rights to which such aliens are entitled,but the right to be informed of potentially available avenues of relief from removal is not among them.as a result,the immigration officer failure to inform sanchez aguilar of his ability to request withdrawal of his application for admission did not violate his due process rights.see united states lopez vasquez,cir.
