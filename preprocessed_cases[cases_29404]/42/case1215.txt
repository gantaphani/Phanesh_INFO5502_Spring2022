hector duran pichardo petitions for review of the final order of his removal issued by the board of immigration appeals.for the reasons that follow,we will deny the petition.
duran pichardo,is a native of the dominican republic and he was lawfully admitted to the united states as a legal permanent resident in.he was married in,and he subsequently fathered two children 
on july,duran pichardo applied for naturalization as a united states citizen.on may,he completed his examination under oath therefore the only thing that remained before he could become a naturalized citizen was taking the public oath of allegiance and renunciation after he successfully completed the examination,duran pichardo was given a document that stated the ins will notify you later of the final decision on your application.
when the final decision did not come in the mail,duran pichardo made repeated calls to the agency in an attempt to be scheduled to take the oath.according to duran pichardo,he subsequently learned that part of his naturalization file had been mislabeled and he was ultimately advised that all or part of his naturalization file had been lost.although we can not be sure of exactly what happened to his file,it is clear that duran pichardo never took the oath.
on march,nearly ten years after duran pichardo satisfactorily completed his naturalization examination under oath,he pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess narcotics and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to months imprisonment.
on october,the government instituted removal proceedings against duran pichardo on the grounds that he was an alien who had been convicted of a controlled substance violation under a b i and an aggravated felony under u.a a iii.although he did not challenge the convictions and conceded that they would otherwise make him eligible for removal,he argued that he was not removable because his naturalization application had been finalized.he also argued that,to the extent his naturalization application had not been finalized,he should not be removed because the government own actions precluded him from taking the oath and thereby prevented his naturalization and citizenship 
while removal proceedings were pending,duran pichardo requested a hearing on his naturalization application and attached evidence that his naturalization file had been mislabeled lost.on september,the government moved to consolidate two naturalization files under duran pichardo name conceding,at a minimum,that duran pichardo primary naturalization file did not contain all pertinent information 
on july,despite the pending removal proceedings,the government formally denied duran pichardo application for naturalization which had been pending since the government based that denial on his convictions,and concluded that those convictions made him ineligible for naturalization.his appeal of that decision was denied.
thereafter,the immigration judge presiding over the removal proceedings found duran pichardo removable under a a iii and b i,and ordered him removed from the united states to the dominican republic.the bia dismissed duran pichardo appeal of that order because it found that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the issues he raised.nevertheless,the bia stated that the government could remove duran pichardo even though the delay in scheduling him to take the oath resulted from the government mishandling of his file.this petition for review followed.
on appeal,duran pichardo argues with some justification that absent the government own error,he would have taken the oath and become a naturalized citizen before his convictions and thus would no longer be removable.he therefore claims that he i obtained a protected liberty interest in the grant of his naturalization application ii is entitled to an order granting his naturalization application iii is entitled to a nunc pro tunc review of his naturalization application so that it may be finalized and presumably granted without consideration of convictions that occurred after he completed the naturalization process.
though we generally lack jurisdiction to review an aggravated felon final order of removal,we have jurisdiction to review duran pichardo challenge to the agency denial of his citizenship claim because there are no factual issues and we retain the authority to determine our own jurisdiction.see a c see also,brandao att y of the,cir w e do have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction,particularly in cases such as this where the petitioner claims to be a national of the united states,and no material issues of fact are presented.section a d also provides that we retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional questions and duran pichardo argues that he has unconstitutionally been deprived of a protected liberty interest without due process of law.because we address a purely legal question,our review of the agency rejection of duran pichardo due process claim is plenary.
to become a naturalized citizen of the united states,duran pichardo was required to i maintain five years lawful permanent residence,physical presence in the united states for at least half of that time,and continuous residence from the date of application until admission to citizenship ii submit an application iii pass a background check iv pass a test on united states history and government and establish his proficiency in communicating in english v be examined under oath by an immigration official and vi publicly swear allegiance to the united states and renounce allegiance to other sovereigns before the attorney general or a competent court.see a a a a b a.
it is undisputed that duran pichardo did everything that was required for naturalization except take the oath.he claims that that omission should not defeat his claim to citizenship because he was verbally informed that his application for naturalization had been approved and the date for the oath ceremony was forthcoming.duran pichardo,however,concedes that he never actually took the oath as prescribed by statute.
because duran pichardo never took the oath,he never became a citizen and he remained subject to removal.congress requires that an alien publicly take the oath before the attorney general or designee as a condition of naturalization.the statutory language is clear and unambiguous.therefore,duran pichardo was still subject to removal even though he completed all of the other prerequisites to citizenship.see,okafor attorney general,cir alien who signed document containing oath of renunciation and allegiance required of all applicants for naturalization,but who did not take oath in public ceremony,had not met requirements for becoming naturalized citizen tovar alvarez attorney general,cir same.
duran pichardo claims,nevertheless,that his satisfactory completion of all of the other requirements for naturalization created a liberty interest in citizenship that can not be undermined by something that was the result of the government own delay in administering the oath the government asserts that duran pichardo could not acquire any cognizable liberty interest until he had satisfied all of the conditions for becoming a citizen,including taking the oath.
