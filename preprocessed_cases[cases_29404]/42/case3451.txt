jose raul meza vallejos,a native and citizen of peru,seeks review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion to reopen.after entering a final order of removal against meza vallejos,the bia granted him a period of voluntary departure.the sixtieth day fell on a saturday.meza vallejos did not depart.rather,on the following business filed his motion to reopen.the bia denied the motion on the ground that meza vallejos had failed to voluntarily depart and was thus statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status for a period of ten years.
we hold that where,as here,a period of voluntary departure technically expires on a weekend or holiday,and an immigrant files a motion that would affect his request for voluntary departure on the next business day,such period legally expires on that next business day.we therefore grant the petition for review and remand this case to the agency for adjudication of the petitioner motion to reopen on the merits.
meza vallejos last entered the united states on february,on a visa with authorization to stay through may.he overstayed his visa and subsequently filed an application for political asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat in april.
in his application,meza vallejos alleged that he had been a member of an underground student organization during his years as a university student in peru,and that the organization advocated student rights and against all communism and totalitarianism.he further alleged that he had been threatened by members of the guerrilla sic while at the university for promoting student elections,and that he thought he would be killed by the guerrilla group sendero luminoso the shining path if he was returned to peru.
following a hearing on the merits in march,an immigration judge ij denied meza vallejos applications for relief but granted him voluntary departure.meza vallejos posted his voluntary departure bond on april.he then appealed the ij decision to the bia.the bia dismissed the appeal in may and renewed the grant of voluntary departure for an additional sixty days,through july,a saturday.
meza vallejos did not file a petition for review of the bia may order instead,on monday,july,he filed a motion to reopen with the bia and an emergency request for an extension of his voluntary departure period.he explained that he had married a citizen two weeks previously,and she had immediately filed a form i petition on his behalf.
at that time,the law of our circuit provided that in cases in which a motion to reopen is filed within the voluntary departure period and a stay of removal or voluntary departure is requested,the voluntary departure period is tolled during the period the bia is considering the motion.azarte ashcroft,cir emphasis added,overruled by dada mukasey.
in october,the bia denied the motion to reopen.it concluded that meza vallejos had filed his motion after his voluntary departure period had expired.the board reasoned that the maximum period of voluntary departure which may be provided by an immigration judge or this board at the conclusion of removal proceedings is days,that there is no legal basis for this board to grant an extension of voluntary departure where this board has already provided the maximum period of voluntary departure allowed,and that this board does not have the authority to further extend period of voluntary departure.because meza vallejos had failed to voluntarily depart,the bia concluded,he was ineligible for adjustment of status for a period of ten years.see d 
in november,meza vallejos filed a timely petition for review of the bia denial of his motion to reopen.that same month,the ninth circuit decided barroso gonzales,cir.in barroso,the bia granted the petitioner a period of voluntary departure.id.at.rather than depart on the thirtieth day a saturday,petitioner filed a timely motion to reconsider pursuant to c b.such motions must be filed within thirty days of a final administrative order of removal t herefore,the deadlines for filing barroso motion to reconsider and the expiration of barroso voluntary departure period fell on the same date saturday,march.at.the bia had recognized,however,that w hen the deadline for filing a motion to reconsider expires on a saturday,the motion is due on the next business day,which in this case was monday,march.id.citations omitted.yet neither the department of justice nor the department of homeland security regulations offer any guidance as to how to treat weekend days when they are the last calendar day of the voluntary departure period.id.at.
we held that where the deadline for filing a motion to reconsider falls on the same day as the expiration of the voluntary departure period,the proper solution is to apply the same rule to both periods.id.at.we explained that we were not extending the voluntary departure time period in contravention of ins regulations,but rather were simply determining which date should be counted as the thirtieth day.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.
the government moved to remand meza vallejos case to the bia so that the board could reconsider his motion to reopen in light of barroso.that motion was granted,and supplemental briefing completed.the bia again denied meza vallejos motion to reopen,finding barroso to be distinguishable since in that case the pertinent deadlines both fell on the same weekend day.see barroso,at.by contrast,meza vallejos voluntary departure period had expired prior to the end of the period in which he was permitted to file a motion to reopen.because he had not voluntarily departed within sixty days,the bia concluded,meza vallejos was barred from seeking adjustment of status.the board further explained 
there is no need to treat the sixtieth day differently if it happens to fall on a weekend or holiday because,unlike a filing requirement,voluntary departure can be accomplished by departing the united states by land,sea,or air any day of the year.thus,the practical reasons for extending regulatory filing deadlines which fall on a weekend or holiday,which relate to the normal business hours during which documents can be properly filed,do not provide a logical basis for extending the maximum period of voluntary departure statutorily authorized by congress.moreover,congress has not expressly or impliedly provided for such an extension in sections b or d of the ina.
meza vallejos timely filed this petition for review of the bia denial of his motion to reopen,relying heavily on azarte and barroso.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,and review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.see,perez mukasey,cir socop gonzalez ins,cir en banc.the bia abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.ontiveros lopez ins,cir.the bia determination of purely legal questions,however,is reviewed de novo.see,minasyan mukasey,cir alali amin mukasey,cir.
voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief that allows certain favored aliens either before the conclusion of removal proceedings or after being found deportable to leave the country willingly.dada,at.this form of relief serves the practical goals of reducing the costs associated with deporting individuals from the united states and providing a mechanism for illegal aliens to leave the country without being subject to the stigma or bars to future relief that are part of the sanction of deportation.azarte,at.
before the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,voluntary departure was granted for generous periods of time.id.in,however,congress curtailed the period of time during which an alien may remain in the united states pending voluntary departure.dada,at.as explained above,where,as here,an immigrant is granted voluntary departure at the close of removal proceedings,the maximum period of voluntary departure is sixty days.see b.appropriate immigration authorities may extend the time to depart but only if the voluntary departure period is less than the statutory maximum in the first instance.dada,at.
