background 
factual background 
in oruro,bolivia,after bellido graduated from high school in,he went to work for the bolivian railroad.he started out as a messenger,eventually reaching a position in which he was responsible for investigating railroad accidents.after several years of being what he describes as a passive member of the railroad federation union rfu,he became part of the union leadership as the secretary of conflicts in.different parties operate within the rfu and bellido rise to his leadership position was precipitated by the internal election of his party to the union leadership.the rfu represented between and members,and bellido position made him one of the top members of the union in the country.as the secretary of conflicts,he was responsible for resolving grievances between employees and between employees and the government.
in and,bellido participated in thirty to forty demonstrations.during a protest march in january of,the army arrested bellido.the army detained him for two weeks,along with five other union members.no charges were filed against him during his incarceration nor was he afforded a chance to speak for his freedom to a judge or to military officials.bellido also experienced physical abuse while in custody.when he was finally released,an army captain warned bellido that if he was found participating in protests again,military members would kill him.
in august of,bellido participated in the march for life,a protest involving people in a kilometer walk to la paz.as the marchers neared la paz,the government arrested union members,threatening to open fire on the crowd.bellido was forced into hiding at a nearby railroad office for several days to avoid arrest.following the march,the government forbade all union activities.bellido,fearful of government retaliation,lived a transient lifestyle in bolivia,infrequently returning to his hometown for over two years.although people questioned his family as to his whereabouts,bellido family was not harmed during his absence.
ii.procedural background 
bellido used a tourist visa to gain entry to the united states from bolivia on february.at that time he was married to norma velasco he divorced velasco in and she returned to bolivia with their two children.entered the united states on december,and overstayed her tourist visa.bellido and married,and they have two united states citizen children together jonathan,now years old,and melanie,now almost years old.bellido and concede that they are deportable.
after spending seven years and two years,respectively,in the united states,bellido and removal proceedings commenced on april.they requested relief based upon suspension of deportation asylum,withholding of deportation,and voluntary departure.in support of his claims,bellido presented evidence attesting to his status as an upright member of american society and to the situation he endured in bolivia testimony from bellido employer and pastor that detailed his rise to a management position at service master and his committed church involvement the deed from the house he purchased in a minneapolis suburb documentation of bellido membership in bolivia railroad union documentation describing labor unrest in bolivia and the government response to it and bellido own testimony about his past experiences in bolivia.the immigration judge ij evaluated the evidence and ultimately denied bellido asylum application.the ij decision was premised on several observations the incredulity of bellido testimony the insufficiency of the corroborating evidence bellido long absence from bolivia and his family relatively life in bolivia since his departure.
the bia found that bellido had failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution.specifically,the bia stated that the harm bellido experienced was not significant enough to qualify as persecution,that his bolivian family was not injured during his time in the united states,and that the government never took action against bellido.the bia did not mention the ij credibility findings as a rationale for its affirmance,but did adopt the ij decision in conjunction with its observations.
on appeal,bellido argues that he presented substantial evidence upon which the bia should have granted him asylum.he further argues that the ij had a duty to evaluate a convention against torture claim sua sponte,and that the bia erred by not recognizing this.
standard of review 
the attorney general may grant asylum when the applicant qualifies as a refugee.a refugee is defined as a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution.a a.the applicant fear of persecution must be subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.ashcroft,cir.if the applicant can establish past persecution,then he is entitled to a presumption of a fear of persecution.perinpanathan ins,cir.persecution is not a defined term.rather,it is a fluid concept that does not necessarily require the applicant to prove that his life or freedom has been or will be directly jeopardized.see bereza ins,cir.
we review the bia asylum determination to verify that it was based on substantial evidence,and reverse if the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.perinpanathan,at quoting feleke ins,cir.when an ij makes credibility findings,we do not disturb the findings if they have a legitimate,articulable basis.nyirenda ins,cir citation omitted perinpanathan,at this court defers to an immigration judge credibility finding where the finding is supported by a specific,cogent reason for disbelief.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
substantial evidence 
we believe bellido has amply proven his asylum claim.as is often the true in asylum cases,bellido own testimony provides the most complete account of the persecution he suffered at the hands of the bolivian government.the ij discounted his testimony citing to implausibilities that do not persuade us as being legitimate.
the ij noted that bellido did not detail his arrest or the death threat from the military on his asylum application.as a preliminary matter,we think it is important to note that a preparer aided bellido in filling out his asylum application.certain facts may have been omitted from the form itself because bellido was unclear as to the level of detail he should provide due to language and cultural barriers.perhaps they were lost in translation or bellido was unclear as to the level of detail he should provide.when the form asked directly whether he had been arrested,detained,or interrogated,bellido answered in the affirmative.we fail to see why bellido omission of details should serve to undermine the entirety of his testimony.see diallo ins,cir stating that not all disparities should lead to an adverse credibility finding,especially when applicant testimony is generally consistent,rational,and believable ins,cir distinguishing between inconsequential,incidental misstatements and inconsistencies that involve the core of the asylum claim.instead,his testimony should be viewed in light of the entire evidentiary record.when done so,bellido version of his experiences in bolivia are consistent and believable.
bellido introduced into evidence his union card that states he was the secretary of conflicts.the card bears an official stamp and the general secretary signature there has been no challenge to its authenticity.this evidence corroborates bellido union membership and his top positi
