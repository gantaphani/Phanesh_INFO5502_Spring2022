jose crisanto gonzalez cervantes petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision holding that there is no realistic probability that california would apply california penal code e e to conduct that is not morally turpitudinous and the bia decision denying his motion to reconsider.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a d,and we deny the petitions.
standard of review 
we review de novo the bia interpretation of the statute of conviction and where,as here,the bia does not issue a published decision in coming to its conclusion,the court defers to the bia determination that the statute of conviction constitutes a crime of moral turpitude to the extent that the bia decision has the power to persuade.nunez holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted citing skidmore swift.see also rohit holder,cir.
ii.analysis 
under the categorical approach,the court looks to the statutory definition of the state offense,and not to the particular facts underlying the conviction,to determine whether the offense falls within the generic federal definition of the crime.see taylor united states,d.to show a state applies a statute to crimes outside the generic definition of the listed crime,the petitioner must show that either in her own case or in another case the state courts have actually applied the statute in the manner for which she argues.gonzales duenas alvarez,d ortiz magana mukasey,cir.there must be a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of moral turpitude.duenas alvarez,at.
a crime is morally turpitudinous if it is vile,base,or depraved,and violates accepted moral standards the essence of moral turpitude is an evil or malicious intent.latter singh holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the context of sexual offenses,whether the crime involves moral turpitude turns on whether there is actual harm or a protected class of victim.nunez,at see also mendoza holder,cir interpreting nunez.the term harm in this context includes psychological harm.see nunez,at.
misdemeanor sexual battery under e has three elements the touching of an intimate part of another person,directly or through the clothing of the perpetrator or the victim against the person will and with specific intent to cause sexual arousal,sexual gratification,or sexual abuse.code e in re shannon,th,d.intimate part is defined as the sexual organ,anus,groin,or buttocks of any person,and the breast of a female.code g.
the bia decision is persuasive 
the bia cited four california court of appeal cases in reaching its conclusion that there is no realistic probability that california would apply e to conduct falling outside the generic federal definition of moral turpitude.in each,the court of appeal applied e to acts where the defendant had the specific intent to cause sexual arousal,sexual gratification,or sexual abuse,and actually inflicted harm through the unlawful touching of the victim intimate parts.see people chavez,th,d people dayan,th,d people rodriguez,no,wl.july,people jones,no,wl.
for instance,in chavez,the court held that misdemeanor sexual battery is a crime of moral turpitude because it is a specific intent crime,and u nlike simple or even felony battery,sexual battery does not result from a simple push or offensive touch.d at.sexual battery,the court found,involved the degrading use of another,against her will,for one own sexual arousal.id.at quotations and citations omitted.in jones,the court upheld the defendant conviction for misdemeanor sexual battery where the victim testified she woke up naked from the waist down to find the defendant lying naked on top of her.wl,at.in dayan,the court upheld the defendant conviction for misdemeanor sexual battery for intentionally and unlawfully groping women in his dental office.d at.and in rodriguez,the court found the evidence that the defendant touched the victim breast against her will established the crime of misdemeanor sexual battery.wl,at.
since the sexual conduct in these cases actually harmed the victims through the touching of their intimate parts,the acts fall within the generic federal definition of moral turpitude as applied in the context of offenses see nunez,at see also mendoza,at.
petitioner fails to meet his burden 
on appeal,gonzalez cervantes has not met his burden of showing the california courts have applied e to conduct falling outside the generic federal definition of moral turpitude.see duenas alvarez,at ortiz magana,at.though gonzalez cervantes cites three cases in arguing california has applied e to conduct that did not rise to the level of depraved,base,and vile,in each case the defendant actually inflicted harm upon the victim with the specific intent to commit sexual abuse.see in re shannon,th,d in re,no,wl,in re carlos,no,wl.
in in re shannon,for instance,the minor defendant pinched the breast of the minor victim,causing her emotional distress and resulting in a significant bruise.d at.the court found that the defendant inflicted a sexual battery under e with the specific purpose of sexual abuse because he first told her,get off the phone.you my ho,and when the victim responded,whatever,and walked away,the defendant pursued her,slapped her face,grabbed her arm,and pinched her breast.id.at.
in in re,the court found the minor defendant committed sexual battery when he poked the center of the victim buttocks,penetrating about an inch.wl,at.the court stressed that the term sexual abuse included conduct beyond that which caused physical injury or pain because otherwise the sexual battery statute would permit a perpetrator to intentionally humiliate or intimidate a woman by an unwanted touching of her genitalia or breasts without violating section.id.at.because the defendant laughed with his companions as he touched the victim and used derogatory language,the court found the evidence demonstrated the defendant purpose was sexual abuse.id.at.
finally,in in re carlos c,the court found there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant acted with the specific purpose to embarrass and humiliate the victim when,upon seeing two of his friends slap the victim rear end,he smack ed the victim crotch area,laughed,and ran away.wl,at.based on the act itself together with its surrounding circumstances,the defendant had the specific intent to sexually abuse the victim when he touched her.id.at quoting shannon,d at.
though gonzalez cervantes argues these cases show the conduct at issue did not rise to the level of depraved,base,and vile,in each case the defendant actually inflicted harm upon the victim by sexually abusing her.moreover,it is precisely because the defendants in these cases had the specific intent to cause the victim psychological harm that the courts found the elements of e were satisfied.of course,specific intent alone will not render a crime morally turpitudinous if the acts at issue are trivial,see galeana mendoza gonzales,cir citing mei ashcroft,cir,or mere provocation,bad taste,or failed humor,nunez,at.however,we do not find that pinching another breasts to the point of bruising,shoving a finger into another rear end,or smacking another crotch is easily characterized as merely provocative,in bad taste,or humor gone awry.
the dissent argues that the psychological harm the victim experienced in in re carlos embarrassment and humiliation does not constitute the type of actual harm required under nunez to elevate e to a crime categorically involving moral turpitude dissent at.but this assumes that the touching of an intimate part itself is not an actual harm.analyzing harm solely from a reus perspective ignores the violation that occurs during the sexual act.and only considering the severity of the psychological harm a victim may experience incorrectly focuses the inquiry on what a victim may be able to endure rather than on the morally reprehensible nature of the act itself.sexually abusive battery necessarily inflicts actual harm on the victim.
section e resembles other morally turpitudinous crimes
