mabelle de la rosa dann dann was charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud count one,visa fraud count two,forced labor count three,unlawful conduct regarding documents in furtherance of servitude count four and harboring an illegal alien for the purpose of private financial gain count five.all charges arose out of conduct involving her nanny and housekeeper,zoraida peña canal peña canal.
dann,an american citizen of peruvian descent,arranged for peña canal to travel from her native peru to the united states in and enter under a visa to serve as a nanny and housekeeper.dann was going through a divorce at the time,was unemployed,and was not receiving child support.once peña canal arrived,dann kept her passport,forbade her from speaking with anyone outside the home,and failed to pay her for two years,although she often promised that she would.she repeatedly threatened to send peña canal back to peru and yet when peña canal agreed to go home,dann told her that she would owe her because she had only worked off of the worth of expenses that dann had paid on her behalf.dann eventually asked peña canal to sign a false statement that she had been paid minimum wage.this statement,along with peña canal passport and peruvian identification,were later found by immigration and customs enforcement ice agents underneath clothes in a drawer in dann room.
dann was convicted after a jury trial on all five counts and sentenced to months imprisonment.the district court ordered that she pay restitution to peña canal of.and because the court found that peña canal who was living in a shelter needed money immediately,the court ordered dann to turn over any accrued child support payments that she received from her while incarcerated directly to peña canal.dann children were eligible for child support.her eldest son is now sixteen,and her twins are ten years old.
dann appeals her convictions for forced labor as well as for the related offenses of document servitude and harboring an alien for financial gain.she also appeals three sentencing enhancements under the united states sentencing guidelines and the district court restitution order.
as we explain below,we affirm the convictions on all counts as supported by sufficient evidence.with respect to sentencing,we decline to reach the merits of the first enhancement for visa fraud because it does not affect the guidelines offense level we affirm the second enhancement for holding dann in forced labor for over one year and we affirm the third enhancement for committing a felony in connection with forced labor.
finally,we reverse the district court restitution order.this case raises a question of first impression whether child support arrearages belong to a criminal defendant such that they may be assigned to a victim by a restitution order while the defendant children are still minors.upon review of california case law,we conclude that the minor child is the real party in interest to accrued child support.until the child reaches the age of majority,the parent remains a conduit of the support and may distribute it for his benefit.thus,any money that dann receives for child support does not belong to her but rather to her children it can not be assigned to peña canal.
background 
factual background 
the parties at trial and on appeal present two competing narratives.dann contends that this case is a not unusual story of the relationship between two women,with all its ups and downs.as a divorced,single mother with three small children,dann was desperate.she gave peña canal the opportunity to come to the united states,and she treated her as a family member.dann took care of,housed,and fed peña canal,and wanted to pay her as soon as she had the chance.dann hoped to give peña canal a room of her own but was unable to do so.the two women had their fights,as all family members do.after peña canal left dann,she discovered that she could obtain a t visa and stay in the united states,as long as she testified against dann peña canal testimony is tainted by her incentive to lie.
the government in turn portrays a woman who went to great lengths to violate immigration laws so that peña canal could work for her.she needed cheap or free labor,and this was her means of procuring it.her behavior towards peña canal became worse and worse over time,culminating in peña canal working without pay in conditions,fearful of what would happen if she were to leave.
since dann was convicted,however,the two narratives are not on equal footing.the court is to construe all facts in favor of the verdict.the facts below are therefore presented in the light most favorable to the prosecution.jackson virginia.
dann brings peña canal to the united states 
dann is a naturalized american citizen of peruvian descent who graduated from berkeley business school.she first met peña canal during a brief visit to peru in march of,when peña canal was working as a nanny for dann sister.dann suggested that peña canal come to the united states to nanny for her family instead.
dann returned to peru a few months later and hired peña canal to take care of her twin baby boys during the trip.again she spoke of taking peña canal to the united states.she promised peña canal the opportunity to study english and a salary that would increase from to per month.at trial,peña canal testified that even at that time,dann spoke about deductions,calculations,and costs,such as the cost of a visa and the cost of housing in the united states.
dann and peña canal went about the process of applying for a visa.dann filled out the papers for peña canal and told her to pretend that she was a tourist going to the united states for vacation.dann told her that it would be more believable if peña canal said that she had a daughter in peru or a mother who was sick,and so on her first application,peña canal stated that she had a daughter and presented a false birth certificate as proof.that application was denied.
dann filled out a second application,this time stating that she and peña canal,along with the twins,would go to the united states for thanksgiving and then return.this time peña canal was granted an interview at the consulate,but this application was also denied.dann returned to the united states in november of but vowed to send for peña canal,even if it meant smuggling her with coyotes through mexico.
during the following two years,dann tried to help peña canal come to the united states on three occasions.dann was going through a divorce,and in she wrote to peña canal 
dear zoraida,
i hope you are well.here,i trying to do everything possible to get ahead all alone and with the responsibility of three children.as you probably know,my divorce will be finalized very soon.now,the judge has ordered that i must go out and work.and i need more help than ever i going to try and see how to bring you over here.as you probably know,a man that my brother is acquainted with is going to get in touch with you very soon and will try to bring you.do tell anyone from your family 
finally,in december,dann arranged for peña canal to contact dann friend,silvana de la rosa silvana.dann and silvana entered into a contract to bring peña canal to the united states.silvana would pretend that she was so frail from cancer that she needed an assistant,peña canal,to travel with her.dann hired a consultant to teach peña canal how to lie to immigration officials,with whom peña canal met regularly over a period of several months before her interview at the consulate.peña canal was granted a tourist visa and entered the united states on july.
at this point,dann was unemployed and receiving no child support.she and her three children were living with her mother.
work conditions with dann 
when peña canal arrived in the united states,she moved in with dann and dann three boys at dann mother house.the house was cramped,and peña canal slept on the floor.dann promised that they would be there for only a few days,and then they would move to a bigger apartment where they would have more privacy.around this time,dann took peña canal passport for,since peña canal did not have any private or secure space of her own.when silvana left the country,dann tore up peña canal return ticket to peru along with the contract to bring peña canal to the united states.
eventually,in late september of,dann,her three children,and peña canal moved out of dann mother house and into a apartment.here again,peña canal did not have a room of her own.she slept on the floor in the corner of the living room.dann began working as a real estate agent but funds were tight.she promised peña canal that she would pay her as soon as she got on her feet.dann,however,never paid peña canal.
peña canal workday began at when she made breakfast for dann and the boys.once the boys were off to school,she had until noon to clean the apartment,do laundry and ironing,and prepare lunch.at about,she walked thirty minutes to the twins school to pick them up.she would feed them lunch and then supervise their homework until the elder son came home.she would take the children out to play,feed them dinner at,and then get them ready for bed at.after the children were asleep,she would tidy the house before retiring at about 
the conditions and the relationship worsened over time.in january of,dann forbade peña canal from leaving the apartment without permission.when dann friends came over,she made peña canal hide in the gym of the apartment complex.she told peña canal not to talk to anyone because she did not want peña canal to tell anybody about the things here at home.at trial,the property manager of dann apartment complex testified that dann told him to order personnel not to speak with peña canal.
sometime in the winter of,dann began restricting peña canal food intake.dann forbade peña canal from eating fruit or drinking tea without permission.eventually,dann began weighing the meat and counting eggs and bread to make sure peña canal was not eating more than her ration.
by february seven months after peña canal arrival in the united states dann still had not paid peña canal.at that time,dann told peña canal 
you should you should think that i treating you like a slave,you should think that i treating you like a slave.i going to pay you.i do want for you to leave me because i do know what would happen to my children.where would i keep them the government would take them from me.
dann continued to promise to pay peña canal.in march of,she opened a bank account for peña canal falsely informing the bank that peña canal worked for whole foods.dann kept the bank documents the personal checks issued to the account were later found in her possession.
in january,the two women had a heated argument because dann thought that peña canal had spoken to her son trombone teacher without permission.dann said,i told you not to talk to anybody.why did you go and talk to the teacher did you want to practice your english she threatened to send peña canal back to peru.she said,i giving you a chance to be here in this country.i going to buy your ticket right now.but first,i going to figure out our accounts.dann concluded that peña canal owed a total of,of which she had worked off only.
dann falsely accused peña canal of stealing from her on at least four occasions.the last of these,on march,resulted in another argument.this time,peña canal stood up to dann and said,
you know what if i here in the united states,it is so that i can make as much as a dollar even honestly.even if it cleaning bathrooms,but honest money.i never taken anybody money in peru and even less here if you think that i stealing from you,call the police.call the police.
peña canal went into the bathroom to wash her face,and dann followed her in and turned off the light.dann then grabbed peña canal by the neck,called her names,and said she was going to send her back to peru.when peña canal answered that she actually wanted to go home,dann reminded her of all the clothes that dann had purchased for her.
dann continued to insult peña canal often,calling her little girl and shit.on march,peña canal told dann to replace a radio she had broken,and dann said,you talking to me about rights.what rights do you have in the united states you a peasant.i giving you an opportunity here in this country.peña canal replied,you treating me like a slave.you not paying me.you not paying me.and besides that,you broke my radio.dann countered,this is my house.in my house,i can do whatever i want.
a few days later,dann told her mother in front of peña canal that peña canal had no rights since here in the united states,the illegal people do even have as much as medi cal.they die here.then dann ordered peña canal to sign a letter that stated that dann had paid her minimum wage in california.the agreement stated in full 
i,zoraida peña,have received from mabelle dann the minimum wage in the state of california starting on july,for the care of her children names omitted home from school at to.in addition,i receive lodging.i occupy the entire living room for a value of in rent.and food,breakfast,lunch,food sic and dinner every day.
in addition to this,i have received some clothes items and gifts from members of mabelle family.perfumes,clothes items,shoes,jackets,pants,et cetera.i have received a yearly total of.
peña canal testified that she signed the letter,knowing that its contents were false.
at trial,the prosecutor asked peña canal why she had stayed with dann peña canal answered i she did trust anybody and had nowhere to go ii dann had her passport iii dann was making false accusations against her that she was taking her money and iv the children were her responsibility.
peña canal departure 
peña canal had made friends at the twins school when she went to pick them up.although she did not speak english,there were a few at the school,including the school custodian,anselma soto soto.peña canal told him about her working conditions,that she had not been paid,and that she was not allowed to talk to anyone.eventually peña canal began keeping some of her belongings with soto in an envelope at the school.she also became friends with a gardener,miguel lopez lopez.she told him that she was afraid to leave work because dann was accusing her,saying that she was going to report her to immigration,that she was illegal and that she could be in this country.another mother at the school,amy oz oz began giving peña canal rides to and from school.she spoke a little spanish,and peña canal told her that she would get in trouble if she was found talking with her.in march of,oz contacted la raza centro legal,an organization that assists domestic workers,on peña canal behalf.
soto,lopez,and oz helped peña canal leave on april.peña canal dropped the children off at the school.she then went through the school kitchen and hid in a car that was driven to a safe house.oz was responsible for calling dann to tell her that she would need to pick up her children herself and that she should pick up a letter from peña canal at the school.the letter contained keys to dann apartment and asked dann to return peña canal passport and peruvian identification.
when dann got to the school and read the letter,she became hysterical.she said that peña canal had taken everything she had emptied dann house,taken the keys,all her jewelry and all her money.dann later told oz that peña canal had been a terrible nanny who had stolen her jewelry.on april,dann her sister and said,zoraida escaped,got away,left.but at least she was here for two years.but i realized from the day she got here that she wanted to look for another job.
meanwhile,peña canal met with a lawyer from la raza centro legal,the immigration advocacy group with whom oz had spoken on her behalf.she had told oz that she wanted to stay in the united states.la raza contacted ice and reported peña canal situation.upon ice recommendation,peña canal was granted a t visa pursuant to a t i i requiring that the victim cooperate in the prosecution of the trafficker.
peña canal also filed a civil suit against dann and her mother,vittett,seeking civil,punitive and other damages.peña canal was granted a default judgment and in compensatory and punitive damages.canal dann,wl,at.
passport and identification papers 
dann never returned peña canal passport or peruvian identification.a police officer testified that he went to the apartment on peña canal behalf to ask for these papers.dann was not present but called him back later.she denied having any documents,denied knowing what he was talking about,and denied having any property that belonged to peña canal.
in june of,ice agents searched dann apartment.they found peña canal passport,her peruvian identification card,and checks for a bank account in her name,along with the agreement that dann had forced her to sign about minimum wage,all buried under clothing in a drawer in dann room.
ii.procedural background 
on june,dann was charged in a indictment with harboring an illegal alien for purpose of private financial gain,in violation of a a iii and b i.on february,the government filed a superceding indictment,charging dann with five counts i conspiracy to commit visa fraud in violation of and a ii visa fraud in violation of a iii forced labor and attempted forced labor in violation of and iv document servitude in violation of and v harboring an illegal alien for private financial gain in violation of a a iii and b i.
after a jury trial,dann was convicted on all five counts.during deliberations,the jury asked four questions.one question was about visa fraud.the other questions were about the forced labor charge.
the district court instructed the jury that forced labor has three elements that dann obtained or attempted to obtain the labor or services of peña canal by means of a scheme,plan or pattern intended to cause peña canal to believe that,if she did not perform such labor or services,she or another person would suffer serious harm and that dann acted knowingly.the jury asked,must the charge of forced labor apply to the entire duration of peña canal service,or can it be applied only to a portion of the time the district court answered,it need not apply to the entire duration of peña canal service.it could be applied to only a portion of the time.
the jury also asked,is the duration of time relevant to determining serious harm the district court answered,yes,the duration of time is relevant.a harm that might be serious if it happened for only a short that might not be serious if it happened for a short time might be serious if it went on for a very long time.shortly after this instruction,the jury returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty on all five counts.
on october,dann filed a motion for judgment of acquittal motion for new trial.dann had also made an oral motion for a judgment of acquittal after the government rested and at the close of all the evidence.the district court denied these motions in a written order on december.united states dann,wl.
on april,the district court sentenced dann to months on each count,to run concurrently.the court also ordered restitution in the amount of,payable to peña canal.as part of this restitution,the district court ordered that any accrued child support payable to dann while she is incarcerated be paid directly to peña canal.
dann filed a notice of appeal on april.on april,she filed a motion under federal rule of criminal procedure a to correct the sentence on the grounds that the district court erred when it ordered accrued child support to be paid to the victim.the district court denied this motion on july.united states dann,wl.july.
dann appeals her conviction and sentence.we address each in turn below.
conviction 
standard of review 
dann argues on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction for forced labor,document servitude,and harboring an illegal alien for financial gain.the court reviews the district court denial of a motion for acquittal de novo.see,united states carranza,cir.
the court asks whether,a fter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson,at.the analysis requires two steps first,the court reviews the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution then,the court determines whether the evidence,so construed,would allow any rational trier of fact to find the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.see,united states nevils,cir en banc.the nevils court cautioned 
this means that a court of appeals may not usurp the role of the finder of fact by considering how it would have resolved the conflicts,made the inferences,or considered the evidence at trial.rather,when faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences a reviewing court must presume even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution,and must defer to that resolution.
id.quotation marks and citations omitted.
nevertheless,dann will prevail if,once all of the evidence has been construed in favor of the government,the evidence is still so supportive of innocence that no rational juror could conclude that the government proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
ii.discussion 
dann argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for three of the five crimes for which she was convicted forced labor,document servitude,and alien harboring for financial gain.we consider each in turn.
forced labor 
first,dann argues that she should be acquitted of forced labor because there was insufficient evidence that she intended to threaten serious harm.
the federal forced labor statute,a,provides 
a whoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of a person by any one of,or by any combination of,the following means 
by means of force,threats of force,physical restraint,or threats of physical restraint to that person or another person 
by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or another person 
by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process 
by means of any scheme,plan,or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that,if that person did not perform such labor or services,that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint,
shall be punished as provided under subsection d.
the government limited this case to the fourth means of violating the forced labor statute,and the court instructed 
if you find that dann obtained the labor or services of peña canal,then you must determine whether she did so by means of a scheme,plan,or pattern intended to cause peña canal to believe that,if she did not perform such labor or services,she or another person would suffer serious harm.
the court then defined serious harm exactly as described in the statute,which includes physical or nonphysical harm,including psychological,financial or reputational harm.c.the jury convicted on this count.
dann does not challenge the instruction.rather she argues that her relationship with peña canal does not fit within the forced labor statute and that the evidence presented was insufficient to support the conviction as a matter of law.
serious harm under 
the acts proved by the government in this case are well within the scope of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of,stat.legislative history suggests that congress passed this act to correct what they viewed as the supreme court mistaken holding in united states kozminski.kozminski limited the definition of involuntary servitude to physical or legal coercion.id.at.in,congress intended to reach cases in which persons are held in a condition of servitude through nonviolent coercion.victims of trafficking and violence protection act of b.
congress concluded that the means used by traffickers are increasingly subtle,at,wl,at.and therefore defines harm broadly as 
any harm,whether physical or nonphysical,including psychological,financial,or reputational harm,that is sufficiently serious,under all the surrounding circumstances,to compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing labor or services in order to avoid incurring that harm.
c.in other words,someone is guilty of forced labor if he intends to cause a person in his employ to believe that if she does not continue to work,she will suffer the type of serious harm physical or nonphysical,including psychological,financial,reputation harm that would compel someone in her circumstances to continue working to avoid that harm.see,united states calimlim,cir finding threat to stop paying victim poor family members constitutes serious harm.
to be sure,not all bad relationships or even bad nanny relationships will constitute forced labor.first,the threat of harm must be serious.congress intended to address serious trafficking,or cases where traffickers threaten harm to third persons,restrain their victims without physical violence or injury,or threaten dire consequences by means other than overt violence,at.according to the statute,the threat,considered from the vantage point of a reasonable person in the place of the victim,must be sufficiently serious to compel that person to remain.see c.
second,the scope of the statute is narrowed by the requirement of scienter.calimlim,at.the jury must find that the employer intended to cause the victim to believe that she would suffer serious harm from the vantage point of the victim if she did not continue to work.while the serious harm need not be effectuated at the defendant hand,the statute requires that the plan be intended to cause the victim to believe that that harm will befall her.id.internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted.the linchpin of the serious harm analysis under is not just that serious harm was threatened but that the employer intended the victim to believe that such harm would befall her.
evidence of intent 
here,dann argues that there was insufficient evidence that she intended to make peña canal believe that she would suffer serious harm if she were to stop working for dann.the government counters that the evidence supports dann intent to have peña canal believe i that she would not be paid back wages for close to two years of work and in fact would owe dann for expenses already paid ii that dann would falsely accuse her of wrongdoing and cause reputational harm iii that peña canal would suffer immigration consequences because she would either not be able to leave the country at all since dann held her passport and papers or she would be sent back to peru and would not have the opportunity to study in the united states and iv that the children for whom she cared would be taken from their mother 
while we consider each of these harms separately below,we are to ask whether,from the vantage point of an immigrant in peña canal position,these harms taken together were sufficiently serious so as to compel her to remain in dann employ.
financial harm 
first,dann argues that there was insufficient evidence that dann intended peña canal to believe that she would suffer serious financial harm if she were to leave.dann points out that peña canal never testified that dann told her that she would not be paid back wages.that may well be true,but the inference was clear.dann told peña canal that she would owe money if she left.after one argument,dann said,i giving you a chance to be here in this country.i going to buy your ticket right now.but first,i going to figure out our accounts.and then she concluded that peña canal owed her a total of,of which only had been worked off.on another occasion,when peña canal told dann to send her home,dann began to calculate the cost of clothes that she had purchased for peña canal.
moreover,as the district court pointed out,dann made peña canal sign a note stating that she had been paid minimum wage.the district court found this fact persuasive 
the jury could make three reasonable inferences from this note when considered in conjunction with defendant false promises to pay peña canal and the debt defendant imposed on peña canal defendant had no intention of paying peña canal,defendant had a consciousness of guilt for not paying peña canal so she wanted to preserve the note to guard against any possible future charges and defendant wanted peña canal to be aware that defendant would keep this note to deter her from trying to enforce her rights.
dann,wl,at.we agree.
we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find that dann intended peña canal to believe that peña canal would suffer financial harm and that that financial harm was sufficiently serious within the meaning of the statute.for an immigrant without access to a bank account and not a dollar to her name,a juror could conclude that the failure to pay her and thus the lack of money to leave or live was sufficiently serious to compel peña canal to continue working 
reputational harm 
second,dann argues that there was insufficient evidence that dann intended that peña canal believe that peña canal would suffer reputational harm if she were to leave.again,dann points out that peña canal never testified that dann told her that she would call peña canal a thief if she left or that dann would tell people back in peru that she was untrustworthy.but here again,we are to draw every inference in favor of the guilty verdict.
the jury heard evidence that dann falsely accused peña canal of theft on four occasions.the jury could reasonably conclude that dann intended peña canal to believe that she would in fact falsely accuse her when she left.and in fact that fear was realized when dann read peña canal letter,she told everyone within earshot at the school that peña canal was a thief who had robbed her and taken everything she had.
immigration harm 
there was also evidence that dann intended peña canal to fear immigration harm.as the seventh circuit articulated in calimlim,a victim has fewer means of escape where the threats in her case involve immigration.at noting that the immigrant victim did not have an exit option because the threats in her case involved her immigration status,she could not freely work for another employer in order to escape the threatened harm.
while dann never explicitly threatened deportation,she did repeatedly threaten to send peña canal back to peru.that threat alone to be forced to leave the country could constitute serious harm to an immigrant who came to the united states in part to study english and who dreamed of starting a business.see united states djoumessi,cir noting that the defendant threats to send victim back to cameroon were coercive in light of the victim special vulnerability as illegal immigrant.dann also had custody of peña canal passport and peruvian identification peña canal testified that she stayed in part because dann held her papers.and in fact,when she did leave,the only request she made of dann in her closing letter was the return of her peruvian passport and identification.
thus the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution,suggests that dann intended to inspire two related immigration fears in peña canal that she would be forced to leave the country or that she would not be able to leave the country because she had no documents.both threats are serious,and this exercise of control is further evidence of scienter.and in fact dann used the word escape to describe peña canal eventual departure a juror could reasonably have concluded that dann intended to keep peña canal in fear of serious immigration consequences.
harm to the children 
finally,there was evidence to suggest that dann intended peña canal to fear what would happen to the children if she were to leave.such a fear is squarely within the intent of congress,which enacted to address traffickers who use more subtle means designed to cause their victims to believe that serious harm will result to themselves or others if they leave,as when a nanny is led to believe that the children in her care will be harmed if she leaves the home,at.emphasis added.
peña canal testified that she did not leave because she worried about what would happen to the children.in february of,dann told her,
you should you should think that i treating you like a slave,you should think that i treating you like a slave.i going to pay you.i do want for you to leave me because i do know what would happen to my children.where would i keep them the government would take them from me.
there are two reasonable interpretations dann may have been apologizing for not paying peña canal and pleading with her to stay so that she would not lose her children.alternatively,dann may have been threatening that the children would suffer if peña canal were to leave exactly the type of coercion that congress envisioned.again,drawing all inferences in favor of the verdict,we must assume that the jury came to the latter conclusion.a juror could conclude that a reasonable person in peña canal position that is,a nanny who had cared for three boys from infancy would feel compelled to stay on account of such a threat.
in sum,a reasonable juror could have concluded that dann intended to cause peña canal to believe that she would suffer financial,reputational,and immigration harms,as well as cause harm to dann children.such a juror could further conclude that the sum of these threatened harms would have compelled a reasonable person in peña canal position to continue to work for dann.having determined that there was sufficient evidence to support dann conviction for forced labor,we affirm the district court denial of dann rule a motion on this ground.
document servitude 
dann also challenges her conviction for document servitude,which arises out of her forced labor conviction.document servitude occurs where a defendant knowingly conceals,removes,confiscates,or possesses any actual or purported passport or other immigration document of another person in the course of trafficking,peonage,slavery,involuntary servitude or forced labor.a.the district court instructed the jury on the three elements of this crime as follows 
first,dann concealed,removed,confiscated,or possessed peña canal passport or other immigration document or government identification document.second,such acts were undertaken in the course of committing or with the intent to commit the crime of forced labor.third,that dann acted knowingly in doing such an act or acts.
dann challenges the second element.
dann first argues that there was insufficient evidence that she had any intent to commit forced labor,an argument we have already rejected.second,dann argues that even if she had the intent to commit forced labor,she did not keep peña canal documents in order to commit that offense.she notes that peña canal testified that she gave her documents to dann because she did not have any safe place to put them she did not testify that she looked for the documents or that she asked dann to give them back to her.indeed,this case stands in contrast to other document servitude cases where the passports were kept in a locked drawer,or where an employer confiscated documents upon arrival.see,united states sabhnani,cir united states farrell,cir.
the statute,however,requires merely that the defendant possess the document,not that the defendant lock it up.u.a.here,the jury heard evidence that when the police asked dann for the papers on peña canal behalf,she claimed that she did not have them.they heard evidence that the documents were ultimately found alongside the note about minimum wage,buried under clothes in a drawer.
again,there are two stories.dann may have kept the passport for safe keeping and may have genuinely believed that she did not have it when the police asked.alternatively,she may have hid the passport in a place where peña canal likely would not have found it,along with the false minimum wage note,in order to prevent peña canal from leaving.construing all inferences in favor of the verdict,we must assume the latter.a rational juror could have concluded that dann possessed and concealed peña canal passport as part of her plan to cause peña canal to believe that she could not leave,or that she would suffer serious harm if she did.
we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support dann conviction for document servitude and affirm the district court denial of dann a motion on this ground as well.
alien harboring for financial gain 
finally,dann challenges her conviction for alien harboring for financial gain.the district court instructed the jury that to convict dann on this count,it had to find 
first,that peña canal was an alien.second,peña canal had come to,entered,or remained unlawfully in the united states.third,dann knew or was in reckless disregard of the fact that peña canal had come to,entered,or remained unlawfully in the united states.fourth,dann concealed,harbored,or shielded peña canal for the purpose of avoiding peña canal detection by the immigration authorities.and fifth,dann concealed,harbored,or shielded peña canal for the purpose of private financial gain.
dann challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the fourth element.
as a preliminary matter,the parties disagree as to whether the government had to prove that dann harbored peña canal to prevent detection by immigration authorities.the government argues that according to united states acosta de evans,harboring does not require that the defendant actively take steps to hide the alien from immigration authorities it is sufficient that the defendant provided the alien with shelter for financial gain,cir.
although the government is correct,the jury was instructed on a different standard specifically,it was asked whether dann concealed,harbored,or shielded peña canal for the purpose of avoiding peña canal detection by the immigration authorities.to convict dann,according to this instruction,the jury had to find that she expressly shielded her from immigration authorities,not just that she gave her shelter.dann argues,and we agree,that this court is bound by that instruction.see chiarella united states,we can not affirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury.mccormick,at.
the district court found,based on this standard,that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that dann shielded peña canal for the purpose of avoiding detection by immigration authorities.dann restricted peña canal movement and forbade her from speaking to anyone outside the home.dann even asked the manager of the apartment complex to tell the staff not to talk to peña canal.dann repeatedly reminded peña canal of her illegal status and asked if peña canal was scared when she talked to a police officer.whenever peña canal came into the house,dann or her mother would ask if she had spoken to anyone.
dann contends that this story is more consistent with someone who did not want her good employee to be poached.that interpretation is plausible,but it is not the only one.the same evidence suggests that dann was harboring peña canal from immigration authorities.and that inference is more plausible given the fact that dann,herself,was implicated in the visa fraud.
we conclude therefore that there was sufficient evidence to support dann conviction for alien harboring for financial gain,and affirm the district court denial of dann rule a motion on this final claim.
sentencing 
in addition to challenging her conviction,dann challenges the district court sentencing guideline calculation and the restitution order that required her to sign over to the victim any payments made by her toward accrued child support.

ii.discussion 
guidelines enhancements 
the district court accepted the guidelines calculation in dann pre sentence report psr,which calculated dann offense at a base level of,her criminal history as category i,with the resulting guidelines prison range of to months.the probation officer recommended,and the court agreed,to a prison term of months under,based on her behavioral and mental health issues the district court did not comment on the three contested enhancements to which the defendant objected at sentencing.
dann argues on appeal that the district court erred in applying the following guidelines enhancements to her sentence for visa fraud,a enhancement for committing visa fraud with reason to believe that the visa would be used to facilitate a felony and for forced labor,a enhancement for holding a victim in document servitude for over a year and a enhancement for committing a felony visa fraud in connection with forced labor.we consider each in turn.
visa fraud enhancement 
visa fraud falls under of the sentencing guidelines manual,which governs trafficking in a document relating to naturalization,citizenship,or legal resident status,or a united states passport false statement in respect to the citizenship or immigration status of another.the base offense level under this guideline is eleven and includes an enhancement of four levels i f the defendant knew,believed,or had reason to believe that a passport or visa was to be used to facilitate the commission of a felony offense,other than an offense involving violation of the immigration laws.b.in the psr,the probation officer reasoned that the defendant had reason to believe that the visa would facilitate her conduct that rose to a felony,unlawful conduct regarding documents in furtherance of servitude.dann argues that the trial court erred in imposing this enhancement because the crime of document servitude identified by the probation officer is an offense involving violation of the immigration laws and is thus excepted by the clear language of the guidelines.
we need not reach this argument.dann base offense level of was driven by the forced labor offense and not visa fraud.an enhancement on visa fraud would not affect the guideline range,and therefore any error would be harmless united states munoz camarena,cir.
forced labor enhancements 
next,dann challenges the guideline enhancements to her base offense level on the forced labor conviction.sentencing for forced labor is governed by of the sentencing guidelines manual,for peonage,involuntary servitude,slave trade,and child soldiers.the base level is.the offense may be subject to a enhancement i f any victim was held in a condition of peonage or involuntary servitude for more than one year.b and an additional enhancement i f any other felony offense was committed during the commission of,or in connection with,the peonage or involuntary servitude offense,id.b.here,the district court applied both of these enhancements over dann objections.
this court reviews a district court factual findings in support of a sentencing enhancement for clear error.united states rivera alonzo,cir citation omitted.reversal for clear error requires a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake.rodriguez united states,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
a.more than one year 
dann argues that the evidence before the district court failed to show that she had held peña canal in forced labor for more than one year,or from at least april,until her escape on april.she contends that the evidence supported forced labor for a much shorter period.the government closing argument focused on the beginning of when dann conduct was at its worst.and in fact,the jury asked whether the charge of forced labor had to apply to the entire duration of peña canal service.the question may suggest that the jury believed that peña canal was not subject to forced labor for the entire time that she resided with dann.
to be sure,the government evidence indicated that the worst of dann bad behavior occurred in or after january.it was at that time that dann told peña canal that she owed.thereafter,dann became increasingly controlling and abusive,ultimately physically accosting peña canal.dann then forced peña canal to sign the agreement stating that she had been paid minimum wage.
nevertheless,there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to find by a preponderance of the evidence that peña canal was subject to forced labor prior to april.she testified that dann began to restrict her movement by january of and forbade her from leaving the apartment without her permission.she told peña canal not to talk to anybody,not to reveal anything about us,do tell anybody anything.dann even told the property manager of the apartment complex to order personnel not to talk with peña canal.
sometime in the winter of,dann also began restricting peña canal food intake,forbidding her from eating fruit and drinking tea without permission and eventually weighing the meat and counting the eggs and bread.it was in february of that dann told peña canal 
you should you should think that i treating you like a slave,you should think that i treating you like a slave.i going to pay you.i do want for you to leave me because i do know what would happen to my children.where would i keep them the government would take them from me.
the district court could have reasonably concluded that dann already knew the implications of her conduct with peña canal that she was in fact treating her like a slave.by april of,peña canal had already foregone eight months in unpaid wages that she risked losing if she were to leave.
we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it found that peña canal had been held in forced labor for over one year and therefore affirm the district court guideline enhancement.
felony in connection with forced labor 
finally,dann challenges the sentencing enhancement for committing another felony during the commission of,or in connection with forced labor under b of the sentencing guidelines manual.the district court adopted the psr,which suggested that dann committed the felony of visa fraud in connection with the forced labor.dann argues that at the time that she committed visa fraud,she had no intention of committing forced labor.these crimes,she argues,are entirely unrelated.
section b of the sentencing guidelines manual provides in full 
if any other felony offense was committed during the commission of,or in connection with,the peonage or involuntary servitude offense,increase to the greater of 
a plus the offense level as determined above,or 
b plus the offense guideline applicable to that other offense,but in no event greater than level.
the first step in our analysis is to determine what it means to commit a crime in connection with forced labor under b.this is a matter of first impression,as the commentary in this section does not define the term and no court has interpreted the language of this enhancement.
there is,however,an analogous provision in the offense guideline for unlawful possession of a firearm,b 
if the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense,increase by levels.
emphasis added.the commentary of b states that possession of a firearm in connection with another felony applies if the firearm or ammunition facilitated,or had the potential of facilitating,another felony offense or another offense,respectively.cmt.
clearly,the drafters must be held to define terms consistently throughout the guidelines.thus in connection with must mean facilitation.in the forced labor context,a felony is committed in connection with forced labor where that crime facilitates or has the potential of facilitating forced labor or conversely where forced labor facilitates or has the potential of facilitating another felony offense.in this case,it is clear that the visa fraud facilitated the forced labor.indeed,as we have explained,dann used peña canal illegal immigration status to intimidate her,to cause her to fear deportation or to fear the risk of leaving without documentation.this evidence is sufficient to show that dann committed forced labor in connection with visa fraud.
dann,however,suggests that according to our holding in united states jimison,in connection with requires an additional element of intent,cir.she argues that the enhancement applies only where the defendant commits the first felony either forced labor or the other crime with the intent to commit the other.this argument is unavailing.in jimison,we interpreted the second half of b the enhancement that applies where a defendant possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.b.we held that,to prove the application of this enhancement,the government must provide sufficient evidence that when the defendant came into possession of the firearm,he had a firm intent to use it to commit a felony.jimison,at.the intent requirement was drawn directly from the language of the enhancement requiring knowledge,intent,or reason to believe.there is no comparable intent language in the forced labor guideline under,and we can not read intent into the provision.
we conclude therefore that a felony is committed in connection with forced labor where it facilitates or is facilitated by the offense of forced labor.and because in this case visa fraud facilitated dann commission of forced labor,the district court guideline enhancement is affirmed.
restitution order 
finally,we turn to the district court restitution order.at sentencing,the court ordered dann to pay in restitution and required that any payments made by dann toward back child support that he owes shall be signed over to the victim as payment towards restitution.dann filed a motion under federal rule of criminal procedure a to correct the sentence on the grounds that the district court erred when it ordered accrued child support to be paid to peña canal.the district court denied the rule a motion 
on appeal,dann argues that the district court erred by assigning a debt that did not belong to dann but rather to her minor children,who are now sixteen,ten,and ten years old respectively.this court reviews legal issues regarding a restitution order de novo.foreman,at.
the mandatory victims restitution act requires that a district court consider three factors before ordering restitution a the financial resources and other assets of the defendant,including whether any of these assets are jointly controlled b projected earnings and other income of the defendant and c any financial obligations of the defendant including obligations to dependents.f a c.any restitution order under this section may be enforced only as against property that is the defendant own according to the relevant state law.see,united states berger,cir in re ramirez,cir the determination of child support rights is a matter of state statutory and common law,superseded by statute as recognized in in re leibowitz,cir.
the question before the court is whether child support arrearages belong to dann such that they may be assigned to the victim by a restitution order,or whether the arrearage actually belongs to her children.this is a matter of first impression.
as a general rule,a parent obligation to pay child support runs to the child,rather than to the other parent,and the parent,to whom such support is paid,is but a mere conduit for the disbursement of that support.williams williams,d.indeed,the equities between the parents do not alter the child support obligation.comer,cal th.
we acknowledge california authority recognizing that when a custodial parent has expended her own resources,she may recover the accrued child support for her own benefit,and that that right of reimbursement may be assigned in certain circumstances.see,e,in re marriage of utigard,d,cal.welf.a requiring the assignment of child support arrearages to the state where the state has dispersed cash assistance to the child.
the california supreme court holdings in in re marriage of damico and comer,however,suggest that even the assignable right of reimbursement to the custodial parent is superceded if reimbursement is sought when the children are minors.in re marriage of damico,cal th comer,cal th at.for example,the damico court held that a custodial parent is estopped from bringing a claim for accrued child support if she concealed the children from the parent when the children were minors.damico,cal th at.in comer,however,this holding was limited to cases where the custodial parent brings a suit after the children have reached majority.cal th at.a custodial parent may sue for accrued child support even if she previously concealed the child,so long as the child is not yet an adult.id.comer thus seems to suggest that accrued payments belong to the child until adulthood.
the comer court explained that 
t his distinction regarding the child age is a significant one,because,in contrast to most adults,children particularly those in their early years in fairness can not be expected to raise themselves and pursue an education without the financial support of responsible adults the child need for sustenance must be the paramount consideration.
id.at quotation marks and citation omitted.if child support has not been paid for a period of time,it is likely that the child needs were met at only a minimal level.id.at.thus,a child may have accrued needs,including educational expenses or cultural opportunities,that may be met by an accrued child support payment,and these needs trump the custodial parent entitlement to reimbursement.
read together,damico and comer suggest that so long as the children have not reached majority,a custodial parent remains the conduit for child support even accrued child support.we therefore conclude that under california law,a creditor in this case a crime victim with a restitution order is not entitled to accrued child support payments owed to a custodial parent of children who have not yet reached the age of majority.
in re estate of spirtos,cir,is not to the contrary.in a footnote,this court noted that u nder california law,the custodial parent,not the child,has the beneficial interest in collecting arrearages in child support.id.quoting cnty.of shasta smith,and citing in re marriage of lackey,d,and utigard,d at.spirtos,shasta and lackey cite utigard for the proposition that a child is not the real party of interest in accrued child support.spirtos,at shasta.at lackey,d at.
utigard,however,involved adult children interest in collecting child support arrearages.d at mary lou and four of her adult children appeal from the judgment.emphasis added.in utigard,the court addressed a property dispute after a divorce.the plaintiff conveyed their marital home to his new wife in an attempt to avoid a writ of execution for then accrued child support.when the plaintiff eventually filed an action under the uniform fraudulent conveyance act five years later,the trial court found that the statute of limitations had run.because her children who were minors at the time of the conveyance were not barred by the statute of limitations,she attempted to have the writ of execution issued in their names.in a very narrow ruling,the utigard court found that the now adult children had no interest in the accrued child support.id.at.
the utigard court noted that in this case no issue was tendered concerning the present or future needs of the children,nor any issue concerning the relation of the unpaid support to the children needs.d at.they declined to reach the question under what conditions the children might be deemed the beneficiaries of arrearages in child support similarly,they did not decide how to resolve a dispute between parent and child as to entitlement to arrearages.id.at.
indeed,the holding in utigard seems to hinge precisely on the fact that the case did not involve minor children who needed funds.throughout the case law,california courts are guided by a fundamental principle in any proceedings involving custody and support it is axiomatic that the court should always adopt the course that is for the best int
