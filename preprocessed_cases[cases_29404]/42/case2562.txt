hor is an algerian with a technical background who before coming to the united states on a visitor visa in was the chief information officer for a large manufacturer.he was also an active member of the fln,the ruling political party of algeria.in march of he was stopped at a roadblock set up by members of gia groupe islamique arm√©,the military wing of the radical islamic movement that is engaged in what amounts to a civil war with the algerian government.ahmed ashcroft,cir debab ins,cir state department,country report on algeria state department,report on human rights practices in algeria state department,fact sheet on foreign terrorist organizations,http.htm central intelligence agency,world fact book on algeria.html amnesty international,algeria fleeing a continuing human rights crisis,june.taken at gunpoint before a leader of the gia,hor was ordered to furnish the organization with a list of active members of the fln and with the security plan of his employer.he was released after promising to comply.he did comply,but instead reported the incident forthwith to the algerian military,which told him that it could protect everyone threatened by the an army veteran,as hor was.it gave him some advice on how to avoid falling into the gia clutches.
five months later,hor was stopped at another gia roadblock.armed men ordered him to lie down on the ground and told him they were going to execute him on the spot in retaliation for his having failed to supply the gia with the promised information.hor uncle,like him an active member of the fln,had been killed just this way a year earlier.but the police had received a tip about the roadblock,arrived just in time,killed two of the armed men,and saved hor.shortly afterwards,following a visit to a psychiatrist who diagnosed hor as suffering from stress syndrome,and also following the issuance of a decision by an algerian court that recommend ed that hor should be extra cautious and keep low profile,hor left algeria for the united states.
he claims that he was persecuted in algeria on account of his political activity and is at high risk of further persecution if he returns.his testimony,if believed,established persecution.compare ins,d ahmed ashcroft,supra,at.the immigration judge,seconded by the board of immigration appeals,rejected the claim.the judge believed hor testimony about his involvement with the political party,and his genuine fear of harm,but not about his encounters with the gia.the judge did think the gia would have allowed five months to elapse from the first encounter before trying to kill hor for breaking his promise to give the group information the court,the immigration judge believes they would have approached the respondent or harmed the respondent long before five months have passed.the judge also did believe that,given hor status as a veteran and the sensitive information he possessed because of his job,the algerian military would have refused to protect him against the gia or that the gia could have known that the second roadblock would intercept him,because he was traveling to a seminar when he was stopped rather than to or from work.the judge thought that if hor story were true,the gia would have killed members of hor family in revenge,which it has not done.
he noted further that hor had failed to submit newspaper accounts or other documentary records of the at the second roadblock.he also thought it suspicious that the psychiatrist report did not mention the cause of hor stress syndrome.he could not fully comprehend the purpose of the algerian court decision recommending that the respondent be extra cautious and keep a low profile.the respondent himself was fully aware that he should keep a low profile and be very cautious,and he did not need the court to tell him that he should be cautious.
the judge thought that in any event hor lacked a fear of further persecution should he be returned to algeria because he was not harmed for five months by the gia after he had promised them to provide the information requested,and when he needed help,he was able to go to his government and seek their assistance assistance that included the killing of the two assailants at the second roadblock.he was also able to seek assistance from a court in algeria.
it is conceivable that the evidence on which the immigration judge based his determination that hor was exaggerating his persecution by the gia really does show this,but that would depend on a knowledge of conditions in algeria nowhere indicated in the opinion,a common failing in asylum adjudications.iao gonzales,cir.it is hardly that the gia never allows five months to elapse before mounting an assault against someone who has refused to play ball with it.the group would have needed some time to realize that hor was not going to furnish the promised information,and more time to organize an assault with a fair chance of success.it would be no surprise,either,if the gia had penetrated the company where hor worked and learned from its mole where hor would be on the day they tried to kill him.
algeria has a censored press,and the immigration judge offered no reason for believing that the incident at the second roadblock would have been allowed to be reported,or even that it had been witnessed,other than by the police,the gia thugs,and of whom might well have decided against reporting the incident to the media.and again one would have to know a lot about algeria and the gia to know whether the failure to seek revenge against members of hor family,none of whom was active in the fln,as he had been,would be out of character.
that a psychiatrist would not mention a terrorist incident in a psychiatric diagnosis seems hardly anomalous and the authenticity of the admittedly quite strange judicial decision is not challenged.in short,there is no reasoned basis for the immigration judge conclusion,which was based not on hor demeanor on the stand but on the unsubstantiated conjectures,summarized above,on which the judge based his assessment of hor credibility.such a ruling can not stand.mamedov ashcroft,cir guchshenkov ashcroft,cir ins,cir ins,cir.
the government points to the recently enacted real id act of,which provides that no court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact in a removal case with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence unless the court finds that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.b.all that this means is that an immigration judge determination that if there were evidence to corroborate the alien testimony the alien could and should have presented it is entitled to reasonable deference.the precondition to deference is that the immigration judge explain unless it is obvious why he thinks corroborating evidence,if it existed,would have been available to the alien.gontcharova ashcroft,cir zheng gonzales,cir gonzales,cir abdulai ashcroft,cir diallo ins,cir.
the judge criticized hor failure to provide newspaper articles,or affidavits from his,to corroborate his story of the roadblock and the gun battle,and also hor failure to submit the documents he had filed with the algerian court in order to obtain that odd court order.the judge concluded that some of these incidents which are central to the respondent claim either have been exaggerated or have not been supported by corroborating evidence when it was available and could have been obtained.but the immigration judg
