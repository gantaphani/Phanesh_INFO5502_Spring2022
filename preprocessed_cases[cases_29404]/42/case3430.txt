introduction 
gustavo adolfo suchite casasola suchite,a guatemalan citizen,appeals his conviction and sentence for illegal reentry into the united states after removal,in violation of.suchite challenges the validity of his underlying removal,contending that he is a citizen.suchite argues that he automatically derived citizenship upon his father naturalization in,when suchite was fourteen.at that time,the controlling statute granted automatic derivative citizenship to children of married parents only when both parents naturalized before the child eighteenth birthday.suchite mother,married to suchite father at all relevant times,did not naturalize until suchite was.the district court,therefore,correctly ruled suchite was not a citizen.our law in drew a distinction between children whose parents were legally separated,and those,like suchite,whose parents were married.see a.had suchite parents been legally separated,or had the law now in effect been in effect before suchite turned eighteen,then he would have automatically derived citizenship upon his father naturalization.suchite principal argument on appeal is that the former statutory distinction between married and legally separated parents is irrational and hence a denial of equal protection.the government counters that the distinction has a rational basis in protecting the parental rights of a,custodial parent.we have already recognized this to be a rational basis in barthelemy ashcroft,cir.we accordingly enforce the statute as it is written and affirm the conviction because suchite did not obtain derivative citizenship when his father alone was naturalized before suchite turned eighteen.
suchite further contends that the statute also denies equal protection in permitting automatic derivative citizenship when one parent having joint custody is naturalized,but not when one married parent is naturalized.we agree that result would be irrational,but follow the fifth circuit in holding the statute does not permit it.see bustamante barrera gonzales,cir.in order to confer automatic derivative citizenship in,the custodial parent,upon naturalization,was required to have sole legal custody.
we also affirm the sentence.the guideline amendment upon which suchite relies is not retroactive.see united states urena,cir.
ii.factual and statutory background 
factual background 
suchite was born in guatemala on february,to guatemalan parents.his parents were then and still are married.suchite father immigrated to the united states two years after suchite birth,and suchite mother followed one year later.both of his parents found employment in the united states and were able to send money home to their children.
on july,when suchite was twelve years old,he and his siblings were lawfully admitted into the united states on immigrant visas.on december,when suchite was fourteen,his father became a naturalized citizen.suchite turned eighteen on february.at that time,suchite mother was not yet a citizen.
in february,a california court convicted suchite of possessing methamphetamine for sale,in violation of california health safety code section,and sentenced him to months of probation and days in county jail.while on probation in,suchite was convicted of receiving stolen property and sentenced to a jail term.his probation for the methamphetamine conviction was revoked,and he was sentenced to two years in county jail,to be served concurrently with the sentence in his conviction.because of his criminal activity,suchite was removed from the united states on february,after his release from custody.he soon returned to the united states and was removed again on may.
the events leading up to the present case occurred on july,when police arrested suchite in california for using a controlled substance in violation of california health safety code section a.suchite was transferred to the administrative custody of the immigration and customs enforcement,and then prosecuted under,as an illegal alien found in the united states following removal.
suchite filed a motion to dismiss the criminal information.he argued that a,the statute which governed derivative citizenship before he turned eighteen,denied him his equal protection rights by discriminating against children of married parents.he argued that there was no rational basis for granting derivative citizenship to the child of legally separated parents upon the naturalization of only one parent,but denying derivative citizenship to the child of married parents in the same circumstances.
the district court denied suchite motion to dismiss,finding that there was a rational basis for congress decision to tie derivative citizenship to the naturalization of both parents if married and to the naturalization of the custodial parent if legally separated.following the district court denial,suchite entered a conditional guilty plea,preserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court placed suchite in criminal history category iv,with a sentencing guideline range of months.the district court imposed a month sentence.suchite would have been in category iii,with a sentencing guideline range of months,but for the inclusion of two recency criminal history points under e.while his case was on direct appeal,the sentencing commission amended the guidelines,deleting the recency points provision.supp.appx,amend.effective,amendment.suchite now asks us to remand to the district court for resentencing in light of amendment.
statutory background 
to answer the principal equal protection argument raised by suchite in challenging his conviction,it is necessary to understand both the statutory scheme that governed automatic derivative citizenship before suchite turned eighteen,and the statutory scheme that went into effect days after suchite eighteenth birthday.
the law that controls this case was the law in effect before suchite turned eighteen.see romero mendoza holder,wl,at cir,quoting minasyan gonzales,cir.we accordingly look to the immigration and nationality act ina section a,codified at a,which was the governing law at that time.section listed the specific conditions necessary for derivative citizenship.it provided in pertinent part 
a a child born outside of the united states of alien parents becomes a citizen of the united states upon fulfillment of the following conditions 
the naturalization of both parents or 
the naturalization of the surviving parent if one of the parents is deceased or 
the naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents or the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child has not been established by legitimation and if 
such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years and 
such child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent last naturalized under clause of this subsection,or the parent naturalized under clause or of this subsection,or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
a emphasis added.
we have recognized that when congress passed a,congress generally intended to provide automatic citizenship to children born abroad of alien parents only after the naturalization of both biological parents.barthelemy,at.we identified the reason congress wanted to prevent the naturalizing parent from usurping the parental rights of the alien parent.id.to avoid having the general rule sweep too broadly,by encompassing situations in which there was no parent with parental rights to protect,congress allowed a child to derive citizenship upon the naturalization of a single parent in the limited circumstance where the parent was deceased,the parent following a legal separation,or an unknown father.a.id.
in this case,suchite does not satisfy a requirement that both his biological parents naturalize before his eighteenth birthday.the statutory exceptions do not apply because suchite mother was alive,married to,and not legally separated from,suchite father at all times before suchite turned eighteen.
the law changed less than a month after suchite eighteenth birthday.suchite would have derived citizenship if he had turned eighteen after february,the effective date of the child citizenship act cca.see.the cca repealed a and broadened the qualifications for derivative citizenship,allowing children under the age of eighteen to derive citizenship automatically upon the naturalization of only one parent.see id.a.
the cca now provides 
a a child born outside the united states automatically becomes a citizen of the united states when all of the following conditions have been fulfilled 
at least one parent of the child is a citizen of the united states,whether by birth or naturalization.
the child is under the age of eighteen years.
the child is residing in the united states in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.
id.a emphasis added.
the cca demonstrates a material departure from the ina former rule that both parents must naturalize to confer automatic derivative citizenship on a child.id.under the new law,if a child is in the legal and physical custody of a parent who becomes a citizen,the child derives citizenship upon the naturalization of that parent.id.this is now true even if the parent retains parental rights.see.
the legislative history of the cca indicates congress wanted to simplify the naturalization process in order to help families.the house report stated the act would benefit families with children while untangling the complex and duplicative provisions of the ina,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.of particular concern to legislators were the hurdles to citizenship faced by,adopted children.see adopted orphans citizenship act and anti atrocity alien act hearing on and before the subcomm.on immigr.and claims of the comm.on the judiciary,cong.opening statement of lamar smith,chairman,subcomm.on immigr.and claims hereinafter hearing see also,at.as a general matter,congress wanted to ensure that children were not deprived of citizenship simply because their parents did not know they needed to take additional steps to naturalize their children,at see also hearing,at.
this concern may be particularly apt in this case,where suchite contends that his parents believed that his father naturalization automatically conferred citizenship upon his children.suchite situation is sympathetic,and congress subsequently acted to prevent its recurrence.the ina,however,and not the cca,governs his claim of citizenship.because the ina was based on a general policy that protected the parental rights of the custodial,parent,in this case suchite mother,he can not derive citizenship under a of the ina since only one of his custodial parents naturalized within the relevant time period.
we therefore turn to suchite contention that the statute is unconstitutional.suchite challenges the provision on equal protection grounds.he argues that a irrationally grants citizenship to children of legally separated parents upon the naturalization of only one parent with custodial rights,while denying citizenship to children of married parents in similar circumstances.the controlling equal protection issue is whether a distinction between children of married parents and those of legally separated parents is rationally based.
iii.analysis 
equal protection 
we decided a similar issue in barthelemy,at.the petitioner in barthelemy was born in haiti to unmarried parents,neither of whom were citizens.id.at.barthelemy never knew his mother because he was left in the care of his father and paternal grandparents soon after his birth.id.at.barthelemy father eventually immigrated to the united states and barthelemy followed.id.barthelemy father naturalized when barthelemy was fourteen.id.the same statutory scheme that controls here,controlled in barthelemy.id.at barthelemy,like suchite,could not derive citizenship from his father because his father was not legally separated from his mother.id.at.he argued that a was unconstitutional because its legal separation requirement irrationally discriminated against children whose parents were never married.id.at.
we rejected this argument.id.we held that the legal separation requirement was rational because it was consistent with a general statutory scheme to protect parental rights,including those of parents.id.at see also nehme ins,cir reasoning that congress enacted the provision to promote marital and family harmony and to prevent the child from being separated from an alien parent who has a legal right to custody johnson whitehead,cir finding that congress took great pains to protect the rights of both parents wedderburn ins,cir reasoning that parents may have reasons to prefer the child original citizenship rodrigues attorney general,cir,unpublished reasoning that the statute purpose was quite clear it was structured to respect the rights of custodial parents who were not citizens of the united states.we explained with a hypothetical situation in which an unmarried,but naturalized parent,unlawfully kidnaped the child from the parent.barthelemy,at.in this scenario,the requirement that the naturalized parent be the custodial,legally separated parent to confer derivative citizenship demonstrates a rational purpose.the requirement protects the rights of the parent by preventing the naturalized parent from affecting the child citizenship in violation of the interests of the parent from whom the child was kidnaped.id.at.
although barthelemy involved the protection of the parental rights of an unmarried parent,the principle of protecting parental rights is similarly served in the context of a marital relationship.married couples do not always agree on how to raise their children,and not unfrequently live separately from each other,even though not legally separated or divorced.in this case,for instance,although neither divorced nor separated,suchite parents spent a year apart,with suchite father in the united states and his mother in guatemala.if,hypothetically,suchite mother had stayed in guatemala while suchite was with his father in the united states when his father naturalized,there would be concerns about the rights of suchite mother.the requirement that there be a legal separation to confer automatic derivative citizenship upon the father naturalization could then more clearly be seen to protect the parental rights of suchite mother.with the benefit of hindsight,the requirement does not appear to serve the purpose of protecting the rights of the parent in this case,where the mother herself became a citizen not long after the father,but that does not make the statute irrational,only imperfect.see barthelemy,at see also wedderburn,at reasoning that a law does not become unconstitutional just because it does not fit of the cases.
suchite makes a secondary equal protection argument.he contends we should interpret the phrase legal custody within the meaning of a to include a parent having joint legal custody,and then hold the statute is irrational by treating a citizen parent with joint legal custody differently from a parent who is married.if we were to construe the statute to grant derivative citizenship upon the naturalization of a parent with joint legal custody,we agree the result would be irrational.our law,however,recognizes the principle that courts do not construe statutes in a manner that would lead to absurd results.ma ashcroft,cir.similarly,we do not impute to congress an intent to create a law that produces an unreasonable result.united states kaldenberg,cir.the phrase legal custody,therefore,means sole legal custody.
suchite relies on a series of unpublished,bia decisions in which the bia said that derivative citizenship follows the naturalization of one parent with joint legal custody.see in re puertas,no,wl bia,unpublished in re delcid,no,wl bia may,unpublished see also in re applicant,no.redacted by agency,wl aao.only skidmore deference,however,is owed to unpublished bia decisions.see garcia quintero gonzales,cir.under skidmore deference,we examine the validit
