karamokotie kamagate appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york carol bagley amon,judge,entered on june,denying his petition pursuant to to vacate a final order of removal from the united states see kamagate ashcroft,cba june.while his appeal and a motion to stay the removal order were pending before this court,kamagate was,in fact,removed from the united states.because kamagate is,nevertheless,subject to adverse collateral consequences as a result of the challenged removal order,we conclude that his appeal is not moot.
kamagate asserts that he is entitled to relief because the basis for his removal was an erroneous conclusion by an immigration judge ij and by the board of immigration appeals bia that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony,see a a iii specifically,an offense relating to counterfeiting,id.a r in challenging this conclusion on appeal,kamagate relies on an argument never raised during the administrative proceedings or before the district court he submits that an offense relates to counterfeiting only if it involves the creation of counterfeit instruments or a scheme to do so.he asserts that his conviction in the eastern district of new york for conspiracy to utter and possess counterfeit securities in violation of,a,see united states kamagate,cba,can not evidence a crime related to counterfeiting because a defendant can be guilty of such a conspiracy without proof that the conspirators ever dealt in counterfeit securities,much less that they made or intended to make such instruments.we conclude that this argument misconstrues a r and misunderstands the relationship of that section to a u we hold that kamagate conviction is for an aggravated felony,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
kamagate conviction for conspiring to utter and possess counterfeit securities 
karamokotie kamagate legally entered the united states on october,married a united states citizen in june,and became a lawful permanent resident on september.in,he joined others in a scheme to cash various counterfeit corporate checks and fraudulent treasury checks,thereby causing losses of approximately.charged in the eastern district of new york with conspiring to utter and possess counterfeit checks,see,a,actually uttering and possessing a counterfeit check,see id.a,and fraudulently endorsing a united states treasury check,see id.a,kamagate pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge on march,and on february,the district court sentenced him to,inter alia,a term of incarceration 
having waived direct appeal in his plea agreement,kamagate collaterally challenged his conviction pursuant to,claiming primarily ineffective assistance of counsel.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the motion on august,see kamagate united states,cba,and this court declined to grant kamagate a certificate of appealability,see kamagate united states,cir.
ii.immigration proceedings 
meanwhile,on july,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued kamagate a notice to appear for removal pursuant to a a iii on the ground that his federal conviction was for an aggravated felony as defined in a r and u.as a result of this notice,upon kamagate completion of his term of incarceration,the bureau of prisons transferred him to ins custody.first appearing before an ij on august,kamagate was granted a continuance to allow him to secure counsel.at his next appearance on october,a further adjournment was granted to afford kamagate counsel sufficient time to prepare for the removal hearing.sometime thereafter,kamagate fired his attorney and on january,advised the ij that he elected to proceed pro se.
at the removal hearing,kamagate admitted his federal conviction but did not specifically concede that he was removable on this ground.instead,he asserted a fear of persecution and torture if returned to his native country,cote formerly known as the ivory coast,and applied for withholding of removal pursuant to b and protection under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment convention against torture in a decision dated june,the ij ruled that kamagate had failed to establish circumstances warranting relief from removal under either united states law or the convention against torture and,summarily concluding that the federal conviction was for an aggravated felony,ordered kamagate removed from the united states.the decision was upheld by the bia on november,
iii.the pending petition 
on june,kamagate,again proceeding pro se,filed his second petition in the district court,arguing that the bia had improperly ordered his removal based on conviction for a crime that was not,in fact,an aggravated felony he moved for a stay of removal pending disposition of his petition,which motion the district court granted.
in support of his petition,kamagate asserted that his crime of conviction did not fall within the definition of aggravated felony provided in a u in light of our decision in ming lam sui ins,cir,or the definition provided in a r,which he read as pertaining only to motor vehicle identification numbers.in an unpublished memorandum and order dated june,the district court rejected these arguments.it noted that ming lam sui concluded that a conviction for one substantive crime did not necessarily establish an attempt to commit a different crime,an issue not presented in this case where kamagate plainly stands convicted of conspiracy to violate a.see kamagate ashcroft,cba,at.relying on the plain language and grammatical structure of the statute,the district court further concluded that the term vehicles applied to only one clause in subsection r,identifying offenses relating to trafficking in vehicles the identification numbers of which have been altered as aggravated felonies.a r.it ruled that the term vehicles did not pertain to,much less limit,three other clauses in the statute identifying other aggravated felonies,specifically,offenses relating to commercial bribery,counterfeiting,or forgery.kamagate ashcroft,cba,at quoting a r.accordingly,the district court denied kamagate petition and lifted its stay of removal.
on july,kamagate filed a notice of appeal from the district court judgment,and soon thereafter moved for a stay of removal,which this court granted by order entered september.in fact,kamagate had been deported from the united states on august,prompting respondents,in may,to move for dismissal of this appeal as moot.because respondents had a cote address for kamagate,this court directed their counsel to inquire of kamagate in writing whether he wished to pursue his appeal.when kamagate responded affirmatively,we directed the appointment of counsel and ordered briefing on the following issues whether conspiracy to utter and possess counterfeit securities is an aggravated felony under a r and u if not,whether either this federal offense or kamagate new york state conviction involved a crime of moral turpitude under the ina and whether kamagate conviction of either offense renders him permanently inadmissible thereby rendering his appeal moot because his removal would present no adverse collateral consequences.kamagate ashcroft,cir.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
iirira stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to review final removal orders against aliens based on their commission of aggravated felonies.see a c.this jurisdictional bar,however,does not affect the availability of federal habeas review under.see ins,d ins cyr,d accord kuhali reno,cir.therefore,under,we retain jurisdiction to consider whether an alien challenging an order of removal has,as a matter of law,committed an aggravated felony as defined in the ina.see kuhali reno,at citing ins cyr,at,for the proposition that jurisdiction extends at least to important question s of law see also id.at holding the availability of review not affected by court ability to consider aggravated felony challenge on direct review to determine whether iirira jurisdictional bar applies.
ii.kamagate appeal is not moot 
although respondents initially argued that this appeal should be dismissed as moot,the parties now assert that kamagate removal to cote does not moot the case.we agree.
a case becomes moot if,at any stage of the proceedings,it fails to satisfy the requirement of article iii,section,of the constitution.see spencer kemna,d accord marrero pichardo ashcroft,cir swaby ashcroft,cir.where a petitioner challenging an order of removal has been deported from the united states,he must show some collateral consequence meaning some concrete and continuing injury other than the threat of removal to establish a live case or controversy.swaby ashcroft,at quoting spencer kemna,at.we conclude that kamagate satisfies this requirement because a collateral consequence of his removal for an aggravated felony conviction is a lifetime bar from reentering the united states.id.citing a a ii.were this court to accept kamagate argument that his federal conviction was not for an aggravated felony offense and to grant him a writ of habeas corpus vacating his order of removal,he would thereby secure significant relief specifically,a a ii would no longer stand as a bar to his seeking reentry into this country.see id.holding that a claim is not moot if there is sufficient likelihood that the collateral injury alleged can be redressed by the relief sought in the court action.
as our inquiry to the parties recognized,kamagate may nevertheless face permanent inadmissibility if his crime of conviction involved moral turpitude.a a i i the parties seem to agree that because the conspiracy crime of conviction required proof of a fraudulent or deceitful intent,kamagate offense could be deemed one involving moral turpitude.see jordan de george.recognizing that fraud has ordinarily been the test to determine whether crimes not of the gravest character involve moral turpitude citing united states ex rel.berlandi reimer,cir see also winestock ins,cir holding that knowingly selling,transferring,and delivering counterfeit united states securities intending to pass them as genuine is a crime involving moral turpitude in re flores,holding that uttering counterfeit documents relating to alien registration knowing them to be counterfeit is a crime involving moral turpitude.
we need not here decide whether counterfeiting crimes invariably involve moral turpitude.we note only that,were we so to rule in this case,kamagate appeal would still not be moot.an alien convicted of a crime of moral turpitude may seek cancellation of removal and thereby avoid permanent inadmissibility,but only if his conviction was not for an aggravated felony.see a thus,even if convicted for a crime of moral turpitude,kamagate can assert significant adverse collateral consequences from the fact that his removal order identifies that crime as an aggravated felony.
because a judicial ruling in kamagate favor could remedy the alleged injury of a lifetime bar from reentry with no possible cancellation of removal,we conclude that the appeal is not moot.
iii.kamagate federal conviction is for an aggravated felony under a r and u 
standard of review 
we review a district court denial of a petition de novo.see evangelista ashcroft,cir citing chrzanoski ashcroft,cir.in so doing,we accord considerable deference to the bia interpretation of ambiguous provisions of the ina,including those defining various categories of aggravated felonies.see see generally chevron,natural resources def.council,d.but we review de novo whether a particular conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony within the parameters established by the ina.see evangelista ashcroft,at noting that the judiciary,not the bia,is charged with the responsibility for interpreting federal criminal statutes kuhali reno,at w here the board has further determined that an offense,as defined by a particular criminal statute,falls within the ina aggravated felony definition,we review that determination de novo.ming lam sui ins,at same.
waiver of the argument that a r does not pertain to conspiracies to violate a 
the law is well established that a federal appellate court will generally not consider an issue or argument not raised below.see,hutton constr.county of rockland,cir and cases cited therein.in the district court,kamagate did not argue,as he now does on appeal,that a conspiracy to utter or possess counterfeit securities can not qualify as an offense relating to counterfeiting under a r because the offense does not require proof that the conspirators made or intended to make counterfeit instruments instead,he argued that subsection r applied only to offenses involving motor vehicle identifications.correctly rejecting this narrow interpretation as a patent misreading of a r,the district court observed that,otherwise,kamagate apparently concedes that the uttering and possessing of counterfeit securities is an offense relating to counterfeiting.kamagate ashcroft,cba,at.
kamagate now asserts that the district court erred in assuming such a concession and in failing to undertake an independent analysis of the scope of offenses under a r,but the record indicates that he did not seek reconsideration on this issue although he understood that he could make such a motion.under these circumstances,if kamagate had been represented by counsel in the district court,we would likely find his argument on appeal to have been waived by default.nevertheless,because kamagate proceeded pro se in the district court and because we retain discretion to hear arguments not previously raised,see marrero pichardo ashcroft,at,we conclude that kamagate omission is not fatal to our review.
ambiguities in the record make it more difficult to discern whether kamagate raised any administrative challenge to the application of a r to his case.see drozd ins,cir holding that argument not raised before ij or bia was waived.nevertheless,we need not pursue the issue because even if we were to resolve the administrative waiver point in kamagate favor,we would reject his aggravated felony challenge as without merit.see,brown ashcroft,cir.
c.the merits of kamagate aggravated felony challenge 
in deciding whether a crime of conviction fits within the definitions of aggravated felony outlined in a,this court has adopted a categorical approach,focusing on the elements of the offense of conviction without regard to the factual circumstances of the crime.see ming lam sui ins,at see also dickson ashcroft,cir and cases cited therein.relying on this principle,kamagate submits that his conviction for conspiring to utter and possess counterfeit securities can not qualify as an aggravated felony relating to counterfeiting under a r because the offense does not require proof of actual counterfeiting by anyone such a conspiracy crime can be committed even by persons in possession of genuine securities if they mistakenly believe them to be counterfeit and intend to use them to commit fraud.without commenting on whether kamagate hypothetical would,in fact,support a criminal conviction,we reject his argument that a conspiracy to violate a is not an aggravated felony crime.
if a substantive violation of a qualifies as an aggravated felony under a r,a conspiracy to violate a qualifies as an aggravated felony under a u 
the critical flaw in kamagate analysis is his assumption that a conspiracy conviction with a a objective must itself fit within the aggravated felony definition of a r.respondents relied on two statutory subsections to denominate kamagate crime of conviction an aggravated felony subsection r,which identifies an offense relating to counterfeiting as an aggravated felony,and subsection u,which defines any conspiracy to commit specified offenses,including those outlined in subsection r,as an aggravated felony.this statutory structure is significant.it means that if the substantive crime that is the objective of a charged conspiracy fits within the aggravated felony definition of subsection r,the conspiracy is also an aggravated felony by virtue of subsection u without regard to whether the elements of the conspiracy crime themselves establish a subsection r offense.in sum,because kamagate can not dispute that he was convicted of a criminal conspiracy,that conspiracy is an aggravated felony un
