yu yan yueng and her son san kai kwok applied for asylum,alleging that chinese family planning officials forced her to undergo an involuntary abortion.an immigration judge denied the application,finding that yueng and san kai were not credible and had not demonstrated either past persecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution.because the ij adverse credibility finding is speculative and not supported by substantial evidence,we grant the petition for review.
we take the facts that gave rise to this case from the testimony the petitioners gave at their asylum hearing.yueng testified at the hearing that she,her adult son san kai kwok who was a minor when he and yueng applied for asylum in,and her husband ho kwok are from tingjiang,fujian province,china,where ho kwok still resides.she is illiterate,with only two years of primary education.in,after san kai was born,yueng submitted to the mandatory implantation of an iud prophylactic device,but at some unknown time it slipped out.
yueng testified that in october she learned she was pregnant.she went into hiding,she said,to prevent the brigade from aborting her pregnancy,and stayed at a cousin house in the provincial capital of fuzhou,about minutes by bus from her own home.she alleged that after one of her cousin neighbors reported her to the government,officials from the brigade began searching for her.she testified that the officials went to her house twice in february,after she had gone into hiding.her attorney noticed the impossibility of the she learned of her pregnancy in october and authorities consequently began searching for her in february.when her attorney pressed her to clarify the timeline,however,the ij told him,she,she answered two times already.move on to the next question.
that same february,according to yueng testimony,her informed her that san kai had been seized and imprisoned by the authorities,both to question him about her whereabouts and to pressure her to come forward.she specified at least twice that this happened in.that same month,she testified,family planning officials came to her house twice trying to find her on the second occasion,apparently about a week after she learned that san kai had been imprisoned,they found her and seized her.in recounting this chronology,however,she specifically testified that the month in question was february.the ij,now realizing the confusion,attempted to clarify the timeline and asked yueng whether she was certain that all of the events in question occurred in february.she affirmed that she was sure.when he pointed out that she had first pegged the events as happening in,yueng replied,well,because i illiterate i did receive a lot of education,and so i have a slip of tongue,and i made a mistake i did confuse and.
during her,the government attorney asked yueng about her extended family.she testified that she has six siblings,two of whom have two children each,and that her husband also has multiple siblings,but that those brothers and sisters all live in the united states.the government then asked yueng whether she had an abortion certificate,to which she replied that all these certificates were taken away by the officials in our brigade,so i do have any.yueng also said that her husband had joined her in hiding.the government pointed out that a letter from ho kwok had been offered as an exhibit,but that while he otherwise corroborated her account he said nothing about hiding from that he placed his wife in a secret place.yueng was unable to explain why her husband letter had not mentioned his own flight from the authorities.
after yueng testified,san kai took the stand.he said that on february,during one of his classes at middle school,some officials from the brigade came to take me away.he said that the officials locked me up in a,in a dark room,no light,and i,i cry all the time.they questioned him about his mother whereabouts,and allegedly treated him harshly the first couple days there no food.they kept high pressure on me and what i could do is just cry.he told the authorities that he did not know where his mother was,even though,he testified,i knew at that time.he testified that he lost track of time in detention,but that his parents later told him that he had been locked up for about a week.on,the government attorney asked san kai if he had known where his mother was while he was detained.he answered,contradicting his earlier testimony,that he did know where she was.he explained,what i met sic is that i did know where she was i could not tell them because i did know.on redirect,he testified that he knew his mother whereabouts after he was released,but not while he was locked up.san kai also testified that his mother does have the ability to communicate clearly with other people,referring to an apparent speech impediment,and that even he had trouble understanding her.
the ij then issued his decision,finding that the petitioners were not credible and had failed to show either past persecution or a fear of future persecution if returned to china.it was yueng testimony,as compared to the written statement attached to her asylum application that is essentially the basis for the credibility finding.her testimony,the ij noted,was inconsistent both internally and with the written statement attached to her asylum application as well as with her husband letter.
the first and most important inconsistency identified by the ij was whether the february of both her son alleged abduction and her alleged abortion was in or in discrepancy was the key basis,which this judge relies on in finding the respondent testimony to be incredible.after summarizing yueng confusion as to the year and her explanation that she was illiterate,the ij dismissed that excuse as irrelevant.the ij considered the discrepancy to be significant there is a significant amount of difference between the year and the year.this judge is mindful that a mistake could have been made,but this judge is not convinced that a mistake was made.
although the ij characterized this confusion as the central issue to his credibility determination,he explained that he would have ruled the petitioners incredible even if yueng testimony about the dates had been consistent.the other factors he addressed were a lack of supporting witnesses or documentation such as an abortion certificate,whether yueng husband joined her in hiding,whether her son had known her whereabouts while he was detained,where yueng was taken into custody,whether or not she surrendered herself,and why she and her husband siblings were able to have multiple children.the ij also determined that yueng failed to present necessary corroborating evidence such as an abortion certificate,the results of a physical examination,documentation of a bona fide marriage,and testimony or affidavits from family members in the united states.
the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision in december.petitioners filed a petition for review in this court.when petitioners discovered that a section of the transcript was missing from the administrative record,the bia sua sponte reopened the case,and we granted the parties joint motion to dismiss the petition for review pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure.the bia received and considered the transcripts that had been omitted,and again adopted and affirmed the ij ruling.yueng and san kai petition for review of that ruling.
the only issue on appeal is the ij credibility finding.because yueng filed her asylum application before the real id act was passed,stat,that statute does not affect the credibility analysis in this case.see diallo gonzales,cir real id act allows an ij to require a credible applicant to provide corroborating evidence in certain circumstances,but not where petitioner filed an asylum application before may.credibility determinations must be supported by cogent and specific reasons and bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.gjerazi gonzales,cir mansour,cir.those reasons must go to the heart of the applicant claim.giday gonzales,cir.we give substantial deference to the reasons the ij gives for a credibility determination,and we will reject such a determination only in ext
