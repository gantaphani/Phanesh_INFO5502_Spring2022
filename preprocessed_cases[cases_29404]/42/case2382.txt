jose de horta garcia,then a permanent resident alien,was deported in because he had been convicted of a drug trafficking crime.this case involves his second illegal into the country after deportation.during his first prosecution for illegal,he challenged the validity of his deportation order on the grounds that he was denied his right to seek a discretionary waiver of deportation under former ina c,c repealed,arguing that the repeal of discretionary waiver should not have been applied to prevent him from applying for the waiver.the district of alaska rejected his contention and de horta garcia did not appeal.he raised the argument again in this prosecution and the district court rejected it based on circuit precedent.we affirm.
background 
de horta garcia first came to the united states from mexico in.he married a united states citizen in and became a lawful permanent resident.by november,de horta garcia had separated from his wife and moved to alaska where he was arrested in a drug sting.in february,de horta garcia waived his speedy trial rights,alaska,extending the state time to prosecute him into june.in june he pleaded guilty to attempted misconduct involving a controlled substance.he appeared,without counsel,at a group deportation hearing in december and was ordered deported under ina a c a c,which at that time made excludable any alien who had been an illicit trafficker of any controlled substance.he was released at the mexican border the next day.
the timing of de horta garcia guilty plea and deportation were very unfortunate for him.had he pleaded guilty and appeared at a deportation hearing only a few months earlier,before april,he would have had the right to petition the attorney general for relief from deportation.see ina c c repealed see also ins cyr,d.when congress passed the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,effective april,however,it amended c so that it no longer applied to aliens,including de horta garcia,made excludable for most controlled substance offenses.see ina c c,a b.the ij at de horta garcia deportation hearing apparently concluded that aedpa modification of c applied to aliens who offended and were arrested before the modification but convicted after it,and so did not tell de horta garcia that he had a right to petition the attorney general for relief from deportation.
about a year after he was deported,de horta garcia was discovered in alaska and charged with illegal after deportation.see a,b.the district court for the district of alaska initially dismissed the indictment,finding that the original deportation rested on an impermissible retroactive application of c in violation of the due process clause.on the government motion for reconsideration,though,the district court reversed itself based on binding ninth circuit precedent.de horta garcia was ultimately convicted of illegal reentry,and he did not appeal.at the end of his prison term in june,he was deported to mexico again.
after the district court initial dismissal of the indictment,de horta garcia moved to reopen his original deportation proceedings and stay his deportation order.the ij denied de horta garcia motion before the district court reconsidered its dismissal.the ij ruling was based on bia precedent,as well as de horta garcia failure to move to reopen within the days allowed by.nothing in the record suggests that de horta garcia appealed the ij ruling.
after being deported a second time,de horta garcia found his way back into the united states once again.this time he was arrested in wisconsin in september on retail theft charges.after being referred to federal authorities,he was again indicted for illegal after deportation,a,b,and again argued that his original deportation was invalid because he was denied the right to petition the attorney general for discretionary relief from deportation under c.the district court rejected this argument based on laguerre reno,cir,which concluded that aedpa bar against discretionary waivers applied retroactively to aliens,like de horta garcia,who offended before its passage,but were convicted after its passage.de horta garcia pleaded guilty,but reserved his right to appeal the retroactivity issue.
de horta garcia begins by conceding,as he must,that the district court properly relied upon laguerre and goes on to predict that in all likelihood,we will not revisit our prior precedent.but counsel for de horta garcia makes a hard argument harder by not fully presenting his arguments for reconsidering laguerre in his brief.instead counsel includes in his short appendix the brief he filed in the district court and states in his appellate brief that it is incorporated herein.we normally refuse to consider such incorporations because e ven when a litigant has unused space,incorporation is a pointless imposition on the court time.desilva dileonardi,cir.
in the context of a litigant failure to provide a transcript under federal rule of appellate procedure b,we have held that where meaningful review is possible,we may exercise our discretion and rule on the merits.united states,cir.because meaningful review is just this case and because we hesitate to thwart de horta garcia stated objective to challenge our precedent in the supreme court,we address the arguments on the merits.
before analyzing de horta garcia primary argument,though,we must analyze a procedural bar that he can not overcome under circuit precedent.section d allows a collateral attack of a deportation order only upon a showing that 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d.although de horta garcia can arguably meet the first two conditions,we have previously held that an alien in his position can not meet the third.
to show fundamental unfairness,de horta garcia must show,first,a violation of due process,and second,that he was prejudiced by the removal proceedings.see,at.if de horta garcia truly lost his opportunity to apply for c relief that might have been granted,then he might have been able to show that he was prejudiced,that judicial review would have yielded him relief from deportation.see united states,cir.but,we have joined the majority of circuits in holding that due process does not encompass a right to be informed of eligibility to be considered relief,at but see united states copeland,cir failure to inform alien of right to discretionary relief can be fundamentally unfair united states,cir same.thus,under this circuit precedent,the violation de horta garcia contends occurred at his deportation hearing did not make the deportation order fundamentally unfair,and he may not collaterally attack it in this prosecution.see,at.
finally,even if de horta garcia could steer clear of the roadblocks preventing him from collaterally attacking his deportation order,his attack itself is also foreclosed by circuit precedent.in laguerre,we explained that the change to c would apply retroactively unless it would disturb reasonable expectations.laguerre,at.but we concluded that applying the new law retroactively to aliens like de horta garcia would not disturb reasonable expectations because i t would border on the absurd to argue that these aliens might have decided not to commit drug crimes had they known that if they were not only imprisoned but also,when their prison term ended,ordered deported,they could not ask for a discretionary waiver of deportation.id.we have held that retroactive application is impermissible because it would disturb reasonable expectations in only two situations when an alien had conceded deportability before repeal in reliance on the possibility of c relief,ins,cir,and when an alien had pleaded guilty to the underlying offense before repeal partly in reliance on the possibility of relief,jideonwo ins,cir.in both cases,we required a showing of specific facts demonstrating actual reliance,at.in cyr,the supreme court held that the repeal of c did not apply retroactively to any a
