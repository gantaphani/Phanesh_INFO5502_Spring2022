backgrounda.facts 
is mexican citizen.he first immigrated to the united states in,married and had two children who reside with their mother in california.he later relocated to illinois where,over the course of several years,he was convicted of aggravated battery and of several drug crimes.in,he was paroled to the immigration and naturalization service the agency ordered him deported and instructed him not to return without the express permission of the attorney general of the united states.
subsequently attempted to reenter the united states on february.shortly after midnight,he arrived at the international airport in chicago,illinois,on a flight from mexico.at customs,he presented a passport bearing the name jose beltran rea and informed an immigration inspector that the purpose of his visit was to see a sick cousin.the inspector noticed that passport contained an unusual visa stamp and led him to a separate area for questioning.continuing the questioning,the inspector scanned fingerprints into a computer to verify his identity.the computer eventually revealed that first name was not jose but rafael on this basis,the inspector determined that was inadmissible and summoned an additional immigration official to continue the investigation.
after approximately two hours had passed,a second official,lori glud,arrived in the inspection room where was being interviewed.inspector glud conducted an additional computer search and discovered that was a documented alien who previously had been deported.learning this,the inspectors then asked if he had obtained the permission of the attorney general to reenter the united states.he confessed that he had not.
shortly thereafter,gerardo guzman,a immigration inspector,arrived to assist the others in taking a sworn statement from.before doing so,inspector guzman informed for the first time of his miranda rights,reading them to him in spanish,native language.signed a waiver that explained he understood these rights and was willing to make a statement without a lawyer present.with translation from inspector guzman,and inspector glud then engaged in a transcribed exchange in which admitted once again that he had not sought the attorney general permission to reenter the united states.
district court proceedings 
on february,was arraigned on charges of illegal reentry,see and use of a false passport,see a at his arraignment hearing,he pleaded not guilty to both charges.less than one month later,however,retained new counsel and entered into a plea agreement with the government.the agreement stipulated that would plead guilty to the charge of illegal reentry,and,in exchange,the government would dismiss the false passport charge and recommend at sentencing that,under the edition of the united states sentencing guidelines,base offense level should be.
at the ensuing change of plea hearing,the district court engaged in a plea colloquy to confirm that he was competent to plead guilty,was proceeding freely and voluntarily,and was knowledgeable about the charge,the possible penalties he faced and his constitutional rights.the court also had the government present a specific factual basis supporting the a charge,to which assented.satisfied with answers,the court accepted the plea agreement and entered a plea of guilty.
at the ensuing sentencing hearing,the parties plea agreement began to unravel.represented by new counsel,indicated to the court that his previous guilty plea may not have been made knowingly.to resolve this matter,the court heard formal testimony from former counsel and from to determine what the defendant understood when he previously pleaded guilty.eventually,the following exchange occurred between and counsel for the government ausa 
ausa w hen you reentered the country in february of this year,on february,you understood that you were violating your agreement not to reenter the country or the order not to reenter the country,correct 
yes,i understand that,but they fooled 
me with the passport.
ausa and,in fact 
the court i did hear the last part of that.you understood that you were violating the order not to reenter the country,but what 
through interpreter it had already been five years.i remember they told me it was five years.
the court who told you five years 
the court when you were sentenced,the judge told you you could reenter the country for five years 
i think so,if i remember correctly.i was very bad in my mean,not my head,but my ulcer,i was really bad.
the court so you did think you were violating the order when you came into the country on february year was it this year 
ausa yes,your honor,february.
the court so you did think you were violating the order when you came into the country on february,
i did think that at the time.
the court okay.i think what we going to have to end up doing is trying this case.perhaps there have been some difficulties that have resulted from the past,and i agree with you,defense counsel,this man did not understand.
i going to vacate the plea agreement,because the defendant has now expressed his innocence by saying at the time of the offense,he did not know he was violating the law,and we set the case for trial on september.
multiple hearings followed and continued in his attempts to plead guilty.each time,the district court refused to accept guilty plea because,in the court view,he did not appear to comprehend fully the rights that he was attempting to waive.at each plea opportunity,when pressed on whether he understood that pleading guilty meant that he no longer could file any motions,appeared hesitant and confused the court interpreted these responses as a reluctance to plead guilty.
finally,on january,sought to plead guilty once again,titling his motion,one last chance.at the hearing to decide this motion,the court asked whether there were any remaining motions that he wished to file.the court reminded that,at a previous hearing,he had told the court that he desired to file certain motions but was unsure whether they were appropriately or.in response,stated that he did not remember these events.then,when asked if he remembered any other part of the hearing,he answered the truth is i do remember much.at.at this point,the district court informed and his counsel that it was denying the motion to plead guilty.it gave the following rationale for its decision 
i t seems to me that,despite his commentary,would probably,in my opinion,say that whatever proceedings we have today,he wo remember very much or that he did understand.
and so,consequently,it seems to me that in order to ensure that all of his rights are protected and there is no argument at a later time that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his rights,it seems to me we should proceed to trial on tuesday.
on the first day of trial,moved to suppress his confession in which he admitted to immigration inspectors that he lacked the necessary permission to reenter the united states.he argued that his sworn confession,although rendered after the administration of miranda warnings,was nevertheless inadmissible because it came after i
