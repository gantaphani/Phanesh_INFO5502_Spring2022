nyakundi john omari omari petitions for review of an order by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge order that omari be removed from the united states.we hold that the record does not reflect that the prior conviction on which the removal order was based was for an aggravated felony,and we accordingly grant the petition for review,vacate the removal order,and remand to the bia.
facts and proceedings below 
omari is a native of kenya who was admitted to the united states in march.in may,he was convicted in minnesota state court for fifth degree assault against his wife.in june,he was convicted based on his guilty plea in the eastern district of texas for conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property,contrary to and specifically,omari pleaded guilty to count one of a indictment naming him and five other named as well as others known and unknown.
count one of the indictment includes a description of a scheme in which one named lodhi and others known but unnamed would burglarize travel agencies and steal blank airline tickets,and another named barney would create forged airline tickets using passenger and destination information provided by several named,including omari,and that those would sell the stolen tickets through travel agencies that they operated.among the overt acts alleged was that in may,lodhi and other unnamed known persons burglarized dimension travel and stole blank airline tickets.in addition to selling stolen airline tickets,omari was alleged to have traveled using some of the tickets.of overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy alleged in count one,four were allegedly committed by omari,including three trips allegedly taken using stolen airline tickets and one sale of two stolen tickets.count one specifically charges that omari and five named others and others known and unknown knowingly and willfully conspired to commit the following crime against the united states interstate transportation of stolen,converted and fraudulently obtained property,in violation of title,united states code,section.

discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
under a c this court does not have jurisdiction to review the removal decision if omari prior conviction was an aggravated felony however,we do have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction,to determine whether the conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.reno,cir.with respect to determining whether a prior conviction falls within a provision of the immigration and nationality act ina,we accord substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the ina itself and definitions of phrases within it.smalley ashcroft,cir internal quotation omitted.we then review de novo whether the particular statute that the prior conviction is under falls within the relevant ina definition.smalley,at omagah ashcroft,cir.
ii.involving fraud or deceit 
for omari to have been convicted of an aggravated felony under relevant provisions of a m and u,his conviction must be for an offense involv ing fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds,or for an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense.a m,u.the ij opinion indicates that the indictment and judgment for omari conspiracy conviction made it clear that omari was convicted of conspiring to violate the second paragraph of,which the ij found to be an offense involving fraud or deceit omari argues that the conspiracy alleged in count one was to commit the offense denounced by the first paragraph of,which does not necessarily involve fraud or deceit,and that he did not plead guilty to a conspiracy to violate the second paragraph of section.
although neither the ij nor the bia defined fraud or deceit,the bia has argued in other cases that fraud and fraud and deceit as appearing in a m should be used in their commonly understood legal sense.see,valansi ashcroft,cir.black law dictionary defines fraud as a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment,and deceit as the act of intentionally giving a false impression.black law dictionary,ed.
in determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony or meets other similar criteria for immigration or sentence enhancement purposes,we employ a categorical approach in which we look at the statute under which the alien was convicted rather than at the particular underlying facts,at.when the aggravated felony provision uses involves language,we inquire whether violation of the statute necessarily entails the involved behavior.see united states montgomery,cir for a prior conviction to involve a serious potential risk of physical injury,violation of the statute convicted under must necessarily entail a serious potential risk of physical injury.in the case of a m,we therefore consider whether violation of necessarily entails fraud or deceit.
the first five paragraphs of set out five alternative ways that the statute can be violated.the first paragraph describes violation by whoever transports,transmits,or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods,wares,merchandise,securities or money,of the value of or more,knowing the same to have been stolen,converted or taken by fraud.violation of this paragraph does not necessarily entail fraud or deceit,since the paragraph can be violated by transporting or transferring goods known to be stolen.for example,the goods could be transferred to someone who knew they were stolen,so that there would be no misrepresentation or deceit.a conviction under is therefore not necessarily a conviction for an offense involving fraud or deceit.
we recognize an exception to the categorical approach when a statute is divisible into discrete subsections,violation of one or more of which would in itself meet the criterion at issue.see smalley,at omagah,at hamdan,cir all noting this exception for the purpose of determining whether a conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude.if the statute is divisible,we look to the record of conviction to determine whether the conviction was necessarily for a particular subsection of the statute that meets the criterion here,that of involving fraud or deceit.in the case of guilty plea convictions,the supreme court has held that examination of the record of conviction for this purpose may include consideration of the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.shepard united states,d concerning the assessment of a prior burglary conviction as a violent felony for sentence enhancement p
