petitioner muhammad butt,who intends to seek adjustment of status if and when an immigrant visa becomes available to him,seeks review of a june,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming a january,decision of the immigration judge ij denying butt application for a continuance of his removal proceeding and ordering him removed.butt argues that the ij abused her discretion in denying the continuance while his employer application for a labor certification,which must be approved before butt may seek an immigrant visa,was pending.but before reaching that issue,we remand the case to the bia to consider,in the first instance,antecedent questions regarding butt eligibility for adjustment of status,the answers to which may bear on any subsequent consideration of whether the ij abused her discretion in denying the continuance.
background 
butt,a native and citizen of pakistan,entered the united states without inspection in february and shortly thereafter sought to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident under.as set forth in more detail below,because butt entered without inspection,he may apply for adjustment of status only if he is grandfathered as the beneficiary of either a petition for classification under section of the immigration nationality act ina or a application for a labor certification under section a a of the ina.furthermore,he must establish that he was physically present here on december.i c.then,if grandfathered,he may apply for adjustment of status under id.i.
butt first sought grandfathering and adjustment of status on the basis of a section petition for classification filed by his wife.he married a citizen on april,and,shortly thereafter,his wife filed a form petition to classify butt as an alien relative,and he filed a form application to adjust status on the ground that his wife had filed the form.both the and the were denied on may,apparently because butt was a no show and thus defaulted.joint appendix.
the immigration and naturalization service commenced removal proceedings in july.after butt failed to appear for a hearing,the ij ordered him removed to pakistan.subsequently,butt moved to reopen the removal proceedings,and the ij granted the motion.butt then advised the ij that he intended to seek adjustment of status on the basis of an immigrant visa,and that the prerequisite application for a labor certification,filed by butt employer on or about december,and accepted for processing on january,was pending he then requested a continuance of his removal proceedings while the application was pending.the ij denied the request because the fact that there is a pending labor certification is grounds for an adjournment,particularly considering how long labor certifications take and there no guarantee that they be approved.because butt did not apply for and was ineligible for any other form of relief,the ij found him removable and ordered him removed to pakistan.as already noted,the bia affirmed without opinion in june.butt filed a timely petition for review of that decision 
ii.analysis 
before us,the parties have principally argued whether it was an abuse of discretion for the ij to deny a continuance while the application for a labor certification was pending.but we decline to consider that question at this time and instead remand the case to the bia to consider antecedent questions regarding butt eligibility for adjustment of status,the answers to which may bear on any subsequent consideration of whether the ij abused her discretion in denying the continuance.
as noted above,because butt entered without inspection,he may apply for adjustment of status only if he is grandfathered under i.id.i a i.to be grandfathered,the alien must be the beneficiary of either a petition for classification under section of the ina,id,filed on or before april,id.i b,or an application for a labor certification under section a a of the ina,id.a a,filed on or before april,id.i b.in addition,if the petition or application was filed after january,the alien must have been physically present in the on december.id.i c.then,once grandfathered,the alien may apply for adjustment of status,which the attorney general may grant if the alien pays a fine filing fee of,id.i,and a the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence and b an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed,id.i.
we remand to the bia to consider a whether butt is grandfathered,viz.whether butt was physically present in the united states on december,and whether the section petition for classification benefitting butt was approvable when filed,as required by a i a and b if butt is in fact grandfathered on the basis of the section petition for classification,whether he may then seek adjustment of status under i on the basis of an immigrant visa 
simply put,if butt is not grandfathered or if he may not apply for adjustment of status on a basis other than an approved section petition for classification,he is ineligible for adjustment of status.accordingly,we grant the petition,vacate the bia decision,and remand the case to the bia to consider these questions in the first instance.
whether butt is grandfathered under i 
was butt physically present in the united states on december,
first,we remand the case to the bia for a finding on whether butt was physically present in the on december.because the section petition for classification benefitting butt was filed after january,to be grandfathered,butt must show that he was physically present in the on december.i c.n clarifies that the alien bears the burden of proof on this question and specifies particular types of evidence that will satisfy it.
in its supplemental brief,the government argues that butt has not met his burden because there is no evidence in the record,of the sort sanctioned by n,that establishes his physical presence in the on december.furthermore,while the section petition for classification and corresponding adjustment of status application claim that butt entered the on february,and the notice to appear states that he entered the on or about february,the visa petition filed by butt employer states that he entered on april,though the government concedes that this date,which is the date on which butt married his wife,is probably a typographical error,see gov t supp.ltr,dated july,at.butt does not address this argument in his supplemental submission.
if butt was not physically present on december,he is not grandfathered,and if he is not grandfathered,he is ineligible for adjustment of status.because the agency has not made a finding on this question,we remand the case to the bia to do so and to remand to the ij if necessary.
was butt section petition for classification approvable when filed 
second,we remand the case to the bia to determine whether the section petition for classification benefitting butt was approvable when filed within the meaning of a i a.
as noted,to apply for adjustment of status as an alien who entered the without inspection,butt must be grandfathered under i.butt is the beneficiary of a section petition for classification filed on or before april,and,we assume,for purposes of this discussion,that he was physically present in the on december.he therefore satisfies the express statutory requirement set forth in i.
but the implementing regulations impose additional requirements,including that the petition or application be approvable when filed 
grandfathered alien means an alien who is the beneficiary of 
a a petition for classification under section of the act which was properly filed with the attorney general on or before april,and which was approvable when filed
