this case raises the question of whether the immigration and naturalization service the ins or the service the basis of information that was available to the service at the time of an alien original proceedings,and subsequent to the entry of a final order of move to remand a case to the immigration judge ij in order to lodge additional grounds for removability.the petitioner appeals from the judgment of the district court raggi,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.we conclude that the board of immigration appeals the bia or the board acted contrary to its own precedents when,in the absence of any previously unavailable evidence,it granted the service motion to remand petitioner removal proceedings.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case to that court with instructions to grant the petition.
background 
petitioner norman johnson petitioner or johnson,a citizen of jamaica,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.between november and december,petitioner was convicted five times of marijuana related offenses on november,october,and may,petitioner pleaded guilty to criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree,in violation of new york penal law.on january,and december,petitioner pleaded guilty to criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree,in violation of new york penal law.
a.the administrative removal proceedings 
in july of,the ins began removal proceedings against johnson as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,a a iii,and as an alien convicted of a crime related to a controlled substance,a b i.in the charging document,and at the hearing before the ij,the ins relied solely on petitioner may,conviction.on august,the ij found petitioner removable on the basis of this conviction.the ij decision was affirmed by the bia on january.
shortly thereafter,johnson succeeded in having his may,judgment of conviction vacated pursuant to new york criminal procedure law h.under bia precedent,a criminal conviction that has been so vacated does not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes.in re,bia.accordingly,on march,the ins moved both to reopen and to remand petitioner removal proceedings.in its motion,the ins conceded that the vacatur of petitioner may,judgment of conviction rendered that conviction an inadequate factual predicate for finding petitioner to be removable.but the service nonetheless suggested that termination of removal proceedings was not warranted.instead,it asked that the case be remanded so that it could amend the charging document to include petitioner other marijuana convictions.the petitioner did not file a response to the ins motion.subsequently,the bia granted the motion to reopen as unopposed.the bia opinion included the further order that the record be remanded to the immigration judge for further proceedings.
on remand,the ins amended the charging document to included petitioner four other marijuana convictions.petitioner,who was pro se,responded by filing a motion to terminate his removal proceedings.in that motion he alleged,inter alia,that the ins was barred by res judicata from bringing new charges against him.specifically,petitioner argued that his other marijuana convictions were known to the ins at the time of his initial removal proceedings,and,accordingly,that they constituted an improper basis for renewing removal proceedings before the ij.noting that the service had a full and fair opportunity to raise the other marijuana convictions in the context of the original removability proceedings,the petitioner argued that the ins should not be allowed to relitigate the issue of removability.
in an opinion dated september,the ij found petitioner to be removable as charged.the ij rejected petitioner res judicata arguments,concluding that the parties never had an opportunity to reach the merits of the present issues because the respondent in his original proceedings was not charged with convictions other than the may,conviction.the ij further stated that t he respondent argument that the service should have alleged all of his convictions in the first proceeding is without merit because t here is nothing in the doctrine of res judicata which requires the service to do so.
petitioner filed a timely appeal to the bia,requesting that the board terminate his removal proceedings.on february,the bia issued a decision denying petitioner request for termination and affirming the decision of the ij on the merits in its decision,the board rejected petitioner res judicata and collateral estoppel claims on the grounds that the convictions forming the basis of the new removal order had never been previously litigated by the parties.the board also noted that res judicata will not bar subsequent litigation if new evidence arises after the conclusion of previous litigation.the board did not clarify how this assertion was relevant,given that all of petitioner convictions were known or knowable before the end of the earlier litigation.
b.the habeas corpus proceeding 
on february,petitioner filed a habeas petition in the eastern district of new york pursuant to.in that petition,he challenged the bia january,at that time was still in alia on the grounds that his may,conviction should not be considered an aggravated felony.petitioner subsequently amended his petition twice to raise claims relating to the renewal of his administrative proceedings below.johnson amended petition alleged,among other things that the introduction of the new charges by the ins was barred by res judicata,that the bia erred in granting the service motion to reopen in the absence of evidence which was not available at the time of the previous proceeding s,and that petitioner convictions other than the vacated may,conviction did not constitute aggravated felonies.
despite the existence of a stay of removal,petitioner was removed from the united states on february.subsequently,on october,a status conference was held without petitioner,at which the district court raggi,addressed the merits of petitioner claims the district court found petitioner res judicata claims to be without merit for the reasons the government had argued in its papers,but sought additional information relating to whether petitioner convictions could be considered aggravated felony offenses.the district court did not specifically address whether the bia had erred in reopening and remanding petitioner removal proceeding in the absence of any previously unavailable evidence.
by letter dated november,the ins submitted the additional information requested by the district court.on december,the district court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus for the reasons stated on the record at the october,status conference.the petitioner appealed 
ii.discussion 
petitioner alleges that the board violated its own regulations in granting the service motion to reopen and remand his proceedings.before we can consider petitioner arguments,however,we must address the service suggestion that,for various reasons,we lack authority to hear the merits of petitioner appeal.
habeas corpus jurisdiction 
we have previously held that discretionary determinations made by the board of immigration appeals are not reviewable in the context of a habeas petition.sol ins,cir per curiam.the service contends that the bia decision to grant its motion to reopen and remand was discretionary,and hence outside of the scope of habeas review.
the ins,however,misapprehends the extent of the bia discretion to grant or deny such motions.the bia is required to follow the law,including ins regulations and bia precedents that impose mandatory limitations on the granting of procedural motions.while the bia has substantial discretion to grant or deny motions that fulfill those basic prerequisites,it is without discretion,when it deals with motions made by the parties,to ignore existing regulatory requirements.see,ins,cir reversing an ij decision to grant a motion to reopen where regulatory requirements were not met acevedo ins,cir per curiam noting that the bia would have been derelict in its duty had it granted a reopening in a case where the movant present
