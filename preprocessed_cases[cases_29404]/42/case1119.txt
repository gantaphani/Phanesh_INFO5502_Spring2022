background 
the smuggling scheme 
the jury heard evidence that lu and others operated a scheme to smuggle willing chinese aliens into the united states for an agreed upon price.in june,approximately of these aliens crowded onto an old fishing boat in the people republic of china prc and set sail for the western coast of canada.prior to boarding the vessel,the aliens were held in various houses and guarded by individuals armed with sticks and guns.
the fishing boat arrived in canada in july.there,snakeheads the name given to custody of the aliens,herded them into a large warehouse,and ultimately transported them to toronto,canada.while in the snakeheads custody in canada,several aliens received beatings from their escorts.eventually,the snakeheads smuggled the aliens into new york city where they were released after paying their respective smuggling fees.aliens who did not pay their smuggling fees,however,were held in various locations throughout the city by other snakeheads.these aliens were told that if their relatives failed to pay their smuggling fees,they would be held longer and beaten.
lu role in the smuggling scheme 
the government presented the testimony of yi ming li li,a snakehead who worked with lu and ultimately pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit hostage taking and one substantive count of hostage taking.li testified that he met with lu and an individual named xin ping ping at a chinese restaurant in brooklyn,new york in june.there,ping asked li to help with the alien smuggling operation by guarding the aliens once they arrived in new york city.li agreed.as a guard,li job was to hold the aliens who had not paid their smuggling fees and release them to their relatives only after their fees had been paid.li testified that during this meeting with lu and ping,ping told him that lu was one of the bosses of the smuggling operation,that li should consult lu if any questions arose concerning the smuggling operation,that li should take instructions from lu once the aliens arrived in new york,and that lu was the boss in new york.
in addition to guarding the aliens,li helped on the new york end of the smuggling operation by working with snakeheads from canada who transported the aliens into new york city.according to his testimony,li worked with two individuals in canada long jie jie and a man li knew only as japanese boy.according to li,japanese boy was the boss in canada.at japanese boy direction,jie would transport small groups of aliens on the last leg of their trip from canada to new york city.once in new york city,jie would call li and set up a meeting point.li would then meet jie and pick up the aliens.
after li picked up a group of aliens from jie in new york city,his practice was to call lu and ping to determine whether to hold the aliens and whether the aliens were customers of lu or ping.if the aliens were customers of lu,li transferred them to lu or individuals working under lu.in total,li and another guard he hired,ben yong zhang,picked up eight different groups of aliens brought to new york city by jie.each group consisted of three or four aliens.
li testified that when the first group of aliens arrived in the middle of july,jie contacted him and told him to bring to a meeting place where jie would drop off the aliens in exchange for the money.the represented jie fee for bringing the aliens from canada to new york city.when li learned of this fee,he called lu and told him that he needed to pick up the first group of aliens.lu responded by delivering the money to li house later that evening.li then called jie to set up a meeting in brooklyn where the two exchanged the money for the first group of aliens.several days later,lu supplied li with another to pay jie for the second group of aliens transported to new york city.
the first two groups of aliens that arrived in new york city were customers of ping.the third group belonged to lu.after li picked up this group from jie,he drove them to flushing,new york and delivered them,at lu direction,to a person named fei jei.fei jei worked for lu,helping him transport,hold,and guard the aliens.the fourth group of aliens that li retrieved from jie belonged to ping.the fifth group of aliens that arrived in new york city included four female aliens.according to the list of customers kept by lu and ping,this group belonged to lu.li testified that after he picked up the fifth group of aliens,lu instructed him to take them to li apartment and hold them there for a short period of time.later,lu met li at the apartment,went inside,and told the aliens to hurry up and pay the money.he also threatened them,telling them that if they did not pay,they would be beaten forced to pay an additional each.li heard lu conveying this same message over the phone to relatives of the aliens.li testified that the aliens appeared nervous and scared after hearing lu threats.during this same visit to li apartment,lu ordered li to beat one specific male alien who,after being held for two days,had not yet paid his smuggling fee.lu also instructed li to rent a basement in which to hold certain aliens who had not yet paid their fees.of the remaining three groups of aliens smuggled into the united states by jie,one belonged to lu and two belonged to ping.
after being informed by a confidential source that chen was about to be released at a specific location in new york city chinatown,ins agents observed lu arrive at that location.there,lu met with chen relatives and accepted a brown paper bag from them.shortly after the exchange of the brown paper bag,another asian male arrived in a separate vehicle and released chen to the same relatives who had turned over the brown paper bag to lu moments before.
testimony of smuggled aliens zehng rong xiao and chen 
the government also presented the testimony of two smuggled aliens chen and zheng rong xiao xiao.xiao,a male,testified that he and his family made arrangements for the snakeheads to smuggle him into the united states for.according to xiao testimony,the smugglers were to be paid after xiao was delivered to his relatives in the united states.while traveling across canada,xiao learned that the snakeheads had increased the smuggling fee from to.when xiao arrived in new york,contrary to the earlier arrangement to which he had agreed,his smugglers told him that he would be released to his relatives only after he paid the new fee.because he could not come up with this additional money,xiao was held in li apartment for approximately three days.xiao testified that during these three days,he wanted to be released in his words the sooner he was released the better.xiao also testified that at various points during his travels from the prc to new york city,he witnessed snakeheads beat two aliens,was warned by snakeheads not to attempt to flee,did not know where he was,and did not dare to run away.xiao ultimately was freed when ins agents raided li apartment in august and arrested li,xiao and five other aliens who had been smuggled into the united states.
chen testified that she had arranged for the snakeheads to smuggle her into the united states in exchange for.on,chen conceded that her agreement with the snakeheads required that she pay them before she could be released.like xiao,chen testified that throughout her journey from the prc to the united states,she witnessed snakeheads carrying sticks and beating other aliens.she testified that watching the snakeheads physically abuse the other aliens scared her.
when chen arrived in new york city,she had no money and did not speak english.because she was unable to pay the fee,she was held in an apartment in the city for twenty days.during this period of time,chen testified,she was very anxious and wanted to get out sooner,but was precluded from doing so.in addition,chen was only allowed to go outside the apartment once,was prohibited from seeing any family members,and was threatened with being sold to a prostitution house if she was unable to pay the fee.finally,on august,chen was let go after her relatives paid lu less than the fee.
the defendant case 
lu presented the testimony of two aliens who were on the fishing boat that arrived on the western coast of canada in july.these aliens claimed to be related to lu.they testified that lu paid their smuggling fees,but that he played no further role in the smuggling operation.lu also presented the testimony of an assistant united states attorney who conceded that during a proffer session with li,li told him that some of the aliens,in fact,were related to lu.
procedural history 
trial commenced on november,and on november,the jury found lu guilty on all four counts charged in the indictment.on january,lu moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure and for a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.in this combined motion,lu argued that there was insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could have concluded that he held chen,who was the subject of the substantive charge of hostage taking,against her will.specifically,lu argued that chen was not detained,as required under the hostage taking act,because she had earlier agreed to accompany the snakeheads and had agreed that she would not be released until payment was made.lu made a similar argument with respect to the charge that he conspired to commit hostage taking.the government filed opposition papers,and on may,the district court issued a written decision denying lu motions.
on august,the district court sentenced lu principally to months imprisonment.in arriving at this sentence,the district court imposed a enhancement pursuant to,because it found that lu was a leader or organizer in criminal activity that involved five or more persons or that was otherwise extensive.on august,lu filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence supporting lu conviction under the hostage taking acta.standard of review 
a defendant challenging his verdict on sufficiency grounds bears a heavy burden.united states mccarthy,cir citation omitted.we must affirm a conviction if,viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states samaria,cir quoting jackson virginia,d.when reviewing such challenges,w e defer to the jury determination of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses,and to the jury choice of the competing inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.united states morrison,cir citation omitted.
b.the merits 
the hostage taking act provides,in pertinent part,that 
whoever,whether inside or outside the united states,seizes or detains and threatens to kill,to injure,or to continue to detain another person in order to compel a third person or a governmental organization to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the person detained,or attempts or conspires to do so,shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life and,if the death of any person results,shall be punished by death or life imprisonment.
a.to obtain a conviction under the hostage taking act,the government must prove that the defendant seized or detained another person,and threatened to kill,injure,or continue to detain that person with the purpose of compelling a third person or governmental organization to act in some way,or to refrain from acting in some way.see united states lin,united states,cir united states,cir.
on appeal,lu challenges only the first requirement as it applies to both the conspiracy and substantive counts of hostage taking.he contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that there was a seizure or detention within the meaning of the hostage taking act because the aliens consented to being smuggled into the united states by virtue of their unwritten smuggling agreements.lu maintains that because the evidence showed that the aliens were held in a manner contemplated by their respective smuggling agreements,no seizure or detention occurred.
in making this argument,lu relies on the ninth circuit recent decision in united states,cir,cert.denied.there,defendants involved in an illegal alien smuggling operation similar to the one described above challenged their convictions under the hostage taking act.see id.at.they maintained that the evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions because they had never increased the aliens smuggling fees beyond the amount initially agreed on.see id.at.affirming the convictions,the court of appeals rejected the defendants challenge and held that the aliens had been seized or detained within the meaning of the hostage taking act from the time the defendants began to hold them in a manner that was not contemplated in the alien smuggling agreement.id.emphasis added.at that point,the court explained,the aliens were no longer consensually in the custody of the smuggling defendants.id.assuming the converse to be true,lu contends that because he held the aliens in a manner that was contemplated by the smuggling agreement,no detention occurred.
the conspiracy count 
even if we construed in the manner advanced by lu,it provides him little help with respect to the conspiracy count.the evidence adduced at trial shows that at least one alien,xiao,was detained in a manner not contemplated by his smuggling agreement.
as recounted earlier,xiao testified that his initial smuggling arrangement provided that lu and the snakeheads would smuggle him into the united states for a fee of,and that xiao or his relatives would pay that fee after xiao release.xiao testified that during his journey across canada,he was told for the first time that the snakeheads had increased the smuggling fee by.he further testified that once he arrived in new york,he was informed,contrary to the original terms of his initial smuggling arrangement,that his relatives would be required to pay the snakeheads before xiao was released.because the two most material terms of the smuggling timing and amount of the altered after xiao consented to being detained,an argument based on must fail.the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for the jury to conclude that xiao did not consent to the materially different smuggling arrangement he was held to after his initial consent was given.in any event,as the discussion of the substantive count below explains,a smuggler compliance with the terms of a smuggling contract does not matter if the person detained wants to go free.
the substantive count 
if lu view of represented the only way the government could prove a seizure or detention under a in the context of an illegal smuggling operation,his argument on appeal would have more force when applied to the substantive count involving chen.the evidence at trial showed that chen agreed to pay the snakeheads to smuggle her into the united states.on,chen conceded that she agreed to pay her fee as a condition release to relatives in new york.ultimately,however,chen was unable to pay the full smuggling fee and,after being held for twenty days,she was released to her relatives for less than the amount she and the snakeheads initially agreed on.
however,does not define the outer limits of what constitutes a detention for the purpose of the hostage taking act in the context of an illegal smuggling operation.while the government may satisfy the detention element by showing that an alien was held in a manner that was not contemplated in the alien smuggling agreement,at emphasis added,we reject lu position that this represents the only way in which that element can be established.we hold instead,as at least one other court has,that a hostage is seized or detained within the meaning of the hostage taking act when she is held or confined against her will for an appreciable period of time,at.
aside,lu seems to argue that the evidence was insufficient to establish a seizure or detention because the words seize and detain imply a lack of voluntariness,which is absent in chen case because she manifested her consent to be held by agreeing to the smuggling arrangement described above.because that arrangement contemplated,from the outset,that the snakeheads would hold chen until she paid her fee,lu contends that any subsequent restraint was voluntary regardless of any fear or anxiety felt by chen.underlying lu argument in this respect is the assumption that an alien initial agreement to accompany his smugglers precludes a finding of later detention.the hostage taking act,however,does not require that a seizure or detention be against a hostage will from its inception.see,at.t hat the hostage may initially agree to accompany the hostage taker does not prevent a later seizure or detention within the meaning of the hostage taking act.id.cases decided under the federal kidnapping statute,which makes it unlawful to seize or confine a person under certain circumstances,provide further support for this interpretation of the detention element of the hostage taking act.see united states eagle thunder,cir holding that victim initial consent to accompany kidnapper did not preclude kidnapping conviction where victim was later detained united states wesson,cir per curiam upholding conviction under federal kidnapping statute where victim may have initially agreed to accompany defendant but where victim later expressed her desire to go home.in view of these decisions,we conclude that chen initial consent to be smuggled into the united states does not preclude lu conviction as long as the evidence was sufficient to prove that,at some point,chen was held against her will for an appreciable period of time,at see also id.at t he dispositive question is not whether the hostages initially agreed to go to the hostage taker house,but rather whether the hostages later were detained or confined there against their will.a person who agrees to be confined,held for ransom,and beaten may nevertheless unilaterally revoke that arrangement at any time,and the contractual nature of the detention does not run counter to a finding that a person who wishes to be free is being detained against her will.it is no valid objection to say that such derogation of the smuggling contract removes the financial incentive to smuggle undocumented aliens.
to prove that an individual has been held against her will,the government need not show that the defendant actually used physical force or violence to restrain that person.see id.at united states macklin,cir noting that to be convicted of kidnapping,a defendant must use some means of or threatened,physical or mental so that the victim is taken,held and transported against his or her will emphasis added.in finding the detention element of a violation met,a jury is entitled to rely on evidence showing that the defendant threatened,frightened,deceived or coerced his hostage so as to cause the hostage to remain under the defendant control.see,at holding that evidence was sufficient to show that defendant frighten ed and deceiv ed the hostages sufficiently to cause them to remain at his house macklin,at.
the fifth circuit decision in provides an illustrative example of how a detention can occur even in the absence of physical restraint.the defendant in that case accepted from four guatemalan aliens in exchange for his help in smuggling them into the united states to see a family member.see,at.after the aliens and the defendant made their way across the border,the defendant and another individual took three of the aliens to the defendant home where they remained for approximately eight days.see id.during this time,the defendant called the family member that the aliens intended to visit and demanded that the family member pay in exchange for the safe delivery of the aliens.see id.at.authorities arrested the defendant while he was attempting to collect the ransom,and he ultimately was convicted of three counts of hostage taking.see id.
on appeal,the defendant argued that there was not enough evidence to show that a detention had occurred because he had neither threatened the aliens with injury nor physically restrained them.see id.at.the aliens,he maintained,were always free to leave.see id.the court rejected this argument,explaining that the defendant failure to physically restrain or threaten his hostages does not mean that he did not seize or detain them within the meaning of the hostage taking act.id.at.it is enough,the court held,that the defendant frightened or deceived the hostages sufficiently to cause them to remain in his house when they would have preferred to join their family member elsewhere.id.at.
the fifth circuit concluded that the aliens disabilities,coupled with the defendant threats and deceptions,caused the aliens to remain with the defendant.see id.at.specifically,the court highlighted the aliens lack of familiarity with the new country in which they found themselves,their inability to speak english,and their lack of resources with which they could have escaped.see id.at.in addition,the court pointed to the defendant warning to the aliens that if they left his house,they would be apprehended by ins officials and deported.see id.based on this evidence,the court explained,a reasonable jury was entitled to conclude that the aliens were held against their will.see id.at.
the evidence presented in this case,like that described in,supports the jury conclusion that lu seized or detained chen within the meaning of the hostage taking act.like the aliens in,chen was frightened by her smugglers.describing her transport from the prc to new york city,chen testified that she witnessed the snakeheads administer beatings to other aliens smuggled alongside her.one such beating occurred after a snakehead discovered that a hole had been scooped out next to a window in one of the safehouses where chen and others stayed while making the trek across canada.believing that one of the aliens had dug the hole in an attempt to escape,the snakehead proceeded to beat the alien.chen testified that watching the snakeheads physical abuse of other aliens scared her.
chen fear carried over to the time she spent in new york city prior to being,in her words,let go.after arriving in the united states,she and three other female aliens were taken to a new york city apartment.chen remained in the apartment for twenty days,more than two weeks longer than any of the aliens who accompanied her.when asked at trial why she st
