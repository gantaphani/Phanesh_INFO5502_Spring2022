shou wei jin petitions for review of the final order of the board of immigration appeals affirming the immigration judge denial of his claims for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act,et.jin,a citizen of china,asserts that he is entitled to refugee status based on the forced abortion of a woman he claims to be his wife.we disagree and deny the petition.
shou wei jin is a native and citizen of china.until he was,jin lived with his family in fuzhou city in fujihan province.in,he paid dollars for a fake passport and a plane ticket to the united states.he was detained at chicago airport and subsequently petitioned for asylum.
jin alleges that he fled china when a woman named yan lin,whom he has described at various points as his girlfriend,his fiancée and also as his wife,was forced by the chinese government to have an abortion.according to jin,he and lin exchanged promises to marry,and the couple families held a ceremony to announce their marriage on january.however,because they were underage,the couple was unable to register their marriage with the chinese government or to obtain a birth permit.
in april,a routine medical examination at a local hospital revealed that lin was pregnant.shortly thereafter,according to jin,she went to live with a relative in another country out of fear that she would be forced to have an abortion if her pregnancy were discovered.jin gives the following account of what happened next three months after the couple learned of lin pregnancy,government officials came to jin house looking for lin and threatening to arrest jin.when jin learned of this visit,he stayed overnight with a friend and left fuzhou city the following day.after consulting with his parents,jin decided to flee for the united states.he made it as far as chicago,where he was detained by the ins.lin was not so lucky she was caught by family planning authorities and forced to terminate her pregnancy.
jin conceded removability and petitioned for asylum and withholding of removal the ij denied jin petition.first,the ij found that jin was not actually married to lin.second,the ij found that jin had not shown that underage husbands of pregnant wives suffer persecution because of china family planning policy.the bia affirmed the ij finding that jin and lin were not married without comment,and also found that jin had not shown that he had a fear of future persecution due to his resistance to china population control policies.
both asylum and withholding of removal require the petitioner to demonstrate,at a minimum,that he has a legitimate fear of persecution.however,the standard for withholding of removal is higher,requiring the petitioner to show a clear probability of persecution.see ins,d zeqiri mukasey,cir.accordingly,we begin our analysis with jin asylum claim if he can not show that he is entitled to asylum,then a fortiori he can not show that he is entitled to withholding of removal.
we review the denial of asylum for substantial evidence,upholding the denial of relief so long as it was supported by reasonable,substantiated,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.a,at.toptchev ins,cir.where,as here,the bia adopts the ij reasoning and offers additional commentary,we review the ij decision as supplemented by the bia.binrashed gonzales,cir.
congress has given the attorney general the discretionary authority to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee because he or she is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of his or her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.at issue is whether jin qualifies as a refugee entitling him to asylum under section a of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira.codified at a b,which provides 
a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
jin argues that he qualifies as a refugee under this provision because he was lin husband,and therefore lin persecution can be imputed to him.jin first claim points to troubling issues regarding the ij decision.however,jin second claim is clearly foreclosed by settled law.
as to jin first point,there was a fair amount of record evidence that he and lin were not actually married.first,lin referred to jin as her fiancé in a letter addressed to the ij.second,jin himself initially indicated that he was not married on his asylum application.indeed,during the proceeding itself,jin characterized his marital status as single,but i engaged.thus,while jin went on to testify that he was actually married to lin and that the couple was not permitted to register their marriage because they were underage,the ij was not required to credit this inconsistent testimony.
however,the ij did not explicitly find that jin testimony that he was married to lin was.instead,the ij somewhat puzzlingly held that jin was required to prove that chinese law recognizes the existence of marriage.the ij thus,the bia decision adopting this incorrect as a matter of law.a marriage is one that takes legal effect without license or ceremony.black law dictionary ed.a traditional marriage,by contrast,occurs when a couple has a marriage ceremony but is unable to register their marriage,zhao holder,cir.where a traditional marriage ceremony has taken place,but is not recognized by the chinese government because of the age restrictions in the population control measures,that person nevertheless qualifies as a spouse for purposes of asylum.zhang gonzales,cir citing ma ashcroft,cir.in the present case,jin affidavit states that my parents organized a small scale banquet to announce the marital union between yan lin and me to members of two families.from then on,yan lin and i started living together at our home.while the ij was not legally required to credit this claim,he was not entitled to disregard it based on the conflation of two separate forms of marriage,or on erroneous assumptions concerning jin burden of proof.
although the ij legal error gives us a different record may well have justified a remand would be futile in this case because jin presented no evidence that he personally suffered persecution as a result of china population control policies.instead,jin initially suggested that he is entitled to asylum based on lin persecution under matter of,bia en banc,which held that spouses of victims of forced abortions,as well as the victims themselves,are automatically eligible for asylum under iirira section a.id.at.after jin perfected his appeal,however,the attorney general overruled matter of.see matter of,spouses are not entitled to the same per se refugee status that a b expressly accords persons who have physically undergone forced abortion or sterilization procedures.under the attorney general current policy,in order for a spouse who has not physically undergone a forced abortion or sterilization to qualify as a refugee under a b,he or she must show persecution or a fear of future persecution based on his or her failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or other resistance to a coercive population control program.id.at.
the procedural history of matter of is worth recounting.prior to iirira,the bia had held that victims of involuntary abortions and sterilizations would not be entitled to asylum t o the extent that such a policy is solely tied to controlling population,rather than as a guise for acting against people for reasons protected by the ina.matter of chang.congress enacted iirira for the express purpose of overturning this policy.see.i,at the primary intent
