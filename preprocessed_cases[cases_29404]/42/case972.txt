petitioner felix norbert siewe,a native and citizen of the republic of cameroon,seeks review of a november,order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming without opinion the january,decision of immigration judge ij michael straus,which denied siewe application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.in re siewe,felix norbert,no,aff g immig.city.siewe claims that the ij adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence because the ij erroneously resorted to speculation and conjecture when assessing the evidence,and because any inconsistencies relied upon by the ij are immaterial and easily and reasonably explained.we conclude that the ij incredulity was supportable by siewe submission of a suspect document,and that the ij finding that an arrest warrant was inauthentic rested on permissible inferences rather than bald speculation.since the ij decision is thus supported by substantial evidence,the petition is denied.
asylum application may 
in may,siewe applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat.his application stated that he was born in may in cameroon that his wife and two children continue to live in cameroon and that he was subjected to political persecution by reason of his affiliation with cameroon largest opposition party,the social democratic front sdf,which is led by john fru ndi.the claimed particulars were 
i siewe joined the sdf in,was in charge of activities from,and served as secretary in charge of organization and coordination from 
ii in the elections,siewe was campaign manager for an sdf candidate for the national assembly,nintcheu 
iii siewe was arrested on june,two days before cameroon national elections in order to prevent the story of the election frauds from coming out,and subsequently detained in various cells without charge for ten weeks,during which time he was fed only twice,beaten,and tortured and 
iv he will be arrested,tortured or executed if he returns to cameroon because he has information about massive fraud in the elections.
asylum officer interview june 
an asylum officer interviewed siewe in june,and concluded that siewe was not credible primarily because dates given for important events were inconsistent.
according to the asylum officer typed report,siewe claimed that he was named nintcheu campaign manager at the beginning of june for elections then scheduled for june,that two days before election day on june,he joined many sdf members outside a government office,where they protested that they had not yet received voting cards required for balloting that on the morning of election day the government postponed the elections for one week,to june,that he returned to the government office on june,and threatened an election boycott unless the voting cards were timely issued that he was arrested leaving work the next afternoon,taken to the judicial police office,transferred that night to another prison,and held there in the same cell for ten weeks and that he was finally released outside a hospital when he became ill.
to evidence his appointment as nintcheu campaign manager,siewe presented a letter,which was dated june,and which,as the asylum officer observed,listed the date of the elections as june.as of the june date of the letter,however,the election was scheduled for june,as siewe stated and as evidenced by the state department cameroon country report.it was not until after the opening of the polls on june,that the election was postponed to june.bureau of democracy,human rights,and labor,dep t of state,cameroon country reports on human rights,available at.gov g drl rls hrrpt.htm last accessed.the asylum officer therefore found t he validity of this document highly suspect and decided that siewe failed to sustain his burden of establishing that he is a refugee.
the asylum officer expressed other doubts as well siewe application said he was detained in various cells and prisons after he was taken to the police station,yet siewe stated in his interview that he remained in one cell throughout his detention the protests in which siewe claimed to have participated were unreported in the press and siewe claimed that he left cameroon on a passport in his own name notwithstanding a pending warrant for his arrest.
ij hearing january 
at the hearing conducted by the ij,siewe represented by counsel generally repeated the accounts given earlier,with some elaboration,some explanation for inconsistency,and some additional documentary evidence.
siewe testified that after his arrest he was beaten at the douala police station,and then held at another prison for ten weeks in a single cell with twenty other prisoners,where they slept on the floor,used buckets for toilets,were fed only twice three or four pieces of bread,and were beaten with belts on the chest and wooden sticks on the legs and feet siewe stated that one prisoner died.siewe testified that he was never charged or permitted to see a lawyer that he was left for dead in front of a hospital in douala where he was treated for two weeks that when he left the hospital,he hid with his brother in a suburb of douala,during which time siewe wife told his brother the police came looking for him and killed his dog and that he twice returned to work so that he could seek and get a vacation letter,which he used to obtain a visa.
siewe acknowledged that his asylum application omitted some of the events and facts to which he had just testified,including being left for dead at the hospital,and the visit by police who killed his dog,but explained that after starting to give a detailed account in his application,he was forced to abbreviate things to reduce the cost of translation.when asked why he omitted these events and facts when he was interviewed by the asylum officer,siewe testified that the asylum officer would let me answer except to the question that he was asking.also,he asserted that he told the asylum officer that he was left for dead when he was dropped at the hospital,and could not understand why the officer only wrote that he became ill.as to certain of the inconsistencies observed by the asylum in various cells rather than one,and membership in the sdf since rather than blamed the interpreter who assisted with the asylum application.
siewe was questioned by the various inconsistencies in the documentary evidence.siewe submitted a photocopy of the arrest warrant that he claimed was posted at his house after he left the hospital.siewe testified that he forgot to keep the original,and that he carried the photocopy with him when he left the country supposedly as a fugitive because his wife friend was a police inspector at the airport and facilitate d his departure from cameroon.siewe did not know why the warrant,which purported to have been signed by the commander of the national police,would acknowledge the existence of political police frankly,a lot of things are done at the local police level without the acceptance or acknowledgment of the higher ups in government.nor could he explain why the warrant stated that he had five children,when siewe testified that he had two.
siewe also submitted two letters purporting to have been signed by a local sdf president,one tchamambe the first attested to siewe party membership,and the other helpfully recited that siewe found himself obliged to disappear for an unknown destination after the elections on june,as a result of persecution,physical torture and detention during which he was abused.the ij confronted siewe with a publication by the british foreign office that states the sdf is aware that some cameroonian asylum applicants have submitted letters and documents purporting to have been issued by the sdf in support of their applications for asylum.the sdf have stated that such letters of support could only be issued by the chairman of the sdf,john fru ndi.siewe explained that the local president hesitated,but that siewe begged him to sign it because the letters would have made it here in time if they had to be signed by chairman ndi.siewe added that,because the local president was not authorized to send such letters,he refused to send siewe the original version of the letter,and only sent a copy.
siewe submitted a medical certificate dated september,days after he was purportedly admitted to the that siewe claimed that he was a victim of police brutality,and documenting m ultiple contusions,a painful tumefaction of the soles of the feet and a penetrating wound in the sternal region of the chest.siewe testified that he awoke in the hospital on september,and immediately asked for the document in order to present it to a human rights organization.when asked why the certificate did not mention that he was testified to receiving food only twice during his testified that this was a minor detail which he did not share with his doctor.
siewe was not asked why the june letter appointing him nintcheu campaign director,which purported to have been written at a time when the elections were scheduled for june,stated that the elections were scheduled for june.
ij decision 
in an oral decision,the ij found that siewe evidence and testimony were not to be believed.based upon this adverse credibility finding,the ij found that siewe was ineligible for asylum because he failed to establish past persecution or a reasonable possibility of future persecution if he returns to cameroon that siewe thus necessarily failed to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution,making him ineligible for withholding of removal and that siewe could not prove either past torture or a probability of torture if he returned to cameroon,and thus was ineligible for cat relief.
on february,siewe appealed the ij decision to the bia.on november,the bia affirmed,without opinion.siewe appealed to this court on december.
on appeal,siewe attacks some of the on which the adverse credibility finding rests.among other things,siewe attacks as mere speculation and conjecture the finding that the arrest warrant was inauthentic,an argument that misses the difference between speculation and inference.see point iv,infra.siewe does not meaningfully challenge certain other of the ij findings,including the finding that the letter appointing him campaign manager was finding that subverts siewe credibility in other respects.see point v,infra.
siewe advances the following challenges to the following factual findings 
a the ij concluded that siewe photocopied arrest warrant was inauthentic because i the ij disbelieved siewe explanation for obtaining only a copy of the arrest warrant,and not the original ii the warrant incorrectly stated the number of siewe children iii an authentic arrest warrant signed by the commander of the national police likely would not acknowledge the existence of political police or political prisoners and iv the undoubted existence of corruption in cameroon did not suffice to support siewe account that he was able to leave cameroon in his own name carrying his own arrest warrant because his wife bribed an airport official.siewe challenges this finding of inauthenticity,claiming that the ij engaged in mere conjecture and speculation.
b the ij did not credit siewe explanations for omitting various events from his asylum application and asylum officer interview.the ij deemed significant siewe participation in the june,violence because it apparently gave rise to his arrest.siewe asserts that this omission should be discounted because he did not testify that his involvement led to his arrest,but rather that he was arrested because he advocated a boycott of the elections.the ij also doubted siewe testimony that while he was in hiding,the police visited his home and killed his dog,because siewe did not mention the incident in his application interview.siewe argues on appeal that he considered this event to be relatively insignificant.
c the ij concluded that the two letters purporting to be from the local sdf first attesting to siewe membership in the sdf,and the second to his claimed inauthentic because i sdf rules only allow chairman ndi to sign such letters ii the second letter stated that siewe disappeared after the elections,which was inconsistent with his testimony that he was arrested three days before those elections and iii siewe submission of the fraudulent sdf letter purporting to appoint him nintcheu campaign manager see discussion infra,tainted the authenticity of the two other sdf letters.siewe argues that the ij should have credited his the local sdf president hesitated but eventually agreed to send the letters after siewe that any discrepancy was minor.
d the ij doubted siewe testimony that he was left for dead outside the hospital after ten weeks imprisonment because it was inconsistent with his statement to the asylum officer that he was released after he became ill,and because it was inconsistent with his application,which does not mention his release at all.siewe claims that these inconsistencies are collateral to the central basis of his claim and resulted from mistranslation.
e the ij found that the medical report was fraudulent because it did not mention that siewe was malnourished,as he must have been after being starved for ten weeks.siewe the ij finding as only criticizing the absence of a complete medical record and responds to the ij skepticism about siewe request for a medical report as soon as he emerged from a coma,by citing his explanation that he asked the doctor to prepare a document for presentation to a human rights organization.siewe therefore effectively leaves unchallenged,the ij finding that the absence of reference to siewe stated condition renders the medical report suspect.
f the ij concluded that the letter purporting to appoint siewe as nintcheu campaign manager was fraudulent,reasoning that on june,the elections were scheduled to be held on june of.the court therefore finds that this does not appear to be a valid document as the elections were not postponed to the until the last minute.siewe argues,without any apparent basis,that the ij rejected the letter because it appointed siewe less than three weeks before the elections were scheduled.that is plainly not the reason given by the ij.and thus siewe does not meaningfully challenge the ij finding.
when,as here,the bia affirms without opinion pursuant to e,we review the ij decision directly.jian hui shao,cir see,li hua lin dep t of justice,cir.we review the ij factual findings under the substantial evidence findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see zhou yun zhang,cir.
when a factual challenge pertains to a credibility finding we afford particular deference in applying the substantial evidence standard,mindful that the law must entrust some official with responsibility to hear an applicant asylum claim,and the ij has the unique advantage among all officials involved in the process of having heard directly from the applicant.zhang,at internal quotation marks omitted.the fact that an ij has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an application can not insulate the decision from review.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.but our exceedingly narrow review of a credibility finding,melgar de torres reno,cir,ensures only that it is based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.zhang,at see also,cir stating that an adverse credibility finding must be based on specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the applicant credibility internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
even when an ij decision contains errors,we may nevertheless deem remand futile and deny the petition for review if substantial evidence in the record relied on by the ij,considered in the aggregate,supports the ij finding that petitioner lacked credibility,and disregarding those aspects of the ij reasoning that are tainted by error,we can state with confidence that the ij would adhere to his decision were the petition remanded.singh,cir per curiam quoting xiao ji chen dep t of justice,cir.
as to the authenticity of his arrest warrant,siewe argument that the ij findings are based upon mere conjecture and speculation elides the distinction between fair inference and bald speculation.
