opinion of the court 
introduction 
petitioner father was killed in cold blood,and the government concedes that he is dead.that what preceded and followed the event on which her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat was almost exclusively based.in his apparent zeal to deny relief to petitioner,however,the immigration judge,donald ferlise,came to the conclusion that the father is alive.
t he court is strongly persuaded and tends to believe that the respondent father is indeed alive and is not dead if this is true then the respondent entire case dissolves right in front of our eyes the case is nothing but a fraud that is being perpetrated upon this court.
app.at see also id.at t he fact that the respondent father is indeed alive is a very,very important issue in this case.in concluding that the father is alive,judge ferlise utterly ignored undisputed evidence of the father death and shored up his conclusion with evidence he had excluded,evidence that actually corroborated the fact of the father death.his conclusion do es not flow in a reasoned way from the evidence of record and is arbitrary and conjectural in nature.dia ashcroft,cir en banc.it is more puzzling than plausible,more curious than commonsense.id.at.the petition for review will be granted,and the case will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
ii.facts and procedural history 
seemad fatima shah has a master of arts in international relations from the university of karachi.she and her husband,khurram aijaz,are natives and citizens of pakistan.they are both muslims and mohajirs muhajirs shah and aijaz entered the united states on october,as nonimmigrant visitors authorized to remain here through april.on may,shah,in addition to seeking withholding of removal and relief under the cat,submitted an application for asylum on behalf of herself and her husband in the application,shah stated that she was seeking asylum for the following reason

my father syed abid hussain was killed by terrorist on,he was shot dead by the persons who are patronized by police there were two main factors for his killing,first he was mohajir immigrant,second he was shia,they too are being victim of persecution.
since the killing of my father,my whole family was uprooted we could not live properly in pakistan,we were unable to live in any part of pakistan as police and other security agencies threatened severe consequences os we try name the culprits.my life was in continuous danger,i was not free to move freely due to continuous threats by security agencies as well as by fundamentalist who are being given full protection by the government.
in the month of september security agencies threatened me and family of severe consequences if we try to proceed further for the inquiry of fathers killing,so mother who is very upset after the death of my father advised me to leave pakistan immediately,so i had to leave pakistan in a hurry as my life was in danger,i had to leave my newly born son also.for this reason i am seeking asylum in united states.
