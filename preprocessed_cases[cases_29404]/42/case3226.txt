at the outset of her removal proceedings,odilia de jesus velasquez escovar gave immigration officials her current address in los angeles.but those officials did not properly record it.instead,they recorded another outdated address and then sent velasquez hearing notice there.velasquez never got that notice and,without it,she did not know when to appear for her deportation hearing.understandably,she failed to appear and was ordered removed in absentia.when she found out about that order,velasquez moved to reopen.an immigration judge denied that motion,and the board of immigration appeals affirmed.in so doing,it abused its discretion.accordingly,we grant velasquez petition for review.
odilia de jesus velasquez escovar is guatemalan.she illegally entered the united states around,settling in los angeles.she has four children two are citizens of the united states.she admits that she remains here unlawfully.
in,velasquez returned briefly to guatemala.on her way back to los angeles,she was pulled over in refugio,texas,by local police.those officers called federal immigration officials,who met velasquez at the calhoun county jail.there,she admitted her alienage and was transported to the corpus christi border patrol station for processing.
velasquez claims that the corpus immigration officials asked her for her current address.she says that she told them that she and her daughters had just moved to vanowen street,van nuys,california.next,she claims she was asked whether she had ever lived at valerio street in los angeles.petitioner says she told them that she had lived at valerio street,but that the vanowen address was her current one.velasquez says the agents told her that they found the valerio address by looking up her identification number,which she assumes meant the number on her california state identification card.
after velasquez with a notice to appear nta,immigration authorities released her.the nta charged her as removable and ordered her to appear in los angeles for an immigration hearing at a date and time to be set later.the nta mistakenly listed the valerio street address as velasquez current address.we do not know whether velasquez noticed the error,but we do know that she never brought it to the government attention.
nta in hand,velasquez returned to california.since her return,she has lived at the vanowen address.she spent roughly six months regularly visiting an attorney office to check on the status of her case.eventually she gave up.having received no further word from the government,she assumed her case had been closed.she was wrong.fifteen months after velasquez stopped visiting the lawyer which was almost two years after she was arrested in texas the immigration court mailed a notice setting a date and time for velasquez to appear.the notice went to velasquez old address on valerio street,not her current address on vanowen.velasquez did not receive the notice,did not appear,and was ordered removed in absentia.a copy of the removal order was sent to the valerio address and returned as undeliverable.
roughly six months later,velasquez was detained by immigration and customs enforcement.the record does not say why.while detained,she learned of the outstanding removal order and immediately filed a motion to reopen.she argued that she should not have lost her right to a hearing because the government improperly recorded and then sent notice to an old address,rather than the current one she claims to have given them.the government argued that it was her burden to tell it that it had the wrong address because she should have noticed the error on the nta.the ij agreed with the government and denied the motion to reopen.the bia dismissed velasquez appeal of that denial.velasquez now petitions for review.
we have jurisdiction under a.our review includes the validity of the notice provided to the alien and the reasons for the alien absence from the hearing.b d.
we review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.hamazaspyan holder,cir.here,the bia reviewed the ij decision de novo,so we review only the bia decision.hosseini gonzales,cir.the bia abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily,irrationally,or contrary to the law.lainez ortiz ins,cir.
there is only one question here did the bia abuse its discretion when it decided that velasquez was not entitled to notice under the immigration statutes the answer is yes because neither of the bia two reasons support its decision.it is arbitrary to discount petitioner unrefuted claim without providing a reason.
the immigration statutes governing notice do three things 
they create a right to notice 
they create an exception to that right for aliens who do not fulfill two simple obligations and 
they describe those obligations.
two provisions create the right to notice.first,a requires that in removal proceedings written notice in this section referred to as a notice to appear shall be given in person to the alien or,if personal service is not practicable,through service by mail specifying t he time and place at which the proceedings will be held.sometimes the nta leaves the hearing time to be set,as it did here.section a a covers those cases and cases where hearings are continued i n the case of any change or postponement in time and place a written notice shall be given in person to the alien or,if personal service is not practicable,through service by mail.between them,these two provisions create,at a minimum,a right to written notice serv ed by mail.a a.
that right is subject to subparagraph b.id.subparagraph b creates the exception a written notice shall not be required if the alien has failed to provide the address required under paragraph a f.a b see also b b identical exception in provision dealing specifically with absentia proceedings.the address required language refers to the section that describes the two simple obligations that aliens must perform to retain their right to notice.
those two obligations are 
t he alien must immediately upon service of the nta provide or have provided the attorney general with a written record of an address and telephone number if any at which the alien may be contacted respecting the removal proceeding,and 
the alien must provide the attorney general immediately with a written record of any change of the alien address or telephone number.
a f i ii.these are the only two obligations that the statutes impose on aliens.a regulation,as we will see,may add a third.
put simply,aliens are entitled to notice unless they fail to give a current address to the government or fail to let the government know when they move.here,velasquez did neither.she claims that she gave the corpus immigration officials her current address on vanowen street and that she never moved.nothing in the record refutes either claim.accordingly,the statutes entitled her to notice.
the bia contrary decision was an abuse of discretion.the bia decided that velasquez was not entitled to notice for two reasons.first,the bia concluded that velasquez was not entitled to notice because she failed to provide the government with her address the respondent was informed of her obligation to inform the immigration court of her mailing address.she did not do so.the respondent therefore is not entitled to receive actual notice of her hearing.just before it wrote that velasquez did not tell the government her address,the bia wrote that velasquez allegedly informed the dhs that she was living with her daughters at vanowen street.
in other words,the bia concluded that velasquez did not provide her current address after acknowledging that she claims she did.this is arbitrary because the bia gives no reason for discounting velasquez claim.and there is no reason it could give.the claim is facially plausible and supported by velasquez declaration.there is no contrary evidence,and no adverse credibility finding.so far as we can tell,the bia disbelieved velasquez for no reason.it can not do that.
the bia second reason is no better.the bia wrote that even assuming velasquez told the officer that valerio was her prior address and that officer misunderstood valerio to be her current address,
