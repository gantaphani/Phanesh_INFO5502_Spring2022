kumar spoke to other constables about the mistreatment,many of whom used to say that this is really,really very bad,very bad.that they should not do this,that they bring people in and torture them like that.the men who were tortured did not call the constables for help.at the hearing kumar was asked why he did not do more to help the prisoners.kumar replied that he wanted to do more but that he was just a constable.
during his final month at the intelligence agency,kumar applied for the position of head constable.he qualified for the position because he had worked three years for the police and had passed a test called the b exam,offered once every three years.he took the test on january,and became a head constable on january.the duty of the head constable consists primarily of supervising constables and ensuring that they stand at their posts.kumar did not witness any of his four subordinates mistreating any prisoner.
three days after being promoted to head constable,kumar spoke to inspector singh about the abuse he had witnessed.he told inspector singh of an incident regarding a boy,jasbir singh,who had served in the police force with kumar.the intelligence agency had suspected jasbir of being an extremist and had imprisoned him in the havalaat.jasbir had died.kumar told inspector singh that this was not correct,and that it is really,really wrong that he jasbir had died injustly.inspector singh responded by calling kumar bad names.kumar stated,he started saying to me whether it is wrong or right,this is not your duty.this is not within the scope of your duty.inspector singh said,k eep your mouth shut.if you see these things again,just disappear from my presence.

the day following his conversation with the superintendent,kumar was transferred from the agency,having served nineteen days as head constable.his duty was to supervise four officers who patrolled the residence of a higher official.at times he was also assigned to patrol a bank or a bazaar.his work was fine because there is no brutal beating that you see and you just do your work.
kumar also testified that,after he left the intelligence agency,a friend of his warned kumar that kumar safety was in danger.the friend,now the bodyguard of an official,asked kumar what had taken place with superintendent pal.kumar told his friend,i said to him i did complain.i only said to him that i informed him as to whatever was going on was not correct.the friend urged kumar,i f you see something use caution,and stated that his superintendent pal men may,might kill you.
ten days after the conversation with superintendent pal,in february,kumar told his supervisors that he was going to spend his one day holiday in his own village in fardipore,where his brother and parents resided.however,afraid of retaliation,he decided not to return to his own village,and instead stayed with his in sujanpore.several days later,his brother told him that four men with guns and dressed in civilian clothes had come to the family home.kumar brother told them that kumar was not there.the men accused his brother of lying and said that kumar had told them that he would be there.at the hearing kumar was asked why,assuming these men worked for superintendent narrinder pal,they could not simply look for kumar at the police line,where presumably they would have known where kumar was assigned.kumar explained that these men were likely police cat s,meaning that they worked for high officials and were policemen,but they were not officially police.their work was not for the police but private.kumar explained,it like this.when i was at the police line then these civil people over there can not touch you,can not kill you.
a month later,in march,kumar spent his one day holiday by seeing his sister,who lives in amritsar.kumar brother later told him that,on the day of his holiday,the same men with guns had again come to his home village looking for kumar.in april,kumar spent his one day holiday visiting the bazaar.he was dressed in civilian clothes.he spotted two of superintendent pal men coming behind him,following him.these men told kumar to stop,adding that they had to speak to him.kumar testified,and i thought if i were to stand near them,possibly they would kill me or they would harm me.and then i ran and got back to police line in tarn tarn.
around the time of the incident in the bazaar,kumar testified,i started thinking that it was okay for me to keep on living there.after that,i spoke to my father.i told him about all of these things.that those men who had come to their home,i had no idea who they were.that they would kill me.his father advised him to leave india and took kumar to delhi.his father spoke to people affiliated with the church,who helped kumar obtain a visa.kumar testified,i had come here to the united states to save my life and i saved myself.
at kumar hearing,the government attorney asked kumar what he would have done had he not been sent back to the police line.the attorney asked,y ou would have remained at the intelligence agency facility where you were at,is it true kumar replied,had i not complained,had i not spoken against my office it might have been possible i would have stayed.but since i did,i was transferred back.
