appellant eliseo cayabyab beltran,a resident alien native of the philippines,appeals from the february,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the august,decision of the immigration court ic denying beltran motion to his case following the ic order of deportation against beltran,entered in absentia when beltran failed to appear at a january,deportation hearing.
beltran claims that the ic abused its discretion in not his case and granting his motion under b a and c,because the ins did not establish by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that written notice of his deportation hearing was sent to the last address provided by beltran.b a.specifically,beltran claims that he did not receive notice of the deportation hearing because the bia continued to send all correspondence to beltran address,in spite of the fact that beltran had notified it,in writing,of his new address.
we reverse the decision of the bia and remand this cause to the ic with instructions to grant beltran motion to his case.we find that beltran had met the statutory requirements of a f,and notified the ins,in writing,of a change in his address.
beltran was born in the philippines in,and legally entered the united states on november,at the age of fourteen.on august,beltran was convicted of larceny in ann arbor,michigan,in violation of.compiled laws annot.he was sentenced to one year in prison.on december,beltran was convicted of first degree retail fraud,again in ann arbor,michigan,under.compiled laws annot.c.he was sentenced to a fine and three years probation.
on july,the department of justice issued an order to show cause and notice of hearing to beltran and subsequently scheduled a deportation hearing,seeking to remove beltran under a a ii of the version of the immigration and naturalization act ina in place at that time.a a ii.that section provided for the automatic deportation of an alien who had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.
beltran received the notice and sought to obtain a waiver of deportability under c of the ina,c.that section provided the ability for an alien,who is otherwise deportable,to request a waiver allowing him to remain in the country regardless of his convictions.the power to grant this waiver is at the sole and unfettered discretion of the ic.
the ic denied the c request and ordered beltran deported on february.beltran appealed to the bia which,on october,reversed and remanded the decision to the ic because the bia found that the ic did not adequately explain to beltran his right to counsel.
after the ic original february,decision,beltran apparently moved and established residence on ecorse road in ypsilanti,michigan.to report this,beltran filed an change of address form on august,informing the ins of his new address.he again filed an form on september,duplicating the august filing,and again providing ecorse road as his current address.however,sometime after september,beltran moved from his residence on ecorse road to his sister home on carpenter road,also in ypsilanti.on february,beltran had a personal representative from the wayne county neighborhood legal services wcnls send a letter to the ins,informing it of beltran new address.beltran did not provide this change of address on an form,and notice of the bia favorable decision,as well as the notice of hearing on remand,were sent to the ecorse road address.
on january,beltran remand hearing was held,but beltran was not present.the ic entered an order for deportation in absentia,pursuant to b a.that section provides that a ny alien who,after written notice does not attend a proceeding under this section,shall be ordered removed in absentia if the service establishes by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided 
on february,beltran was detained by the ins,and held for deportation.beltran filed a motion to his case on march.beltran argued to the ic that he had never received either the bia favorable decision,the ic notice of hearing on remand,or the ic order in absentia.moreover,he claimed that the february,letter from the wcnls satisfied his statutory duty to notify the ins of his whereabouts.he therefore argued that service of the notice of hearing on remand was not proper under c,which provides that a notice to appear,if served by mail,is sufficient if mailed to the last address provided by the alien in writing.emphasis added.
the ic denied his motion,acknowledging the ins receipt of the wcnls letter,but noting that the person who signed the letter was not an attorney but a law school graduate who had not passed a bar examination the ic stated that t here is nothing in this record that shows that either at the time or in the present that beltran authorized this individual to act on his behalf.the wcnls representative had not filed an appearance before the ic or the bia,and the ins therefore claimed to have no idea who he was.thus,the ic dismissed the wcnls letter as with the provisions of a f ii,which requires the alien to immediately provide a written notification of any change of address.
the bia denied beltran direct appeal on february.beltran filed a petition for review with this court on february.hence,his appeal is timely before this court under fed.a b.we granted beltran a stay of deportation,pending this appeal,on march.
ii.standard of 
we review the bia decision on a motion to for an abuse of discretion.see ins doherty,d ashki ins,cir.
jurisdiction in this case is governed by the ina,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira.see,pulice ins,cir.originally,of the ina granted the federal courts jurisdiction to review all orders of deportation.however,in,of the aedpa amended and limited federal jurisdiction.courts could no longer review an order of deportation against an alien who was convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude if each crime was punished by at least one year of imprisonment.
the iirira repealed entirely,and implemented transitional rules.section c g of the iirira applies to an alien,like beltran,whose deportation proceedings began prior to enactment of the iirira in,but who received his order of deportation more than thirty days after enactment.section c g replaced,yet similarly provides that 
t here shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a a ii of such act as in effect on such date for which both predicate offenses are,without regard to their date of commission,otherwise covered by section a a i of such act as so in effect.
as discussed above,a a ii,as it existed at the time of the iirira enactment in,rendered an alien deportable if he had been convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude,which were not part of a common scheme accordingly,c g denies an appeal to an alien if his two crimes of moral turpitude were otherwise covered by a a i,as it existed in,which referenced a crime of moral turpitude for which the alien either is sentenced to confinement or is confined therefor in a prison or correctional institution for one year or longer a a ii see also pulice,at 
the retail fraud conviction imposed no jail time at all on beltran.accordingly,because at least one of beltran convictions did not impose imprisonment of more than one year,his case is reviewable,and this court holds jurisdiction.
iii.analysis 
an alien may file a motion to his case pursuant to b c,after he has failed to appear at his deportation hearing.under that section,the alien may file the motion at any time if he can demonstrate that his failure to appear was due to the fact that he did not receive notice.b c ii.otherwise,he may only file a motion to if he does so within days and cites exceptional circumstances.b c i.
when an alien fails to appear for his deportation hearing,the ic may enter an order of deportation in absentia,pursuant to b a,but only if the ins establishes by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that written notice of the hearing was pro
