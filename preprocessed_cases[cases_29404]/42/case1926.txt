the difficult question presented in this matter lies at the nexus between criminal and immigration law.the united states appeals from the district court grant of a judgment of acquittal following a jury verdict which had found gilberto rubio lucio lucio guilty of possession of a firearm while illegally or unlawfully present within the united states pursuant to g a.lucio,an alien,had previously entered the country without authorization.he filed an application to adjust his immigration status to that of a lawful permanent resident.during the pendency of his application,he was authorized to work in the united states and deportation proceedings could not be initiated.on this basis,the district court found that lucio could not be charged with being illegally or unlawfully present within the united states given that he was authorized to remain in the county until the immigration and naturalization service ins adjudication of his application.we are constrained to hold that in light of recent precedent,if an alien immigration status remains unlawful during the pendency of an application to adjust that status,the mere fact that he has received permission to work in the country,and may not be deported,does not alter the initial unlawfulness of his immigration status.consequently,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
in,federal law enforcement officials began investigating security companies that had been employing illegal aliens as armed security guards for local houston,texas area businesses.on june,this investigation led the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf,along with other area law enforcement agencies to the la cucaracha nightclub in houston,where they encountered lucio who was working as a security guard.though lucio did not have a firearm on his person when law enforcement personnel arrived at the nightclub,they learned that lucio had discarded his weapon shortly before law enforcement arrival.a subsequent consensual search of his vehicle recovered a loaded caliber revolver.
lucio was charged pursuant to g a.the indictment provided that lucio had illegally possessed the firearm on february,he pled not guilty a jury trial was held,and on december,a verdict of guilty was rendered.on january,lucio moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure,or in the alternative,a new trial pursuant federal rule of criminal procedure.the basis for lucio motion was that because he had filed an application for adjustment of his immigration status,which was still pending at the time that he was charged with violating g a,he could not have been deemed to be illegally within the united states because he was lawfully permitted to remain in the country during the pendency of the application significantly,among the privileges afforded to an individual who has applied for adjustment of status is that he is allowed to remain in the country while his application is pending.see legal immigration and family equity act,stat,life act see also e.consequently,he argued,the necessary predicate to be charged under g a was absent as he was not illegally or unlawfully present in the united states.
the district court found lucio argument to be availing and granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on march,the united states timely appealed,arguing that irrespective of the pendency of lucio application for adjustment of status,he could still be charged under g a.
standard of review 
a motion for judgment of acquittal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to convict.united states medina,cir.when a district court grants a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to,the determination is not entitled to exceeding deference by this court.united states loe,cir.rather,this court must review the decision de novo,employing the identical standard as did the district court.id.under a de novo standard of review,this panel must assess whether a reasonable jury could have properly concluded,weighing the evidence in a light most deferential to the verdict rendered by the jury,that all of the elements of the crime charged had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.id.we are not required to analyze the evidence with an eye toward negating every possible inference of innocence,rather,if the fact finder was presented with sufficient evidence to support the verdict reached,that verdict must be upheld.id.
discussion 
the crux of the government argument is that despite the fact that lucio had filed an application to adjust his immigration status to that of a lawful permanent tolled the ins ability to deport him,and provided employment authorization until his application was pendency of the application did not proscribe lucio from being charged pursuant to g a.lucio counters by arguing that the district court grant of the judgment of acquittal was consistent with the basic intent of the life act regulatory scheme.our initial challenge therefore is to determine whether an alien who has filed an application for adjustment of has not yet been acted upon by the nevertheless lawfully within the united states for the purposes of g a.
it is uncontroverted that lucio illegally entered into the united states in.in,congress enacted the immigration reform and control act irca in an effort to formally legalize aliens who had illegally entered into the united states prior to january.see et.under irca terms,the alien had to meet a series of requirements before he could be termed a lawful permanent resident.see supra,note.first,the alien had to file an application for lawful temporary residence,which had to be granted by the ins.see a.thereafter,only then could the alien have his status adjusted to lawful permanent residence.id.at b.
pursuant to irca amnesty provisions,lucio filed an application to adjust his immigration status within the one year window articulated by the,and may.see a.testimony was presented at trial which suggested that his application was rejected by the ins on the basis that the agency had concerns about the fact that lucio had frequently left the united states in the period of time preceding the filing of his application.despite the fact that his application was not acted upon,lucio continued to live and work within united states for a number of years even though,technically,he was unlawfully present in the country given that he had unlawfully entered the united states,his alien status had not been adjusted,and his irca amnesty application had never been ruled upon.
thereafter,sometime between and he apparently filed an application pursuant to the ins legalization questionnaire program.it is helpful to note that several class action lawsuits were initiated stemming from problems,which occurred in the late,related to the ins implementation of irca amnesty provisions.see catholic social services,meese,vacated sub nom.reno catholic social services,d league of united latin american citizens ins,vacated sub nom.reno catholic social services,d and ins zambrano,d.as a result,aliens who filed nonfrivolous amnesty applications in accordance with irca,often had their applications improperly denied.
in an effort to remedy these problems,the ins allowed aliens living in the united states in an unlawful status to file legalization questionnaires to determine whether they had been by the ins.the phrase is a term of art describing instances where the ins had denied an alien irca legalization application on the grounds that the applicant had traveled outside the united states in contravention of ins guidelines.see,carlos holguin,peter schey and charles song,handling late amnesty cases practice and procedure under the ins legalization questionnaire program,interpreters releases.recognizing that countless aliens seeking amnesty under irca had their applications denied on very questionable grounds,the legalization questionnaire was intended to assist the ins to make a determination as to whether it had erroneously an alien during irca amnesty,through may.if the legalization questionnaire was approved by the ins,this would allow the alien to file a legalization application and,thereafter,the ins would issue the alien temporary employment authorization an
