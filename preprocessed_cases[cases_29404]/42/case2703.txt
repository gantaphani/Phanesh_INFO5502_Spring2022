george reddy ambati and his son,pranaykumar ambati pranaykumar,practicing christians and natives and citizens of india,seek review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing their appeals.the ambatis contend that the bia lacked substantial evidence for its determination that ambati failed to demonstrate either past persecution or fear of future persecution on account of his religion.they further contend that the bia erred in upholding the immigration judge ij denial of their request for a continuance to allow their attorney time to prepare their case.they also challenge the board conclusion that pranaykumar appeal was untimely.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm.
background 
the ambatis are practicing christians of the roman catholic faith.both ambati and his wife come from christian farming families who still reside in villages in india.they have two son born in india and a daughter born in the united states.although ambati resides with his son in the united states,his wife and daughter reside in india.ambati parents and all six of his brothers and sisters live in india in close proximity to one another.ambati supports his parents and siblings from his earnings in the united states.
a.ambati testimony before the immigration judge 
ambati completed both high school and college in india.he first arrived in the united states on a nonimmigrant student visa in.he received a master degree from oklahoma state university and,in,he returned to india.
ambati remained in india until.he lived and worked in nagpur,a city located miles from his native village where his parents still reside and operate a family farm.while in nagpur,ambati worked as an environmental scientist for the indian government from to.during this period,he experienced no difficulties in nagpur as a result of being christian and was able to attend church without physical handling by those hostile to christians.however,he was afraid of physical harm during his monthly visits to his parents in their village.
although ambati confirmed that his parents still regularly attended church in their village,he stated that his family had been subject to religious attacks for the last ten years.ambati explained that,as christians,his family was neither liked nor accepted by their neighbors.in fact,on several unspecified occasions,his father and his brothers were attacked and beaten at night while returning from the fields.in addition,hindu farm workers would steal from ambati father farm and would prevent other hindus from working there.
in,ambati again entered the united states on a nonimmigrant student visa,this time to pursue a doctorate degree at the illinois institute of technology in chicago.he explained that becoming a student was the only opportunity for him to leave a country he very much wanted to leave.soon after he arrived in chicago,he experienced serious financial difficulties that caused him to leave school and eventually move with his wife and two children to new york city to work.shortly after arriving in new york in,he,his wife,and his son applied for because they were alarmed by news from ambati parents that they were having difficulty with their crops and that ambati father had been attacked and beaten one night while returning home from the fields.
administrative proceedings 
with the help of an attorney,ambati filed a request for asylum in september and included his wife and pranaykumar in his application.he alleged that,as christians,he and his family had suffered persecution by hindus.responding to an order to show cause,ambati appeared at a deportation hearing in october without an attorney.the immigration judge explained in detail the purpose of the hearing as well as ambati rights in the proceedings.the ij then asked if the ambatis planned to retain counsel to represent them.when ambati replied that they did,the ij continued the hearing until may.the ij warned ambati,however,that he would grant no further continuances and urged ambati to tell his counsel that his hearing date would not be extended.
ambati retained counsel two weeks before his scheduled hearing and informed her that he previously had retained an attorney in new york in to assist him in filing his application for asylum.on may,ambati and pranaykumar appeared at the scheduled hearing,and their newly retained counsel requested a continuance.counsel explained that she had overestimated the new york attorney degree of involvement in the ambatis case the case had not been prepared for the hearing,as she had believed,and thus she did not feel prepared to go forward.the ij suggested to counsel that she could withdraw her notice of appearance and ambati could proceed pro se.the ij stated he would go forward with the hearing because not only had he granted ambati a continuance,but also had explained clearly that no further continuances would be given.when asked by the ij if he wanted the attorney to represent him,ambati stated that he did.during the course of the hearing,the ij specifically asked ambati whether he would leave the united states if ordered to do so.ambati replied,i beg your honor to help me to live here because of the serious problem which we are facing.
after considering the evidence the ij concluded that ambati request for asylum fell short of establishing either past persecution or a fear of future persecution.the ij determined that there was no basis to find that ambati suffered past persecution because ambati freely practiced his religion,worked in a government position,and was never tortured,detained,or threatened on account of his christian faith.moreover,the ij reasoned,the economic and physical hardships experienced by ambati father and brothers did not support ambati claim for asylum.lastly,the ij opined that ambati application for asylum was nothing more than a mechanism to prolong his stay in the united states.consequently,the ij denied ambati both asylum and withholding of deportation and ordered him deported to india.the ij refused to allow ambati voluntary departure because he found that ambati desired to remain in the united states at all costs.internal quotation marks omitted.as for pranaykumar,the judge also denied him both asylum and withholding of deportation,but granted him voluntary departure.finally,the judge terminated the proceedings regarding ambati because she had left the united states before the initial deportation hearing.
on appeal,the bia affirmed the ij decision and adopted his findings and conclusions insofar as they regarded ambati.in addition,the board found that,because ambati was allowed sufficient time to secure an attorney and prepare his case after the first continuance had been granted,the ij did not abuse his discretion when he refused to grant ambati another continuance.the bia reasoned that ambati received due process because he was on notice that the ij was unwilling to grant further continuances and that ambati was able to fully and fairly present his case.lastly,the bia determined that pranaykumar appeal was untimely because it had been filed well beyond the filing deadline of days after the ij decision.ambati now seeks review of the bia decision.
ambati argues that the bia erroneously concluded that his experiences in india,and those of his family members,did not amount to persecution in addition,he contends that the bia erred in upholding the ij decision in light of his due process challenge.the ij refusal to grant a continuance,ambati reasons,deprived him of his right to counsel and his right to present fully his case.finally,ambati challenges the bia unwillingness both to overturn the ij denial of voluntary departure for him and to consider the merits of pranaykumar appeal.we address each of these contentions in turn.
persecution 
ambati contends that the bia erred in denying him asylum because the evidence established not only that ambati and his family were harassed and abused,but also that the livelihood of ambati parents was impaired on account of the family christianity.we review the bia asylum determination under the substantial evidence test.see petrovic ins,cir quoting sivaainkaran ins,
