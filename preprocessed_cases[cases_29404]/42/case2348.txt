in july,the state of illinois charged with burglary in violation of ilcs a.the criminal information specified that committed the offense of burglary in that he,without authority,knowingly entered into a motor vehicle,to wit a chevrolet,property of suzanna alaniz,with the intent to commit the offense of theft,therein,in violation of chapter,act,section a.this crime is characterized under illinois law as a class felony.see ilcs b.for this offense,a sentencing judge may impose,alone or in combination,a period of probation,a fine,restitution,and a term of imprisonment,among other things.ilcs b.any term of imprisonment for a class felony may not be less than three years nor more than seven years.ilcs a.in august,pled guilty to that charge and was sentenced to eighteen months probation adherence to the conditions of his probation was unfortunately.on september,a scant six weeks after the guilty plea,he was charged with violating his probation.a charge of violating probation was entered again on november,and a warrant was issued for his arrest.a little more than three years passed before law enforcement again caught up with.on january,pled guilty to the probation violation illinois law provides that,for a violation of probation,a court may continue the existing sentence or impose any sentence that was available under section b.ilcs e.the court revoked probation and sentenced him to a term of three years imprisonment,the minimum term allowed for the crime of burglary.
approximately one year later,ice commenced removal proceedings against by filing a notice to appear nta with the immigration court.the nta specified that was subject to removal because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined by a g and a u.the original nta charged that,on january,had been convicted for the offense of intent to commit the offense of theft in violation of ilcs a.with the agreement of the parties,the ij amended the nta to state that,on august,was convicted of the offense of burglary in violation of ilcs a.admitted that he had been convicted of burglary but denied that he was subject to removal as an aggravated felon.the ij relied on this court decision in united states,cir,in holding that a burglary with intent to commit theft under the illinois statute was an aggravated felony because it was an attempted theft offense.the ij rejected contention that his conviction did not qualify as a felony because he originally was sentenced only to probation.the ij noted that the illinois statute allowed the state court judge to the defendant on the original charge for any violation of probation,and the state court had done so here,imposing a term of imprisonment.the bia dismissed subsequent appeal,agreeing with the ij that the illinois crime of burglary with intent to commit theft was an aggravated felony under.the bia also agreed that sentence for violating his original sentence of probation satisfied the statutory requirement for a sentence in excess of one year on the original conviction.petitions this court for review.
in his petition,he contends that the ij incorrectly construed his conviction for burglary to an automobile as an aggravated felony.he argues that the bia mischaracterized his conviction as one for attempted theft.he also asserts that is distinguishable and not determinative of his claim.the government contends that we lack jurisdiction over petition because a c deprives this court of jurisdiction to review petitions filed by aliens who are subject to removal as aggravated felons.we begin by addressing our jurisdiction to review the claim.
our jurisdiction is limited because the ina,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,strips the judiciary of authority to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.gattem gonzales,cir.see also a c,a a iii.the bia determined that committed an aggravated felony but we nonetheless retain the authority to determine our jurisdiction.eke mukasey,cir gattem,at ins,cir.moreover,the real id act of amended section a c of the ina to allow this court to review constitutional claims or questions of law.see a d eke,at stating the real id act put an end to any doubt that we are authorized to consider the question whether dhs correctly determined that a petitioner convictions were aggravated felonies for the purposes of the immigration laws.thus,to the extent that the bia holding turned on its construction of the immigration statute at issue,it presents a question of law that congress has given us the power to address.gattem,at.see also yang ins,cir w hen judicial review depends on a particular fact or legal conclusion,then a court may determine whether that condition exists.we therefore have jurisdiction to determine whether,as a matter of law,is removable as an aggravated felon,and in particular whether the crime for which he was convicted in illinois qualifies him for that status.eke,at gattem,at.see also gonzales,cir where a petition from a person ordered removed as an aggravated felon presents a question of law,the court has jurisdiction over the petition.our review of the determination that committed an aggravated felony is de novo.eke,at,at.
first contends that his removal order is not supported by clear and convincing evidence that he is subject to removal as an aggravated felon as that term is defined by a g and u hereafter subsection g and subsection u.under subsection g,an aggravated felony consists of a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.subsection u adds that an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the listed offenses,including a theft offense,also qualifies as an aggravated felony.the government sought to remove as an aggravated felon on the theory that his conviction for burglary to a motor vehicle with intent to commit a theft therein is an attempted theft offense for the purposes of immigration law.we have previously defined the term theft offense for the purposes of the ina as requiring the taking of property exercise of control over property,without the owner consent,with the intent to temporarily or permanently deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership,at.see also ins,cir.under illinois law,a person commits theft when he knowingly 
obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner or 
obtains by deception control over property of the owner or 
obtains by threat control over property of the owner or 
obtains control over stolen property knowing the property to have been stolen or under such circumstances as would reasonably induce him to believe that the property was stolen or 
obtains or exerts control over property in the custody of any law enforcement agency which is explicitly represented to him by any law enforcement officer or any individual acting in behalf of a law enforcement agency as being stolen,and 
a intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property or 
b knowingly uses,conceals or abandons the property in such manner as to deprive the owner permanently of such use or benefit or 
c uses,conceals,or abandons the property knowing such use,concealment or abandonment probably will deprive the owner permanently of such use or benefit.
ilcs.the illinois statute for theft thus employs the same two elements we used to define the generic term theft offense for immigration purposes exercise of control over property without the owner consent and the intent to deprive the owner permanently or temporarily of the use and enjoyment of that property.similarly,we have defined att
