this case causes us to review a denial of an application for asylum by a coptic christian egyptian national based on grounds of religious persecution.although the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the denial of asylum using its relatively new summary affirmance procedure,it should not have done so.basic flaws in the methodology and reasoning used by the immigration judge ij undercut his reasoning and so we remand.we reject the notion that a state department country condition report must specifically name a petitioner or his family members to be useful in the analysis of an asylum application.we also reject the notion that an ij,particularly in the absence of any adverse finding as to petitioner credibility,may simply ignore the need to make a finding as to whether petitioner has demonstrated past persecution on account of one of the specified grounds for asylum.but one swallow does not make a spring,and we reject again the petitioner wholesale attack on the bia summary affirmance procedure.
adel nagi el moraghy,a native and citizen of egypt,entered the united states in on a tourist visa,which he subsequently overstayed.in,el moraghy,a coptic christian,applied for asylum,citing incidents of persecution by islamic fundamentalists while he was a student in the southern egyptian town of assiut.his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat was rejected by an ij on may.el moraghy appealed this decision to the bia,which upheld without opinion the decision of the ij.see e.el moraghy,supported by amici curiae,now petitions this court for review of the bia decision.we remand for further consideration,finding that the ij improper use of state department country condition reports and failure to make findings as to past persecution or credibility prevent us from resolving the case on those grounds we take no view as to the petitioner eligibility vel non for any of the relief that he seeks.
el moraghy,then years old,entered the united states on a tourist visa at newark airport on february.he initially resided in oklahoma city with his maternal uncle,wagdy rizk,and later moved to milford,massachusetts.during this time,el moraghy received financial support from rizk and family in egypt.after the expiration of his tourist visa,el moraghy submitted an application for asylum on february,including a signed statement,dated january,detailing alleged incidents of persecution in egypt.on march,el moraghy was interviewed by an asylum officer who found him not credible.four days later,on march,the immigration and naturalization service issued a notice to appear to el moraghy for overstaying his visa.
el moraghy conceded deportability,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and under article iii of the cat.he said he sought to escape the persecution of the muslim fundamentalists in egypt,because i am a coptic christian.el moraghy alleged that his life had been threatened on several occasions because of his religious beliefs,aggravated by his friendship with a muslim woman.the egyptian government,he said,does little to protect christians from attacks of the muslim fundamentalists.according to el moraghy,if he were forced to return to egypt,he would be tortured or most likely killed by muslim fundamentalists.
at his june,hearing,el moraghy described a handful of purported instances of persecution in egypt.all of these incidents happened in or near assiut,egypt,a town six hours to the south of cairo by train,where el moraghy attended college.el moraghy is an active orthodox coptic christian who grew up in cairo.most egyptians are sunni muslims,but approximately ten per cent,or more than six million,belong to the coptic orthodox church.after his graduation from high school in,el moraghy was assigned by the government to attend college in assiut.el moraghy had no choice of where to attend college,and his later requests to transfer out of assiut were denied.we describe the five incidents as related by el moraghy,as to which the ij made no credibility finding.
the first incident occurred shortly after el moraghy arrived at assiut university in.el moraghy approached a group of students to ask them about class schedules.when the students noticed the cross tattooed on el moraghy right hand,they verbally abused him and then departed.no physical violence occurred at this time.a second incident took place in february.el moraghy was prevented from returning to his apartment by individuals who told him that he would defile the ground outside the mosque near his apartment,and that he had to wait until after friday prayers to return home.
the third incident took place on march.el moraghy met a girl he knew from church named enass abrahin zaki on campus.as they spoke,four students he described as members of fundamentalist groups surrounded them and told him that he was violating their rules by speaking with a woman.as el moraghy walked home afterwards,he was stopped by the same four individuals,who pushed him into a secluded area and began beating him.they hit him with belts and kicked him until they heard someone coming and ran away.during the beating they called el moraghy an infidel and an animal.el moraghy shoulder was dislocated,his glasses were broken,and he felt concussed as a result of the beating.he subsequently saw a doctor,who referred him to a hospital in assiut.el moraghy submitted a document purporting to be a certificate from mary medical center in assiut that stated that on march,adel nagi naser allah was examined and found to have a dislocated right shoulder,concussion,and scratches around the right eye.this could be the result of striking a rough solid object.the scratches around the right eye could possibly happen as a result of shattered glass.el moraghy said he stayed in the hospital for three days,but he did not report the incident to the police because he feared that the fundamentalists would find out and kill him.
a fourth incident occurred in.el moraghy was visiting a monastery,daral maker or dar el muhurak,more than an hour away from assiut.el moraghy hired a taxi to drive him part of the way back from the monastery.the taxi driver was playing an tape.el moraghy asked him not to play the tape because he was a christian the driver responded by forcing him out of the taxi,hitting el moraghy hard enough to cause bleeding from one ear,and leaving him on the highway.again,el moraghy did not report the incident to the police because he feared retribution.
the final incident grew out of el moraghy friendship with a girl,nadia ziki,a muslim who lived in assiut.el moraghy met ziki on the train in when she was visiting an uncle in cairo.they became friends,and ziki asked el moraghy to take her along to see the monastery.ziki said that,as an educated person,she wanted to go to see the monastery herself,even though it might be dangerous and she would be considered polluted in the eyes of fundamentalists.el moraghy eventually agreed to take her,and they went together five or six times.
on their last visit to the monastery,on july,they were stopped and forced out of ziki car on the way back to assiut by members of a group el moraghy identified as islamic fundamentalists.el moraghy and ziki were driven,blindfolded,to an unknown location.there they met with the group leader.the group leader told them that the group knew about the relationship between el moraghy and ziki,and that the only solution was for el moraghy to become muslim and to marry her.according to el moraghy,the relationship was a platonic one.el moraghy,the leader demanded,must convert from christianity to islam.when el moraghy said he could not become muslim,he was struck.a paper was brought to el moraghy,who was told that signing it would amount to a conversion.seeing no other way out,el moraghy signed the paper,which committed him to become a muslim.el moraghy and ziki were then told that they had to wait for the official in charge of conducting marriages to arrive,but it turned out that he was not available.they were then told that they could leave,but would have to return to complete the marriage.
afterwards,el moraghy took the train to cairo,where he met with a priest,named arsanwos basyeley ragheb,from his church.the priest told him he should flee,and recommended that he go to the marmina monastery in alexandria.el moraghy submitted a statement from arsanwos.in it,arsanwos recalled advising el moraghy to go to the mina monastery to escape the tremendous amount of psychological pressure that he was exposed to.arsanwos also said that he counseled el moraghy to stay in the united states to get away from th e difficult atmosphere he was living in.
el moraghy stayed at the monastery for a while,and then returned to cairo,where he resided with his grandmother.from november until february,el moraghy worked at the sonesta hotel in cairo as a cashier,because he needed certification of employment to be able to travel to the united states.el moraghy had previously worked at the sonesta hotel during summer vacations.during the two months before his departure,el moraghy did not return to his family home out of fear.he said that his mother had received anonymous calls inquiring if he was there.el moraghy theory was that he was a marked man,even in cairo,based on the earlier events and his signed promise and subsequent failure to convert to islam.
el moraghy uncle,rizk,testified at a second hearing on may,that el moraghy had told rizk that he had been beaten on multiple occasions,that his shoulder had been dislocated,that the trouble had been caused by his friendship,as a christian,with a muslim woman,and that his life was in danger in egypt.rizk had also spoken to el moraghy mother,both on the telephone and in person during a visit to egypt,and said that el moraghy family was very worried about him and feared that he would be harmed if he returned to egypt,but did not specify their reasons for the fear.rizk was by the ij about his statement that el moraghy had told him he had read the conversion document he had been forced to sign at the earlier hearing el moraghy had testified that he had not read the document.this discrepancy concerned the ij.
during the june hearing,el moraghy testified that none of his nuclear family members had experienced problems with islamic fundamentalists.he did know one friend was killed in egypt.but he remained afraid that he would be killed if he returned to egypt because once he had been identified by the fundamentalists as a target,he would remain a marked man.
el moraghy argued that the government could not control fundamentalists and did little to protect coptic christians.to demonstrate this,he submitted state department country condition reports for egypt and newspaper articles describing terrorism in egypt.according to the country condition report,there are significant legal and social impediments placed on christians in egypt.while coptic christians had previously been the target of violent assaults,there were no reports of terrorist attacks against christians during.the government had begun prosecutions against some perpetrators of previous attacks against coptic christians,but some members of the christian community do not believe that the government is sufficiently vigorous in its efforts to prevent attacks.the country condition report for had noted that coptic christians are the objects of occasional violent assaults by the islamic group and other terrorists.during,extremists were responsible for killing eight christians in the minya governorate near assiut.a country condition report described continuing violence against coptic christians,with at least killed,including a group of eight in assiut.
el moraghy also submitted numerous newspaper articles and other sources describing the history of persecution of coptic christians in egypt.the islamic terrorist group islamiya carried out attacks on coptic christians from on,operating mainly in the southern or upper regions of egypt,including minya and assiut governorates,but also in large towns such as alexandria and cairo.in may,thirteen coptic christians were killed in assiut in a single day.nearly thirty people were killed in assiut in two weeks in february.according to a human rights watch world report,eight or more coptic christian students were killed at a church youth group meeting in february in minya governorate.newspaper accounts also relate kidnappings and forced conversions of christians.
the ij issued an oral decision on may.he denied el moraghy application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat.he granted el moraghy request for voluntary departure.the ij noted that el moraghy had attached state department country reports for egypt for and,and other accounts of muslim fundamentalism in egypt,but said a review of those documents does not refer to the respondent or any members of his family in egypt.the ij dismissed the purported medical certificate from mary,saying that there were no hospital records to corroborate el moraghy account.furthermore,he declared 
outside of the respondent declaration of what happened to him in egypt,other than what the witness uncle has testified in this proceedings has told him after coming to the united states,there is not one scintilla or iota of evidence to corroborate the respondent declaration of what happened to him in egypt and why he left egypt and came to the united states.
the ij concluded that a person would not fear persecution,nor would persecution be likely if el moraghy were to return to egypt.the ij did not make any finding that el moraghy was not credible,nor did he address whether el moraghy had suffered past persecution.
el moraghy appealed the ij decision to the bia.on november,the bia affirmed without opinion the ij decision,relying on the summary affirmance procedure provided for in e.el moraghy,supported by amici now challenges the bia ruling,arguing that the bia affirmance was in error,and that the ij improperly failed to make a credibility finding or analyze whether el moraghy had suffered past persecution.el moraghy and amici also contend that the bia application of the summary affirmance procedure was in error,and that the summary affirmance regulations prevent judicial review of the bia actions.
