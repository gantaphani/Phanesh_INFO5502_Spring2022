dashdavaa javhlan,a native and citizen of mongolia,petitions for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia denying her applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.an immigration judge ij denied javhlan applications for relief and the bia affirmed without opinion pursuant to e.thus,we review the ij decision as the bia final determination.lanza ashcroft,cir.we have jurisdiction under.we grant the petition for review and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
we review a decision that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under the substantial evidence standard.ins.the bia can be reversed only if the evidence presented was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.id.
because the ij did not make an adverse credibility determination,we take javhlan testimony as true.navas ins,cir.the following facts are thus drawn from javhlan testimony at her hearing before the ij and from javhlan supporting documents.
javhlan grew up hearing her grandparents talk about their fears of communist rule in mongolia.she also heard the story of how her deceased paternal grandfather,a buddhist monk,was tortured and killed by agents of the communist government in.as an adult,javhlan refused to join the communist party.she also refused to serve as a spy for the communist secret police by acting as their eyes and ears at the mongolian british and indian embassies where the mongolian ministry of foreign affairs had placed her.at another time,javhlan worked at the united nations development programme undp in mongolia where again she was pressured and refused to spy for the secret police.
secret police agents approached javhlan frequently on her way to and from work and threatened her with assault,imprisonment,rape,and death because she refused to act as a spy for them.secret police agents told her,w e have the power to arrest you and we will show you that there not a life of prison.we can do anything.we can rape you.we will show you what misery is all about.in june,a secret police captain named ganbold arrested javhlan and took her to a prison,where she was interrogated for four to five hours.captain ganbold shouted at javhlan that she was a traitor for not helping her country.javhlan was terrified that she would not survive.eventually,javhlan was released from custody without any explanation.as javhlan was leaving the prison,the agents warned her that she was fortunate this time,but that she would not come out alive next time.javhlan continued to receive phone calls and threats from secret police agents after this unexplained detention.javhlan was stopped by secret police agents on the street and interrogated about why she was not cooperating with the secret police.javhlan was warned that her family would face serious consequences if she did not cooperate with the secret police.
from to,the people democratic party was in power in the government and the secret police called javhlan less frequently.but when the mongolian communist party regained power in,javhlan testified that the threats from the secret police agents became more powerful.at this time,javhlan was working for the undp and the secret police agents wanted her to provide information about united nations representatives.captain ganbold threatened to tell javhlan supervisors at the undp that she was a prostitute and a spy.javhlan was very afraid that captain ganbold would carry out these threats and,even worse,that she would be arrested and jailed again.javhlan was accosted by secret police agents in the streets,who threatened javhlan with assault,imprisonment,torture,rape,and death.javhlan began to change her work habits,hoping that she would escape these continuing threats and harassment from secret police agents.as a result of these constant threats and harassment,javhlan contemplated suicide 
javhlan suffered mentally and physically as a result of the secret police harassment and threats.in september,javhlan developed a paralysis on the left part of her face because of the stress of the threats and thinking about what would happen to her as a result of her refusal to cooperate.in may,javhlan husband was suddenly fired from his job at the water supply economy company without explanation.
this followed a phone call javhlan received from the secret police warning her that after she had refused for so many years to do her duty for her country,it was time for her country to deal with her.she was also told during this same conversation that the next time she was arrested she would be raped.javhlan and her husband decided to flee mongolia because they believed this was the only way to avoid harm.
after javhlan and her husband left the country,the secret police contacted javhlan mother and brother demanding to know javhlan and her husband new location.when javhlan mother and brother refused to provide the requested information,the secret police threatened that they would be punished.on december,javhlan brother car was firebombed one day after the secret police visited him demanding to know javhlan whereabouts.
javhlan submitted to the ij an affidavit from a native mongolian,gonchigdamba bayarsaikhan bayarsaikhan,who suffered constants threats and survived an assassination attempt when his car exploded after he refused to act as a spy for the communist secret police at the foreign embassies where he worked.bayarsaikhan stated in his affidavit that the mongolian secret police are capable of visiting untold acts of horror and devastation on its targets the ij did not question the credibility of bayarsaikhan affidavit.
although the ij did not question javhlan credibility,the ij denied javhlan applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection because the ij concluded that javhlan had not suffered past persecution and had not established that she had a fear of persecution if she were to return to mongolia.the ij concluded that javhlan subjective fear of returning to mongolia was genuine,but that there is no objectively reasonable basis for a fear of future persecution.the ij cited no cases to support her legal conclusions,nor did the bia.the bia affirmed without opinion.we disagree.
a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that javhlan suffered past persecution on account of her political opinion.the evidence demonstrates that javhlan suffered multiple confrontations with communist secret police agents,and that she was frequently threatened over a period of years with assault,imprisonment,rape,and death because she refused to act as a spy for them.the threats by the secret police,and the mental anguish and physical paralysis that javhlan suffered as a result,constitute persecution.we find that the cumulative effect of these events qualifies as an offensive suffering or harm that rises to the level of persecution.
we have held that threats of serious harm may constitute persecution.mashiri ashcroft,cir,amended by.lexis cir.although we have found that unfulfilled threats alone generally do not rise to the level of persecution,see hoxha ashcroft,cir,we have held that ongoing threats,harassment,and close confrontations amount to persecution.see thomas ashcroft,cir threats of violence and death are enough to constitute persecution.internal quotation marks and citation omitted ruano ashcroft,cir finding persecution where the asylum applicant received multiple death threats over a period of six years and had near confrontations with his persecutors sangha ins,cir holding that recruitment attempts and death threats are sufficient to show persecution.
in determining whether multiple threats and incidents of harassment constitute persecution,we view them cumulatively.mashiri,at surita ins,cir.t he severity of harm is compounded when incidents of persecution have occurred on more than one occasion,particularly where an applicant is victimized at different times over a period of years.baballah ashcroft,cir internal quotation,citation,and ellipsis omitted see also ashcroft,cir finding it improper for the ij to treat the petitioner personal experiences as if they had occurred in a vacuum,even though the petitioner personal experiences of persecution occurred a decade apart.here,javhlan hour detention may not by itself amount to persecution.because reasonable minds could differ on whether this single incident constitutes persecution,the record does not compel a finding that it does.the ij,however,erred by viewing this incident in isolation,holding that the only incident javhlan encountered was in when she was briefly held for four or five hours.this unexplained detention is not the only mistreatment javhlan suffered she was threatened numerous times and over a period of years with assault,imprisonment,rape,and death,threats that escalated in severity over time.thus,the ij erred in relying only on this detention to find that there was no past persecution,particularly in light of the frequent harassment and serious threats the secret police agents made to javhlan life and safety.
we have also held that persecution need not be physical.see,e,kovac ins,cir explaining that persecution requires harm or suffering,not necessarily physical harm kahssai ins,cir per curiam reinhardt,concurring the fact that petitioner did not suffer physical harm is not determinative of her claim of persecution there are other equally serious forms of injury that result from persecution.mashiri,at persecution may be emotional or psychological as well as physical.knezevic ashcroft,cir stating that persecution may come in the form of threats,harassment,or mental,emotional,and psychological harm khup ashcroft,cir finding threats,combined with anguish suffered as a result of the killing of a fellow burmese preacher,to constitute persecution.in this case,javhlan received many threats to her own life and suffered mental anguish as a result.javhlan contemplated suicide and suffered a nervous breakdown.this mental stress led to a partial stroke in the left part of her face,which occurred about a year before she fled mongolia.the cumulative effect of the constant threats by the secret police combined with the mental anguish and physical paralysis that javhlan suffered as a result constitute persecution.thus,javhlan credible testimony and corroborating evidence compel a finding of past persecution.
either past persecution or a fear of future persecution provides eligibility for a discretionary grant of asylum.ratnam ins,cir.javhlan has demonstrated her eligibility for asylum under both of these standards.
first,because javhlan suffered past persecution,there is a rebuttable presumption that she has a fear of future persecution,and the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that she no longer has a fear.b see also tawadrus ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the government did not make any argument before the ij or the bia concerning changed country conditions,nor did the government present any evidence,including documentary evidence,for that purpose.we decline to grant the government another opportunity to do so.see baballah,at.in these circumstances,to provide the ins with another opportunity to present evidence of changed country conditions,when it twice had the chance,but failed to do so,would be exceptionally unfair.thus,javhlan has established her eligibility for asylum based on past persecution.
second,javhlan has also established her eligibility for asylum based on a fear of future persecution.to establish a fear of persecution,javhlan needed to demonstrate she subjectively fears persecution and that her fear is objectively reasonable.ahmed keisler,cir.because javhlan testified credibly that she genuinely fears harm,the subjective prong of the fear test is satisfied.id.further,there is substantial evidence that javhlan has an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.the substantial evidence includes the threats made to javhlan life and safety by the secret police before she fled mongolia the affidavit submitted by another mongolian native,whose veracity the ij never questioned,who was personally threatened and survived an assassination attempt because of his refusal to spy for the mongolian secret police the continued questioning of javhlan mother and brother by secret police agents about javhlan whereabouts after her departure the threats secret police agents made against her mother and brother when they refused to tell the secret police agents javhlan whereabouts and the bombing that blew up and destroyed javhlan brother car one day after her brother refused to tell the secret police javhlan whereabouts this evidence clearly shows at least a chance of future persecution sufficient to establish a fear.gonzales,cir ins,cir.therefore,we conclude that javhlan is statutorily eligible for asylum.
to qualify for withholding of removal under b,an alien must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds.al harbi,at internal quotation marks omitted b.past persecution,however,also generates a presumption of eligibility for withholding of removal.see b i mousa mukasey,cir ins,cir.because the government has not rebutted the presumption of a fear of future persecution,javhlan is also entitled to withholding of removal under b.
to qualify for protection under the cat,javhlan must establish that it is more likely than not she would be tortured if removed to mongolia.kamalthas ins,cir quoting c.the ij denied javhlan cat protection because she found that javhlan failed to meet the lower standard for asylum and therefore necessarily failed to meet the heightened standard of a clear probability of torture.because we conclude that the ij erred in finding that javhlan did not meet the standard for asylum,we remand to the bia to determine whether javhlan satisfies the standard for cat protection.see ins ventura,see also mohammed gonzales,cir u nlike in the case of asylum and withholding,the showing of past torture does not give rise to a regulatory presumption of fear of future torture citing c.
we therefore conclude that javhlan suffered past persecution and that she has shown a genuine and fear of future persecution should she return to mongolia.under these circumstances,javhlan is eligible for asylum.we also conclude that javhlan is entitled to withholding of removal.we remand this case to the bia for the attorney general to exercise his discretion under b as to whether to grant javhlan asylum,and for an appropriate order withholding removal of javhlan.we also remand to the bia for consideration of whether javhlan is entitled to withholding of removal under cat.
petition granted remanded for further proceedings.
the majority confidently takes over the ij role,combing the record to support its determination that javhlan suffered past persecution.but congress and the supreme court have rejected the majority approach.by statute,the agency administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b emphasis added.said otherwise,t o reverse the bia finding we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion,but compels it see ins.because the agency determination here is supported by substantial evidence,i respectfully dissent.
the ij conclusion that javhlan has not suffered past persecution is well supported by the record.we have defined persecution as an extreme concept,ghaly ins,cir quoting fisher ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted,involving the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ in race,religion or political opinion in a way regarded as offensive,desir ilchert,cir quoting kovac ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.but not every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive rises to the level of persecution.ghaly,at quoting fisher,at internal quotation marks omitted.here,the record establishes that javhlan was never touched,and she and her husband were able to work for two decades in embassies without interference.
based on javhlan testimony,the threats she experienced over a period lacked detai
