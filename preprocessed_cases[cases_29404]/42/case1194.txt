background 
after entering the united states,singh was granted asylum on july,and adjusted to lawful permanent resident status on june.on september,singh was convicted in the united states district court for the northern district of florida of conspiracy to counterfeit passports,counterfeiting and using visas,and mail fraud in violation of.he was also convicted of unlawful possession of forged,counterfeited,altered,and falsely made nonimmigrant united states visas in violation of.
singh later departed the united states and,as relevant here,on january,in late october,he applied for admission to the united states as a lawful permanent resident.he was instead detained by immigration and customs enforcement on january.on january,he was served with a notice of removal charging him as an inadmissible arriving alien because he had committed a crime involving moral turpitude,namely his counterfeiting conviction 
after being served with his notice of removal,singh appeared for a master calendar hearing before the immigration court in newark,new jersey.through counsel,he acknowledged proper service of the notice to appear,admitted all of the factual allegations therein,and conceded the sole charge of removability for his commission of a crime involving moral turpitude.singh subsequently filed an application for cancellation of removal,and,through counsel,indicated that he would not be seeking any alternative forms of relief.ar at.
the ij denied singh application for cancellation of removal,in an interlocutory order,on the basis that singh had not accrued the requisite seven years of continuous residence in the united states to make him eligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to a.thereafter,the ij held a hearing to determine whether singh had any other form of relief available to him.singh sought no such relief and,accordingly,the ij issued a final decision on april,incorporating in full its prior interlocutory order.

standard of review 
in reviewing the merits of petitioner claims,this court reviews the agency conclusions of law de novo,subject to established principles of deference.mendezreyes att y gen,cir quoting wang ashcroft,cir.these principles of deference include the deference owed to administrative agencies pursuant to chevron,nat.res.def.council.see wang,at.in general,the degree of deference owed to a bia decision varies based upon the decision precedential value.see de leonochoa att y,cir.here,the bia decision was a,opinion.see g.accordingly,we defer to its legal conclusions only insofar as they have the power to persuade.see mahn att y gen,cir at most,these decisions are persuasive authority.
singh eligibility for cancellation of removal 
singh is removable from the united states.his counterfeiting conviction,as he correctly concedes,qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude that renders him inadmissible,and thus removable,from the united states.see a a i i crime involving moral turpitude renders alien inadmissible a a alien who was inadmissible at time of entry is deportable.crimes,like singh,involving allegations of dishonesty or fraud fall well within the recognized definition of crimes involving moral turpitude.see de leon reynoso ashcroft,cir see also in re serna,bia the offense of possession of counterfeit obligations of the united states has also been held to involve moral turpitude since the statute includes the intent to defraud.
having conceded removability,the sole relief that singh now seeks is cancellation of removal.t he alien shoulders the burden of showing that he is eligible for cancellation of removal.pareja att y,cir.for a lawful permanent resident to be eligible for cancellation of removal,he or she must satisfy three requirements show lawful permanent resident status for not less than five years demonstrate continuous united states residency for seven years after having been admitted in any status and establish that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony.a.the parties agree that singh meets the first and third requirements.singh also rightly concedes that his period of residence prior to the commission of his counterfeiting offense does not satisfy the requirement.the sole disagreement here concerns whether singh post time period from the date of his on january,to the service of his notice to appear on january,satisfies the requirement 
to be eligible for cancellation,the alien must have resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status.a.the clock starts to run when the alien is admitted to the united states.such admission is defined as the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.a a.the year clock of a thus begins with an alien lawful entry.holder martinez gutierrez,emphasis in original.when the continuity clock stops is governed by another subsection of the cancellation statute,termed the rule.this rule provides that continuous residency periods end either when the alien is served a notice to appear under section a of this title or when the alien has committed an offense that renders the alien inadmissible or removable whichever is earliest.d.
as singh concedes,and as the bia properly found,his counterfeiting conviction was a event.because of that conviction,both the ij and bia concluded that singh could not begin a new period of continuous residence after his readmission.by their reasoning,singh commission of a crime involving moral turpitude not only stopped the clock as to his preceding period of residency,but permanently prevented the clock from ever restarting as to a later period of residency.singh challenges that conclusion.
in okeke gonzales,cir,we recognized one situation in which the period could potentially after commission of a crime.the alien in that case,a native and citizen of nigeria,entered the united states as a student in,returned home to nigeria,and then returned to the united states in.id.at.upon,he was arrested for possession of marijuana,to which he pled guilty and received a sentence of five years probation.id.he subsequently departed the united states and was readmitted on a student visa in,and lived here without interruption thereafter.id.in,he was charged with removability based on his failure to maintain his student status,per the terms of his student visa.id.at.he sought cancellation of removal.the bia held,as it has here,that the commission of a offense is not simply interruptive of the period of continuous physical presence,but is a terminating event,after which no further continuous presence can accrue for purposes of cancellation of removal.id.at.
we reversed.although we emphasized that multiple circuits had deferred to the bia determination that the clock generally can not start anew,we distinguished those cases on the basis that none involved an individual who left the united states and reentered.id.at.we cited the alien as the critical fact for restarting the clock,id.at,and drew a bright line between those who remain in the united states and those who after a event,rendering a holding in favor of those who where,as here,there is lawful reentry after a event,the commission of a controlled substance offense,the clock starts anew.id.despite that language,we noted that the case then at hand unlike singh was not about deporting an alien who had committed a crime because the notice to appear made no reference to okeke alleged commission of the controlled substance offense.id.according to the notice he received,okeke was removable,rather,because he had overstayed his student visa.the notice to appear did not allege removability on the basis of the crime that also stopped the clock
