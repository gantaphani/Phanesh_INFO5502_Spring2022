pauline ndonyi,a native and citizen of cameroon,petitions for review of an order of removal entered by immigration judge jennie giambastiani ij,which became final when the board of immigration appeals bia dismissed ndonyi appeal.the ij and the bia both concluded that the harsh treatment ndonyi suffered in cameroon was not on account of her political,religious,or social affiliations,and denied her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.because the ij and the bia failed to properly analyze the nexus between the persecution faced by ndonyi and her political and religious beliefs,we grant the petition for review and remand the case for further proceedings.
in may,pauline ndonyi entered the united states at detroit,michigan,by crossing the border in a canadian family car.the agent at the border station checked only the driver passport,and waived the car through the border as a result,ndonyi entered the united states undetected.in december,ndonyi,who was not yet in removal proceedings,filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection,because she claimed to have suffered persecution as a result of her political activities and her father leadership in the cameroon baptist convention cbc,a baptist christian organization.ndonyi application detailed that i n january,she was tortured and raped by the government police and military for expressing her political opinion.the application also stated that in september,she was forced to watch her father being tortured for his involvement with the church,and that she and her mother both were tortured for trying to come to his defense.ndonyi application claimed that,based on her past experience,she feared being tortured and killed if she returned to cameroon.an asylum officer interviewed ndonyi,see,and after determining that she was inadmissible,the officer referred ndonyi application to the executive office of immigration review,see id.c.the government then initiated removal proceedings against ndonyi in early february for being illegally present in the united states.see a a i.
in september,ndonyi appeared with counsel at a hearing before the ij.ndonyi,a native english speaker,testified that she is a member of the kom tribal group,an ethnic group located in the northwest province of cameroon.ndonyi explained that french and english are the two official languages of cameroon,but that french is the more prevalent language and english speakers,or anglophones,are often treated as citizens.
ndonyi stated that for two years,beginning in,she attended the university of yaoundé university,which is located in a part of the country.according to ndonyi,the university discriminated against its anglophone students by omitting their names from student lists barring them from participation in sports and extracurricular activities relegating them to dirty,substandard housing and neglecting to grade their academic papers or record their course resulted in the students failing to receive proper credit for courses they completed and prevented their advancement to higher grade levels.in response to the university discriminatory policies,students formed the northwest students association nsa,an organization of a few hundred members that attempted to vindicate the interests of the school anglophone students by conducting peaceful demonstrations,boycotts of classes,and strikes targeted at school administrators.although the nsa regularly posted fliers and engaged in protests during ndonyi two years at the university,the school administration did not permit the nsa to function in the school,so members met secretly,and their actions were met with resistance from school officials.
ndonyi joined and actively participated in the nsa while at the university.ndonyi testified that in,she and other nsa members engaged in a peaceful strike in front of the university administration building when school administrators called the police.the police arrived in trucks,and were armed with guns and clubs.ndonyi explained that the police told the students that the students were disturbing the peace,and that the police were going to teach them a lesson for their disruptive behavior.the police beat the students with the clubs and pushed the students into the trucks.
ndonyi recounted how the police then took the students to the police station,where they separated the male students from the female students.ndonyi and the other female students were forced into a nasty looking cell.police officers entered the cell,and kicked and beat ndonyi and the other female students with clubs.during this incident,two officers held her down while other officers took turns raping her.the other girls in the room were also raped by the police.the students were held overnight and released the next morning without being charged with any offense.ndonyi testified that upon her release from the prison,she went to the hospital to obtain treatment for her injuries,but did not report the episode to other authorities.a close friend of ndonyi,rosalyina disango,died as a result of the incident.ndonyi became angry when rosalyina death was misreported as a suicide,and as a result,ndonyi attempted to contact members of the press to have the true story of her friend death published.the government discovered ndonyi efforts to contact the press and summoned her to the police station in late january.ndonyi did not report to the station and instead fled miles to her home province.
ndonyi explained that upon arriving in the northwest province,she did not go directly to her parents home in mabingo,but instead stopped in another town miles away because the situation at home was also bad.since,there had been hostility toward her family in her home province because her father was the chairman of the cbc.ndonyi father and her family faced backlash after her father refused to break away from the church and join a splinter cameroon national baptist christian convention cnbc,which objected to how the cbc spent church funds.the cbc and cnbc members attended the same church,which led to social hostilities directed at cbc,shunning,and stone throwing.ndonyi father attempt to inform the authorities about the oppressive actions of cnbc members fell on deaf ears because the authorities were affiliated with the cnbc.
after a few weeks in the nearby village,ndonyi returned to her parents home.ndonyi initial hesitation to returning home proved february until september,her family was under de facto house arrest w e could go out we were being stoned,called names.they would even interact with us.so basically we just stay ed home.ndonyi also detailed that cnbc members left letters tacked to her family front gate threatening to burn down their home because of her father continued allegiance to the cbc.
the efforts by ndonyi father to publicize the family plight exacerbated the situation.in early september,ndonyi father was arrested for writing a letter to government officials in the cameroonian senate,discussing how the local government supported the cnbc instead of neutrally resolving the dispute between the two baptist sects.the letter brought no response ndonyi speculated that the politicians were silenced because the political landscape was dominated by french speakers,who advanced their own agendas and causes.the local officials branded ndonyi father a traitor and a troublemaker,and arrested him for going over their heads to the higher authorities.
two weeks later,the entire ndonyi family,along with other cbc members,was arrested and locked up by uniformed police.the family was taken to a maximum security prison in bamenda,where local officials attempted to get ndonyi father and other cbc members to sign documents that stated they would stop opposing the cnbc.several cbc members signed the forms and were released,but ndonyi father refused to sign,and the family was detained for two weeks.during the imprisonment,the police tortured ndonyi father in front of the entire officers took him out of his cell,hung him from handcuffs placed around metal bars on a wall,and then beat his legs and body with clubs.the officers told the family that this should be a lesson to them.when her father began to pass out,ndonyi could no longer stand idly jumped on top of one of her father assailants and was bludgeoned in the head with the butt of a rifle.
when ndonyi awoke,she was being treated by one of her father supporters,and was informed that her family had been released.ndonyi family had returned to their home in mabingo,where cnbc members continued to intimidate and socially censure them and the other cbc members.ndonyi explained that her family returned to mabingo because it was unlikely that the family could find work or get an education in the parts of cameroon.ndonyi did not want to witness her family subjected to discrimination in mabingo,so instead of returning home,she traveled miles to another town,baffouse,where she stayed with her father supporters.while in baffouse,ndonyi learned that two military officers had shown up at her parents home and asked for her whereabouts.when her mother refused to tell the officers where ndonyi was,she was badly beaten.
ndonyi lived in baffouse for six months when she decided to leave cameroon.ndonyi obtained documentation and a fraudulent passport from a friend,and traveled to canada on another woman business visa.about one week later,ndonyi crossed the border into the united states.once in the united states,ndonyi began attending a nursing program at a technical college in madison,wisconsin.at one point,ndonyi attempted to transfer her school credits over from the university of yaoundé,but the school had no records of ndonyi it was like i did even exist in the school.they could find any records for my name.
ndonyi also testified that,in june,she discovered that her father had passed away under suspicious circumstances.she explained that her family still faced persecution from the cnbc and police at the time of her immigration hearing.and she said that she would not return to cameroon for fear of being raped,tortured,or arrested,because her family no longer has income after her father death,and because she will be a victim of torture for her support of causes.
after ndonyi completed her testimony on direct examination,the ij continued the hearing twice,and ultimately rescheduled for early december.during the intervening fifteen months,ndonyi counsel withdrew.as a result,ndonyi represented herself at the december hearing.on,the government attorney asked ndonyi about the rallies and protests she participated in while part of the nsa,and the number of students involved with the group.ndonyi related consistent stories about the january protest and her rape and torture in its aftermath,and about her family membership in the cbc and the december incident.
however,the government attorney also elicited several numerical estimates from ndonyi that differed from those she had testified to more than a year earlier on direct examination.for example,on ndonyi estimated that the nsa had only members instead of,that she participated in five rallies not ten,and that only to students protested in january as opposed to.ndonyi explained that the specific figures she gave might be inaccurate because she did not pay close attention to details and was merely estimating.
in addition to ndonyi testimony,the record before the ij consisted of,among other things an affidavit from an american missionary in cameroon regarding ndonyi father activities in the cbc the state department and country reports on human rights practices in cameroon an editorial regarding the religious conflict that ndonyi father published in a national newspaper a medical certificate from ndonyi hospital visit in january ndonyi father obituary and a threatening letter that cnbc members sent to ndonyi father.the missionary affidavit stated that the ndonyi family suffered more persecution than most families loyal to the cbc because pauline ndonyi father was a leader in the cbc church and he openly reported the activities of dissidents to the cbc authority.the missionary further explained that ndonyi father affiliation with the cbc prevented them from worshipping in their local church,ostracized them from local civic and religious functions,and maligned them in public gatherings.the state department reports confirmed that natives of the two anglophone provinces,the northwest and southwest provinces have suffered disproportionately from human rights violations committed by the government and its security forces.the reports elaborated that anglophones are largely underrepresented in the public sector,and generally believed that they had not received their fair share of public goods and services.
the ij reviewed the record and rendered an oral decision on december,the same day that ndonyi testified on.the ij first found that ndonyi was not credible due to several discrepancies between her testimony on direct examination and her testimony,given more than a year later.the ij noted several differences,including the number of protests ndonyi claimed to have participated in,the number of nsa members that ndonyi cited,the number of students who participated in the nsa protest and were arrested in january,and the number of trucks the police arrived in to arrest the students.the ij explained that despite ndonyi confession that she did not pay close attention to detail,the numbers were significant.the ij also stated that ndonyi was not credible because she had testified on direct examination that when she fought with the soldiers who were beating her father in september of and she was hit on the head,she was hospitalized however,today she testified that after she was hit on the head,she passed out,and did not require any hospitalization or medical treatment 
the ij next found that ndonyi claims of persecution were not sufficiently related to her political opinion.with regards to the sexual assault,as deplorable and despicable an act as that was,the respondent has failed to show that it was on account of her political opinion.the ij continued,s he has failed to establish a nexus that she was singled out on account of her political opinion when she was assaulted and jailed.the ij stated that the protestors may have been jailed for disturbing the peace or for attempting to break into an administrative office,and not for protesting.
the ij also stated that ndonyi treatment in december while defending her father was unrelated to her baptist faith i do not find that she was hit because of her baptist faith,nor because of her father baptist faith.she went against a soldier or a policeman and regrettably bore the brunt of his wrath for interfering while he was performing his duties.while the ij acknowledged that ndonyi father was singled out because of the dispute between the cbc and cnbc,the ij stated,i can find no nexus presented by the respondent that would tie her to persecution on the basis of her father affiliation.
the ij ultimately concluded that ndonyi had not established past persecution,or a fear of future persecution,on account of her political opinion,religion,or membership in a particular social group,and the ij denied ndonyi applications for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij then stated that ndonyi testimony was insufficient to conclude that she would be imprisoned and tortured by the cameroonian government,and denied her request for cat protection.the ij ordered ndonyi removed to cameroon.
ndonyi filed a timely pro se appeal of the ij order with the bia in january.in march,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij conclusions that ndonyi had not testified credibly because the discrepancies identified by the ij adequately place d the respondent testimony into question.in april,ndonyi petitioned for review of the bia decision with this court.and in october,the government filed an unopposed motion to remand the case to the bia because the ij adverse credibility determination was based in part on her erroneous conclusion that ndonyi had testified inconsistently regarding being hospitalized following the september incident.we granted the government motion and remanded the case to the bia in november.
ndonyi retained counsel in may,and in august the bia reconsidered the case and issued a new decision vacating its prior decision,and dismissing ndonyi appeal.after reconsidering the case,the bia determined that it agree d with the ij conclusion that taking ndonyi testimony as true,she did not meet her burden of proof for relief.the bia stated that ndonyi brutal treatment while incarcerated rose to the level of past persecution,but the bia found that ndonyi did not establish that her mistreatment was on account of a political opinion,particular social group,or other enumerated ground.t he demonstration was not political,and they were only protesting the university discrimination.the bia attributed ndonyi treatment to harsh prison conditions and circumstance,rather than to her political views,her religion,or her father leadership in the cbc.the bia concluded that even accepting that the past events in their totality amounted to past persecution,the government rebutted the presumption of a fear of future persecution because ndonyi could reasonably relocate away from the university and her hometown the bia stated,we acknowledge her testimony that she will face discrimination and the evidence indicating that anglophones have historically had issues in cameroon while these factors are not insignificant,we do not find proof of a level of hardship which would establish that internal relocation would be unreasonable.ndonyi timely filed a petition for review of the bia decision with this court in september.
ii.analysis 
because the bia adopted and supplemented a portion of the ij decision,we review that part of the ij decision along with the additional reasoning provided by the bia.see oryakhil mukasey,cir khan mukasey,cir.we review the decisions under the substantial evidence standard.ogayonne mukasey,cir.under this standard,w e must uphold the decision to deny relief so long as it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.oryakhil,at quoting chatta mukasey,cir,and mema gonzales,cir.we will overturn the decision to deny relief only if the record compels a contrary result.id.quoting mema,at see also ogayonne,at.
ndonyi challenges the denial of her application for asylum and withholding of removal on several grounds first,ndonyi asserts that the ij made an improper adverse credibility determination before denying her application.but because the bia assumed that ndonyi was a credible witness when it dismissed her appeal in october,the ij adverse credibility determination is irrelevant to our review we will assume,as the bia did,that ndonyi testimony credibly established a fear of past persecution.see gonzalez ins,cir see also kayembe ashcroft,cir.
ndonyi also argues that the ij and bia deprived her of procedural due process under the fifth amendment by refusing to fully consider her evidence,and by misapplying the law to her case.however,we have repeatedly stated that immigration proceedings that meet statutory and regulatory standards comport with due process,and,as such,aliens are by arguing instead that immigration proceedings infringed the statutory and regulatory right to a reasonable opportunity to present evidence.khan,at see also hussain keisler,cir kadia gonzales,cir.and ndonyi has not advanced a colorable challenge to the immigration courts process,but instead argues that they derived improper inferences from the facts and misapplied the law in arriving at their asylum determinations.we will evaluate these arguments as part of ndonyi substantive challenge to the immigration courts denial of her application for asylum and withholding of removal.
in order to establish her claim for asylum,ndonyi bears the burden of proving that she is unable or unwilling to return to cameroon because of past persecution or a fear of persecution,on account of her race,religion,political opinion,nationality,or membership in a particular social group.see oryakhil,at soumare mukasey,cir see also a a.a request for withholding of removal seeks relief under the immigration and nationality act,which prohibits the removal of a person to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened because of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.binrashed gonzales,quoting b a alteration in original.to be eligible for withholding of removal,an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution.shmyhelskyy gonzales,cir see also ins stevic,d.the required showing for withholding of removal is more stringent than an applicant burden of proof on an asylum claim.shmyhelskyy,at see also soumare,at.
in arguing that the bia and ij substantively erred by denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal,ndonyi contends that the record established past persecution and a fear of persecution based on her political opinion and religious views.she writes in her brief,the record indicates that she was arrested,detained and sexually assaulted as a result of her participation in an nsa protest,which aimed to end discrimination against the anglophone minority.she continues,the record also demonstrates that she and her family suffered persecution because of their baptist faith and her father cbc membership.
through her testimony and corroborating submissions,ndonyi presented an abundance of evidence of past abuse.she detailed the facts of multiple arrests without legitimate cause,several severe beatings,and a violent rape.these incidents clearly represent a punishment or infliction of harm that this country does not recognize as legitimate.boci gonzales,cir.such egregious,repetitive acts of physical one incident that required ndonyi to be rise to the level of past persecution if they occurred on account of ndonyi political opinion or religious views.see tchemkou gonzales,cir cecaj gonzales,cir.this circuit and several other circuits have adopted the doctrine of mixed motives,which recognizes that an individual may qualify for asylum if his or her persecutors have more than one motive as long as one of the motives is specified in the immigration and nationality act.gjerazi gonzales,cir quoting mohideen gonzales,cir see also de brenner ashcroft,cir ashcroft,cir girma ins,cir borja ins,cir chang ins,cir.
in determining that ndonyi did not suffer on account of her political opinions regarding anglophone rights,the bia completely ignored the doctrine of mixed opinion does not analyze whether ndonyi oppressors were partially motivated by politics or religion,and makes no mention of any of our precedent on the issue.the ij and the bia also failed to consider the evidence as a whole,as they were required to do by the elementary principles of administrative law.cecaj,at.the ij stated that ndonyi may have been jailed for disturbing the peace or for attempting to break into an administrative office.but this is radically deficient reasoning because it utterly fails to consider the context of ndonyi arrest.see id.the ij curt statement fails to account for the fact that the protestors disturbed the peace,and supposedly attempted to trespass,because they were engaged in a political was not merely shouting obscenities or engaged in random criminal acts,but was protesting the discriminatory treatment of anglophone students at the university.this is especially troubling considering that ndonyi needed to prove only that her persecution was partially motivated by her political opinion.see gjerazi,at mohideen,at.
even more surprising is the bia additional reasoning that the demonstration was not political,and they were only protesting the university discrimination.it is difficult for us to understand how a large group protesting a pattern of discrimination targeted at a specific minority could be us such a demonstration epitomizes political speech.claiborne hardware,d s peech to protest racial discrimination is essential political speech lying at the core of the first amendment.quoting henry first national bank of clarksdale.
the ij also failed to account for the severity of the response by the police,who arrived armed,en masse,and then raped the female students at the prison.an asylum applicant may prove her claim through circumstantial evidence.terezov gonzales,cir gjeraz
