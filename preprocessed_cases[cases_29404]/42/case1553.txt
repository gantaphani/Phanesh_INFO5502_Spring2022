an alien who wishes to apply for cancellation of removal must show,among other things,that he has continuously resided in the united states for seven years after admission to this country.see a.however,a statutory provision known as the rule provides that the commission of a criminal offense can cut short the alien period of continuous residence.see id.d b.in the case before us,the board of immigration appeals bia has deemed petitioner abdul azim jaghoori petitioner ineligible for cancellation of removal because of a crime he committed within his first seven years of residence in the united states.petitioner argues the bia should not have applied the rule in his case because the offense and guilty plea occurred before congress promulgated the rule.
the inquiry into a statute retroactive effect is informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.ins cyr,quoting martin hadix,internal quotation marks omitted.these considerations militate against retroactivity here.accordingly,we apply our traditional presumption against retroactivity,olatunji ashcroft,cir citation omitted quoting republic of austria altmann,and grant the petition for review.
the prospect of discretionary relief from removal has long been a fixture of immigration jurisprudence.prior to the passage of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,potential avenues for relief included a waiver of deportation pursuant to section c of the immigration and nationality act,c repealed,and suspension of deportation pursuant to a repealed.to qualify for relief under either statute,an alien had to meet certain criteria.
section c provided 
aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general without regard to the provisions of subsection a of this section other than paragraphs and c the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years.
c.although,by its terms,the provision referred only to aliens seeking readmission after a temporary departure,courts and the bia came to apply the waiver in deportation proceedings regardless of an alien travel history.judulang holder.the class of aliens qualifying for this form of relief was extremely large,and a substantial percentage of these aliens succeeded in obtaining a waiver.ins cyr.
suspension of deportation was harder to obtain.to qualify,an alien had to show that he was a person of good moral character,and that his deportation would cause extreme hardship to him or his family.a.the statute further limited relief to aliens who,at a minimum had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the application for relief.id.satisfying this continuous presence requirement was a simple matter,demanding nothing more than the passage of time the clock continued to run even after deportation proceedings were under way.see appiah ins,cir.
the enactment of iirira eliminated both the section c waiver and suspension of deportation and replaced them with a new form of discretionary relief,dubbed cancellation of removal.iirira,stat.the new provision,which governs here,authorizes the attorney general to 
cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,
has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and 
has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
a.while the second of these requirements has analogs in the prior statutes,it does not operate the same way.under a provision that has come to be known as the rule,the period of continuous residence is deemed to end upon the earlier of two events,which are spelled out in subsections a and b of the rule.id.d.under subsection a,the clock stops when the government serves a notice to appear for removal proceedings.under subsection b,it stops when the alien has committed an offense rendering him inadmissible under a or removable under a or a.
congress enacted iirira on september.the bulk of its provisions,though,including the rule,did not take effect until april,see,stat.at.
petitioner is an afghan citizen but has lived in the united states for most of his life.he was born in the ghazni province in eastern afghanistan.the family shia muslim faith and hazara ethnicity placed them within a small minority of the afghan population.in the early,a time of war in that country,the family fled to pakistan.subsequently,at age,petitioner entered the united states as a refugee.he acquired lawful permanent resident status on april.
during his stay in the united states,petitioner has had several with law enforcement.the,for present purposes,most relevant of these was a credit card theft committed in virginia on february.petitioner pled guilty to this offense on july,and received a day suspended jail sentence.importantly,this conviction did not render him deportable.see a a i authorizing deportation of an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude cimt,but only if the crime occurred within five years after the alien date of entry,and the alien was sentenced to confinement for one year or longer.
petitioner status as a lawful permanent resident remained secure even after congress enacted iirira in.though his criminal record grew to include one conviction for misdemeanor obstruction of justice and three convictions for driving under the influence,none of these offenses rendered him removable.
in september,petitioner traveled back to afghanistan to do some work for his brother,who was in the construction business.he stayed for about a month.upon his return,the department of homeland security dhs placed him into removal proceedings on the basis of the credit card theft conviction,alleging that this offense was a cimt rendering him removable pursuant to a a i.dhs later withdrew this charge subsequently,in august,a virginia grand jury indicted petitioner for attempting to pass a fraudulent prescription for oxycontin in violation of section of the virginia code.petitioner pled guilty to this charge and received a suspended jail sentence.
the prescription fraud conviction prompted dhs to bring two new charges of removability.the first charge alleged that petitioner credit card theft and prescription fraud convictions were cimts not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,thereby rendering him removable pursuant to a a ii.the second charge alleged that the prescription fraud conviction,by itself,was grounds for removal pursuant to a b i 
petitioner,through counsel,conceded removability pursuant to a a and proceeded to file an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cancellation of removal.the immigration judge ij ordered his removal to afghanistan.however,in view of petitioner ethnicity and religion and his many years in the united states,the ij granted his application for withholding of removal.this decision allows petitioner to remain in the united states for the time being,but it does not accord an opportunity to pursue citizenship,nor does it prevent immigration authorities from removing him to a country other than afghanistan.see f in re lam,bia.
cancellation of removal would preserve petitioner opportunity to seek permanent residence,but the ij denied petitioner application for this form of relief on the ground that the credit card theft triggered the rule,d.in response,petitioner filed an appeal with the bia,arguing that the rule was prospective only and could not apply to the credit card theft.the bia dismissed the appeal.applying the rule to petitioner credit card offense,the bia said,can not produce an impermissible retroactive effect here because petitioner did not become removable until the prescription fraud.invoking the supreme court rationale in fernandez vargas gonzales,the agency reasoned that it was petitioner choice to engage in illegal conduct after the effective date of the new law,the iirira,that subjects him to the new and less generous legal regime,the application of the rule.alteration in original quoting fernandez vargas,at 
we have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal pursuant to a.our power to review such orders is limited by a b,which restricts judicial review of decisions denying cancellation of removal,and by a c,which restricts judicial review of any final order against an alien who,like petitioner,is removable because of a drug offense covered in a b.these restrictions,however,are of no moment here because the permissibility of applying a statute retroactively is a pure question of law,fox balt.city police dep t,cir,and therefore subject to judicial review.see a d.
we review legal questions de novo.salem holder,cir.although we generally defer to agency interpretations of statutes that are ambiguous,a statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed to be unambiguously prospective.ins cyr.we therefore do not defer to the bia interpretation of the rule.
where applicable,subsection b of the rule cuts off an alien period of continuous residence upon either of the following the alien commits an offense that renders him inadmissible under a,or the alien commits an offense that renders him removable under a or a.see d b.the latter can not justify the application of the rule here because petitioner was not removable within seven years of his admission to the united states.nevertheless,because the bia characterized petitioner credit card theft as a crime involving moral turpitude,which would render him inadmissible pursuant to a a i i we must determine whether subsection b of the rule operates against him.
the retroactivity of the rule is,at bottom,a question of congressional intent.see olatunji ashcroft,cir.under landgraf usi film products,our analysis proceeds in two steps.first,we ask whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.id.at.if congress has made its intent clear,while acting within the limits of its power,our inquiry is concluded.tasios reno,cir.if,conversely,congress did not speak with the requisite clarity,we proceed to landgraf second step and ask whether the new statute would have retroactive effect.landgraf,at.here we assess whether the statute attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.id.at.if so,then in keeping with our traditional presumption against retroactivity,we presume that the statute does not apply to that conduct.martin hadix,internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the bia took no position on whether congress clearly intended for the rule to operate retroactively.its decision assumed arguendo that the statute is silent with regard to congressional intent.neither party argues that this was in error.
the requirement of a clear congressional directive,necessary for disposition under landgraf step one,is a demanding one.ins cyr.the prescriptive language in the statute must be express,unambiguous,and unequivocal.see gordon pete auto serv.of denbigh,inc,cir.we are satisfied that congress did not expressly and unambiguously prescribe the proper reach of the rule and we proceed,accordingly,to landgraf second step.
a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment.tasios,at quoting landgraf,at internal quotation marks omitted.the question,rather,is whether the statute would attach new legal consequences to prior events.chambers reno,cir.in this regard,a statute must be deemed retrospective if,as justice story long ago stated,it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.soc y for the propagation of the gospel wheeler,cas.
this inquiry into a statute retroactive effect demands a commonsense,functional judgment.cyr,at quoting hadix,at.the judgment should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.quoting hadix,at.
the circumstances presented here are remarkably similar to those in jeudy holder,cir.as with petitioner,the alien in jeudy acquired lawful permanent resident status in.both men pled guilty to a crime in.see at.by the time iirira took effect in,both had attained the seven years of continuous residence required to seek discretionary relief under law.see id.both,too,continued to reside in the united states until the government initiated removal proceedings in,a full years after they acquired lawful permanent resident status and more than a decade after they reached seven years of continuous residence.see id.
the jeudy court declared that applying the rule to jeudy offense and conviction would attach a new and serious consequence to jeudy criminal conduct that was completed before iirira took effect.at.the effect in petitioner case is the same.when petitioner pled guilty to credit card theft in,his conviction did not foreclose his opportunity to qualify for discretionary relief.petitioner continued to accrue the seven years of unrelinquished domicile necessary for a section c waiver and the seven years of continuous physical presence necessary for suspension of deportation.indeed,by the time congress enacted iirira in september,petitioner had been living in the united states long enough to qualify for both forms of relief.a retroactive application of the rule would not merely imperil petitioner opportunity to seek permanent relief from removal it would render such relief an impossibility.absent a clear congressional directive,we can not assume that congress intended the rule to have this effect.
the government notes that both the second and tenth circuits have identified circumstances in which the retroactive application of the rule does not produce an impermissible effect.see kleynburg holder,app x,cir martinez ins,cir.these cases are distinguishable from the present case in two critical ways.first,in each of these cases,the crime rendered the alien immediately deportable.second,the alien had not yet accrued seven years of continuous residence when iirira took effect.
these factors were critical to the second circuit decision in martinez.under the circumstances in that case,the court said,there was nothing to prevent the government from prosecuting the alien and securing an order of deportation before the alien reached seven years of continuous residence.see martinez,at.but for the time required to bring an offender to justice,the alien would never have become eligible for discretionary relief,and there would be no expectation for the rule to unsettle.id.
in this respect,the circumstances of petitioner case bear a closer resemblance to sinotes cruz gonzales,cir.there,the alien convictions did not expose him to deportability under law.see id.at.the alien continued to live in the united states and,like petitioner,was a resident when iirira became law.see id.the ninth circuit recognized that the imposition of the rule would have serious adverse consequences for the alien.id.it held,therefore,that the rule must not apply to him.see id.at.
we think it important to note,too,that both here and in sinotes cruz the government procured the aliens convictions via guilty plea.the means of conviction are relevant to our assessment of retroactive effect because,as the supreme court observed in ins cyr,an alien who decides to plead guilty can not help but be acutely aware of the consequences of conviction.at.in cyr,an alien pled guilty to a drug offense prior to the passage of iirira.see id.at.his conviction rendered him deportable,but,under the law at that time,he remained eligible to apply for a discretionary waiver under section c.see id.iirira abolishment of the section c waiver took this opportunity away from him.the court,noting that aliens under law had a significant likelihood of receiving c relief,reasoned that aliens almost certainly relied on this likelihood in deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial.id.at.the interference with this expectation,the court concluded,was an impermissible retroactive effect.see id.
here,the government argues that petitioner,unlike the alien in cyr,had no reason to concern himself with the availability of discretionary relief at the time of his guilty plea,since that offense did not render him deportable.this is a questionable assumption,and in any event irrelevant,as we have emphatically declared that subjective reliance is not an essential element of retroactive effect.see olatunji,at,whether the particular petitioner did or did not subjectively rely upon the prior statute or scheme has nothing whatever to do with congress very basis for the presumption against statutory retroactivity.
there can be no doubt that the right to go to trial is a valuable one.a retroactive application of the rule would impose new and unforeseen consequences on petitioner decision to relinquish this right.this is impermissible.
the government does not deny that the rule imposes new legal consequences on petitioner.it contends,though,that petitioner has no right to complain about those consequences because he was not helpless to avoid them.resp t br.but for his prescription fraud,it notes,the effects of our immigration laws including the rule would never have come to bear on him.
we can not agree that the retroactive effect of the rule is diminished because of actions petitioner took after the rule enactment.the question before us is whether we may presume that a statute enacted in does not apply retroactively to events in.petitioner conduct in gives us occasion to address this question,but it does not change the answer.
indeed,as supreme court precedent and our own case law make clear,a statute may have an impermissible retroactive effect on an alien even if the immigration consequences of that statute were avoidable.see vartelas holder,olatunji,at.the supreme court was clear on this point in vartelas holder,a case involving another alien with a criminal conviction predating iirira.the alien in vartelas,a greek immigrant,took a trip abroad in,long after iirira effectively precluded foreign travel by aliens with criminal records like his.the government argued that the statute had no retroactive effect at all,since it was the act of returning to the united states and not the immigrant conviction that triggered the statute.the court deemed this argument disingenuous,stating 
the immigrant return to the united states occasioned his treatment as a new entrant,but the reason for the new disability imposed on him was not his lawful foreign travel.it was,indeed,his conviction,of an offense qualifying as one of moral turpitude.that past misconduct,in other words,not present travel,is the wrongful activity congress targeted in a c v.
the text of the rule,similarly,leaves no doubt about the wrongful activity that congress designed it to target.the object of subsection b is to ensure that an alien who commits an enumerated criminal offense within seven years of admission to the united states does not go on to become eligible for discretionary relief while immigration proceedings against him inch slowly toward a resolution.see ram ins,cir explaining that congress enacted the rule in response to a belief that aliens sought to delay deportation proceedings in order to meet the continuous physical presence requirement.the rule is unconcerned with the particular events that give rise to the alien removal indeed,it operates the same way no matter what brought about the removal.the only crimes that come within its scope are those committed before the fulfilment of the requirement.in this way,the rule reserves its effect for aliens who abuse the hospitality of this country within a short time of being welcomed here.in re perez,bia.
the government likens this case to fernandez vargas gonzales,but the comparison is inapt.the alien in that case had ample opportunity to seek an adjustment of status before iirira took that opportunity away from him.see id.at.he simply neglected to take advantage of it.see id.at.this rationale does not apply to petitioner.he did not sleep on his rights.how could he,when the law that threatened his ability to seek relief,iirira,was on the books before his need for that relief had even arisen 
we do not hold that petitioner had a right to commit more crimes.he does not,and the repercussions of his conduct have,accordingly,come to bear on him twice to date first when the criminal court convicted him,and second when the ij issued an order of removal.we simply hold that the government can not use the rule to add yet one more repercussion to that list.a lawful resident who has lived in the united states long enough to merit consideration for relief from removal has a settled expectation in his opportunity to request such relief.courts may not disturb that expectation absent clear evidence that congress intended that effect.
for the foregoing reasons,we grant the petition for review and remand the case to the bia for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
petition for review granted and case remanded 
abdul jaghoori,a native and citizen of afghanistan and a lawful permanent resident of the united states since,was convicted of at least two crimes involving moral turpitude while residing in virginia a conviction for credit card theft and a conviction for prescription fraud.he concedes that the two convictions render him removable under a a ii.jaghoori seeks discretionary relief from his order of removal with his application for,among other things,cancellation of removal under a.that section authorizes the attorney general to cancel a lawful permanent resident removal if the resident 
has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,
has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and 
has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.a emphasis added.
the bia denied jaghoori application for cancellation of removal because he was unable to show,as required by a,that he had resided in the united states as a lawful permanent resident continuously for years.under the rule of d,his conviction for credit card fraud cut off the running of the residency period short of seven years,because it would have rendered him ineligible for admission into the united states under a a i i.jaghoori noted,however,that his conviction preceded the effective date of the rule,which was enacted in as part of illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of the.jaghoori maintained therefore that applying the rule in his case would give it impermissible retroactive effect.the bia rejected this argument,explaining 
w hen assessing statutory eligibility or discretionary merit for a grant of cancellation of removal,we necessarily look at a variety of antecedent events,including events that are both favorable and unfavorable to the alien,and an alien past criminal conduct may well impact on the operation of the statute,but only to the extent of defining the authority to grant discretionary relief to removable aliens.
w e find that it is the respondent choice to engage in illegal conduct underlying his conviction after the effective date of the new law,the iirira,that subjects him to the new and less generous legal regime,the application of the rule,not a past act that he is helpless to undo up to the moment the government finds him out.
internal quotation marks omitted.
on appeal,jaghoori again presses his argument that applying the rule of d effective april,to his conviction in order to deny his application for cancellation of removal attaches new legal consequences to his guilty plea,and,as such,the rule should not be applied retroactively,citing landgraf usi film products.
because the legal consequence on jaghoori immigration status only attached once jaghoori committed a second crime years after iirira enactment,i believe that the bia got it right.therefore,i wou
