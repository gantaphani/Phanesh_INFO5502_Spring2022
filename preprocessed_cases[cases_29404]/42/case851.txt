sylvestre passi petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia april,order affirming immigration judge ij elizabeth lamb denial of his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.the bia assumed that passi had testified credibly about an incident in which he was beaten into unconsciousness during a military raid,but concluded that country conditions had changed such that he no longer had an objectively reasonable fear of persecution.because we find that the bia could not have conducted an individualized analysis of how changed country conditions would affect someone in passi situation,we grant the petition,vacate the bia order,and remand for further proceedings.
sylvestre passi is a native and citizen of the republic of congo.he claims to have entered the united states on july.in may,he filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief,and was subsequently placed in removal proceedings.
at a merits hearing in july,passi testified that in november,members of the cobra militia loyal to congo current president denis entered his home in brazzaville,shot and killed his father,and beat him into unconsciousness.he claims that he and his family were attacked because of their lari ethnicity and their perceived support for predecessor and rival,pascal lissouba passi father had been a police officer under lissouba regime.after the attack,passi and his family fled to gabon and from there,passi eventually came to the united states.the ij admitted several documents into evidence including the,and united states department of state country reports on human rights practices for the republic of congo,a amnesty international report on congo,and several news articles from and.
in an oral decision,the ij pretermitted passi asylum application finding that he had not met his burden of proving that he applied for asylum within one year of his arrival in the united states as required by a b.in re sylvestre passi,no.a immig.city.the ij found that passi was not a totally credible witness.she then went on to consider whether passi was eligible for withholding of removal,noting that he faced the higher burden of proof of showing that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted.the ij rejected passi withholding of removal claim stating 
i read the background materials submitted including the state department materials.the state department talked about the tribe to which he says he belongs and i believe he says it in the southern part but there is nothing in the record that says that his tribe is signaled sic out for any problems now,especially now.the times have changed,the political situation has changed and i have no reason to believe that he would be persecuted were he to return to his country.
id.the ij also rejected his cat claim.
passi appealed only the denial of his asylum claim to the bia.the bia affirmed the ij denial of asylum,but on different grounds.in re sylvestre passi,no.a.the bia assumed that his asylum application was timely filed and that he had testified credibly about his past persecution,but explained in a short per curiam decision 
w e concur with the immigration judge ultimate decision that conditions in the republic of congo have changed to the extent that there is no evidence in the record that passi would face persecution there.in that regard,we find no indication in the most recent objective evidence of record that passi,who was beaten into unconsciousness during a raid by cobra militia,presently has an objectively reasonable fear of persecution in the republic of congo based on any past persecution.further,we find no evidence that passi has an independent fear of future persecution by cobra militiamen on account of his lari ethnicity,his imputed political support of former president pascal lissouba,or any other protected ground under,if he is removed to the republic of congo.
id.citations omitted.
passi timely petitioned this court for review,again only challenging the denial of his asylum claim 
when the bia affirms an ij decision on different grounds,we review only the bia decision.see yan chen gonzales,cir.as we have explained on several occasions,however,when the bia affirms the ij decision in some respects,but not others,we may also review the ij decision,although our review is confined to those reasons for denying relief that were adopted by the bia.see xue hong yang dep t of justice,cir.see generally ming xia chen bia,cir.in this case,the bia assumed that passi asylum application was timely filed and that he had testified credibly,so we may not rest on the ij adverse credibility finding or her ruling pretermitting passi asylum claim.see yan chen,at.instead the bia adopted the ij reason for denying passi withholding of removal country conditions had reject his asylum claim.although we are reviewing the bia decision,we find it informative in this case to look to the ij decision as well to decipher the reasoning in which the bia concur red just as we would if the bia had merely modified or supplemented the ij decision.
we review the agency factual findings under the substantial evidence standard treating them as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b dong gao bia,cir.we will,however,vacate and remand for new findings if the agency reasoning or its factfinding process was sufficiently flawed,for example,where the agency determination was based on an inaccurate perception of the record,omitting potentially significant facts.tambadou gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also cao he lin dep t of justice,cir.we review de novo questions of law and the application of law to fact.see,ins,cir.
the burden of proving eligibility for asylum rests on the applicant.a.an applicant may qualify for asylum either because he has suffered past persecution or because he has a fear of future persecution.b.a fear of persecution may be even if there is only a slight,though discernible,chance of persecution.diallo ins,cir citing ins,d.this standard is considerably easier to meet than the standard for withholding of removal,which requires the applicant to establish that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground.see b ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.where,as the bia assumed here,an asylum applicant has demonstrated that he suffered past persecution,a presumption arises that he has a fear of persecution.b.while past persecution is sufficient to establish eligibility for asylum,regulations nonetheless direct the ijs to exercise their discretion to deny asylum in certain situations.b i tambadou,at.one such situation is when the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that t here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality,b i a,thus rebutting the presumption that arose upon the initial showing of past persecution.see jalloh gonzales,cir.
this petition calls on us to decide whether substantial evidence supports the bia finding that conditions in congo have fundamentally changed such that passi no longer has a reasonable fear of persecution.to support its conclusion that conditions in the republic of congo have changed to the extent that there is no evidence in the record that passi would face persecution there,the bia cited only the state department country report.while the state department country reports often provide a useful and informative overview of conditions in the applicant home country,we have instructed the immigration courts not to place excessive reliance on them.chen ins,cir.in tambadou gonzales,we explained that the bia can not rely in a conclusory fashion on information in a state department country report about general changes in the country.at internal quotation marks omitted.instead,we explained,the bia must use the information in the r eport in a manner and supplement it with further analysis,that is,the bia must conduct an individualized analysis of how changed conditions would affect the specific petition
