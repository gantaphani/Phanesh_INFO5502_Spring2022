george gerges rizk,the principal petitioner in this case,claims that the immigration judge ij and board of immigration appeals bia erred in rejecting his asylum claim on the basis of an adverse credibility determination.specifically,rizk argues that he was not given a chance to explain the inconsistencies on which the ij relied in finding him not credible.because the record shows that rizk did have ample opportunities to reconcile the numerous contradictions in his testimony,but failed to offer a reasonable and plausible explanation for them,the ij adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence.we therefore deny his petition for review.
rizk,a citizen of egypt,entered the united states on december,as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure,with authority to remain in the united states until june.his wife,nadia youssef attia attia,and two children,joseph george gerges joseph and john george gerges john,entered the united states as nonimmigrant visitors on march,and were authorized to remain until september.in early,all were issued notices to appear,charging them with being subject to removal under a b for having remained in the united states beyond the dates permitted by their visas.rizk and his family conceded removability but sought relief in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.rizk and his wife filed separate petitions for relief,and the children claimed derivative relief through each parent.see a stating that a child accompanying an asylum applicant may share in the applicant asylum status.
the ij conducted an hearing over the course of three days.rizk and attia were the only witnesses,and each testified out of the hearing of the other.their testimony focused on three separate incidents the harassment and beating of their son joseph for refusing to join in islamic prayers,the at the family apartment,which led to rizk persecution by the police and prosecution for inciting sectarian chaos,and attia harassment by a muslim,mohammed abdul latif,culminating in her abduction and rape.for the reasons explained below,we focus mainly on the incident.
the and its aftermath are central to rizk claim of persecution.according to rizk,on january,unknown perpetrators broke into the family apartment,stole money and jewelry,and scrawled slogans on the walls.after the police arrived to investigate,attia accused latif of committing the crime.the police took rizk and attia to the police station and interviewed them along with latif.after preparing a report,the police detained rizk overnight on the charge of inciting sectarian chaos,allegedly because he accused a muslim of breaking into and stealing from his apartment.the next day,the police transferred rizk to state security,where,rizk asserted,he was interrogated,occasionally struck by officers,and given five minutes of electric shocks through his index fingers.he thereafter received letters requiring him to appear in court in connection with his prosecution on the incitement charge.
in a detailed,opinion,the ij reviewed rizk and attia testimony and detailed dozens of inconsistencies,including discrepancies as to times,dates,the sequence of events,and the identity of the individuals who participated in those events.the ij pointed out internal inconsistencies,as well as inconsistencies between the stories offered by rizk and attia most significantly,the petitioners testimony contradicted the key piece of documentary evidence they had submitted the police report on the of their apartment.the ij stated that the unusual number of factual discrepancies present in the respondents accounts,combined with the blatantly contradictory nature of those discrepancies,has left the respondents representations dubious.in light of these numerous conflicts,the ij determined that the petitioners were not credible,and indeed that their testimony has left the court in such disarray that it could not begin to discern the truth,if any,from the vast fallacies.consequently,the ij denied all of the petitioners requested relief.
following the ij rejection of their claims,petitioners appealed to the bia.on december,the bia adopt ed and affirm ed the ij opinion solely as to the lead male respondent,rizk.the bia opinion expressly did not address the appeals of attia or the couple children.petitioners filed a timely petition for review of the bia decision.
on appeal,attia argues that the bia failed to address her challenge to the ij adverse credibility determination regarding her testimony.we agree.the bia opinion states the respondents consist of a married couple and their two children.for purposes of this order,reference to the respondent will refer to the lead male respondent.the opinion then upheld the ij adverse credibility as to the respondent,and concluded that the respondent appeal is dismissed.in short,the bia affirmed in full the ij decision as to rizk,but did not mention attia,john,or joseph other than to include them in the definition of respondents a term never again used in the opinion and exclude them from the definition of respondent.
at oral argument,the government asserted for the first time that the bia did not address attia claims because they were not properly before it.according to the government,the petitioners notice of appeal to the bia addressed only rizk claims.because attia claims were not exhausted,the government argues,we should dismiss her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.the record does not support this assertion.the petitioners notice of appeal and supporting brief to the bia lists the alien identification number for each of the family members,repeatedly refers to the family collectively as respondents or appellants,and refers specifically to the female appellant or respondent where appropriate.accordingly,we conclude that attia adequately appealed the ij decision and that we have jurisdiction over her petition.
because the bia decision did not resolve attia appeal and,consequently,did not resolve the cases of joseph and john,who are eligible for derivative relief through attia,we must grant her petition and remand her case along with her children to the bia for decision.w here the bia has not made a finding on an essential asylum issue,the proper course of action for a court of appeals is to remand the issue to the bia for decision.chen ashcroft,cir citing ins ventura,d.we therefore do not address attia additional challenges to the ij decision.
rizk claims that the ij adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence.where,as here,the bia expressly adopts the ij decision,we review the ij findings as if they were the bia.holder,cir.because credibility determinations are findings of fact by the ij,they are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.to reverse such a finding we must find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it.ins,d.
we must uphold the ij adverse credibility determination s o long as one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of the alien claim of persecution.wang ins,cir the ij must have a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner credibility,and must offer a specific,cogent reason for any stated disbelief.hartooni ins,cir accord singh gonzales,cir.major inconsistencies on issues material to the alien claim of persecution constitute substantial evidence supporting an adverse credibility determination.see kaur gonzales,cir.this general rule has two qualifications,however.first,minor inconsistencies regarding and trivial details,such as typographical errors or inconsistencies in specific dates and times that lack a close nexus to the petitioner asserted grounds of persecution,can not form the exclusive basis for an adverse credibility determination.id.at.of course,even minor inconsistencies going to the heart of a petitioner claim may,when considered collectively,deprive the claim of the requisite ring of truth,thereby supplying substantial evidence that will sustain the ij adverse credibility determination.rivera mukasey,cir quoting kaur,at.m
