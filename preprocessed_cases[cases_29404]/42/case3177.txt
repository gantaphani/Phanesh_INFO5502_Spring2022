jose reyes alberto ruiz vidal,a native and citizen of mexico,has lived in the united states since august as a lawful permanent resident,but he has behaved himself.among other transgressions,he been charged with crimes at least twice before and,as a result,has repeatedly faced deportation proceedings.we tasked with reviewing his latest dalliance.we consider whether he is removable due to his no contest plea to a lesser included offense when we apply the modified categorical approach.
in,california filed an information charging ruiz vidal with sale and possession for sale of a controlled substance,which the information identified as methamphetamine.ruiz vidal pleaded no contest to simple lesser included offense of the sale charge.he was sentenced to time served and five years felony probation.
the department of homeland security served ruiz vidal with a notice to appear,and an immigration judge concluded that ruiz vidal was removable because he was convicted of a controlled substance offense which can be identified as methamphetamine.he appealed to the board of immigration appeals,which agreed with the immigration judge.we review ruiz vidal petition to vacate the removal order.
an alien is removable if the government proves by clear and convincing evidence that he been convicted of certain offenses relating to a controlled substance covered by the controlled substances act csa.a b i see cabantac holder,cir per curiam as amended.we review whether ruiz vidal was convicted of a controlled substance offense de novo.cabantac,at.to determine whether an alien offense qualifies as one relating to a controlled substance covered by the csa,we compare the elements of the state statute of conviction to the offense as defined by federal law.see taylor united states,alvarado holder,cir.
california health and safety code a is a divisible statute,and thus,we apply the modified categorical approach to analyze ruiz vidal conviction and determine whether it involved a substance included in the csa.coronado holder,cir as amended ruiz vidal gonzales,cir yep,that our guy,abrogation on other grounds recognized by ragasa holder,cir as amended.section a lists alternative potential offense elements,some of which are contained in the csa and some of which are not.coronado,at.for example,chorionic gonadotropin is on schedule iii of the csa,but is on california schedule iii.id.at see also cal.health safety code f.where a statute is divisible we permitted to review certain documents to determine which alternative in the statute applies.descamps united states.
when applying the modified categorical approach,we restricted to consult ing a limited class of documents,to determine whether the defendant was convicted of a crime relating to a controlled substance defined by the csa.alvarado,at.in this case,documents we may consider include ruiz vidal plea colloquy,the charging information and the clerk minute order.see descamps.at united states leal vega,cir.after we determine the elements of the crime of conviction,we compare them with the elements of the generic crime,descamps.at,as we would under the categorical approach.
ruiz vidal argues that his record of conviction does identify the controlled substance to which he is,that we ca tell from looking at the limited class of acceptable documents whether he pleaded to possession of methamphetamine or some other substance,say chorionic gonadotropin.but count of the information charged ruiz vidal with unlawful sale of a controlled substance,a violation of section a of the health and safety code of california to wit methamphetamine.emphasis added.count also includes an allegation that ruiz vidal possessed for grams or more of a substance containing methamphetamine.
at his plea colloquy,ruiz vidal confirmed that he was pleading no contest to the lesser included offense of count of the information,not just to an untethered violation of a possession.the court asked for ruiz vidal plea to the lesser included to count,a violation of health and safety code section a,and ruiz vidal responded n o contest.the court then made a finding of guilt,and the government indicated that the remainder of the complaint would be dismissed.emphasis added.
the court minute order another document that permissible to review under the modified categorical approach,see leal vega,at confirms that ruiz vidal pleaded to the lesser included offense of count.it states that ruiz vidal entered a plea to the lesser related offense of count and indicates that ruiz vidal stipulated that a factual basis existed for the plea.where a minute order specifies that a defendant pleaded to a specific count of the criminal complaint or indictment,we can consider the facts alleged in that count.cabantac,at.
and when a defendant references a specific count during his plea colloquy,we can also consider the drug listed in the charging document.see id.furthermore,a plea referencing a to wit count in a charging document suffices to establish the controlled substance for removal purposes.see leal vega,at united states valdavinos torres,cir.in leal vega,for example,the defendant pleaded guilty to count of the complaint,which stated that he possessed for purpose of sale a controlled substance,to wit,tar heroin.at emphasis omitted.we found the conviction to be for a drug trafficking offense because the minute order stated that the conviction was for count.id.at.similarly,in valdavinos torres,we held that a defendant conviction was an aggravated felony for purposes of removal after reviewing a plea form indicating that he pled guilty to count two,which the complaint described as possession for sale of a controlled substance,to wit,methamphetamine.at.thus,ruiz vidal plea which references a specific count in the information and the information,which references a specific controlled substance,provide clear and convincing evidence that ruiz vidal was convicted of a removable offense.
ruiz vidal further argues that we ca consider the reference to methamphetamine in the information because,by pleading no contest to a lesser included offense,he pled to an offense different from the one charged.in essence,he argues that possession of another controlled substance,say chorionic gonadotropin,could be a lesser included offense of the sale of methamphetamine charge.
but,in addition to asking us to overlook his plea specific reference to count,ruiz vidal ignores the meaning of lesser included offense.although it is ancient doctrine that a defendant can not be held to answer a charge not contained in the indictment,our criminal justice system has long permitted a defendant to be found guilty of any lesser offense necessarily included in the offense charged.schmuck united states,emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.california defines a lesser included offense as w here an offense can not be committed without necessarily committing another offense,the latter is a necessarily included offense.people tinajero,d.california courts determine whether an offense is necessarily included by reviewing whether the facts actually alleged in the accusatory pleading include all the elements of the lesser offense,such that the greater offense can not be committed without also committing the lesser offense.people birks,cal.
ruiz vidal was charged with sale of methamphetamine under california health and safety code a but pleaded to and was convicted of a lesser related offense to the charge under.ruiz vidal admitted to the factual basis for his plea,and he never disputed that he was pleading to a lesser included offense of sale of methamphetamine.thus,even based only on the limited documents we allowed to review,it clear that ruiz vidal pleaded to possession of methamphetamine.
the dissent concedes there no reasonable dispute that ruiz vidal actually possessed methamphetamine,as opposed to a drug that is not punishable under federal law,but nonetheless argues that we can not know whether he was convicted of possessing methamphetamine,as opposed to some other drug.dissent at.however,because possession of each different drug under california health and safety code a constitutes an entirely separate offense,coronado,at,the indictment charged him with the specific offense of sale of methamphetamine,not sale of a controlled substance.a conviction for possession of any other drug could be a lesser included offense to sale of methamphetamine.the only way a conviction for possession of a controlled substance can be a lesser included offense to the crime of sale of methamphetamine is if the drug the defendant is convicted of possessing is methamphetamine.hence,so long as there is clear and convincing evidence that ruiz vidal crime of conviction was a lesser included offense to count,we can conclude he was convicted of possessing methamphetamine.
the dissent characterizes our holding as a new exception to the general rule that when the record of conviction comprises only the indictment and the judgment,the judgment must contain the critical phrase as charged in the information or otherwise unambiguously specif y that defendant pleaded guilty to a specific count.dissent at emphasis added and omitted internal quotation marks omitted.but,the record of conviction here comprises more than just the indictment and judgment.in united states vidal,there was no transcript of the plea colloquy or any other memorialization of the factual basis for the plea,cir.here,we have the transcript of a plea colloquy that gives us a clear way to connect the references to methamphetamine in the charging document with the conviction under cal.health safety code a.ruiz vidal,at.during the colloquy,the judge specifically asked whether there was a factual basis for the plea,which had been identified as a lesser included offense of count.ruiz vidal had ample opportunity to object to that characterization,but failed to do so.the only difference between this case and the numerous cases in which we have relied on the factual basis stipulated to during a plea colloquy is that the judge here did use the word methamphetamine.but that irrelevant because,as we have shown,a possession conviction that is a lesser included offense to sale of methamphetamine can only be for possession of methamphetamine.
finally,ruiz vidal relies on an unpublished bia opinion and cisneros perez gonzales,cir as amended,to argue that we ca rely on the record to determine that his plea to a lesser included offense was for methamphetamine possession.but in cisneros perez we concluded that the judgment record did establish that cisneros perez necessarily pleaded no contest to the allegations in the original complaint because i t is not stated in any of the cognizable documents that the conviction for violating the lesser included offense stems from the same incident as the charges in the criminal complaint.id.at emphasis added.here,the cognizable documents demonstrate that ruiz vidal plea to the lesser included of count derives from the same incident as the information,which explicitly referenced methamphetamine.ruiz vidal record of conviction contains what cisneros perez record of conviction lacked a clear connection between the plea and the facts alleged in the charging document.
in their briefs urging panel rehearing or rehearing en banc,ruiz vidal and amici argue for the first time that under california law,possession is not a lesser included offense of sale.but ruiz vidal waived this argument in his supplemental brief filed on december,he conceded that the lesser included offense characterization was correct as a matter of law.
because there is clear and convincing evidence in the documents permissible for review that ruiz vidal pleaded to and was convicted of possession of methamphetamine,a controlled substance,he is removable.
petition denied.
petitioner was charged with sale of a controlled substance a substance that the state alleged in the information was methamphetamine.he pled no contest to a lesser included offense possession of a controlled substance.petitioner stipulated that there was a factual basis for his plea,but explained nothing further regarding the offense.the question in this case is not whether petitioner actually possessed methamphetamine,as opposed to a drug that is not punishable under federal law.if that were the question,this case would be straightforward,as the record does not contain any serious suggestion that petitioner possessed any substance other than methamphetamine.medina lara holder,cir.
the question instead,however,is whether the record provides clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that petitioner was convicted of possessing methamphetamine.see carachuri rosendo holder,the text of the immigration and nationality act thus indicates that we are to look to the conviction itself as our starting place,not to what might have or could have been charged.in answering that question,whether petitioner actually possessed methamphetamine makes no difference.medina lara,at quoting descamps united states.rather,our limited task is to determine whether petitioner plea to possession of a controlled substance,as a lesser included offense to sale of methamphetamine,necessarily constitutes a conviction for possession of methamphetamine.
here,the specification of methamphetamine occurs only in the allegations contained in a count of the information to which petitioner did not plead guilty.in fact,the plea was made to an entirely different statute not even mentioned in the information.in united states vidal,cir en banc,we held that in order to allow us to infer that a defendant was convicted of the allegations in the information,when the record of conviction comprises only the indictment and the judgment,the judgment must contain the critical phrase as charged in the information.id.at emphasis added citation omitted.in other words,vidal made clear that a defendant is not convicted of the allegations unless he pleads guilty as charged in the information.we have,in recent cases,made an exception to this rule in one situation,and one situation only w here the abstract of judgment unambiguously specifies that defendant pleaded guilty to a specific count.united states torre jimenez,cir.we have not considered the allegations in the information when the defendant pled guilty to an offense different from the one charged in the information.martinez perez gonzales,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states snellenberger,cir en banc per curiam see also alvarado holder,cir cisneros perez gonzales,cir.this case obviously does not fall within the one exception we have created rather,it obviously does fall within the class of cases in which the defendant pled guilty to a different offense than the one charged,and in which we consequently refused to review the allegations in the charging document when applying the modified categorical approach.
the majority opinion,however,adopts a new exception for certain cases in which the defendant did not plead guilty to the offense charged in the indictment,but to a different statutory offense an offense that constituted a lesser included offense to a crime that was charged in the information.it holds,in short,that because petitioner was charged with selling a controlled substance,specified as methamphetamine in the information,and he pled no contest in his plea colloquy to a different criminal charge the lesser included offense of possession of a controlled substance the controlled substance he pled no contest to possessing was necessarily methamphetamine 
the majority adoption of a new exception to vidal for pleas to lesser included offenses as memorialized in a plea colloquy is unwarranted and unwise.petitioner is removable only if he was convicted of a controlled substances offense as defined by federal law.a b i.therefore,as explained above,we must look to the conviction itself as our start
