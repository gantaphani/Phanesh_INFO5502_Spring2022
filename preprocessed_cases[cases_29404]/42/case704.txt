walter yovany vasquez macias vasquez is a citizen of honduras with a checkered immigration history in the united states.he was detained in california in,left voluntarily,illegally reentered the country,and then sold drugs to at least two undercover officers in the late leading to one criminal conviction and deportation in.vasquez again returned to the united states without authorization in approximately he claims that he subsequently went straight and entered the antique business.
for reasons not known to us,vasquez decided to abandon the antique market and leave the united states.with a friend,he traveled from texas to niagara falls,where they walked across the rainbow bridge to canada.canada border services agency cbsa officers first saw vasquez on the canadian side of the bridge as he walked in the car lanes towards canada they brought him to their facility for inspection.vasquez lacked a passport or visa to enter canada and his explanations about the reasons for his travel were not plausible.a cbsa agent testified that he refuse d vasquez entry to canada.the cbsa supplied vasquez with an allowed to leave document,customarily created whenever someone from the united states attempts to enter canada and is refused entry.notwithstanding canada allowing vasquez departure,cbsa agents forcibly returned vasquez to the united states in handcuffs.
cbsa agents handed vasquez over to customs and border protection cbp officials,who conducted an immigration investigation and records check.the cbp records check revealed that vasquez was a honduran citizen who had been asked to leave in and been deported in for his felony drug conviction.vasquez was indicted for being voluntarily present and found in the united states.having been in the united states illegally for approximately ten years,he was convicted based on his failed attempt to begin anew in canada.after trial,vasquez renewed,albeit untimely,an earlier motion for a judgment of acquittal,arguing that he was not in the united states when he was found.
discussion 
the parties agree as to the facts of the case and as to most of the applicable law,but leave it to this court to determine the meaning of found in and whether vasquez was continuously in the united states within the meaning of because vasquez was not in the united states when he was found and,when found in the united states,was here involuntarily,vasquez conviction was plainly erroneous and it would constitute manifest injustice to allow it to stand.
the government proposed that the term found in the united states is synonymous with present in the united states.we have previously rejected this interpretation.the offense of being found in the united states depends not only on the conduct of the alien but also on acts and knowledge of the federal authorities.united states rivera ventura,cir.the commission of the offense is not complete until the authorities both discover the illegal alien in the united states,and know,or with the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement could have discovered,the illegality of his presence.united states acevedo,cir alterations omitted quoting rivera ventura,at see also united states williams,cir.
the parties also disagree as to when vasquez was found in the united states.the government contends that,notwithstanding his physical presence north of the canada border,vasquez never left the united states vasquez argues that the first time that he was both found and in the united states was upon his forcible return to the custody of cbp agents.because vasquez was not in the united states while he was on canadian soil seeking admission into canada,he was not found in the united states until the cbsa brought him across the border in restraints and the cbp discovered him.
prior to this discovery,vasquez physically crossed the border from the united states into canada at that point,he had neither a legal nor a physical presence in the united states.if found at this point,vasquez was not in the united states pursuant to the requirements of.nevertheless,under similar circumstances the ninth circuit has twice held that the aliens were found in the united states pursuant to a theory that employed a legal fiction of their continuous presence in the united states after having crossed into canadian territory.see united states gonzalez diaz,cir united states ambriz ambriz,cir the ninth circuit lays out two rationales for its view neither is persuasive.
first,the ninth circuit noted that ambriz was never legally in canada,and thus,was not entering the united states from a foreign country.at see also gonzalez diaz,at.two assumptions underlie this analysis first,for purposes of the statute,physical presence is not synonymous with legal presence second,ambriz and gonzalez diaz must have been legally either in canada or in the united states.we disagree with the second proposition and therefore do not reach the first.
aliens attempting to enter the united states,stopped in analogous circumstances,are not legally in the united states.see,united states angeles mascote,cir united states canals jimenez,cir.however,nothing cited in these cases,ambriz ambriz,gonzalez diaz,or the parties briefs suggests that these aliens,turned away at a united states port of entry,were considered to be present in their countries of origin while physically in a airport,border crossing,or port.
indeed,the supreme court has recognized that a person,denied entry into the united states,might also not be present in any other country.see,shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei.in mezei,the government detained and refused entry,for security reasons,to a alien returning from a trip to hungary.id.at.every country consulted france,through which he traveled en route to the united states the united kingdom hungary and about a dozen latin american countries refused to take him.id.at.his presence on ellis island did not count as entry into the united states,zavydas davis,however,neither was he in france,hungary,or elsewhere 
the possibility that vasquez was outside the united states once he exited our borders finds mixed support in his treatment by customs officials at the border.a cbp official testified that vasquez was treated,at least in some respects,as though he had never left the united states,but a cbsa agent testified that vasquez made it far enough that he could not have turned around and returned to the side of the rainbow bridge.vasquez was transported,in custody,under a status known as immigration examination.on his return,united states officials did not permit vasquez to leave they took his fingerprints and ran them through national databases,questioned him in secondary inspection,forced him to fill out customs paperwork,and ultimately arrested him.
insofar as vasquez treatment mirrored cbp customary treatment of immigrants seeking to enter through ports of entry,this would be insufficient to support vasquez conviction for entering the united states,based on the doctrine of official restraint.see,united states zavala mendez,cir angeles mascote,at.the official restraint doctrine requires both physical presence in the country as well as freedom from official restraint before an attempted entry becomes an actual entry.angeles mascote,at internal quotation marks omitted.the same principles apply to being found in the united states if an alien presence here after she has left the country is so attenuated that she has not yet entered,then it is insufficient to support found in liability 
the criminal liability of,undocumented aliens who are denied admission into canada is a new question for this court,but we have examined the treatment of goods that were taken into canada and did not clear customs.see united states obscene magazines,cir.in obscene magazines,we held that goods rejected by the customs officials of a foreign country to which export is attempted are imported from that foreign country id.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.whether the magazines were accepted into canada or denied entry and held by canadian customs is irrelevant.regardless of their fate in canada the objectionable publications were presented at the united states border for entry into the united states from without when they were seized.id.at.the obscene magazines were entering the united states,regardless of whether or not they were in canada we see no reason not to extend this reasoning to aliens reentry into the united states.
the ninth circuit also justified its ambriz ambriz decision because it believed that the found in prong was the only way that ambriz could be prosecuted.at.this assumes both that ambriz or vasquez could not be prosecuted for attempting to enter the united states and that the conclusion that no statute prohibits their conduct is an untenable result.id.at.we do not share our sister circuit concern.while we recognize that criminal behavior should be punished,we are also mindful of the cautionary example,state eaton,of the infamous case of rex larsonneur,eng.moreover,congress has not outlawed all travel between sovereign nations,and not every unlawful stay in the united states even by a alien can or should result in a criminal conviction.united states thomas,d.
the law does not bend to meet the facts of each case.although vasquez undeniably broke the laws of the united states at some point after his deportation,he is not guilty of the crime of which he was convicted.we are not too troubled by this seeming oddity.even though we reverse his criminal conviction,vasquez will again be subject to deportation moreover,it seems equally anomalous to punish vasquez for being found in the united states when he was only found based on his attempt to stop living in the united states unlawfully.this would create a disincentive for undocumented,aliens to do the one thing that congress would most like them to do leave.thomas,d at.
as referenced above,upon returning to the united states,vasquez was more analogous to aliens who seek to enter the united states at a port of entry.like them,vasquez was processed by cbp agents.and like the agents in angeles mascote,the cbp agents here ran vasquez information through immigration databases and examined his prior immigration history.at.vasquez indictment charged him only with being found in the united states,rather than also including the attempted entry prong of 
two primary but immaterial differences separate vasquez from cases like angeles mascote.first,unlike angeles mascote,vasquez was entering the united states after having been denied entry into another country,rather than after having been legally present in another country.because nothing in requires entry into the united states following legal presence in another country,this distinction should not matter.obscene magazines,at.second,unlike angeles mascote,vasquez did not wish to be inside the united states.indeed,despite the indictment unnecessary charge that vasquez was voluntarily present in the united states,the only expression of vasquez will was his strong desire to get out of the country this does not make vasquez more susceptible to prosecution under than if he intended to enter the united states.
vasquez and angeles mascote were both not in the united states when they were found like angeles mascote,vasquez is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.it was plain error for vasquez to be convicted of being found in the united states,and allowing his conviction to stand would constitute manifest injustice.
conclusion 
although he had indisputably been present in the united states illegally for nearly a decade,vasquez was not found while he was in this country.when he was found admittedly not long after his departure from the united states vasquez had neither a physical nor a legal presence in this country.when he had been found and was in the united states,vasquez had been returned involuntarily with neither a desire to enter,nor a will to be present in,the united states.as a result,vasquez was not found in the united states within the meaning of.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of conviction entered in the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.
the court today reverses defendant vasquez conviction for being found in the united states after deportation without the permission of the attorney general in violation of.i join in that judgment,but write separately because i reach that conclusion somewhat differently from my colleagues in the majority.specifically,i construe to require proof of a defendant general intent to be in the united states.in the case of a defendant charged with being found in the united states illegally,that means proof either that a defendant was voluntarily in the united states when authorities found him physically present in this country,or that his presence in the united states at the time he was so found was a result of his last voluntary return to the united states.neither circumstance is present here.when vasquez was found in the united states by federal border authorities,he was not here voluntarily rather,he was forcibly brought here by canadian officials.it was this compelled return to the united states not any earlier return preceding vasquez departure for canada that caused vasquez to be found in this country.in these circumstances,i agree that the judgment of conviction must be reversed.
there is no need for me to repeat facts detailed by the majority.i note simply that vasquez submits that,as a matter of law,he can not stand convicted of having been found in the united states after a prior deportation because united states authorities only found him in this country when he was involuntarily returned in handcuffs by canadian officials who had just denied him legal entry into their country,and to the extent he had voluntarily returned to the united states after deportation some years before crossing into canada,he was never found in this country by united states officials during that time.
neither at trial nor on appeal has the government disputed that a defendant presence in the united states must be voluntary to support a conviction.indeed,the indictment so charges,and the jury was so instructed in this case.rather,the government maintains that vasquez presence in the united states can not be divorced into two parts,one before his unsuccessful entry into canada,when he was voluntarily in this country but not yet found by united states officials,and the other after canadian authorities returned him to this country in restraints,at which time he was found here by federal authorities.the government submits that defendant crime is properly viewed as continuing,so that his voluntary presence here before he left for canada,and the government finding him here after his attempt to enter canada,together satisfy the mens rea and actus reus elements of the crime of conviction.the district court charge supported this theory of culpability,instructing the jury that a person who is denied entry to a foreign country and is returned to the united states side of the port of entry did not leave the united states even if that person was physically on foreign territory before being brought back into the united states.a.
in explaining why i can not agree,i briefly consider the two elements of a crime.as to the actus reus element of being found in this country after deportation,our precedent instructs that the crime is not complete until the government becomes aware of defendant illegal presence in this country.see united states williams,cir.here,the government agrees that such awareness occurred only after vasquez was returned in custody from canada.at that time,vasquez person was plainly within the geographical borders of the united states.see leonard sand et,modern federal jury instructions criminal,instr.hereafter sand to be found in the united states means to be located in the united states following reentry.nevertheless,a number of our sister circuits,in order to ensure against redundancy in the enter,attempt to enter,and found in prohibitions of,have held that,where a person unsuccessfully attempts to enter the country through a border point without deception,he can not yet be found in the united states despite his physical presence within the country borders because he is under official restraint.see united states angeles mascote,cir holding that alien whose status as previously deported was discovered when he presented himself to immigration and customs authorities at airport was not found in united states united states canals jimenez,cir same see also united states zavala mendez,cir reaching same conclusion for alien approaching border station in motor vehicle.if we were to agree a question we need not here decide that reasoning might itself support reversal of vasquez conviction for being found in the united states illegally,on the theory that his conduct admitted at best an attempted reentry.
the government,however,maintains that vasquez was not here attempting to enter the united states from a foreign country because canada had,in fact,denied him entry.it argues that,despite his actual physical departure from united states soil and brief physical presence in canada,vasquez should be treated as never having left the united states.
insofar as this argument distinguishes physical from legal presence in a foreign country,suggesting that the latter is necessary to preclude a defendant who has departed the united states from being found in this country upon even involuntary return,i am not convinced.vasquez may not have been legally present in canada when he physically crossed into that country,but neither was he ever legally present in the united states before crossing into canada.the government real argument seems to be that where,as here,a defendant surreptitiously enters this country illegally,he somehow remains in this country even if no longer here physically until he enters another country lawfully,or at least until he does so free from official restraint.i disagree.
the official restraint doctrine places a limit on our government in proving a crime thus,to prove unlawful entry or attempted entry,the government must establish that a deported alien came,or tried to come,into the united states from a foreign port or place while free from official restraint.sand at instr.see correa thornburgh,cir holding that freedom from official restraint required to have entered united states for purposes of insofar as the statute found in prohibition was included to cover defendants who surreptitiously entered the united states,courts have required the government to prove that the defendant actually was in the united states free from official restraint.sand at instr,cmt.at collecting cases.i do not,however,think that the doctrine places a limit on an alien ability to depart this country,so that his presence in the united states can fairly be said to continue uninterrupted at the same time that his person is in another country,albeit under restraint by its officials.indeed,the conclusion borders on the metaphysical,raising concern about the adequacy of the statute notice about the criminal conduct proscribed.
this concern is only aggravated when one considers the crime mens rea element.as already noted,the government does not dispute that requires proof of mens rea.but as we consider precisely what intent is required to support a found in conviction a matter not previously addressed by this court we confront the challenge of a silent statutory text.see united states champegnie,cir observing that contains no language requiring proof of a particular mental state.the challenge is only enhanced by the fact that does not codify a common law crime,where the law presumes a scienter requirement even where not expressly stated.see morissette united states,accord liparota united states.nevertheless,in construing statutes,courts assume that congress intends to legislate consistently with the constitution.the due process clause admits only a narrow category of strict liability crimes,generally limited to regulatory measures where penalties are relatively small.see morissette united states,at.section b,however,admits the possibility of a year sentence.in such circumstances,we can properly presume that requires at least some proof of mens rea to support conviction.see generally.bar ass united states,cir concluding that absent clear indication in the language or legislative history of a contrary congressional purpose,mens rea is presumed to be an element of any federal crime.
certainly,that is the conclusion this court has reached in considering the statute enter and attempt to enter prohibitions.while we have declined to construe these prohibitions to require proof of a defendant specific intent to disobey the law,see united states newton,cir accord united states rodriguez,cir holding that conviction for attempted illegal reentry does not require proof that defendant knew he needed attorney general permission to enter united states see also sand at instr,cmt.at observing that every circuit to address the question has held that the government need not prove that the defendant knew it was illegal for him to enter the united states to support conviction,we have held that the government must prove general intent,as evidenced by a voluntary act of reentry or attempted reentry by the defendant that is not expressly sanctioned by the attorney general.united states martus,cir accord united states champegnie,at holding intent to reenter united states sufficient mens rea for attempted reentry despite common law history of requiring specific intent for attempt crimes see sand at instr,cmt.at explaining why section is better viewed as a general intent crime requiring only that the defendant voluntarily enter the united states.
there is no reason to construe found in prohibition not to require similar proof of mens rea.even though being found in a place might be viewed as a passive act by the defendant,see united states salazar robles,cir,criminal culpability demands proof that the defendant was voluntarily in the united states either at the time he was found here or at some time after his last return to the united states before he was so found.
voluntary presence at the time officials find a deported alien in this country does not require the government to prove how the defendant entered the united states.see sand at instr,cmt.at citing cases.at the same time,courts have held that does not require proof of voluntary presence at the precise moment a defendant is found in the united states.in united states salazar robles,the illegal alien was in state prison when federal authorities discovered that he was in this country.the ninth circuit recognized that a s salazar robles did not voluntarily put himself in folsom state prison,he did not voluntarily commit the act of being found in the united states.id.at.nevertheless,that court upheld defendant conviction,holding that the crime mens rea element could be satisfied by proof that defendant was found in the united states albeit in prison as a result of his voluntary return to this country after deportation.see id.
in this respect,being found in the united states may be considered a continuing offense that begins with the alien voluntary return to this country after deportation and is completed when federal authorities discover his presence.see united states hernandez noriega,cir holding that a lthough the act of returning to the united states must be voluntary,it is not relevant whether an alien continued presence in the united states was voluntary at the moment of discovery quoting united states dixon,cir.but i do not think the same continuing offense conclusion can apply where a defendant does not maintain a continuous physical presence in the united states between his voluntary return following deportation and authorities discovery of his presence.an intervening departure from the united states effectively breaks the continuum that allows the defendant discovery in the country at one point to be attributed to his voluntary return at an earlier time,so as to satisfy both the actus reus and mens rea elements of the found in crime.thus,where a defendant is found in the united states only after an intervening physical departure,that discovery can not be said to derive from the return.rather,to support a found in conviction,the government must prove that the alien was voluntarily in the united states at s
