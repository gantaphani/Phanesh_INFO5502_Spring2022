introduction 
bassam saliba saliba obtained temporary protected status tps in in this country by providing falsified documents with his application indicating that he was a citizen of lebanon.saliba was,in reality,a native and citizen of syria,a country whose citizens at that time were not eligible for tps.nine years later,in,saliba was able to adjust his status to that of a legal permanent resident lpr.even though saliba fraudulent procurement of tps should have rendered him statutorily inadmissible under a c i and thus not eligible for lpr status,the former immigration and naturalization service ins mistakenly granted him that status.but when saliba applied for naturalization in,the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis discovered that he had obtained tps by submitting a fraudulent application and denied his application for naturalization for that reason.in explaining the reason for its action the uscis pointed out that saliba apparent fraud precluded a finding that he had been lawfully admitted as a permanent resident as required for naturalization under a.saliba filed a second unsuccessful naturalization application following which he filed a petition for review of the denial of his application for naturalization in the district court pursuant to c.
in the district court,the attorney general of the united states and various uscis officials collectively,the government,moved to dismiss saliba petition pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and,in the alternative,moved for summary judgment,on the ground that saliba is statutorily ineligible for naturalization.the court on september,granted the government motion to dismiss saliba petition.thereafter,saliba timely filed a notice of appeal to this court.after our review of the case,we conclude that saliba fraudulent procurement of tps in made him inadmissible for lpr status,and,because he had not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence,he can not be naturalized.accordingly,we will affirm the district court september,order dismissing saliba petition for review 
ii.statement of jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to c,which provides that an individual whose application for naturalization is denied may seek review of such denial before the united states district court for the district in which such person resides.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,because the district court september,order constituted a final order.
iii.factual and procedural background 
saliba is a native and citizen of syria.petition for review pet.he entered the united states on or about december,pet,on a student visa,saliba att y,no.civ.ksh,wl,at.in or around january,he filed for tps claiming to be a citizen of lebanon and submitted falsified documents which stated that he was a citizen of lebanon.pet.saliba alleges that he decided to submit these falsified documents with his tps application because the state of war that existed at that time in the middle east made him fear for his life.pet.despite these falsified documents or more accurately,by reason of them the immigration and naturalization service ins granted saliba tps status.saliba,wl,at.saliba actual nation of origin,syria,was not designated as a country whose citizens were eligible for tps at the time that saliba sought the benefit of that status,though it was designated as being within that program on march.see designation of syrian arab republic for temporary protected status,fed.reg.
seven years later,on july,saliba filed an application to register as a permanent resident or to adjust his status to that of a lpr.pet.as part of his application,saliba submitted documents that accurately identified him as a native and citizen of syria and provided his date of entry into the united states.pet.his responses on the application itself,however,were less accurate.for example,the district court found significant that saliba wrote none in the space on the application that requested the applicant existing a number,his registration number,and when asked in question on part of the application whether he by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact,ever sought to procure,or procured any other immigration benefit,saliba answered no.saliba,wl,at citing the borgen,ex.c.
saliba had an obvious motive to provide dishonest responses on his application.if his fraudulent procurement of tps and his existing a number came to light at the time that he applied to adjust his status to a lpr,he would have been rendered statutorily inadmissible under a c i and therefore ineligible to become a lpr.saliba petition does not address his inaccurate responses on his application,but,instead,alleges that the uscis had the information about his prior tps application,because they crossed out the old a number through the temporary protected status application that was on the application and wrote in a new a number.pet.he asserts that the ins apparent replacement of his old a number with a new a number constituted a waiver of his inadmissibility pursuant to a c iii.pet.regardless of whether saliba contentions have merit,on february,the ins approved his application and his status was adjusted to that of a lpr.pet.
five years later,on february,saliba applied for naturalization pursuant to a.pet.but the uscis denied his application on january,because it determined that he had not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.pet.in particular,the uscis concluded that saliba was not lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence because,at the time of his adjustment to that status,he was pursuant to ina a c i based on his tps fraud.pet.ex.a,at.
two months later,on march,the uscis issued saliba a notice to appear before an immigration judge ij.pet.the notice indicated that saliba was subject to removal based on his submission of a fraudulent lebanese passport and birth certificate to establish tps eligibility in.pet.ex.a,at.on july,however,the ij terminated the removal proceedings because of our holding in garcia attorney general,cir,which we decided on january.pet.in garcia,we held that a statute of limitations for rescission of lpr status also applies to the initiation of removal proceedings predicated on the circumstance that the alien improperly obtained lpr status.at.
on march,saliba filed a second application for naturalization.pet.the uscis denied this second application ten months later,on january,because of its prior conclusion that saliba submission of falsified lebanese documents with his tps application rendered him statutorily inadmissible for naturalization.pet.saliba filed a form,request for hearing on a decision in naturalization proceedings on february,which resulted in a hearing on april.pet.but on june,the uscis reaffirmed its denial of saliba second application for naturalization.pet.
on october,saliba filed a timely petition in the district court for review of the uscis denial of his second application for naturalization.in his petition,saliba first asserts that the misrepresentations that he made in his application for tps were immaterial and not willful,pet.in addition,saliba maintains that even if his misrepresentations were material,the ins waived his inadmissibility when it granted him lpr status,and the uscis implicitly waived his inadmissibility through its subsequent failure to rescind his lpr status within the statutory window for taking such an action,pet.on december,the government moved to dismiss the petition pursuant to rule b,or,in the alternative,moved for summary judgment.
nine months later,on september,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss.saliba,wl,at.it determined that the uscis properly denied saliba application for naturalization because he was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence on account of his fraudulent procurement of tps.id.at.the court further concluded that saliba did not obtain a waiver of inadmissibility because even if the ins was aware of saliba tps application when it adjudicated his application to adjust status,he was ineligible for a waiver under i,and the service did not have the legal authority to waive inadmissibility on any other grounds.id.at.it also rejected saliba contention that the uscis failure to rescind his lpr status and initiate removal proceedings within the statute of limitations period constituted an implicit waiver of inadmissibility for purposes of naturalization.id.at.specifically,the court reasoned that the garcia decision is limited to proceedings and has no application to petitions for naturalization.id.at.the court thus dismissed saliba petition,and on november,saliba timely filed a notice of appeal to this court.

vi.discussion 
saliba maintains that he did not willingly make any material misrepresentations to obtain tps,and that,even if he did,the ins and uscis waived any bar to his admissibility attributable to his misrepresentations when they granted him lpr status and did not rescind that status within the statute of limitations period for taking such action.we conclude,as did the district court,that saliba misstatements at the time that he applied for tps were necessarily material making him statutorily inadmissible for permanent residence and that saliba neither applied for nor obtained a waiver of inadmissibility under i.accordingly,saliba was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence and we are constrained to affirm the district court september,order dismissing his petition for review.
saliba obtained tps by fraud and is thus inadmissible for permanent residence 
we divide the issue that we examine on this appeal whether saliba is eligible for naturalization into three.the first is whether saliba obtained tps by fraud or by willfully misrepresenting a material fact,because,unless he did so,the government has no basis to claim that saliba was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence when he adjusted his status to that of a lpr in.
to adjust his status so that he would be a lpr,to become lawfully admitted for permanent residence,saliba had to be,among other requirements,admissible to the united states for permanent residence at the time of his adjustment.a.significantly,pursuant to a c i an alien who,by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact,seeks to procure or has sought to procure or has procured a visa,other documentation,or admission into the united states or other benefit,is statutorily inadmissible for permanent residence emphasis added.inasmuch as it is undisputable that tps is an other benefit within the meaning of a c i,the question before us with respect to saliba obtaining a benefit is whether he obtained tps by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact.a c i.the district court concluded that saliba misrepresentations of his citizenship when he applied for tps were necessarily material to his procurement of that status.see saliba,wl,at citing a c i and aoko holder,cir.appellees br.at.we agree.
saliba admits in his petition that,prior to adjusting his status,he obtained tps by submitting falsified documents stating that he was a lebanese citizen.see pet.these admittedly falsified documents were unquestionably material to saliba procurement of tps because the government did not designate his home country,syria,as an eligible country under the tps program until.see designation of syrian arab republic for temporary protected status,fed.reg.thus,saliba could not have been granted tps if he had submitted legitimate documents,and his concededly clear misrepresentation of the facts pet.and misrepresent ation of his nationality to obtain temporary protected status,pet,rendered him inadmissible for permanent residence as a matter of law.see a c i.
saliba resists this conclusion by stating that his decision to submit falsified lebanese documents was involuntary and made under duress,due to his fear of the conditions plaguing the middle east at the time of his tps application.appellant br.at see also pet,at the time of the temporary protected status application,the middle east was in a state of war,and saliba acted in fear for his life.saliba thus claims that,even if the fact of his syrian citizenship was material,he did not willfully misrepresent his citizenship to obtain tps.a c i emphasis added.this argument fails because the willfulness of his misrepresentation is not mitigated by external circumstances.saliba could have sought asylum from syria rather than misrepresent his citizenship to file for tps.see generally.moreover,one of the statutory grounds on which the attorney general may designate a foreign state so that its nationals are eligible for tps is if she makes a finding that there is an ongoing armed conflict within the state and,due to such conflict,requiring the return of aliens who are nationals of that state to that state or to the part of the state would pose a serious threat to their personal safety.b a.at the time that saliba applied for tps,the attorney general had not found that there was such an ongoing armed conflict in syria the foreign state of which saliba was a citizen that threatened the personal safety of syrian nationals justifying syria designation under the tps program.accordingly,saliba claimed subjective fear of returning to syria does not provide a basis for us to reach a conclusion that his submission of falsified documents to obtain tps was an involuntary act inasmuch as he obtained tps by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact,he was statutorily inadmissible for permanent residence pursuant to a c i,and thus there was a mandatory ground requiring the denial of his application for adjustment of his status to that of a lpr.
saliba inadmissibility for permanent residence renders him unable to naturalize 
as we have indicated,the ins mistakenly granted saliba lpr status despite his statutory inadmissibility.see pet.this circumstance gives rise to the second on appeal whether,notwithstanding his current lpr status,saliba statutory inadmissibility for permanent residence means that he never was lawfully admitted for permanent residence a prerequisite to naturalization pursuant to,no person shall be naturalized unless he has been lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence in accordance with all applicable provisions of this chapter.see also id.a no person shall be naturalized unless such applicant has resided in the united states continuously,after being lawfully admitted for permanent residence.because saliba was inadmissible for permanent residence based on a mandatory statutory ground,a c i,the government maintains that although he must be regarded as having been admitted for permanent residence by reason of the expiration of the period for rescinding his lpr status,he was not lawfully admitted.
section a of title of the united states code defines the term lawfully admitted as the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed.we have explained that the term lawfully denotes compliance with substantive legal requirements,not mere procedural regularity.gallimore att y,cir.citation and internal editorial marks omitted see also,gonzales,cir.l awful status is required,not simply lawful procedure.matter of longstaff,cir.admission is not lawful if it is regular only in form.in re koloamatangi,bia same.thus,an alien whose status has been adjusted to lpr but who is subsequently determined to have obtained that status adjustment through fraud has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence because the alien is deemed,ab initio,never to have obtained lpr status.gallimore,at emphasis and alteration in original quoting koloamatangi,at.
moreover,our emphasis on substance over form in determining whether a lpr was lawfully admitted for permanent residence extends beyond the context of fraud or misrepresentations.as we observed in gallimore,even w here an alien obtains lpr status through administrative oversight despite being ineligible for that status for one reason or another several of our sister courts of appeals have deferred to bia decisions concluding that the alien has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.id.at collecting cases from various courts of appeals.we joined these decisions cited in gallimore,and held that an alien whose status has been adjusted to lawful permanent resident but who is subsequently determined in an immigration proceeding to have originally been ineligible for that status has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.id.at citations omitted.we were clear that this determination applied regardless of whether the applicant lpr status was not lawful because the applicant procured it through fraud or because the applicant was not legally entitled to it for any other reason.id.at see also koloamatangi,at a n alien was not lawfully admitted for permanent resident status if,at the time such status was accorded,he or she was not entitled to it.
based on our conclusion that saliba obtained tps by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact,a c i,it is clear that he never was lawfully admitted for permanent residence and is thus ineligible for naturalization,a.our precedent is clear that,even if the ins erroneously granted saliba lpr status based on his fraudulent application claiming to be a citizen of lebanon or based on his partial misstatements on his application for adjustment of status,see saliba,wl,at citing the borgen,ex.c,the ins error nevertheless undermines the lawfulness of his lpr status,see gallimore,at.after all,saliba procurement of tps and subsequent adjustment to lpr status are not solely attributable to administrative error or circumstances unrelated to his fraudulent claims.quite to the contrary,by fraudulently claiming to be a citizen of lebanon when he sought tps he set in motion the whole problem regarding his status.
the inescapable fact is that saliba,as he admits,made a clear misrepresentation when he submitted falsified documents which stated that he was a citizen of lebanon.pet.thus,saliba petition removes any doubt that he failed to comply with the substantive legal requirements that govern applications for tps.in addition,saliba inaccurate responses regarding his tps on his application for adjustment of status to that of a lpr contradict any claim that his fraudulent behavior remained confined to his tps application.saliba fraudulent procurement of his tps renders him inadmissible for permanent residence under a c i,and,though the ins mistakenly granted him lpr status,a circumstance that shows that lawful procedure was followed in his case,the lawfulness of the procedure does not mean that he attained lawful status as a lpr.rather,lawful status as a permanent resident must be established under a and for an applicant to be eligible for naturalization,and because saliba can not demonstrate that he was lawfully admitted for permanent residence as that phrase has been interpreted uniformly by the courts of appeals,he can not be naturalized.
neither the ins nor the uscis waived saliba inadmissibility 
our conclusion that saliba fraudulently procured tps,which rendered him inadmissible and not lawfully admitted for permanent residence,brings us to the third and final in our trilogy whether the government waived the barriers to his admissibility.the district court concluded,and the government maintains on appeal,that there is no evidence in the record to show that saliba applied for,or ever obtained,a waiver of inadmissibility.saliba,wl,at appellees br.at.saliba responds that a determination of whether he applied for,requested or was granted a waiver is a question of fact that can and should be resolved in discovery.appellant br.at.specifically,saliba contends that the ins and the uscis granted him a waiver when the ins approved his adjustment of status to that of a lpr in despite its alleged awareness that he previously had applied for tps under another a number,pet.and the uscis failed to rescind his lpr status or seek to remove him from this country before the expiration of the statute of limitations for taking such an action under a,pet.we do not agree with saliba that either of these considerations,even taken at face value,constitute a waiver of inadmissibility.saliba never obtained a waiver pursuant to i,which is the sole basis on which a waiver may be granted.
implicit waiver by the ins when saliba became a lpr 
saliba contends that the reviewing ins officer waived his inadmissibility when the ins granted him lpr status in.an applicant inadmissibility under a c i,based on his fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact,can be waived under i which reads as follows 
the attorney general may,in the discretion of the attorney general,waive the application of clause i of subsection a c of this section in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse,son,or daughter of a united states citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the attorney general that the refusal of admission to the united states of such immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the citizen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such an alien or,in the case of a vawa,the alien demonstrates extreme hardship to the alien or the alien united states citizen,lawful permanent resident,or qualified alien parent or child.
significantly,a formal application for a waiver under this section is the sole method of requesting the exercise of discretion under sections g,h,i,and k of the immigration and nationality act ina,as they relate to the inadmissibility of an alien in the united states.f emphasis added.in addition,a waiver applicant must apply for the related waiver by filing the form designated by uscis,with the fee prescribed in b,and in accordance with the form instructions.id.a see also khan johnson,cwx,wl,at cal,a n applicant is required to submit a formal application requesting a waiver and pay a fee.unless an applicant complies with these regulations,uscis is not permitted to waive the applicant bar to admissibility.saliba does not allege that he complied with these formal waiver application processes.
although states that the formal waiver application process is the sole method for an otherwise inadmissible applicant like saliba to obtain a waiver of inadmissibility,he fails to provide any evidence that he applied for,or obtained,a waiver under i.he,instead,contends that there is an issue of fact as to whether the ins was aware of his fraudulent procurement of tps when it approved his application to adjust his status to that of a lpr in.pet,see also appellant br.at.as support,saliba alleges that his application for lpr status shows that his original a number,assigned when he obtained tps in,was written on his application for lpr status in red ink but an ins officer subsequently crossed it out using dark colored ink,after which the same person replaced the old a number with his new a number.pet,see also appellant br.at.saliba contends that the on the document show that the issue of his misrepresentation was addressed by the officer reviewing the file,appellant br.at,and that through this proposed sequence of events,the ins implicitly waived any grounds for inadmissibility that may have existed at the time that he became an lpr,pet.
in dealing with the waiver point,we note that we do not agree with saliba that the ins apparent crossing out of his old a number,coupled with the insertion of his new a number in different colored ink,provide any evidence that a ins officer intended to grant him a waiver of inadmissibility.it is clear that the inference that saliba seeks to draw from his application,that a specific ins officer intended to grant him a waiver of inadmissibility,is not the only inference that can be drawn from the change of a numbers.after all,because a new number was assigned to a new application,for all we know the officer changed the numbers because the officer believed that the change was proper procedure inasmuch as saliba filed separate applications for tps and lpr status.yet in order to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,saliba must nudge his claim across the line from conceivable to plausible,an achievement that can not be accomplished through the type of speculative allegations that make up his,theory.twombly,at.at.
in any event,regardless of the ins officer intent,and taking the factual allegations of saliba petition as true,the circumstances surrounding his application for lpr status are insufficient as a matter of law to constitute a waiver of inadmissibility.as we have indicated,an application for waiver of inadmissibility under i is the sole method of requesting such a waiver.f emphasis added.thus,even if the ins reviewing officer intended to waive saliba inadmissibility,and even if that officer had been fully aware of saliba prior tps fraud,the officer lacked legal authority to waive the bars to saliba admissibility.see saliba,wl,at.in the absence of any evidence in the record showing that saliba was eligible for,applied for,and obtained a waiver of inadmissibility under the procedures set forth in i,and its implementing regulations,saliba inadmissibility was not waived at the time that he became a lpr.
failure to rescind lpr status within the statute of limitations in a 
saliba also contends that the statute of limitations that governs commencement of removal proceedings and rescission of lpr status under a should serve as a waiver of known grounds of disability for purposes of his application for naturalization.pet.see also pet.he maintains that the holdings of garcia and matter of saunders,bia,support his assertion that his misrepresentation implicitly was waived by uscis failure to rescind his lpr status within five years.pet.saliba essentially argues that since the uscis can not now rescind his lpr status or seek to remove him,it has no grounds on which to deny his application for naturalization.we disagree,and because neither section a,nor the cases interpreting its applicability,support the view that the uscis implicitly waived saliba inadmissibility,we conclude that his fraudulent procurement of tps precludes his attempt to naturalize.
the natural starting place in our inquiry with respect to a is the plain language of the statute.united states introcaso,cir.quoting staples united states.when we examine the plain language of section a,we are satisfied that it does not affect or implicate naturalization eligibility.the statute provides that 
if,at any time within five years after the status of a person has been otherwise adjusted under the provisions of section or of this title or any other provision of law to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,it shall appear to the satisfaction of the attorney general that the person was not in fact eligible for such adjustment of status,the attorney general shall rescind the action taken granting an adjustment of status to such person and cancelling removal in the case of such person if that occurred and the person shall thereupon be subject to all provisions of this chapter to the same extent as if the adjustment of status had not been made.nothing in this subsection shall require the attorney general to rescind the alien status prior to commencement of procedures to remove the alien under section of this title,and an order of removal issued by an immigration judge shall be sufficient to rescind the alien status.
a emphasis added.by its terms,the statute imposes a limitation on rescission of a grant of lpr status and removal of aliens.see malik att y,cir.garcia,at.
although we seem never to have opined directly on the issue,several district courts in this circuit have reached the conclusion that the plain language of the statute does not in any way contemplate extension of the limitations period to the naturalization process.jin mei lin napolitano,no.civ,wl,at.may,aff sub nom.jin mei lin sec y dep t of homeland.cir.accord adegoke fitzgerald,supp,petitioner argues that a extends beyond the rescission context and confirms that his lpr status is not void for purposes of naturalization.it does not.monge holder,no.civ,wl,at,because the government seeks neither to rescind petitioner lpr status nor remove him from the country,a does not apply in this case.
unlike saliba,we agree with the district courts recognition in those cases that rescission,removal,and naturalization raise entirely distinct legal questions,and though section a deals with rescission and removal,it does not concern naturalization.ros napolitano,wl,at.july,see also t he findings of the attorney general in terminating removal proceedings or in canceling the removal of an alien pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,shall not be deemed binding in any way upon the attorney general with respect to the question of whether such person has established his eligibility for naturalization as required by this subchapter.
this logical reading of the statute is consistent with our holding in gallimore in which we explained that an alien who becomes a lpr despite being inadmissible has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.at.in that case,the ins granted the alien conditional lpr status in july,and later removed conditions on his lpr status in august.id.at.the alien applied for naturalization more than five years later,in december,but the ins denied his application and initiated removal proceedings after it became aware that he had not disclosed his prior criminal conviction.id.although our analysis in that case focused on the issue of the alien eligibility for a waiver under ina c,we nonetheless held that the alien never was lawfully admitted for permanent residence,despite the fact that the limitations period in section a had expired prior to the ins naturalization denial.id.at.
a holding that an otherwise unlawful admission for permanent residence can be transformed into a lawful admission whenever the limitations period has expired under section a would be inconsistent with gallimore.after all,such a conclusion would contradict the gallimore point that an alien is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence unless he strictly complies with the substantive legal requirements of the immigration laws.at.we are satisfied that the substantive compliance prerequisite to the grant of citizenship can not be circumvented by reliance on a statute of limitations that by its
