opinion of the court 
wister evanson,a native and citizen of trinidad and tobago,pled guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and criminal conspiracy in violation of pennsylvania law.after the state judge sentenced him to probation and community service,the department of homeland security dhs commenced removal proceedings.the immigration judge ij found that evanson offense did not constitute an aggravated felony and granted cancellation of removal.however,based on information found only in a sentencing document,the board of immigration appeals bia found that the offense constituted an aggravated felony and ordered removal.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the bia erred in failing to apply the modified categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,d,and shepard united states,d,and therefore erred when it considered evanson sentencing document to determine whether he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.we will thus grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.
wister evanson,was admitted to the united states as a permanent resident in december of.in march,evanson was a passenger in a car owned and driven by stephanie ofori,his girlfriend,when they were hit by a drunk driver police responding to the accident found marijuana in the car and arrested evanson.according to the affidavit of probable cause attached to the police criminal complaint,the marijuana was in a large black trash bag found on the back seat of the car and was divided into one large bag,two bags,and small bags.the criminal complaint also alleged that a marijuana cigarette was found in evanson pocket.
evanson pled guilty in pennsylvania state court to a criminal information charging him with committing a controlled substance offense in violation of.stat.ann.a,and criminal conspiracy to commit that offense in violation of.cons.stat.ann.stat.ann.states 
a the following acts and the causing thereof within the commonwealth are hereby prohibited 
except as authorized by this act,the manufacture,delivery,or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver,a controlled substance by a person not registered under this act,or a practitioner not registered or licensed by the appropriate state board,or knowingly creating,delivering or possessing with intent to deliver,a counterfeit controlled substance.
mirroring the language of the statute,the information alleged that evanson did manufacture,deliver,or possess with an intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance s,to wit marijuana.administrative record.these counts of the information did not contain any additional detail about the offenses.
evanson was sentenced to months probation and community service.the judgment of sentence stated that evanson was charged with intent to deliver or manufacture marijuana lbs drug schedule.
following his sentencing,dhs commenced removal proceedings against evanson.specifically,dhs charged evanson with removability under a a iii,which provides that an alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable,and under a b i,which provides that an 
alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,is deportable.
evanson denied the charges of removability.
at evanson first hearing,the ij noted that he was required to consider what evanson was found guilty of or pleaded guilty to rather than the facts of the underlying offense.the ij then held that the criminal complaint was not sufficient evidence of the elements to which evanson pled guilty because it had been superceded by an information.the hearing was adjourned to give the government an opportunity to supplement the record with evidence that would establish the elements of the offense to which evanson pled guilty,namely a copy of the information and a transcript of evanson plea colloquy.
at a hearing in december,the ij reviewed the criminal transcript of the plea colloquy was presented despite the ij found that it did not establish that evanson offense involved payment.the ij therefore found that evanson offense could qualify as a federal misdemeanor.at.
accordingly,the ij found that the government had not established that evanson had been convicted of an aggravated felony and dismissed that count of the removability proceeding.the ij concluded that evanson was nonetheless removable pursuant to a b i because he had been convicted of violations of laws or regulations related to a controlled substance 
evanson then presented an application for cancellation of removal under a,which provides relief from removal for certain permanent residents.at a hearing on the application,evanson testified that the night before his arrest a friend placed a bag of marijuana in the trunk of ofori car and forgot to take it with him when he got out of the car.evanson denied that he knew that the marijuana was left in the car or the volume of marijuana.the next day,ofori was driving evanson home when they were hit by a drunk driver.a police officer witnessed the accident and asked ofori to follow him while he pursued the driver.once the driver was stopped,another officer indicated that he smelled marijuana and asked to search ofori car.the officer found the bag of marijuana and evanson was arrested.evanson admitted casual marijuana use,but denied that he ever sold marijuana or used marijuana in front of his children.
evanson also testified about his lengthy residence in the united states.in addition to serving as a reservist in the united states armed forces,evanson has been gainfully employed in the health care field for at least ten years.also,he has completed a number of courses towards an undergraduate degree in computer science from joseph university.evanson testified that he has three children,ages,and,all united states citizens.at the time he was taken into immigration custody,evanson lived with the older two children and their mother and saw the youngest child on a regular basis.evanson supported all three children.following evanson testimony,the ij credited evanson account of the incident and granted his request for cancellation of removal based primarily on his close relationship with his young united states citizen children.
the government appealed to the bia.in its decision,the bia found that evanson had been convicted of an offense involving possession with intent to deliver or manufacture a controlled substance,marihuana,in the amount of pounds.app.the bia did not discuss how it determined that evanson offense involved pounds of marijuana.based on the large quantity of marijuana involved,the board concluded that evanson conviction was punishable as a felony under the federal controlled substances act,a,and thus was an aggravated felony.app.as a result,the bia found that evanson was not eligible for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed.evanson petitions for review.
we have jurisdiction to determine de novo whether evanson conviction constituted an aggravated felony,but not to review the bia exercise of its discretion in granting or denying cancellation of removal.a c,d 
evanson contends that his conviction under pennsylvania state law did not constitute an aggravated felony.the government argues that evanson controlled substance offense was an aggravated felony,and that he is therefore ineligible for discretionary relief from an order of removal.to determine if evanson has been convicted of an aggravated felony,we begin with its definition under the immigration and nationality act ina.the definition of aggravated felony includes,in relevant part,illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b.in turn,section c defines drug trafficking crime as any felony punishable under the controlled substances act.thus,a state drug conviction constitutes an aggravated felony if a it would be punishable as a felony under the federal controlled substances act,or b it is a felony under state law and includes an illicit trafficking element.accordingly,we apply two independent tests for determining whether a state drug offense constitutes an aggravated felony the illicit trafficking element route and the hypothetical federal felony route.garcia att y,cir citing gerbier holmes,cir.
hypothetical federal felony 
under the hypothetical federal felony route,we compare the offense of conviction to the federal controlled substances act to determine if it is analogous to an offense under that act.the federal controlled substances act makes it a felony to knowingly or intentionally manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,any amount of marijuana,except that distributing a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration is a misdemeanor.a,b d,b.a state marijuana conviction is therefore only equivalent to a federal drug felony if the offense involved payment or more than a small amount of marijuana.see steele blackman,cir since distribution of marijuana without remuneration is not inherently a felony,it seems to us that the only alternative to so regarding it consistent with the rule of lenity would be to treat any offense in this context as a misdemeanor.wilson ashcroft,cir.
in jeune att y,we considered whether a conviction under.stat.ann.a was analogous to a violation of b d,cir.we found that distributing a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration could be prosecuted under the pennsylvania statute,and thus that we could not determine that it was equivalent to a federal drug felony without more information about the conviction.id.
we recognize that other courts have disagreed with our view of.see,julce mukasey,cir holding that a petitioner bears the burden of proving that a state marijuana conviction did not involve remuneration to escape the conclusion that the conviction amounted to a federal felony in re aruna,declining to apply steele to cases arising outside of the third circuit.however,the government makes no argument that we should alter our conclusion that distribution of a small amount of marijuana without remuneration is not inherently a federal felony.accordingly,we need not revisit this issue.
illicit trafficking element 
under the illicit trafficking element test,a state felony drug conviction constitutes an aggravated felony if it contains a trafficking element.see,gerbier,at.to contain a trafficking element,a state felony must involve the unlawful trading or dealing of a controlled substance.jeune,at quoting gerbier,at see also steele,at essential to the concept of trading or dealing is activity of a business or merchant nature,thus excluding simple possession or transfer without consideration.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in garcia,we noted that the pennsylvania statute may encompass conduct that does not involve trading or dealing.in particular,it is not clear that every violation of the manufacturing provision involves trading or dealing.at.in jeune,we clarified that more than the bare fact of conviction under.stat.ann.a is needed to satisfy the illicit trafficking element test.at noting that m anufacturing marijuana for personal use would arguably not be an aggravated felony.
accordingly,under either the hypothetical federal felony test or the illicit trafficking element test,a conviction under the pennsylvania statute is not necessarily an aggravated felony.thus,we must determine what records may be consulted to evaluate a conviction under the pennsylvania statute.
categorical approach 
to determine whether an offense of conviction amounts to an aggravated felony,including by means of the hypothetical federal felony and illicit trafficking element tests,we presumptively apply a formal categorical approach.singh ashcroft,cir synthesizing our aggravated felony case law.a formal categorical approach prohibits us from any review of the factual basis for an underlying conviction.id.at.thus,to determine what records we may consult in evaluating evanson pennsylvania conviction,we must determine whether the presumption in favor of the formal categorical approach applies,and if not,how far we may depart from it.we begin by considering the origin of the categorical approach.
the supreme court set forth the formal categorical approach in the context of the armed career criminal act acca,e.taylor united states,d.the acca requires an enhanced penalty for possession of a firearm when the defendant has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both.e.violent felony is defined as an offense that i has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.e b.taylor had been convicted of violating a state burglary statute that had a broader definition than the court found congress intended to apply to the term burglary as used in the acca.see at.thus,in taylor,the court was confronted with deciding whether the sentencing court in applying e must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,the formal categorical approach,or whether the court may consider other evidence concerning the defendant prior crimes,the factual approach.id.at.noting the language of e,legislative history suggesting a categorical approach to predicate offenses,and the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach,the supreme court concluded that a trial court should generally look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.id.at.
however,the supreme court also held that it was appropriate to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of an acca predicate offense.id.at.we refer to this second step of the taylor analysis as the modified categorical approach in particular,in taylor the court held that we may consult the charging document and jury instructions in addition to the statutory definition to determine what elements formed the basis for a defendant underlying conviction.id.at.
in shepard united states,d,the court extended the modified categorical approach to cases resolved by guilty plea.the court reiterated that a court applying e must avoid evidentiary enquiries into the factual basis for the earlier conviction,instead focusing on whether a plea had necessarily rested on the elements of an acca predicate offense.id.at.quoting taylor,at.thus,the court held that appropriate records to consider in evaluating a pleaded case are the statutory definition,charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of the plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented the closest analogs to the materials approved in taylor.at.holding that a police report submitted to a local court as grounds for issuing a complaint was not an appropriate document to consider.
like the acca,a a iii the section of the ina that renders an aggravated felon to a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony emphasis added rather than to any alien who has committed an aggravated felony.in re,for nearly a century,the federal circuit courts of appeals have held that where a ground of deportability is premised on the existence of a conviction for a particular type of crime,the focus of the immigration authorities must be on the crime of which the alien was convicted,to the exclusion of any other criminal or morally reprehensible acts he may have committed.accordingly,we presumptively apply the formal categorical approach in evaluating whether predicate convictions fall within the definition of aggravated felony.singh,at see also id.at noting that taylor analysis applies in the aggravated felony context because a the section enumerating aggravated felonies is similar to e in that it too enumerates offenses,conviction of which places an alien in the category of aggravate
