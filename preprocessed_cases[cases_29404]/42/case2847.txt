naing tun petitioner conceded removability and sought asylum,withholding of removal,relief under the convention against torture cat,and voluntary departure.an immigration judge ij denied all forms of relief,and the board of immigration appeals board affirmed.petitioner now seeks review of the board order.
the board determined that asylum relief was unavailable because petitioner failed to file his asylum application within one year after entering the united states.we are without jurisdiction to review that determination.see yakovenko gonzales,cir holding that a finding of untimeliness is a factual finding shielded from our review by a.the denial of relief on the withholding of removal and cat claims was based on an adverse credibility determination.as to these claims,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.we hold that the improper and prejudicial exclusion of evidence coupled with unreliable translation denied petitioner a fair hearing in violation of his due process rights under the fifth amendment of the united states constitution we need not address the parties arguments as to whether we have jurisdiction to review the board denial of voluntary departure.our remand on the other issues moots the board ruling on voluntary departure and requires a reopening of the record.
background 
general background 
petitioner is a native and citizen of burma and a member of burma minority arakan ethnic group.he entered the united states in february at new york,new york,as a crewman in transit with authorization to remain in the united states until march.he overstayed this authorization,was found removable,and sought relief alleging torture,past persecution,and a fear of future persecution.the ij handling his case excluded a physician affidavit and testimony that would have explained how scars and markings on petitioner body,as well as petitioner current medical and psychological symptoms,were consistent with claims of torture at the hands of burma ruling military regime.the ij also excluded an affidavit from a country conditions expert.the expert affidavit spoke directly to a critical,contested issue in the case,namely,the degree of surveillance exercised by the military regime over mail and communications and the difficulty of obtaining and sending documents from burma.also,at petitioner hearing before the ij,a native speaker of burmese interrupted the proceedings to inform the ij that the official translator was not correctly translating the questions and answers.consistent with these claims of translation problems,petitioner repeatedly had trouble understanding the questions asked by the ij and attorneys and frequently provided answers that did not make sense in light of the questions that were asked.after the hearing,petitioner submitted an affidavit from the native speaker detailing alleged translation errors,but the ij declined to accept the affidavit,found no evidence of translation errors,found petitioner,and denied relief.the board affirmed in a four page opinion.
because this case involves a challenge to an adverse credibility determination,alleged translation errors,excluded evidence,and an alleged deprivation of due process,it is necessary to review in detail the applications,affidavits,testimony,and other evidence admitted into and excluded from the proceedings below.
application,amended application,and accompanying affidavits and documents 
petitioner filed an initial pro se application,an amended application with a supporting affidavit,and supporting documents.the documents included a letter from han nyunt,a man who claimed that he protested in burma with petitioner in december.nyunt also claimed that military police arrested him,showed him pictures of petitioner,and questioned him about petitioner.other documents included state department human rights reports on burma for,and a document petitioner identified as a burmese warrant for his arrest dated october a march membership card for a opposition group in burma,the national league for democracy and a july document stating that petitioner was a member of a group called the arakan league for democracy.petitioner also submitted a written report from sharon frye,a physician petitioner offered as an expert in physical and psychological trauma.finally,petitioner offered a written report regarding country conditions in burma prepared by professor david steinberg,the director of asian studies at georgetown university school of foreign service.
in his initial,pro se application,petitioner made the following claims.his younger brother was killed in a student demonstration.also in,petitioner a ctively took part in the mass demonstrations as a member of the local citizen committee of my township of south okkalapa.petitioner joined a group called the national league for democracy after a coup that brought the present military regime to power in burma.in,before an election,he was arrested with other workers from the local citizen committee and incarcerated for nearly three years at insein prison,where he faced persecution,interrogations,threats and was forcibly put into solitary confinement.he took part in demonstrations in late,shortly before he left the country in february.
in his amended application,prepared with the assistance of counsel,petitioner stated,in i was arrested,beaten,and interrogated because of my political activities.i was incarcerated for over three years during which time i was tortured,interrogated,and forced to do hard labor.i was released only after signing a document stating that i would abstain from politics.he also claimed that a warrant was issued for his arrest in,and security agents still visited his family and asked about him.he feared indefinite incarceration,beatings and torture because of his race,political activities and memberships in the national league for democracy,the arakan league for democracy which he joined after arriving in the united states and the local citizen committee.he did not apply for relief immediately upon arrival in the united states because he wanted to see if the situation in burma improved.he applied for relief in june.this was shortly after the ins issued its notice to appear and shortly after the date he alleges that he learned of the arrest warrant.
in his affidavit accompanying the amended application,petitioner provided additional details regarding alleged abuse and torture that followed his arrest.petitioner alleged he was arrested by military agents and detained for several months at tauck kyant military headquarters near rangoon.there,he was asked about his political activities.when he refused to respond,his persecutors hanged him naked from the ceiling,beat him with bamboo batons,electrically shocked his back,chest,genitals,and shoulders,sodomized him with a rough wooden pole,beat him with rubber batons,and kicked and punched him.he was denied medical attention and still bears physical scars and suffers headaches and memory loss as a result of the torture.he then faced trial without counsel and without any appeal rights.he was convicted of political agitation and imprisoned at a prison facility called insein where,again,he was beaten.he was later moved to a work camp where he was subjected to forced labor.he was required to break rocks,mix feces for fertilizer,and plant trees,all while wearing shackles on his legs and a collar around his waist.
expert opinions 
as the first order of business at an april,hearing before the ij,the government objected to the use of professor steinberg report on conditions in burma.the government did not suggest that professor steinberg was in any manner unqualified to offer insight regarding current conditions in burma nor did it suggest that any evidence existed to indicate bias,lack of credibility,or lack of qualifications on the part of professor steinberg.rather,the government argued that petitioner should not be allowed to use professor steinberg as an expert because professor steinberg was not made available for.counsel for petitioner noted that the immigration court in louis had recognized professor steinberg as an expert on at least four prior occasions and that his credentials showed on their face that he was to address country conditions in burma.professor steinberg was a former employee of the department of state,had published more than twelve books and forty articles about burma and east asia,and had taught numerous classes on burma and east asia.notwithstanding these qualifications,the ij concluded,since the government does have the opportunity to him,that document will not be given any weight.
as the next order of business,counsel for petitioner sought to enter frye written report and have frye testify as an expert in the fields of physical and psychological trauma.in her written report,frye explained the background information petitioner had given to her regarding his time in burma.that information was consistent with petitioner applications,affidavits,and testimony as detailed below.she then described his current physical and psychological condition,which she had determined by personally examining petitioner in early february prior to the hearing.she stated 
t here is spinal tenderness at the level of lumbar region and a cm curved scar on the left shoulder.there are three cm scars at the level of the left shoulder.there is a cm round scar at the level of the thoracic spine.there are two mm hyperpigmented areas over the spine.there is a cm linear curved scar on the medial aspect of the left knee.there is a cm scar on the left pretibial surface.there is a cm scar on the medial aspect of the left lower extremity.there is a cm round scar on the left lateral ankle.there is circumferential hyperpigmentation around the ankles bilaterally.on the left buttock there is a cm round hyperpigmented brown area.
she concluded 
based on my examination it is my assessment that tun suffers from symptoms consistent with stress disorder resulting from his imprisonment and torture.disorder is a set of characteristic symptoms that develop following a psychologically distressing event such as torture which is considered to be outside the range of normal experiences.these symptoms in tun case include but are not limited to difficulty sleeping,nightmares,a sense of being lost in life,and increasing irritability.in addition,he develops periods of anger,and nausea and dizziness based on cues from his experiences.he has residual pain in his back which is consistent with his description of wearing the metal collar around his waist and also be ing beat en on many occasions with batons.his scars are consistent with the use of a stun apparatus,multiple beatings and wearing of collars around the ankles.although he remembers the association of some scars with the specific types of torture he can not remember all.tun suffers from memory loss due to the torture,malnutrition,sleep deprivation,and harsh living conditions.
emphasis added.
when petitioner sought to have frye testify,the ij expressed concern that petitioner interpreter had to make a six flight.the ij apparently wanted petitioner to testify first so that the interpreter could be released in time to make the flight.the parties agreed to this order for questioning the witnesses.frye was about to leave the proceedings and wait outside when the ij,apparently anticipating the dismissal of frye,decided it would be more efficient to address her qualifications as an expert before allowing petitioner to testify.the ij permitted voir dire during which frye explained her qualifications.
according to frye testimony during voir dire and the statement of qualifications in her written report,she had worked as an emergency room trauma nurse from approximately into the early.she then went to medical school in west virginia and was licensed by the state of missouri to practice medicine in.she has been a practicing physician since that time.she now works as an associate professor of internal medicine at the saint louis university health sciences center in the division of infectious diseases and immunology.she is fully trained and board certified in internal medicine and infectious diseases.in that capacity,she has seen and diagnosed many patients who have been physically or psychologically traumatized.she sees many victims of trauma who have developed infections secondary to their trauma and these victims often have psychological as well as physical symptoms.
in addition,frye volunteers with physicians for human rights asylum network.this group main purpose is the documentation and exposure of instances of human rights abuses.her participation includes travel to countries to offer medical assistance and document conditions.she traveled to zaire,bosnia,tajikistan,kosovo,afghanistan,ukraine,belize,rwanda,uganda,and india,but not burma.frye volunteer work for the group also involves providing assistance to asylum applicants in the form of medical evaluations and assistance in the preparation of affidavits.her role on the domestic side involves interviewing and examining applicants to make sure their symptoms are consistent with their claims and identify any false allegations of torture.she acted in a pro bono capacity for petitioner.
the ij believed frye was in the area of internal medicine but expressed concern at frye qualifications to offer an opinion regarding physical and psychological trauma.the ij claimed to have read frye report but appeared to ignore frye extensive experience with victims of physical trauma,the fact that petitioner offered frye as an expert in the area of physical trauma not just psychological trauma and the fact that frye directly connected petitioner actual physical scars and symptoms to his claims of torture and abuse.
the ij concluded that frye was not qualified to serve as an expert because she had not been to burma,her primary area of practice was internal medicine rather than trauma or psychiatry,and her organization,the physicians for human rights asylum network,seems to be more of an advocacy group than anything to do with treatment.
after dismissing frye,the ij and the attorneys questioned petitioner through the interpreter.petitioner relayed the following information in his testimony.his mother had been active in politics when he was young but was arrested and interrogated and,as result,ceased her involvement in politics.she had not been harassed by the military since that time,other than general surveillance and questioning regarding petitioner.in,after security forces shot and killed petitioner brother,petitioner and his family were not able to obtain the brother body nor were they able to obtain a death certificate the military rulers of burma would not issue death certificates for persons who died in demonstrations.petitioner testified that he was motivated by,and became active in politics following,the killing of his brother.petitioner organized group demonstrations and eventually joined the national league for democracy.he became a township organizer for the national league for democracy in the township of south okkalapa.
petitioner elaborated upon his description of his arrest and incarceration.he was arrested by security police in and tortured at military intelligence headquarters at tauck kyant.his persecutors were ethnic burmans.he was beaten,raped,locked in a small,dark,wet cell,and deprived of medical attention and adequate food.he was tried without process,sentenced,and taken to insein prison.there,again,he was beaten by officers,but a doctor provided some medical aid.when authorities discovered the doctor was being kind to political prisoners,the doctor was sent away.petitioner was then moved to a work camp at htoogyi.there he wore chains and iron rings around his back and feet,he could not walk freely,and he was forced to break rocks and plant trees.he testified that,at the work camp,he was made to do more than other prisoners and he believed this was because of his race.at the work camp,the only physical abuse other than the forced labor and shackles was kicking to make the prisoners work more.
in all,petitioner was incarcerated for over three years.he spent about three months at the work camp and was allowed no visitors while at military headquarters or at the work camp.his family was allowed to visit him once a month at insein prison,but on some visits,they were not allowed to see him because of his wounds.he was released from the work camp in december after he signed a form agreeing not to participate in political activities.
after he was released,he went to a medical clinic to be treated for injuries from beatings and from the chains he was forced to wear.he then was unable to find employment because people knew of his past political activities and his imprisonment,and they did not want to be involved with him.he was on a sort of probation and had to sign in periodically at a police office.he described being watched by government agents and being questioned at his home.
petitioner resumed political activities in after the funeral of burmese political figure and former prime minister u nu.fearing retribution,he fled to shan state,a different political subdivision in burma,near the thai border.in shan state,petitioner met,was befriended by,and obtained work from the owner of a vineyard.petitioner returned to rangoon in october and december to see his wife and parents and to participate in political demonstrations.while in rangoon during this time,petitioner claims that he stayed in a home owned by his employer from shan state.after petitioner participated in a demonstration that police broke up,he fled again to shan state.a friend of petitioner,saw naing,was arrested at the demonstration.
in february,petitioner was able to leave burma on a plane after his employer obtained travel documents for him.petitioner came to the united states.communications with persons in burma were difficult because government agents conducted surveillance of his family home in burma,listened to telephone communications,and read private mail.he could talk to his family on a limited basis,however,because they spoke arakanese,and the government agents spoke only burmese.petitioner family was questioned by military intelligence officers.the military government sent an arrest warrant to petitioner family home in october.petitioner received a copy of the arrest warrant in june.his father sent the warrant to the united states using the burmese postal system.petitioner father died in.a person from burma who came to the united states brought petitioner a copy of his father obituary.petitioner spoke to the family of a friend,hen nyunt,who was arrested at a demonstration.the family told petitioner that intelligence officers had questioned nyunt about petitioner.
later,petitioner received a letter from nyunt stating that petitioner should not return and that the military government had asked about petitioner and shown nyunt a picture of petitioner participating in a demonstration.the letter arrived via dhl.on,there was a good deal of questioning regarding surveillance,the danger to petitioner family in using the postal system,the use of dhl rather than use of the postal system,and the difficulty,impossibility,or danger inherent in trying to obtain government documents.ultimately,petitioner stated that his family used the postal system at their own risk when they sent him the warrant,that surveillance varied from being very tight at times to being less tight at other times,and that dhl was generally more secure and less likely to be screened by the military intelligence.petitioner explained that his family was not able to obtain government documents because he had been involved in politics,so he did have a death certificate regarding his father or prison records for his own incarceration.petitioner explained that the warrant was delivered to his family home and that it was not a document that his family had to seek from the government.petitioner also stated that he did not seek an affidavit or letter from his employer in shan state because he felt the employer had already done enough to help and petitioner did not want to bother him further.finally,petitioner stated that he did not have a death certificate regarding his father because he had not asked the person who came to the united states and brought the obituary to bring a death certificate.
during the hearing,there were at least a dozen instances where petitioner indicated that he did not understand the questions posed by the translator and at least a dozen other instances where petitioner responses,provided to the court by the translator,were confusing or not directly responsive to the questions originally asked in english.the ij and the board discussed examples of these confusing exchanges and relied upon the ij view of these confusing exchanges in finding petitioner to be not credible.we do not discuss each exchange,but rather,focus on those exchanges identified by the board and the ij 
motion to supplement the record and motion for a new hearing 
after the april hearing,petitioner filed a motion to supplement the record with an affidavit from the native burmese speaker who attended the hearing and attempted to speak during the hearing.the government resisted the motion and petitioner responded,asking for new hearing.in the affidavit,the native speaker indicated specific instances of incorrect translation and stated that,in his assessment,approximately twenty percent of the translation contained errors.examples referenced by the native speaker included,inter alia,the claim by the translator that petitioner had made reference to his children,when petitioner,in fact made no reference to children and,in fact has no children the translator misuse and interexchange of general terms like mistreated and beaten with more specific terms like raped and tortured like before leading to confusion regarding when,how often,and at which location petitioner experienced torture during his incarceration the interpretation of questions about when petitioner met his wife as questions regarding when petitioner married his wife and questions about his hometown rather than questions about his place of birth.according to petitioner,these and other passages in the transcript led to confusion and delay in petitioner answers and confusing,contradictory answers that contributed to the ij overall impression regarding petitioner credibility.
ij decision 
the ij restated her conclusions regarding frye in her written decision even if frye could have established that she was an expert,her testimony would have been given less weight because of her activities with refugees.ultimately the court found that frye was not an expert in the area offered and she was excused.the ij then addressed petitioner testimony at length.in concluding that petitioner was not credible,the ij stated,t he petitioner sworn testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application and it was not sufficiently corroborated by his supporting documents.the ij analysis of petitioner credibility focused on three main areas of concern alleged inconsistency between petitioner affidavit and his testimony concerning the conditions of his confinement at insein prison the issue of obtaining corroborating documents via regular post or dhl,the issue of the surveillance of his family in burma,and the danger to his family in sending materials to petitioner and the differences between his original and amended asylum applications and the lack of detail in the original application.the ij also cited other,miscellaneous inconsistencies.
regarding his treatment as a prisoner,the ij stated that petitioner affidavit was for the most part consistent with his testimony regarding his treatment while in custody at military headquarters in tauck kyant,but petitioner failed to testify to certain details he mentioned in his affidavit,such as being required to drink his own urine when water was not provided.the ij then stated that petitioner testimony was inconsistent with his affidavit regarding the conditions during his imprisonment at insein prison.the ij characterized petitioner affidavit as claiming that he was tortured once a month beaten with batons and punched tortured,then put in solitary,then tortured,and returned to solitary.the ij then described petitioner testimony regarding insein prison as follows h e first said he was not mistreated at insein,but then said he was tortured.he said he was tortured only twice,and after being put in solitary he was returned to his regular cell.he said he was hit with rifles and military boots,claimed he was not mistreated at insein but then said he was tortured.
regarding petitioner ability to obtain documents,the ij noted that petitioner repeatedly stated that he could not obtain documents from the government,but the ij found it inconsistent that petitioner had been able to obtain the arrest warrant.the ij also said it was inconsistent that petitioner was able to obtain a passport and leave the country in light of the arrest warrant and it was inconsistent that petitioner father was able to mail the arrest warrant when petitioner stated it was not possible for his family and friends to use the mail to send affidavits because they were under surveillance.also,the ij stated there was an inadequate explanation as to why his family could use dhl.
regarding the addition of detail between the original and amended asylum applications,the ij noted the omission from the initial application of details regarding his arrest,detainment,rape,or torture and the omission of any reference to having been a political organizer or leader,living in shan state or receiving the assistance from the employer in shan state.the ij recognized that petitioner had assistance of counsel in preparation of the amended application.
finally,regarding other inconsistencies,the ij noted that petitioner mother remains in burma unharmed even though she used to be active in politics,petitioner stated in his affidavit that he spent several days in a medical clinic after release from prison but testified that he only spent one day at a medical clinic,and petitioner failed to submit his national league for democracy membership card until even though it was purportedly issued in.
the ij then addressed the fact that petitioner had moved to reopen the record or hold a new hearing and had submitted an affidavit from the native burmese speaker who was present at the hearing.notwithstanding claims in the native speaker affidavit regarding language proficiencies,the ij found no evidence proving the native speaker abilities in either burmese or english,and the ij refused to permit petitioner to supplement the record.the ij made no comment as to petitioner confusing and answers or instances where petitioner was unable to understand the questions posed by the interpreter,and the ij apparently did not consider these exchanges to be evidence of poor translation.
based on the adverse credibility ruling,the ij denied relief.
board decision 
the board reviewed the ij opinion,finding no clear error in the ij credibility determination.the board addressed a few of the claimed translation errors,and stated,the ij only relied on two of the cited errors in making her adverse credibility determination the testimony that petitioner was not mistreated but was tortured at insein prison and the amount of times he was beaten at insein prison.the board chose six instances of alleged inconsistencies between petitioner affidavit and his testimony and described how the board believed the record supported the ij finding of inconsistencies.we address these inconsistencies in our analysis below.
the board also made fine distinctions in addressing what it perceived to be inconsistencies between the original and amended applications.for example,petitioner described his brother death as the catalyst for his own involvement in political activities,and listed may,as the date of death in one instance.in another instance,he gave may,as the date of his brother death.the board seized upon this and other inconsistencies as material inconsistencies proving petitioner not credible.ultimately,the board affirmed the credibility determination and dismissed the appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
an applicant for withholding of removal or relief under cat is entitled to a fair hearing under the due process clause of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution.reno flores,d al khouri ashcroft,cir the fifth amendment due process clause mandates that removal hearings be fundamentally fair.for a removal hearing to be fair,the arbiter presiding over the hearing must be neutral and the immigrant must be given the opportunity to fairly present evidence,offer arguments,and develop the record.b b a al khouri,at c urtailing testimony and circumscribing a petitioner ability to elaborate on the details of his claim by instructing him only to answer the questions asked and then concluding that limited responses undermined his credibility violates notions of fundamental fairness.marshall jerrico,d the due process clause entitles a person to an impartial and disinterested tribunal in both civil and criminal cases.a neutral arbiter is,at a minimum,one who has not the case and who is not predisposed to disregard a witness testimony based on that witness participation in an advocacy group.see,gonzales,cir finding a due process violation where an ij appeared to have a case and refused to hear relevant testimony because of a prejudgment about the witness credibility and the probative value of the witness testimony quoting kaur ashcroft,cir.
these procedural rights would be meaningless if an immigrant could not understand the proceedings,so the bia recognizes that due process rights necessarily encompass the right to competent translation.matter of tomas,i n,bia.also,although the traditional rules of evidence do not apply in immigration proceedings,prawira gonzales,cir,due process concerns dictate that immigration judges do not enjoy complete discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence.see also maroon ins,cir t he exacting requirements of judicial admissibility are not ordinarily applicable to administrative proceedings,except to the extent that due process is involved.internal citation omitted.to comport with the requirements of due process,evidence must be probative and its admission fundamentally fair,nyama ashcroft,cir quoting espinoza ins,cir,and the immigration court can not unfairly prevent a petitioner from presenting probative evidence and making a record.
to be entitled to relief based on an alleged due process violation,a petitioner under the immigration laws must show prejudice.in this context,prejudice means a showing that the outcome of the proceeding may well have been different had there not been any procedural irregularities.united states,cir actual prejudice exists where defects in the deportation proceedings may well have resulted in a deportation that would not otherwise have occurred.emphasis added,internal quotations omitted.this standard does not require petitioners to show by a preponderance that,but for the procedural infirmities,the result of the proceedings would have been different.al khouri,at prejudice in this context,however,does not require but for causation.rather,petitioners must demonstrate an error that potentially affects the outcome,id.quoting agyeman ins,cir,or had the potential for affecting the outcome.al khouri,at quoting ambati reno,cir.
here,given the strength of frye report and testimony as well as the importance of her medical opinion to the corroboration of petitioner claims of physical abuse and torture,we hold that the exclusion of her testimony may well have affected the outcome,especially when coupled with the ij exclusion of other evidence and reliance upon infirm translation,at.these combined errors include not only the exclusion of frye clearly admissible and highly probative testimony and report,but the exclusion of professor steinberg corroborating report,the ij and the board reliance on unreliable translation,and the application of a standard in assessing consistency between the application,the amended application,and the testimony.in particular,the ij and the board focused primarily on petitioner failure to maintain consistency in the details and level of detail used to describe his abuse and the locations and times of that abuse during his incarceration at three different facilities.the ij and the board also focused on petitioner description of difficulties with the mail and obtaining documents.these issues relate directly to the excluded evidence and to some of the most confusing aspects of the infirm translations.we discuss the errors below and detail the prejudicial impact associated with each.
exclusion of experts 
as an initial matter,we note that our review of the transcript left us with the firm impression that the ij desire to help the translator make a six flight weighed substantially in the decision to exclude frye.this is an obviously improper factor to consider when assessing the admissibility of an expert.the ij did not,however,expressly rely on this fact,and our analysis need not focus on this apparent basis for rejecting frye.rather,we look to frye qualifications and the reasons for exclusion expressly stated by the ij.
among the express reasons given by the ij for the exclusion of frye were her lack of travel to burma,her membership and work for the human rights organization,her focus on internal medicine and infectious diseases rather than trauma,and her lack of specialization in psychiatry or psychology.whether she had ever traveled to burma has absolutely no bearing on her ability as a physician to recognize physical or psychological trauma or to comment regarding the consistency between petitioner actual,present physical symptoms and his claims of abuse and torture.further,we find it more than a little troubling that an immigration judge who is ostensibly working as a neutral arbiter in a and decisionmaking capacity would use a physician participation in an advocacy and aid organization as a basis to presume a conflict and bias as opposed to considering such participation as affecting the weight of the evidence.this is especially troubling where,as here,the immigration service itself has used the very same organization to give presentations to immigration judges during training and continuing education seminars regarding torture in our view,the ij assessment of frye contained commentary regarding participation with the human rights organization that suggests the ij may not have acted as a neutral arbiter.benslimane gonzales,cir collecting cases involving suspect rulings by immigration judges wang attorney general,cir the tone,the tenor,the disparagement,and the sarcasm of the ij seem more appropriate to a court television show than a federal court proceeding.
further,frye was clearly qualified and offered critical corroborating testimony based on a recent medical examination of the petitioner.there does not appear to have been any objection to her methodology,only to her qualifications,and even if the rules of evidence were to apply in this context,it is not necessary that a physician be a specialist or publish in a particular area to provide assistance in the evaluation of claims of abuse or torture.see.requiring only that an expert be qualified by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education.given frye medical education and work experience as a physician and nurse in the united states and abroad,she was qualified to comment on physical trauma,physical scars,the consistency between petitioner claims and his physical scars and symptoms,and,based on her experience with trauma victims,psychological effects of trauma.see,hanaj gonzales,cir ordering a remand and suggesting reassignment to a different ij where the initial ij ignored aspects of a petitioner evidence,including an affidavit from a board certified family physician who documented scars on the petitioner heel,head,shoulder,back,palms and leg consistent with the petitioner allegations of beatings.
regarding the possibility of prejudice under the standard of,we believe that the exclusion of frye report and testimony may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.the contents of her report and anticipated testimony were strong evidence of torture and strongly corroborated petitioner claims.the markings around petitioner waist and ankles were consistent with his claims of having been shackled in the work camp,and his numerous small scars and skin discolorations were consistent with his claims of having been tortured with electrical shocks.the ij and the board,however,chose to wholly disbelieve petitioner by focusing only on perceived conflicts between the applications,affidavit,and testimony regarding the details of when and where the abuse occurred.it is clear the ij wholly disbelieved petitioner because the ij stated,t he horrific facts tun describes,if true,surely amount to past persecution.
notwithstanding this conclusion,the ij and the board completely ignored the most valuable corroborating evidence of his relied specifically on infirm aspects of the translation to discount his claims.petitioner claim for relief,however,depended not on the precise details of when,how often,and in which place of confinement he was tortured,but whether he was tortured and whether it is likely to happen again upon his return to burma.the inconsistencies relied upon by the ij and the board pale in comparison to the strong physical evidence corroborating his claims of torture,forced labor,and bondage.given this fact,we have little trouble concluding that the improper exclusion of frye affidavit and testimony strongly suggest prejudice under the due process standard.
professor steinberg 
professor steinberg was qualified as shown not only by his resume,but also by his body of published works.according to his affidavit,prepared in january,he traveled frequently to burma,including a recent visit in august and a planned trip in february.the ij excluded his affidavit solely because he was not present to be cross examined.the presence of the author of a report and availability of the author for,however,are not absolute requirements in immigration proceedings.see,yang gonzales,cir finding error and remanding where an ij and the bia failed to accord weight to an affidavit from a,facially qualified country condition expert.as described above,fairness rather than the rules of evidence govern the admissibility of evidence,and the use of a report from a qualified witness,in the absence of any specific objections,is generally fair.the weight ij routinely ascribe to reports by absentee authors is shown by reliance on such materials,including the state department country reports.perinpanathan ins,cir discussing the value of department of state country condition reports in the assessment of claimed fears of persecution.importantly,the government and the ij in the present case did not suggest that there was any basis upon which to impugn professor steinberg qualifications or to suspect bias.had the government suggested any basis for its alleged need to professor steinberg,this issue might merit greater attention.as it stands,however,the ij election to exclude the report of a facially unobjectionable expert without any explanation as to why was needed is unfair and unsupportable.see,niam ashcroft,cir holding in an asylum case that the exclusion of a relevant expert witness affidavit was arbitrary and required reversal where nothing in the expert affidavit or in her curriculum vitae showed that she was unqualified to give expert evidence.
regarding prejudice,we note that professor steinberg report provided strong corroboration for petitioner claims the military regime in burma conducted surveillance of individuals,mail,and telephone conversations.these claims were also corroborated by statements in the country reports,but professor steinberg report added detail and explained with greater specificity the invasive and pervasive nature of the regime surveillance practices the exclusion of his report added to the prejudice against petitioner because one of the primary bases for finding petitioner not credible was petitioner perceived waffling regarding his family and his friends ability or inability to use the burmese postal system and dhl shipping.petitioner said that use of the mail was too dangerous and that government agents would read the mail,but he also said dhl packages were less likely to be screened and his family could use the mail system if they paid bribes to the appropriate persons.while it is not unreasonable for a finder of fact to view these statements as inconsistent and rely on such inconsistencies,in part,to find a petitioner not credible
