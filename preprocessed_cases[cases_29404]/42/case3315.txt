section b of the immigration and nationality act imposes an obligation on employers to verify that their employees are legally authorized to work in the united states.b.regulations designate the employment eligibility verification form i form for this purpose,a,and employers must retain these forms and provide them for inspection upon three days notice.b ii.this case arises out of the results of one such inspection in which immigration and customs enforcement ice discovered violations of the verification requirements of b.
ketchikan drywall services,kds petitions for review from the summary decision of an administrative law judge alj in favor of ice on out of alleged violations of b and the resulting civil penalty of.kds argues that it substantially complied with the requirements of the statute,that the alj improperly refused to consider certain documents,and that the penalty was improperly calculated.we have jurisdiction under e and deny the petition.
kds is a drywall installation company incorporated in washington state.it employs four employees and approximately twenty employees.it also hires additional employees as needed on a basis.kds does not hire workers in the field,but requires them to go to its main office first to fill out i forms.
over the years,more than a dozen different employees have been responsible for collecting i forms from new hires,but until,kds did not employ any staff with training in i compliance.in,kds received a warning notice from the immigration and naturalization ins following an audit of its i forms.in,kds finally hired a new controller with i training who initiated efforts to improve compliance.
in march,ice served a notice of inspection and administrative subpoena on kds,requesting o riginal i forms and any copies of attached documents presented at the time of i completion for employees working from january,to march.kds produced some i forms and other employee verification documents on april.on april,ice served a notice of intent to fine nif,and kds subsequently made a further production of documents.ice accepted these documents,reviewed them,and served an amended nif on october.
the amended nif contained four counts.count i covered employees for whom kds had failed to provide any i form at all,in violation of b and b.count ii covered employees for whom section employee information and attestation of the forms was incomplete,in violation of b and b i count iii covered employees for whom section employer or authorized representative review and verification of the i forms was incomplete,in violation of b and b ii count iv covered employees for whom there were omissions in both section and section.ice ordered kds to pay a civil penalty of.
kds requested a hearing before an alj,and ice filed its complaint with the office of the chief administrative hearing officer.kds responded to the complaint and,together with its response,it produced for the first time more copies of identification and employment authorization documents.the alj refused to consider these documents.he granted ice motion for summary decision for violations under count i,violations under count ii,violations under count iii,and violations under count iv,for a total of violations.the alj granted kds motion for summary decision on the remaining violations.
the alj adopted ice proposed base penalty,but adjusted it downwards to reflect the fact that fewer violations had been proven than alleged.the alj rejected both parties arguments regarding aggravating or mitigating factors,and ordered kds to pay a civil penalty of.this petition for review followed.
kds contends that many of the violations that the alj found were not violations at all,on the ground that it had copied and retained documentation for these employees and that any omissions from the i forms themselves were either minor or could be filled in by reference to the copied documents.kds also argues that the alj erred in refusing to consider those documents produced for the first time with its summary decision materials,and that those documents cure the deficiencies in the i forms to which they relate.finally,kds argues that the penalty was improperly calculated and should have been reduced to reflect both its good faith efforts to comply with its statutory obligations and the nature of any violations.
we review agency action under the narrow arbitrary or capricious standard as set forth in the administrative procedure act.a judulang holder.we do not grant deference under chevron.nrdc,to an agency interpretation of a statute unless it appears both that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.united states mead,emphasis added.even where it does not qualify for chevron deference,however,agency action may still qualify for deference under skidmore swift,where it exhibits persuasive characteristics.mead,at the fair measure of deference to an agency administering its own statute has been understood to vary with circumstances,and courts have looked to the degree of the agency care,its consistency,formality,and relative expertness,and to the persuasiveness of the agency position.citing skidmore,at.we do not overturn an agency determination of a civil penalty unless it is either unwarranted in law or unjustified in fact.balice dep t of,cir quoting bosma dep t of,cir.
kds first argues that it fully complied with its statutory obligations by copying and retaining its employees verification documents together with partially completed i forms,because the documents showed the employees eligibility for work and the forms had been signed.kds further argues that any other deficiencies should be excused as merely technical or procedural failures,made in spite of good faith attempt to comply.see b a.finally,it contests several specific violations that the alj found with respect to sections and of its i forms.we address these arguments seriatim.
kds argues that b unambiguously allows an employer simply to copy and retain its employees verification documents in order to comply with the verification and documentation requirements imposed by b.that provision reads,in relevant part 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,the person or entity may copy a document presented by an individual pursuant to this subsection and may retain the copy,but only for the purpose of complying with the requirements of this subsection.
b.kds asks this court to read b as providing an alternative to filling out the forms completely.the statute,however,does not allow for such an interpretation.under a plain reading of its text,nothing in b relieves employers of any of the statutory verification and documentation obligations imposed in b and.nor is it written in terms of providing employers with an alternative method of complying with those subsections that the statute permits the copying and retention of documents for the purpose of complying with the statute does not mean that employers need do nothing further in order to comply.in other words,copying and retaining documents is neither necessary nor sufficient for compliance,and b simply makes clear that it is permitted.
regulations confirm this understanding that compliance requires that the relevant information from the documents be transcribed onto the i form,regardless of whether copies of the documents are retained.b explains that,while copying of documents is not required,it is permitted it also goes on to explain that t he copying and retention of the copy or electronic image does not relieve the employer from the requirement to fully complete section of the form i.kds asks us to read this regulation in light of two cases that preceded its promulgation,united states manos,ocaho,wl,and united states,richfield caterers,ocaho at,wl,which could be read to stand for the proposition that partial completion of an i form might be sufficient.but we must interpret the regulation by its own terms,for it has superseded whatever rule manos and richfield caterers may have established.fully means fully,and not,as kds argues,partially.
kds argues that it is senseless to require employer and employees to waste the time necessary to transcribe information onto i forms when that information is already available on an attached copy of the relevant document.but requiring that the parties take the time to copy information onto the i form helps to ensure that they actually review the verification documents closely enough to ascertain that they are facially valid and authorize the individual to work in the united states.the i form also provides concrete evidence that such review took place.further,aggregation of all of the relevant information onto one form allows for easier review of that information by ice.it is neither arbitrary nor capricious to require that employers actually complete their i forms.
kds argues in the alternative that even if it has not complied with all of its verification and documentation obligations under b,its should nevertheless be treated as compliance under b a because any deficiencies were merely technical or procedural,made in spite of a good faith attempt to comply.it urges us to rely on a congressional committee report from explaining the elements of a good faith defense under a and cites montero martinez ashcroft,cir,for the proposition that a term should be given the same meaning throughout the statute.but the meaning of a term like good faith attempt necessarily changes with context,even within a single statute an employer may make a good faith effort to comply with the statute in some regards without making a corresponding effort to comply in others.because employers substantive obligation to avoid employing unauthorized individuals differs from their procedural obligation to verify and document that their employees are authorized to work,we are not persuaded that the elements that might establish a defense to violations of the one should also establish a defense to violations of the other.accordingly,we must look elsewhere for guidance on how best to interpret b a.
in,the ins published extensive interim guidelines interpreting what constituted technical or procedural violations as opposed to substantive violations.see memorandum from paul virtue,ins acting exec.comm r of programs,interim guidelines section b of the immigration and nationality act added by section of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of march,the virtue memorandum.before turning to the substance of the virtue memorandum,we first address the government argument that the memorandum is owed chevron deference.
we grant chevron deference only where the agency exercised its delegated authority to promulgate rules that carry the force of law.see mead,at.where an agency action was not undertaken pursuant to a relatively formal administrative procedure tending to foster the fairness and deliberation that should underlie a pronouncement that carries the force of law,we are unlikely to find that the agency action carries such force.see id.at.in the instant case,the virtue memorandum was promulgated only informally,and with the expectation that formal regulations would be forthcoming.see virtue memorandum at explaining that interim guidelines shall apply only u ntil implementing regulations are in place.accordingly,the virtue memorandum is not entitled to chevron deference.see christensen harris,i nterpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of law do not warrant deference.
we must next consider whether the virtue memorandum is entitled to any deference under skidmore.see mead,at.whether the virtue memorandum should be given skidmore deference depends on such factors as the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,as well as its overall power to persuade.see id.at quoting skidmore,at.we note that the virtue memorandum provides detailed,concrete guidance for dealing with omissions that might appear on an i form,indicating that the agency did indeed consider the issue thoroughly.see virtue memorandum at.we further note that,although the agency has not fully explained the rationale underlying its guidance,it has drawn the distinction between substantive violations and technical or procedural violations in a manner.for example,a failure to ensure that the individual provides his or her printed name is a substantive violation,while a simple failure to ensure that the individual also provides his or her maiden name is merely technical or procedural.virtue memorandum at,a b,b a.further,the agency has consistently relied on the virtue memorandum in enforcing the statute for well over a decade.see,united states wsc plumbing,ocaho.finally,we note the relative expertise of the agency when it comes to determining which omissions are substantive and which ought to be excused.see mead,at.in sum,we are persuaded that the classification of substantive violations and technical or procedural violations contained in the virtue memorandum is entitled to skidmore deference and so hold.we now turn to the specific violations that kds challenges in this case.
the alj found,and kds challenges,section violations counts ii and iv where employees failed to check any box in section of the i form,and where employees checked the box indicating lawful permanent resident lpr status but failed to provide an alien number kds also challenges the alj finding of a violation where kds created a new i form for a rehired employee by cobbling together a photocopy of section of that employee previous i form with an updated section.
kds argues first that it is not responsible for errors or omissions made by employees in section of its i forms,but b clearly makes employers responsible for documenting employee work authorization.where kds chose to hire employees who had failed to fill out section completely,it did so at its own peril.
kds also argues that it suffices for an employee to attest that he or she is authorized to work generally,and that there is accordingly no requirement for that employee to check a specific box in section of the i form.the language of the statute compels the contrary conclusion,however employees must attest to the specific category of eligibility into which they fit.see b listing three categories that render an individual eligible for work in the united states,and requiring that individual to attest to one of them.the virtue memorandum confirms that an employee failure to check a box in section is indeed a substantive verification failure.virtue memorandum at a b.
next,kds contends that its retention and production of copies of certain of its employees documents excuse deficiencies on the i forms where the copied documents provide the necessary information.it is true that the virtue memorandum provides that some kinds of violations that would otherwise be substantive are rendered technical or procedural where the relevant information is available on a legible copy of a document retained with the form i and presented at the i inspection.see virtue memorandum at b.kds was found liable for deficiencies in section related to its employees failure to attest to a specific category of eligibility by checking the appropriate box,however,and such violations are classified as substantive,notwithstanding the availability of copies of the relevant documents.see virtue memorandum at a b.as we have noted,this is consistent with the language of the statute,which explicitly includes this attestation requirement.see b.where the employee has not attested to the specific category of eligibility into which he or she fits,the statutory requirement is unfulfilled,regardless of whether other documentation might allow ice to deduce the specific category to which the employee would have attested.see id.
kds argues that it should not be penalized for using a copy of section of an employee previous i form to create a new form when it rehired that employee.when an employer rehires an employee,it has the option of either using section of that employee previous i form,or of creating a new form.c.there is no option to proceed by cobbling togeth
