jorge arturo and his wife maria jesus torre petition for review of the board of immigration appeals bia opinion dismissing their appeal of an immigration judge ij denial of their petitions for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture cat.we grant the petition for review and remand this case to the bia for further proceedings,but we hold that on remand the bia need not necessarily deem credible.
jorge arturo,and his wife maria torre la torre,natives and citizens of peru,sought asylum and withholding of removal based on alleged persecution by the terrorist organization shining path.the incident central to claim occurred on june.according to testimony,two members of the shining path broke into his house in peru,while two other shining path members remained outside.fired his gun in the air,triggering his car alarm,and the four individuals fled.
submitted a police report mentioning this incident,but the report as produced by the police differs from account of the incident.the police report stated that was awakened by his car alarm,and when he went outside two security guards told him they saw two individuals fleeing over the wall.the report said nothing about two other people entering house,about a gun being fired,or about any involvement by the shining path.finally,the police report recited that had said items were stolen from his car,while own account in his testimony and in his declaration mentions no property loss.
and la torre were charged as removable in.they conceded removability but sought relief in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.at the ij hearing direct examination testimony focused on the june incident.neither the government nor the ij asked about the contents of the police report.before testifying,in a written declaration filed with the immigration court,had explained that the police report did not mention the shining path because,as he put it,the police did not want to get involved with allegations of the shining path.did not explain in his written declaration,nor in his hearing testimony,why the police report did not mention the home invasion or gunfire that he described in his hearing testimony.
the ij denied and la torre petition,finding that was not credible because his testimony about the june incident differed from the account in the police report.the ij then held alternatively that even if testimony was credible,she would still have denied relief on the ground that failed to show past persecution or a fear of future persecution because t he june incident appears to be a criminal robbery.the bia affirmed the ij ruling and alternate holding,citing the same inconsistencies between testimony and the police report.
we review the ij and bia adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence.see kaur ashcroft,cir.the ij based her adverse credibility finding on the inconsistencies between account,during his immigration proceeding,of the june incident as a terrorist home invasion and the police report describing the same event as a car burglary.these inconsistencies go to the heart of the petitioners claim.see desta ashcroft,cir.however,gave a plausible explanation in his declaration for one of these police report failure to mention the shining path.the ij did not comment on this explanation in her decision,nor suggest any reason that she found his explanation not credible.garrovillas ins,cir.this lack of consideration given to proffered explanation was error and prevents the underlying inconsistency from serving as substantial evidence to support the ij adverse credibility finding.see,kaur,at an adverse credibility finding is improper when an ij fails to address a petitioner explanation for a discrepancy or inconsistency.guo ashcroft,cir holding that an alleged inconsistency in a petitioner testimony could not serve as substantial evidence for an adverse credibility finding where the ij did not address at all the petitioner reasonable and plausible explanation for the inconsistency.
the bia made only passing and incomplete mention of explanations for the discrepancies,noting that t he respondents argue that this was a minor inconsistency or no consistency sic at all but concluding that w e disagree.because the bia opinion does not refer to the explanation that gave,to the effect that police in peru are reluctant to mention the shining path,and does not give the bia reasons for considering that explanation unpersuasive,the bia treatment of explanation does not satisfy our precedential requirement that in order to ensure a fair hearing,the bia not only identify specific inconsistencies,but also address in a reasoned manner the explanations that the petitioner offers for these perceived inconsistencies.ins,cir quoting osorio ins,cir.we hold that where gave an explanation of inconsistencies between his account of the june incident at his home and the account of that incident in the police report,those inconsistencies can not serve as substantial evidence for a finding that was not credible when neither the ij nor the bia addressed explanation in a reasoned manner.id.
explanatory statement does not account for all of the inconsistencies between the police report and testimony.his explanation does not suggest why the police report did not mention that there were two intruders inside the house as well as two outside of it,nor does it suggest that shot his gun to scare the men away.moreover,his explanation sheds no light on why the police would report that a bag containing sales slips and toys was stolen from car when in his written statement and during his testimony did not mention any property being taken.however,was never asked about any of these inconsistencies at his hearing before the ij.it is speculative at this juncture,but certainly possible that may have had good explanations for the remaining differences between his testimonial report and that filed by the police and also possible that the bia might have good reasons to reject his explanations.it may be that explanation that the police do like to mention the shining path also explains why they would not mention his use of a gun or the home invasion,because these points were part of his story about the shining path.in any event,the ij could not properly base her adverse credibility determination on the inconsistencies between testimony and the police report that did not explain in his declaration,when she did not ask about these discrepancies or give him an opportunity to reconcile them.see don gonzales,cir t he ij must provide a petitioner with a reasonable opportunity to offer an explanation of any perceived inconsistencies that form the basis of a denial of asylum.quoting ordonez ins,cir chen ashcroft,cir finding that the petitioner was denied a reasonable opportunity to explain what the ij perceived as an inconsistency in her testimony and concluding that t he ij doubt about the veracity of her story,therefore,can not serve as a basis for the denial of asylum because the ij did not offer an opportunity to explain the inconsistencies on which she later relied in finding him not credible and did not address the explanation he gave for some of those inconsistencies,the ij adverse credibility finding,which was subsequently adopted by the bia,was not supported by substantial evidence.
the ij and bia alternately held that even if were deemed credible,he and his wife still had not met their burden of establishing eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.despite the asserted independence of this conclusion,however,neither the ij nor the bia took all of testimony as true for the purposes of determining his and la torre eligibility for asylum,as they are required to do when deeming a petitioner to be credible in an alternate holding.see kalubi ashcroft,cir testimony must be accepted as true in the absence of an explicit adverse credibility finding.in reaching the conclusion that the experiences had suffered in peru did not rise to the level of persecution on the basis of a protected ground,both the ij and bia referred to the june incident as a criminal robbery,thus crediting the p
