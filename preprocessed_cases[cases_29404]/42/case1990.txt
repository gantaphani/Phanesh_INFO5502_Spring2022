ferdinand omagah petitions for review of an order of the attorney general refusing to grant a discretionary suspension of deportation.the immigration judge ij and board of immigration appeals bia concluded that omagah conviction,under,of conspiracy to obtain,possess,and use fraudulent immigration documents barred suspension.we deny the petition for review.
omagah,a nigerian citizen,originally entered the united states on august,using an student visa and resided there from august,to the present,with the exception of two visits to see his parents.omagah applied for permanent residence through the amnesty program,and his application was pending on april.
on august,the attorney general initiated an order to show cause why omagah should not be deported because he had overstayed his student visa and he had been convicted of conspiring to obtain,possess,and use false immigration documents.
on december,the ij ordered omagah deported to nigeria,then considered his request for suspension of deportation and voluntary departure.at the suspension hearing,the government introduced the plea agreement and accompanying factual resume and argued that omagah was per se ineligible for suspension because the conviction established that he lacked good moral character.
the ij found that omagah lacked good moral character for two reasons.first,the ij agreed that the conspiracy to obtain,possess,and use illegal immigration documents proved,as a matter of law,that omagah lacked good moral character.second,the ij found that omagah had testified falsely under oath at the suspension hearing his testimony that he merely was inquiring about his immigration status during the meeting with the immigration officer was belied by the plea agreement and factual resume.the ij found that omagah had perpetrated a fraud on the court by testifying falsely.the bia upheld the ij decision on appeal.
the attorney general has discretion to suspend an alien deportation for criminal convictions if the alien 
is deportable under paragraph,or of section a of this title has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than ten years immediately following the commission of an act,or the assumption of a status,constituting a ground for deportation,and proves that during all of such period he has been and is a person of good moral character and is a person whose deportation would,in the opinion of the attorney general,result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien or to his spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
a ed.repealed so,the statute establishes two prerequisites before the attorney general may find exceptional and extremely unusual hardship and suspend deportation continuous residence for over ten years and good moral character.if the alien fails to satisfy one of those prerequisites,the attorney general lacks the discretion to suspend deportation under 
there is a standard to review the bia finding that the alien per se lacks good moral character.hamdan ins,cir.first,we consider whether the bia has applied the correct legal standard to determine good moral character.id.we must accord deference to the bia legal interpretation of good moral character and moral turpitude as used in the ina.id.if the phrases are ambiguous,we defer to the bia reasonable interpretation.id we will review de novo,however,the interpretation of federal and state criminal statutes.hamdan,at.determining a particular federal or state crime elements lies beyond the scope of the bia delegated power or accumulated expertise.
if we determine that the bia has interpreted the ina reasonably and the substantive criminal law correctly,we proceed to the second step,in which we use the substantial evidence test to evaluate the bia factual finding that a specific alien lacks good moral character.id.quotation omitted citation omitted.the substantial evidence standard requires only that the bia decision be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.id.quotation omitted citation omitted mikhael ins,cir.
we lack jurisdiction to review the bia discretionary decisions.omagah challenges a bia decision issued after october,in a deportation case initiated before april,so we have jurisdiction under the transitional rules set forth in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira iirira transitional rules strip the courts of appeals of jurisdiction over the attorney general discretionary decisions over whether to suspend deportation for example,we lack the jurisdiction to review the bia discretionary judgment concerning whether the alien citizen family members would suffer unusual and extremely severe hardship.moosa,at.
the alien,however,must satisfy the residency requirement and prove statutory eligibility for good moral character before the bia exercises its discretion.the question of good moral character is not left entirely to the executive discretion.convictions of crimes of moral turpitude establish per se an absence of good moral character.where the bia bases its decision on a past conviction for a crime of moral turpitude,we should apply our standard of review in this case,the bia based its decision on omagah conviction,moral turpitude,and per se ineligibility for suspension.we may review that conclusion,because the statute classifies it as nondiscretionary.
the bia found that omagah lacked good moral character because he had committed a crime of moral turpitude.that conclusion is reasonable conspiring to obtain,possess,and use illegal immigration documents is a crime of moral turpitude.the crime involves fraud as a central ingredient and requires proof of mens rea sufficient to classify it as a crime of moral turpitude.
we previously have adopted the bia definition of moral turpitude 
moral turpitude refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.moral turpitude has been defined as an act which is per se morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong,or malum in se,so it is the nature of the act itself and not the statutory prohibition of it which renders a crime one of moral turpitude.among the tests to determine if a crime involves moral turpitude is whether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind.
hamdan,at quoting bia decision in the same case internal citations omitted.
we concentrate on the inherent nature of the crime,as defined in the statute concerned,rather than the circumstances surrounding the particular transgression.okoro ins,cir citing okabe ins,cir.as a general rule,if a criminal statute encompasses both acts that do and do not involve moral turpitude,then the bia can not sustain a finding of deportability.pichardo ins,cir hamdan,at.for us to sustain a finding of deportability under such an overbroad statute,the law must be divided into discrete subsections that track the distinction between moral turpitude and less severe conduct.hamdan,at.
in practice,the supreme court and courts of appeals have the distinction between malum in se and mala prohibita crimes.crimes including dishonesty or lying as an essential element involve moral turpitude.in jordan degeorge,the court held that the potentially regulatory offense of evading liquor taxes constituted a crime of moral turpitude.the court did not address whether evading liquor taxes was malum in se or mala prohibita instead,it explained that fraud has consistently been regarded as such a contaminating component in any crime that american courts have,without exception,included such crimes within the scope of moral turpitude.id.in the wake of jordan,the courts of appeals have interpreted moral turpitude as including a wide variety of crimes that involve some fraud or deceit 
when assessing substantive criminal laws,we have focused on the elements of the crime.if the government must prove that the defendant acted with a guilty mind or intentionally deceived someone,we have been more likely to classify it as a cr
