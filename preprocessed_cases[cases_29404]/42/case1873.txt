claudia lorena,also known as claudia,moreno petitions for review of an order by the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge order that moreno be removed from the united states.we hold that under the undisputed facts moreno did not automatically obtain citizenship pursuant to section g of the immigration and naturalization act,g,by virtue of her adoption by a citizen.having no other claim to citizenship,moreno is an alien.she is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered by a b and likewise by a a iii.accordingly,under a c,we lack jurisdiction to review her challenge which does not fall within section a d to the rulings of the immigration judge ij and the bia denying her relief under former section c on the basis that in the exercise of discretion she did not merit and was not deserving of such relief.
facts and proceedings below 
the undisputed facts respecting moreno citizenship are as follows.she was born in mexico on september,to unmarried mexican citizens.in june,in mexico,her mother married manuel moreno manuel,a citizen.manuel was born in the united states in and prior to had been physically present in the united states for not less than ten years,at least five of which were after.in,on manuel application,moreno was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident.on december,manuel adopted moreno as his daughter in a new mexico state court proceeding.there is no claim nor any evidence of any relationship between manuel and moreno mother or between manuel and moreno prior to.in,when moreno was,her mother became a naturalized citizen of the united states.
moreno dropped out of high school in her junior year and began cohabiting with gustavo soto.the two of them frequently used drugs and often supported themselves by selling drugs.in october,moreno participated with soto and others in the illegal transportation of marihuana by motor vehicle from las cruces,new mexico to a location on interstate highway in the vicinity of truth or consequences,new mexico.the marihuana was moved in one vehicle and moreno and soto were in a separate vehicle looking out for police.moreno and soto were arrested,charged,and released on bail.moreno then fled with soto to mexico,and she became the subject of a federal warrant as a fugitive.after becoming frightened by soto abusive conduct towards her,moreno returned to the united states and surrendered to federal authorities.in august,moreno,pursuant to a plea agreement,pled guilty to,and was convicted of,possession with intent to distribute more than kilograms of marihuana in violation of a and b c and,and in october she was sentenced for that offence by the united states district court for the district of new mexico to five years probation.
moreno abstained from drugs between and early,but then began to frequent a party house in las cruces where she frequently used cocaine moreno was at this house with a number of people on an evening in june,when ty lowery lowery was murdered.in july,based on accusations from some of those present,moreno was arrested and charged with murder,conspiracy,and false imprisonment.in october new mexico state court proceedings,moreno,following a jury trial,was acquitted of both the murder and conspiracy charges,but was convicted of falsely imprisoning lowery,and in january she was sentenced to three years imprisonment 
in may,the new mexico federal district court revoked moreno probation for her drug conviction and sentenced her to serve months in prison for that possession with intent to distribute offense.
while she was serving her federal sentence,moreno filed an application with the citizenship and immigration services cis seeking a determination that she is a citizen.on july,the cis denied moreno application after concluding that moreno had not met the requirements of sections or of the immigration and naturalization act ina the cis noted that these sections refer to derivative citizenship after birth.the cis explicitly did not consider section of the ina,codified as,because it noted that adoption does not establish the blood relationship required by section for obtaining citizenship at birth.
on march,the department of homeland security dhs served moreno with a notice to appear nta alleging that she was an alien subject to removal based on each of her two prior convictions.specifically,the dhs alleged that moreno drug trafficking conviction was an aggravated felony as defined in a b making moreno subject to removal under a a iii and that it was also a controlled substance offense,making moreno subject to removal under a b i in the nta,the dhs further alleged that moreno conviction of false imprisonment in new mexico was a crime of violence and thus an aggravated felony under a f making moreno subject to removal under a a iii.
at her dallas,texas removal hearing,moreno claimed that she is a citizen under g,section g of the ina,by virtue of her adoption by a citizen,manuel,and,therefore,that she is not subject to removal.in the alternative,moreno argued that she is eligible for,and she requested,discretionary relief under ina former section c for her conviction.she further argued that she was not removable based only on her conviction because it was not a crime of violence and,therefore,not an aggravated felony.
on november,the immigration judge ij rejected moreno argument for citizenship,agreeing with the cis decision that nothing in g ina section g would have conferred citizenship on moreno.the ij also noted that ina section was applicable to moreno at the time of her adoption but that it required the filing of a petition by manuel prior to moreno eighteenth birthday and no such petition was ever filed.
after determining that under the undisputed facts moreno was an alien,the ij reviewed other evidence,including that related to her prior convictions,and then stated 
the question of whether or not the respondent should be granted the c waiver as a matter of discretion will be addressed first,without regard to the respondent eligibility and whether or not the felony conviction in the united states district court and the sic conviction in new mexico are aggravated felonies.
there follows a lengthy discussion of the evidence and matters pertaining to the exercise of section c discretion,which the ij concludes by stating,in the exercise of discretion,the court holds that the respondent is not entitled to a waiver of any grounds of inadmissibility.in the next section of his opinion,the ij addresses whether moreno conviction of false imprisonment contrary to new mexico statutes ann was for an aggravated felony,and,citing,inter alia,united states zamora,cir,concludes that because it was a crime of violence under,it was hence an aggravated felony.the ij opinion concludes with his formal findings,namely that moreno is an alien,not a citizen that she has been convicted of two crimes,both of which are aggravated felonies.the first was a drug trafficking crime and the second was a crime of violence that she has served more than five years imprisonment for the first felony and more than one year of imprisonment for the second felony that respondent does not warrant a grant of relief as a matter of discretion under section c and that respondent is subject to removal as charged.the opinion concludes by ordering that all relief from removal sought herein is denied and that moreno be removed to mexico for the reasons indicated in her form the nta.
on april,the bia affirmed the decision of the ij.the bia essentially agreed with the ij analysis of moreno claim for citizenship,stating 
the respondent maintains that she became a united states citizen pursuant to section g of the act in when,at the age of,she was adopted by her united states citizen father.we disagree.section g of the act relates to individuals who acquire united states citizenship at birth it does not provide for the acquisition of citizenship after birth,by adoption or any other means the respondent concedes that her biological parents were unmarried mexican citizens at the time of her birth in mexico in september,and the administrative record does not reflect that the respondent birth mother was married to the respondent adoptive father at the time of her birth because all required statutory conditions for citizenship were not met at the time of the respondent birth in,the respondent is not a united states citizen by operation of section g of the act or former section a the statutory predecessor to section g that was in effect in.
the bia then turned to the issue of deportability and affirmed the ij finding that moreno was deportable by reason of each of her prior convictions 
the bia next addressed former section c.it began by stating t he immigration judge determined that the respondent did not merit section c relief in the exercise of discretion,and given the very serious adverse discretionary considerations present in this case we find no basis for reversing that determination on appeal.it then went on to state alternatively,however,we also hold that respondent is not statutorily eligible for section c relief for two reasons.emphasis added 
at the end of its next,and concluding,paragraph,the bia states the respondent is neither statutorily eligible for section c relief nor deserving of such relief in the exercise of discretion.
on may,moreno timely filed with this court her petition for review of the bia decision 
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have limited jurisdiction under to review a final order of removal.we can review moreno claim to be a national of the united states,and decide such claim if,as here,the pleadings and affidavits reflect that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented.b.section a subparagraph b precludes our jurisdiction to review the there referenced denials of discretionary relief,and section a subparagraph c precludes our jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a a iii,b,c,or d of this title,but under section a subparagraph d,the jurisdictional restrictions of subparagraphs b and c and other jurisdictional restrictions contained in chapter of title other than section do not preclude our review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.a b,c and d.see also,ziglar,cir.we do,of course,also have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.reno,cir.
moreno nationality claim is a question of law that we review de novo.alwan ashcroft,cir.as moreno was concededly born outside of the united states and its outlying possessions,the following from our recent opinion in gonzales,cir,is applicable 
as petitioner was not born in the united states,naturalization is his sole source for a claim of citizenship.naturalization is available only as provided by acts of congress and,even then,only in strict compliance with the terms of such acts.petitioner has the burden of proving that he qualifies for naturalization,and he must do so in the face of the supreme court mandate that we resolve all doubts in favor of the united states and against those seeking citizenship.internal quotations and footnotes omitted 
ii.nationality claim 
moreno argues that she is a citizen under section g of the ina,g,by virtue of her adoption by manuel,a citizen.at moreno birth in september what is now section g was codified as a and provided in relevant part as follows 
a the following shall be nationals and citizens of the united states at birth 
paragraphs through 
a person born outside the geographical limits of the united states and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien,and the other a citizen of the united states who,prior to the birth of such person,was physically present in the united states or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than ten years,at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years provided stating other ways citizen parent physical presence requirement could be satisfied in relation to certain governmental service this proviso shall be applicable to persons born on or after december,to the same extent as if it had become effective in its present form on that date.
at the time of moreno adoption in,section a had been amended,october,stat.by eliminating the a just before the following and redesignating each of the paragraphs formerly designated through as a through g,so that section began 
nationals and citizens of united states at birth 
the following shall be nationals and citizens of the united states at birth 
and continued with the same seven paragraphs which were formerly designated as through see note supra and were now designated as a through g,respectively,but without any other change in the text of any of such paragraphs.thus,what was formerly section a became section g 
moreno concedes that she was born outside the geographical limits of the united states and its outlying possessions,that neither of her biological parents was a citizen at the time of her birth,and that citizen manuel,who adopted her in,was not married to her mother when she was born in.nonetheless,she argues that she became of a citizen parent when manuel adopted her in.moreno places great emphasis on congress use of the preposition of in section g rather than the preposition to,which congress used elsewhere in the ina,for example section b moreno argues that congress use of the preposition of means that the word born is modified only by where and not by to whom,such that congress did not intend to require a blood relationship between the child and the citizen and that congress also created no requirement that the child relationship with the citizen date from the child birth.
our plain reading of section,however,convinces us that moreno argument is without merit.section does not address citizenship through adoption,and its text explicitly addresses only citizenship at birth t he following shall be nationals and citizens of the united states at birth.moreover,section g requires that the person be born of a citizen parent,obviously reflecting a relationship when born.that reading is likewise enhanced by section g express requirement that the citizen parent united states residency prerequisites be all fulfilled prior to the birth of such person,a requirement that would be pointless if the citizen parent could first become the parent of such person more than a decade after the person birth.
we also note that section is titled nationals and citizens of united states at birth and is found in part i of subchapter iii of the ina,which is titled nationality at birth and collective naturalization.on the other hand,with part ii,titled nationality through naturalization,congress established the means by which children adopted by a citizen could obtain citizenship,namely section of the ina,codified as under moreno reading of section g,the requirement to petition for naturalization under section would only apply in cases where the citizen parent did not meet the residency requirements of section g.moreno provides no authority for this novel reading of the interaction between these two sections,and we find her argument unpersuasive.
moreno relies on two opinions from the ninth circuit that have rejected the government interpretation that section g requires a blood relationship between the citizen parent and the child born outside the united states.in scales,cir,the petitioner biological mother was an alien who was married to a citizen at the time of and prior to petitioner birth.the citizen was not the petitioner biological father,but,because he was married to petitioner mother at the time of petitioner birth,the court found that petitioner had acquired citizenship at birth under section g.id.at.in scales,the government relied on the state department foreign affairs manual,which provided that,a bsent a blood relationship between the child and the parent on whose citizenship the child own claim is based,citizenship is not acquired.id.at.in rejecting the government interpretation of section g,the court noted that congress had explicitly required a blood relationship in section of the ina,which addressed children born out of wedlock,and that no similar requirement existed under section g for a child born in wedlock.id.at 
in gonzales,cir,the court addressed a similar situation as in scales,except that the biological father was an alien and his wife was a citizen.the biological mother was also an alien but at birth she virtually immediately abandoned the child to the biological father and his wife.the citizen was listed as the child mother on his birth certificate,although she conceded that she is not his biological mother.id.at.the ninth circuit decided that,under california law,because the petitioner in had been acknowledged by the father and accepted into the family by the father citizen wife,who was married to the father when the petitioner was born,the petitioner was for all purposes legitimate from the time of his birth.id.at internal quotations omitted.the court concluded,therefore,that the petitioner was not born out of wedlock,and,following its holding in scales that section g does not require a blood relationship for a child born in wedlock,the court determined that the petitioner was a citizen under section g.id 
we do not need to decide whether we agree with the ninth circuit interpretation that section g imposes no requirement of a blood relationship to the citizen parent for children born in wedlock because,assuming arguendo that we adopt that interpretation,moreno claim to citizenship under section g still fails.although the court in scales and found that neither child was born out of wedlock,and therefore did not require a blood relationship with the citizen parent,it did not ignore the explicit requirement that the circumstances described by section g be met at birth in both scales and,the court analyzed the circumstances existing at the petitioner birth,and found in each case that one of the petitioner biological parents was married to a citizen at the time of the petitioner birth in moreno case,however,there is no dispute that she was born in september out of wedlock to two alien parents and that her alien mother and citizen manuel were not married to each other until june and that manuel did not even know moreno or her mother before 
moreno further argues that manuel must be regarded as her biological the relationship between them hence necessarily subsisting since her that is the law of new mexico and is hence entitled to full faith and credit under article iv,of the constitution and.we reject this contention.by such reasoning,moreno would be a citizen under section g when born in even if manuel had never known moreno before,and had never married or even known her mother,merely because he adopted moreno in december.for the reasons previously stated,giving such a retroactive effect to the adoption is obviously contrary to section g which,without any mention of adoption,confers citizenship at birth to those born abroad of an alien and a citizen parent who prior to the birth of such person had been physically present in the united states for specified periods.congress has the power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization,cl,and we have long recognized that congress has a completely free hand in defining citizenship as it relates to persons born abroad.ins,cir.see,fierro reno,cir state law change in custody though validly retroactive under state law not given retroactive effect for purpose of former a 
moreno interpretation of section g is not correct,and her claim for citizenship at birth or at adoption under section g fails.furthermore,moreno has not shown,nor does she argue,that she meets the requirements to become a naturalized citizen under part ii of subchapter iii of the ina.therefore,under b,we find that moreno has presented no genuine issue of material fact about her nationality,and we hold that she is an alien subject to removal under the ina.
iii.discretionary relief under section c 
moreno does not dispute that,if she is an alien,she is removable by virtue of her conviction for a drug trafficking offense.her only claim is that she is eligible for,and was wrongfully denied,section c relief available to her under cyr.see note supra.
both the ij and the bia,in the exercise of discretion,denied section c relief expressly on the basis that moreno did not merit the favorable exercise of discretionary relief thereunder.
as amended by the real id act,section a subparagraph c precludes our jurisdiction over an order of removal against an alien removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a a iii,b,c,or d,but subparagraph d of section a provides that n othing in subparagraph b or c will preclude review of constitutional claims or questions of law.because moreno drug trafficking conviction is an offense covered in a b,and likewise because it is an offense covered by section a a iii section a c deprives us of jurisdiction to review moreno claim that the ij and bia erred in determining that in the exercise of discretion moreno did not merit section c relief,unless her challenge to that determination presents a constitutional claim or a question of law for purposes of section a d.while a challenge to a determination that an alien is statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief does present a question of law,a challenge to a determination that in the exercise of discretion favorable relief under section c is not merited does not present a question of law or a constitutional claim,and hence such a challenge does not fall within section a d.we squarely so held in gonzales,cir.may,slip,wl where we said 
the real id act amended the ina to limit appellate jurisdiction over petitions for review in cases such as this,where petitioner is an aggravated felon,to solely constitutional claims or questions of law.a d although phrases his argument in legal terms,he uses those terms to cloak a request for review of the bia discretionary decision,which is not a question of law we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction petition in so far as it challenges the bia denial of section c discretionary relief from removal.
see also,cyr.at,d traditionally,courts recognized a distinction between eligibility for discretionary relief,on the one hand,and the favorable exercise of discretion,on the other hadwani gonzales,cir denial of discretionary relief of adjustment of status under does not present a constitutional claim or a question of law bravo ashcroft,cir discretionary denial of cancellation of removal under b,the successor to section c,see cyr.at,d,presents no legal or constitutional issue gonzales,cir denial of b discretionary relief based on conclusion that prior conviction,which did not per se render alien ineligible for such relief,demonstrated that he lacked the good moral character required for such relief was a discretionary decision.
accordingly,because the ij and the bia in the exercise of discretion denied moreno section c relief on the basis that moreno did not merit the favorable exercise of discretionary relief thereunder,we have no jurisdiction to review moreno complaints respecting the denial of section c relief 
conclusion 
under a c,we are barred from reviewing the decision to deny moreno section c relief in the exercise of discretion,and moreno has raised no constitutional claim or question of law under a d that would allow us to set aside that discretionary denial of section c relief.finally,because moreno is an alien who is removable for her drug trafficking conviction under a a iii and b i,we are barred from reviewing her removal order by a c.moreno petition for review is 
in early moreno took her two children whose father is soto,then approximately five and ten years old,to live with her mother and manuel,who subsequently adopted them.
adam montoya was convicted of murdering lowrey as well as of kidnapping,false imprisonment and conspiracy,but on appeal his murder conviction was reversed due to an erroneous jury instruction and the case was remanded for a new trial on the murder charge the convictions on the other offenses being affirmed.see state montoya.see also state toney.before the ij,moreno testified that she did not commit the offense of false imprisonment and stated that she plead the fifth at my new mexico trial but that others testified against her there.
although section of the ina was amended by the child citizenship act of cca,the cis did not consider the amendments because moreno eighteenth birthday occurred prior to the enactment of the cca.see nehme,cir noting that the cca amended automatic naturalization provisions only apply to alien children who satisfy the statute conditions on or after february,including the condition that the child be under eighteen years of age.similarly,although the cca also repealed section of the ina,the cis nonetheless reviewed moreno application for eligibility under section formerly codified at see fierro reno,cir.under both sections,however,the cis correctly determined that moreno is not eligible for derivative citizenship because her mother did not become a citizen until after moreno eighteenth birthday.moreno does not contend otherwise.
section a b defines the following conduct as an aggravated felony illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b.under c,the term drug trafficking crime includes any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et.c.moreno conviction was for a felony punishable under the controlled substances act.
section a a iii provides,any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.
section a b i provides,any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,is deportable.a b i.
under section a f,the following is considered an aggravated felony a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.section of title defines a crime of violence as a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
at the time of moreno guilty plea,c of the ina,codified as c,provided aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general without regard to the provisions of subsection a of this section other than paragraphs and c.nothing contained in this subsection shall limit the authority of the attorney general to exercise the discretion vested in him under section b of this title.the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years.c repealed.although c was repealed in iirira,b,stat,it was in effect when moreno pleaded guilty in.the supreme court has held that c relief remains available for aliens,like respondent,whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.cyr,d.moreover,although the terms of c would appear to apply only to the admission of returning aliens,it was interpreted by the bia and the courts to allow certain removable aliens to apply for a discretionary waiver.id.at.
with respect to her prior drug conviction,the bia noted that respondent does not dispute that it would render her deportable as charged if she were an alien.as to the false imprisonment conviction,the bia agreed with the ij that it was an aggravated felony under a f because the sentence was for three years confinement and the offense was a crime of violence under b,citing zamora and stating,on analogy to the discussion of why burglary is a b offense in leocal ashcroft,d,that an individual who undertakes to confine or restrain another unlawfully and without consent necessarily disregards the substantial risk that in the course of committing that offense he will intentionally use physical force against another,either to effect the victim restraint or confinement in the first instance or to overcome the victim resistance or both.
the two reasons were first,that there is no ground of inadmissibility under a a substantially equivalent to the false imprisonment conviction and,second that c relief remains available only as to aliens as whom the amendment or repeal of c was impermissibly retroactive,and it was not so as to respondent because her false imprisonment conviction was in.
on april,moreno filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of texas,dallas division,challenging her removal order sometime after may,and before any merits action was taken in that case,the district court entered its order transferring the case to this court where it was converted to a petition for review of the bia april,order and merged into the same cause in this court as that arising from moreno petition for review filed may,pursuant to of the real id act of may,stat.see,ziglar,cir congress provided that a habeas petition pending before a district court as of the real id act effective date was to be transferred to the appropriate court of appeals and converted into a petition for review.
in alwan we held that,because our jurisdiction was predicated on b a and c and we were directed to decide the issue,we hence did not give deference,under chevron natural resources defense council,d,to the bia legal conclusions respecting the meaning of a national of the united states under a.see alwan,at.in nehme ins,cir,we held chevron deference was not due the bia interpretation of citizenship under because our jurisdiction turned on that question.however,in,at,we stated that nehme was not controlling on the chevron issue because our jurisdiction no longer turned simply on b but was also supplied by a d,enacted and as part of the real id act.this same reasoning would appear to also apply to alwan holding as to chevron deference.in we declined to ultimately resolve the chevron deference issue because we would affirm the bia interpretation with or without chevron deference.at.the same is true here respecting the citizenship issue.
the entirety of a as in effect in september was as follows.nationals and citizens of united states at birth.a the following shall be nationals and citizens of the united states at birth a person born in the united states,and subject to the jurisdiction thereof a person born in the united states to a member of an indian,eskimo,aleutian,or other aboriginal tribe.provided,that the granting of citizenship under this subsection shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of such person to tribal or other property a person born outside of the united states and its outlying possessions of parents both of whom are citizens of the united states and one of whom has had a residence in the united states or one of its outlying possessions,prior to the birth of such person a person born outside of the united states and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is a citizen of the united states who has been physically present in the united states or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year prior to the birth of such person,and the other of whom is a national,but not a citizen of the united states a person born in an outlying possession of the united states of parents one of whom is a citizen of the united states who has been physically present in the united states or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year at any time prior to the birth of such person a person of unknown parentage found in the united states while under the age of five years,until shown,prior to his attaining the age
