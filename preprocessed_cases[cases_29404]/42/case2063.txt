the petitioner,lancine kaba,seeks review of the denial by an immigration judge and by the board of immigration appeals bia of his requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief pursuant to the united nations convention against torture.before this court,kaba contends that the immigration judge erred in finding him not credible,in concluding that he had not suffered past persecution in his native cote formerly known as the ivory coast,and in refusing to recognize his fear of future persecution there.because we conclude that the evidence in the administrative record does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the immigration judge,we hold that the petitioner has failed to establish his eligibility for the relief he seeks.we therefore affirm the administrative decision and deny the petition for review in this matter.
factual and procedural background 
petitioner kaba,a native and citizen of cote,entered the united states on july,on a valid student visa with the intent to pursue studies at michigan technological university.when kaba ceased attending college in december,however,the immigration and naturalization service,now the department of homeland security,determined that the petitioner was subject to removal and ordered him to appear before an immigration judge to show cause why he should not be removed from the united states.at that proceeding,kaba conceded removability but indicated his desire to apply for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture.
however,kaba first application,filed with the administrative agency in,did not list any specific instances of past persecution or torture.instead,he claimed merely that m y family is from the north of ivory coast and is muslim and belongs to the dioula ethnic group.as a result,my family has been threatened by the government and forces loyal to the government.the record shows,however,that despite the fact that his ethnicity could be traced to northern cote,kaba and his family were actually residents of the country largest city,abidjan,located on the southern coast.it was there that kaba was born,reared,and attended school from.
kaba filed an amended application in,in which he claimed without explanation that he would be tortured should he return to cote and also asserted 
my family has been completely uprooted by the political,ethnic and religious violence in ivory coast.my family was forced to flee their home in abidjan and i have not heard from them for many months.i believe that they are in a area of the country but i do not know where or in what conditions they are living.
this contention appears to have been based on the failed coup in cote in september that effectively split the country in two,with forces holding the southern half of the kaba family rebel forces holding the northern section.according to the state department country report,which was introduced into the administrative record,a period of political instability took root as a result of turmoil caused by the uprising,which led to various kinds of human rights abuses in both parts of the country,including but not limited to arbitrary and unlawful killings by security forces,progoverment militias,and student groups torture and inhumane punishment by those same groups illegal arrests and lack of public trial deplorable prison and detention center conditions police harassment of africans restrictions on speech and assembly trafficking and forced labor and violence against women.conditions in the north were reported to be worse than those in the south.
but nowhere in the long list of human rights abuses is there any indication that discrimination on the basis of religion was widespread.the country report suggests that immediately after the rebellion,the government targeted persons perceived to be perpetrators or supporters of the rebellion,who often were muslim but notes that s trong efforts by religious and civil society groups have helped prevent the crisis from becoming a religious conflict and that the targeting of muslims suspected of rebel ties diminished somewhat during.the only form of outright discrimination reflected in the report concerned northern muslims who shared names,style of dress,and customs with several of cote predominantly muslim neighboring countries and who were sometimes accused wrongly of attempting to obtain nationality cards to vote or otherwise take advantage of citizenship,thereby creat ing a hardship for a disproportionate number of muslim citizens.again,there is no indication that ivorian muslims were persecuted because of their religion rather than because of political activity,or that they suffered religious persecution rather than hardship of the kind described in the country report.
eventually,a hearing was held before an immigration judge,at which both the petitioner and his brother,ousseinou kaba,testified.petitioner lancine kaba testified that he was then years of age and was one of six children born to an ivorian mother and to a father who was himself born in neighboring guinea.he further explained that his family was muslim and from the dioula ethnic group,thus purportedly inviting derision and harassment from what he described as the overwhelmingly christian and population in the southern part of the country where the kabas resided.
the petitioner further testified that his father held a computer engineering consulting position with the african development bank in the capital city of abidjan.still,according to kaba,his family was subjected to numerous indignities because they were muslim,dioula,and descended from a father.for example,the petitioner claimed that his oldest sister was routinely ridiculed by others for wearing a indicative of her adherence to islam.he explained that he himself had his government identification card confiscated in because of his name,although he was later issued a new,permanent identification document.likewise,the petitioner said,he was initially thwarted in his attempts to obtain a passport because his father was not a native ivorian.eventually,however,that document too was issued to the petitioner.finally,kaba recounted difficulties he experienced in attempting to retrieve from the abidjan post office certain documents sent to him in connection with his application to michigan tech.according to the petitioner testimony,such difficulties arose simply because of the postal clerk recognition of the muslim origin of his name and her resulting demand that he produce national identification that he did not possess.that matter was resolved only after kaba father agreed to pay the clerk to release the petitioner mail.
significantly,the petitioner referred to this collection of problems as harassments.in his own words,he admitted 
but it was to a point where it was persecution yet.it was something i could deal with,you know,i was leaving the country for school,so it was for,to me something really big.plus,it was every,everywhere,so i did,did feel the need to.plus i was coming to school here.
kaba also testified about a confiscation by the police of his father automobile,allegedly because his father was not a native ivorian.again,however,no lasting harm resulted from that interaction with government representatives given the fact that the vehicle was returned to its owner less than one week later in exactly the same condition in which it had been when taken.
finally,the petitioner recounted what he had learned about an incident that occurred on july,in abidjan in which his brother ousseinou was purportedly detained by government police simply because his identification card revealed his muslim name.according to consistent testimony offered by both the petitioner and his brother,the police jailed ousseinou overnight,placed him in a cell with other young muslim men,and beat and kicked him.ousseinou also claimed that the beating resulted in him suffering two cracked teeth and sustaining a wound over his eye.moreover,ousseinou testified that when he was released from custody the following morning,he saw his father at the police station and noticed that the father had also been incarcerated and beaten by the police after arriving at the police station to free his son.ousseinou kaba also mentioned in his testimony that he had been detained by police on two occasions prior to the july,incident.in both of the prior arrests,however,the authorities merely checked ousseinou identification documents and then released him unharmed after approximately minutes.
after the petitioner rested his case before the immigration judge,the government recalled the petitioner to the stand.during the questioning that followed,the attorney highlighted ousseinou testimony that the petitioner had maintained consistent contact with his family and that the family had remained in abidjan despite some harassment by.in light of that testimony,the petitioner was asked to explain his assertion in the amended asylum application that his family was forced to flee their home in abidjan and that he had not heard from them for many months.in attempting to do so,the petitioner engaged in the following exchange with the government lawyer 
well,what happened is that when the situation went back in there,i stopped having contact from my dad.there was a time when there was a hurricane,somewhere in miami or whatever,in florida,and at the african development bank,all the indiscernible system and everything is outside of the country.it indiscernible.so,i was in touch with my dad or anybody for awhile,for at least a month or two months.it was around that period.
q from the immigration judge.for how many months 
a.a month or two.so,at that time,i did have any contact with anybody,the phone lines were down because they are always down once there is a rebel attack or anything.so,i was in touch with them for awhile,and i honestly thought that they left the country or they run sic away.
q from the government lawyer.and what time was this what time period what month 
well,i really do remember.i really do remember.
q.you stated that you believed that they were living in a area of the country.why would you have that belief,sir 
because,initially,i would have thought that would be the first place they will head if they had to leave abidjan.there is no other way to go.if we are pushed by christian sic,we will have to go to the rebel north.
okay,so you have no information 
i had no information.i assumed they were on their way.
that they had actually fled 
i did have any,i just could get in touch with them.
at the conclusion of the petitioner testimony and the closing arguments of counsel,the immigration judge delivered her oral decision in the matter.that decision summarized the testimony and documentary evidence introduced before the court,discussed the relevant case law,statutes,and regulations,and ultimately concluded that kaba was not entitled to the relief he sought.specifically,the immigration judge noted her concerns regarding kaba credibility,particularly as it relates to omissions in his written application when compared to his and his brother testimony.she then highlighted the general and vague nature of the petitioner complaints and the failure of the applications to make reference to any specific incidents of mistreatment or harassment that he or his family incurred.the immigration judge next pointed to the fact that ousseinou kaba had testified that he had been arrested three times by the police even though lancine kaba mentioned only one such arrest in his own testimony and used that fact,as well as the fact that ousseinou did not mention an injury to the bridge of his nose when describing the beating he received in jail,to find the brother testimony incredible.discussing the petitioner mistaken assumption that his family had fled their abidjan home,the immigration judge also found lancine kaba not credible and unable to sustain his burdens of proof and persuasion necessary to establish eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal under the act,or withholding under the torture convention.
alternatively,the immigration judge determined that,even if the petitioner were found to be credible,no relief was justified because lancine kaba suffered only a few isolated incidents of harassment and not past persecution in cote.furthermore,the court found that the administrative record did not clearly establish a nexus on which this court could find that any of the harm that kaba underwent,or his family underwent,was due to a protected ground.finally,because the immigration judge considered the petitioner family to be part of what the country report described as cote islamic urban elite,because the report also indicated increased interfaith understanding in the country,and because any potential harm to the petitioner could be attributed to general violence in the country rather than to specific government oppression,she ruled that the petitioner could not establish a fear of future persecution or torture should he be removed to his native land.
the bia summarily dismissed kaba appeal,agreeing with the immigration judge that the petitioner failed to establish through credible testimony that he had suffered past persecution in his homeland.alternatively,the bia noted that,even if kaba testimony were to be found generally credible,he did not establish eligibility for relief.
discussion 
standard of review 
when,as in this case,the bia summarily affirms a portion of the decision of an immigration judge without an discussion of the relevant issues,we review the immigration judge decision as the final agency decision.denko ins,cir.that administrative ruling must be sustained if the determination is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d.under this deferential standard,we may not reverse the board or the immigration judge determination simply because we would have decided the matter differently.koliada ins,cir citing mikhailevitch ins,cir.rather,to overturn such a factual determination,we must find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it,at.
request for asylum 
before the immigration judge and the bia,kaba requested that he be granted asylum in the united states.as we have explained,r esolution of any request for asylum involves a inquiry first,whether the petitioner is a refugee within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act,and second,whether the petitioner merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the attorney general.chen gonzales,cir quoting perkovic ins,cir.see also ins,d b.
section a a of title of the united states code defines the term refugee to 
a ny person who is outside any country of such person nationality or,in the case of a person having no nationality,is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided,and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
an applicant who has been found to have established past persecution shall also be presumed to have a fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim,b,unless the immigration judge finds,by a preponderance of the evidence,either that 
a there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion or 
b the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant country of nationality and under all the circumstances,it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.
kaba is unable in this case to invoke the presumption of a fear of future persecution that arises,pursuant to b,from the establishment of past persecution.even though applicable statutes do not define the term persecution,we have determined that persecution within the meaning of a a requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,unaccompanied by any physical punishment,infliction of harm,or significant deprivation of liberty.mikhailevitch,at.here,kaba co
