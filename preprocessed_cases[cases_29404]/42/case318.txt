nicholas hanna dawoud dawoud,a native and citizen of lebanon,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia.the the conclusion of languid proceedings notable for dawoud dilatory pursuit of his dawoud any relief on his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel,and his request for a remand for an adjustment of status based on his marriage to a citizen.although dawoud case has not been free from irregularity,after careful consideration,we deny the petition.
dawoud entered this country on april,as a admitted for business purposes,and was entitled to remain in the united states no later than june.dawoud chose to remain past this date,and in due course,on january,the department of homeland security dhs served him with a notice to appear.on april,dawoud,appearing pro se,successfully sought a continuance of removal proceedings pending against him.
on june,dawoud married clotilde sousa,a citizen.on june,pursuant to section e of the immigration and nationality act,e,sousa filed a petition for alien relative petition on behalf of dawoud.at dawoud next hearing on november,again appearing pro se,dawoud explained that he had recently married a citizen and requested a further continuance of all removal proceedings while his petition was pending.because he had serious concerns as to the legitimacy and bona fides of the respondent marriage,the immigration judge ij instructed dawoud to produce documentation in support of his wife petition and continued all proceedings until march,to provide dawoud the opportunity to produce the relevant documents,but warned that no further continuances would be forthcoming 
in light of this turn of events,dawoud retained the services of an attorney,joseph grimaldi,who agreed to represent dawoud in his removal proceedings in exchange for two thousand dollars.dawoud asserts that,at his first meeting with grimaldi,dawoud explained that the immigration judge requested documentation supporting his petition,and grimaldi led dawoud to believe that he would gather the necessary documentation.
at the march hearing,however,despite appearing to represent dawoud,grimaldi did not bring the requested documentation.instead,grimaldi moved for a continuance pending approval of the petition,or in the alternative,voluntary departure to lebanon.the ij declined to continue the proceedings for any further length of time and ordered dawoud removed to lebanon.dawoud,still acting through grimaldi,filed a motion to reconsider and an emergency motion for a stay of removal on may,the requested emergency stay of removal was granted on may,but on november,the ij denied the motion to reconsider because,inter alia,dawoud failed to provide the documentation the ij had previously requested,the motion failed to raise any error of law or fact in the court prior decision,and the motion was.b.the ij then vacated the stay and ordered dawoud removed to lebanon.on september,dhs approved the petition sousa filed on behalf of her husband,dawoud.
in a later filed affidavit,dawoud claimed that,after the motion to reconsider was denied,his attorney strongly discouraged him from filing an appeal of the ij march decision,and failed to inform him of his ability to file a motion to reopen or another motion to reconsider based on ineffective assistance of counsel.on august,almost a year after the petition was approved,with the aid of his present counsel dawoud filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.although dawoud motion to reopen included documents to support the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel,the motion did not explain why he waited to file his motion to reopen until nearly eleven months after the approval of his petition and over two years from the date of the ij initial decision to deny him further continuances 
the ij denied dawoud motion to reopen,after noting that the motion was time barred and did not fall within any exceptions to the period for filing such motions the ij also considered the potential applicability of the doctrine of equitable tolling in doing so,the ij observed that dawoud was not informed about time limitations for filing a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel,and that dhs would not be significantly prejudiced if the motion to reopen were allowed.nevertheless,the ij concluded that even if equitable tolling were available in this circuit,dawoud delay of more than two years after an order of removal was entered against him,and nearly a year after dhs approved his petition,was not consistent with the diligent pursuit of one rights required for equitable tolling to apply.
dawoud appealed the ij decision to the bia,adding,in addition to his motion to reopen,a motion to remand based on the alleged new evidence of his approved petition.he also attached a form application to adjust his status based on the previously approved petition.the bia did not discuss,or provide any indication that it considered,its policy concerning motions to reopen for the purpose of permitting uscis to adjudicate adjustment of status applications but it nevertheless affirmed the ij denial of dawoud motion to reopen on timeliness grounds.the bia further upheld the ij denial of equitable tolling because of dawoud lack of diligence in pursuing a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.the bia therefore did not consider the merits of dawoud ineffective assistance of counsel claim.in addition,the bia denied dawoud motion to remand for consideration of his adjustment of status application because dawoud failed to offer any evidence that was not available and could not have been presented to the ij during the march,hearing.the bia further noted that granting dawoud motion for a remand would undermine the immigration judge decision denying dawoud request for a continuance,and would reward dawoud for his delay in filing evidence previously requested by the immigration judge.thus,the bia concluded that granting a motion to remand would be unjust and therefore denied dawoud all relief.this appeal timely followed.
the bia denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.tandayu mukasey,cir chen gonzales,cir.the bia decision will be upheld unless the complaining party can show that the bia committed an error of law or exercised its judgment in an arbitrary,capricious,or irrational way.tandayu,at quoting raza gonzales,cir see also chen,at an abuse of discretion exists where the bia misinterprets the law,or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.quoting toban ashcroft,cir.
subject to exceptions not relevant in this case,motions to reopen removal proceedings are limited in two ways aliens are limited to one such motion,and it must be filed within ninety days of the issuance of the final decision.b see also fustaguio do nascimento,at.it is undisputed that dawoud filed his motion to reopen more than ninety days after the ij march,decision became final.to avoid the inevitable finding that his motion to reopen was not timely,dawoud argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the period for filing a motion to reopen due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
equitable tolling is a sparingly invoked doctrine,irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d,used to excuse a party failure to take an action in a timely manner,where such failure was caused by circumstances that are out of his hands,salois dime sav.bank,cir.we have not definitively decided whether the bia has either the authority or the obligation to apply equitable tolling in the immigration context.fustaguio do nascimento,at quoting gonzales,cir.it is nevertheless clear that even were equitable tolling available in such cases,we would require that one claiming equitable tolling show lack of actual notice of a time limit lack of constructive notice of a time limit diligence in the pursuit of one rights an absence of prejudice to a party opponent and the claimant reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the time limit.jobe ins,cir en banc see also chen,at.
