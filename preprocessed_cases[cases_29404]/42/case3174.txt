jose maria carlos de leon zumel,a native and citizen of the philippines,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia ruling that he is inadmissible under.a b i i for having engaged in terrorist activity,and dismissing his appeal from the immigration judge ij order of removal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and hold that the bia did not err when it determined that an attempted coup against the philippine government was unlawful under philippine law,and that zumel engaged in the coup by planning it.but assuming that the question whether the coup participants lacked an intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of one or more individuals,a b iii v b,is a question of fact,the bia erred in failing to apply clear error review to the ij finding that the coup participants lacked such intent.see d i.we therefore grant the petition for review and remand to the bia.
this appeal relates to zumel activities during a period of political instability in the philippines from to.in,zumel was serving as a general in the philippine air force.in february of that year,ferdinand marcos held snap elections.despite allegations of election fraud,the philippine congress adopted a resolution declaring that marcos received the highest numbers of votes and proclaiming him president.however,a mass demonstration of support for marcos opponent,corazon aquino,ultimately led marcos to flee to the united states in exile and aquino to take power.
after aquino took power,zumel became a leader of an opposition group known as alyansang tapat sa sambayanan altas.altas was a faction of the military that believed marcos was the legitimate elected leader of the philippines.to demonstrate their continued support for marcos,altas members,including zumel,attended a ceremony for marcos running mate at the manila hotel on july.as a result of zumel attendance at the ceremony,the air force removed him from active duty and placed him on an assignment.
despite his removal from active duty,zumel remained active in altas.in january,altas staged a coup against the aquino government.zumel participated in planning the coup,including deciding which bases to target.in order to destabilize the aquino government and pave the way for marcos to return to power,altas decided to take over two air force bases,villamor air force base villamor afb and sangley air force base sangley afb,and a television station in manila.the altas forces took over villamor afb for about one hour,but succeeded in taking over sangley afb for two days.during that period,altas detained the sangley afb commander on the premises and prevented him from communicating with his troops.after two days,the philippine military forces supporting aquino suppressed the attempted takeover.
zumel was not involved in tactical decisions about how best to deploy the altas forces on the ground.rather,his role during the operation was to coordinate the actions of the opposition air force units and send reinforcements to assist the troops if necessary.while the attempted coup was underway,zumel monitored the radio from a safe house.he was unable to communicate with the altas leaders at sangley afb,however,because the battery on his radio died,and he never sent any reinforcements to villamor afb because the philippine military regained control too quickly.
after the january coup attempt failed,zumel went underground,and the aquino government issued warrants for his arrest.according to the government,the warrants charged zumel with violating the philippine articles of war,specifically article mutiny or sedition and article officers,separation from service.see an act for making further and more effectual provisions for the national defense by establishing a system of military justice for persons subject to military law,comm.act,comm,phil.while underground,zumel continued to take a leadership role in altas,and served as the point of contact for individuals wishing to join the movement.he also communicated with lieutenant colonel gregorio honasan,the leader of reform the armed forces movement,which also opposed aquino.
zumel,honasan,and other opposition groups began planning another attempt to unseat the aquino government.this effort the largest of the opposition initiatives took place in november,and involved the coordinated efforts of multiple organizations.according to the government,over opposition troops participated.in this coup attempt,the opposition attempted to take over villamor afb,sangley afb,and the aguinaldo headquarters of the armed forces of the philippines.the attempt was initially successful honasan troops took control of sangley afb,and used it to launch air attacks on the aguinaldo headquarters.zumel role during the operation was to coordinate reinforcement troops for sangley afb.from his position in a safe house,zumel monitored the radio communications between altas members and the philippine military,and sent reinforcement troops to sangley afb.these reinforcements were forced to turn back when the united states air force sent fighter planes to help the aquino regime gain control.although the opposition troops held on to sangley afb and the army headquarters for several days,and controlled villamor afb for a few hours,the coup was ultimately defeated with american assistance.according to zumel,the coup attempt resulted in approximately to casualties on both sides.after this second coup attempt,the aquino government charged zumel with an additional count of rebellion and sedition for his participation in the coup.
the aquino government and altas,represented by zumel as its chairman,began negotiating a peace agreement in,and reached an agreement on may.altas members agreed to surrender all equipment,firearms,ammunitions and explosives in their possession.in turn,the aquino government agreed that the altas members named on a list later provided by zumel shall be granted a general and unconditional amnesty for crimes committed in pursuit of political belief during the period february to april.zumel was one of the altas members who received amnesty.zumel certificate of amnesty stated 
this is to certify that jose ma.carlos zumel was granted amnesty for acts constituting rebellion coup committed during the period from february,to april,on june,pursuant to the provisions of proclamation,issued on march,by his excellency,president fidel ramos.
in september,zumel traveled to the united states on a visitor visa.he applied for lawful permanent residency through his daughter the next month.the application did not mention zumel involvement in altas,and it falsely stated that zumel had never been charged with violating any law in the united states or elsewhere,and had never been a beneficiary of amnesty.on april,the former immigration and naturalization service service granted zumel permanent residency status.
on november,after a short visit to the philippines,zumel arrived at los angeles international airport,where an immigration officer referred him to secondary inspection.the service subsequently served zumel with a notice to appear,charging zumel with being an arriving alien who was subject to removal under a b i i for engaging in terrorist activities zumel case was referred to an ij,and zumel filed a motion to terminate the proceedings on the ground that he had not engaged in terrorist activity.
before examining the ij and the bia rulings on zumel motion to terminate the proceedings,we first explain the statutory provisions that render aliens who have engaged in a terrorist activity ineligible to receive visas or to be admitted to the united states.see generally a b.
under a b i i,a ny alien who has engaged in a terrorist activity is inadmissible.the term engage in terrorist activity is defined to include committing or inciting to commit a terrorist activity under circumstances indicating an intention to cause death or serious bodily injury,preparing or planning a terrorist activity,and soliciting others to engage in terrorist activity,either in an individual capacity or as a member of an organization.id.a b iv.it also includes soliciting individuals for membership in a terrorist organization described in a b vi iii unless the solicitor can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the organization was a terrorist organization.id.a b iv v cc.
a terrorist organization is defined in a b vi iii to mean a group of two or more individuals,whether organized or not,which engages in,or has a subgroup which engages in terrorist activity.id.a b vi iii.
finally,terrorist activity is defined to mean any activity which is unlawful under the laws of the place where it is committed or which,if it had been committed in the united states,would be unlawful under the laws of the united states or any state.id.a b iii.terrorist activity must also involve one of six enumerated activities,including t he use of any explosive,firearm,or other weapon or dangerous device with intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property,or a threat,attempt,or conspiracy to do the foregoing.id we have held that an armed attack by dissidents on the military of a country,including attacking the military convoy,constitute terrorist activity under a b iii.khan holder,cir.
while these interlocking definitions cover a wide range of activities,we focus on the statutory language relevant to this appeal an alien is inadmissible if the alien planned an activity either individually or as a member of an organization,a b iv ii,that was unlawful under the laws of the place where it was committed,id.a b iii,and involved the use of explosives,firearms or other weapons or dangerous devices,id.a b iii v b,with the intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of individuals or cause substantial damage to property,id.
we now turn to the ij and the bia rulings.the ij held three evidentiary hearings and issued both an interim and final decision in this case.the ij first determined,as an issue of first impression,that the government had the burden of proving that zumel was inadmissible at the time he adjusted status,and therefore was never lawfully admitted for permanent residence,see a c,because he had engaged in terrorist activity 
next,the ij considered whether zumel had engaged in the coup attempt,and whether it was a terrorist activity within the meaning of the statute the ij found that zumel had engaged in the coup attempt by participating in its general planning.see a b i i,iv ii.she also found that the coup attempt was unlawful under the laws of the philippines,see id.a b iii,and that weapons were used during the coup attempt.she then addressed whether the coup attempt was undertaken with the requisite intent to endanger.see id.a b iii v b.in her preliminary ruling,she found that it was undisputed that there were some deaths as a result of the coup attempt,which raised the inference that the participants intended to endanger individuals.in her final ruling,the ij found zumel to be credible and therefore credited his testimony that there were altas officers stationed at villamor afb and sangley afb.the ij held that this raised the inference that altas intended to take over the bases using the leadership already in place,thereby avoiding bloodshed.based on zumel testimony,the ij also found that the altas troops detained the commander at sangley afb,but did not injure or threaten him.the ij stated that this fact raised the inference that the participants in the coup were promoting a peaceful surrender.finally,the ij found that the aquino government,not the opposition,destroyed fighter planes in the coup attempt.based on these findings and inferences,the ij concluded that the government had not met its burden of proving that the participants in the coup attempt intended to endanger individuals or cause substantial property damage,and therefore ruled that zumel was not inadmissible as an alien who engaged in terrorist activities.see id.a b i i.
the bia sustained the government appeal.in response to the argument that zumel efforts to return power to a duly elected president made him a political combatant,not a terrorist,the bia first stated it lacked jurisdiction to consider a group or individual motive for engaging in an activity that otherwise meets the definition of terrorist activity,citing in re s k,bia.the bia then concluded that zumel engaged in the coup attempt both by helping plan the attempt and by soliciting others to join altas and to participate in the coup attempt.in considering whether the coup attempt was a terrorist activity,the bia adopted the ij conclusions that the coup attempt was unlawful under philippine and the attempt involved the use of firearms or other weapons.turning to the intent of the coup participants,the bia reached a different conclusion than the ij.based on the record,the bia stated that the purpose of the members of altas and other participants in the attempted coup was to force the government from power.further,according to the bia,the means for obtaining that purpose included a range of activities,including using weapons to secure an air force base,and thus it was undisputed that the participants anticipated that forcible action of some kind would be taken against the government.based on these facts,the bia concluded that the participants in the coup attempt intended to,and did,use weapons to endanger individuals.in reaching this conclusion,the bia did not overturn the ij holding that zumel was credible,instead noting that zumel made significant concessions in his testimony that supported the bia conclusion.
in light of its conclusions that zumel engaged in the coup attempt and that the coup attempt constituted a terrorist activity,the bia determined that zumel was inadmissible at the time he adjusted status to that of lawful permanent resident,and was therefore an arriving alien who was inadmissible as charged.the bia ordered zumel removed to the philippines zumel timely petitioned for review.
where,as here,the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and law,rather than adopting the ij decision,our review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent the ij opinion is expressly adopted.see rodriguez holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we review agency factual findings and determinations of mixed questions of law and fact for substantial evidence,and legal questions de novo.khan,at.whether the bia applied the correct standard of review is a legal question.ridore holder,cir.we defer to the bia interpretation of ambiguous immigration statutes under skidmore swift,meaning that our deference is proportional to the interpretation thoroughness,reasoning,consistency,and ability to persuade.lezama garcia holder,cir quoting mejia hernandez holder,cir.
on appeal,zumel does not dispute that the altas members intended to overthrow the aquino government.nor does he dispute that the coup attempt involved the use of weapons.instead he claims that the bia erred in holding that he engaged in the coup attempt by planning it and soliciting others to participate in it,that the coup attempt was unlawful under the laws of the place where it was committed,and that it was undertaken with intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property,see a b iii v b 
we first consider zumel argument that,even if the coup attempt was a terrorist activity,the record does not support the bia determination that he engaged in that activity by planning it and soliciting others to participate in it.
we conclude that substantial evidence supports the bia determination that zumel planned the coup attempt.see id.a b iv ii.zumel testified that prior to the coup attempt,he met with honasan and they agreed to join forces to carry out a coup against the aquino government zumel then held meetings with the relevant commanding officers to coordinate the attempt.zumel also testified that he provided troops to support the takeover of sangley afb.such evidence supports the bia determination that zumel at a minimum helped in general planning of the coup attempt.in light of this evidence,we are not persuaded that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude that t
