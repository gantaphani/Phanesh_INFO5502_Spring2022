petitioner alla borovikova,a native of the former union of soviet socialist republics ussr or soviet union and a citizen of ukraine,petitions this court for review of a november,order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming a decision of immigration judge elizabeth lamb the ij denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal.case no.a february,new york.petitioner entered the united states on or about february,and was admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor.after overstaying her visa,she applied for asylum largely on the basis of claims that she had been persecuted in ukraine because she is a jew.the ij found petitioner story not credible and denied her requests.petitioner argues on appeal that the ij lacked substantial evidence to support the adverse credibility determination and asks us to hold that any reasonable factfinder would be compelled to grant petitioner applications for asylum and withholding of removal.see b b a dministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.she further argues that although she did not request relief under the united nations convention against torture cat,treaty doc,the ij and bia erred in not considering her qualification for such relief sua sponte.we disagree and,accordingly,the petition for review is denied.
background 
borovikova was born january,in russia.in her petition for asylum and withholding of removal,she alleges that she suffered persecution in multiple countries from the time of her childhood until she fled to the united states in.among other things,she reported the following to the ij that as a child she was taunted by neighbors,classmates,and teachers because she was a jew while in grade school,when she refused to join the komsomol,a communist youth its atheistic tenets violated her religion,she was taunted,assaulted,and beaten by classmates including an incident in which a classmate threw a stone at her,giving her a serious head wound with no response from authorities when she applied to nursing school in,she was refused admission because she was jewish her family then moved to kiev,ukraine in hope of escaping persecution but she was again denied admission to nursing school in,this time on the basis of openly announced motives after finally being admitted to nursing school in,she suffered additional harassment until her graduation in,including having her arm broken by a student in retaliation for her refusal to join the komsomol after a period of being denied nursing work,she married and found a nursing job at a hospital near her husband military post in taganrog,russia but could not practice her religion openly because of its potentially negative impact on her husband military career in,petitioner husband was transferred to east germany,where she was subject to harassment,humiliation,and government surveillance,and her husband suffered mistreatment and denial of promotion at work because of his wife religion in january petitioner and her family moved to kiev after her husband discharge from the military in march she was attacked at a store,during which two men threw her physically from the premises and she broke her foot in the shin in january uniformed hooligans burst into petitioner apartment,shouted slogans,and poured scalding soup on her,after which medical authorities refused to treat her in september,while petitioner was visiting her parents graves,a crowd of or people dressed in rukh uniforms desecrated the cemetery,shouted slogans at her,chased her,and beat her until she passed out,causing her to suffer a concussion and a fractured leg in november,nationalists threw a smoke bomb into petitioner apartment,set her front door on fire,and put a box of mercury under her front door,making petitioner and her daughter ill and she feared for her safety and decided to spend six months in the united states so that the nationalists would forget about her,but,after arriving in the united states in,learned that conditions had worsened and that she will be persecuted again should she return to ukraine.petitioner now lives in brooklyn,where she is a member of a jewish community center and a synagogue.
discussion 
relevant legal standards 
the standards for evaluating claims of asylum and requests of withholding of removal overlap considerably.because the standard for a successful withholding of removal claim is higher than for an asylum because we find in this case that petitioner asylum claim must be do not treat her withholding claim separately in detail.abankwah ins,cir 
the statute governing asylum immigration and nationality act of,as the executive discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee within the meaning of the statute.see b a eligibility id.a defining refugee an alien seeking asylum bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is a refugee with a fear of persecution.see id.b b matter of acosta,bia see also damko ins,cir according deference to the bia statutory interpretation in matter of acosta as mandated by chevron,natural resources defense council,d.
because asylum determinations require intensive factual inquiries that appellate courts are to conduct,our review of factual determinations by an ij is tightly circumscribed see b b stating that,on appeal,the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary zhou yun zhang ins,cir w e defer to the factual findings of the bia and the ij if they are supported by substantial evidence.in cases like this one,in which the ij bases her denial of asylum on a finding that a petitioner application is not credible,our review is especially limited and highly deferential.zhou yi ni doj,cir xu duan dong ashcroft,cir jin hui gao united states attorney,cir see also wu biao chen ins,cir holding that we afford particular deference to the credibility determinations of the ij quoting montero ins,cir zhou yun zhang,at where the ij adverse credibility finding is based on specific examples in the record of inconsistent statements by the asylum applicant about matters material to his claim of persecution,or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters,a reviewing court will generally not be able to conclude that a reasonable adjudicator was compelled to find otherwise.
an adverse credibility finding,however,may not be upheld if based entirely upon a misstatement of the facts or bald speculation or caprice.zhou yun zhang,at see also ins,cir indicating that ij reasons for an adverse credibility finding must be specific and cogent and must bear legitimate nexus to petitioner claim of persecution.in evaluating a disputed adverse credibility finding,our role does not extend to hypothesiz ing excuses for the inconsistencies in an asylum applicant testimony.zhou yun zhang,at see jin yu lin doj,cir.
ii.petitioner asylum claim 
the facts stated by petitioner present a colorable asylum claim inasmuch as they allege a pattern of persecution on the basis of religion,which is a protected ground.see a.the ij denied petitioner claim,however,upon finding that her story was not credible.specifically,the ij based her adverse credibility determination on three grounds that the birth certificate petitioner submitted was likely fraudulent that petitioner original application for asylum and her supplemental affidavit presented contradictory stories,particularly regarding petitioner experiences while living in east germany and that petitioner gave inconsistent testimony at her hearing before the ij concerning a document that purportedly supported her claim to have suffered a broken leg during an attack.upon a review of the record and the ij decision,we conclude that any of the three bases enumerated by the ij,which we discuss in turn,could by itself have supported an adverse credibility finding.we therefore hold that the ij factual determination is supported by substantial evidence and decline to disturb the ij decision.
a.the birth certificate 
the first ground on which the ij rested her adverse credibility determination was a finding that petitioner likely submitted a forged birth certificate.this finding is based primarily upon a report by an immigration and naturalization service ins employee stationed at the united states embassy in moscow embassy report.the embassy report described two inconsistencies in petitioner birth certificate leading the ins employee to believe that the submitted document is fraudulent.specifically,the embassy report indicated that in,when the document was purportedly issued in kiev,ukraine,soviet documents produced outside of russia contained the language of the republic in the body of the document.petitioner document,however,contained the words birth certificate in russian only,rather than in russian and ukrainian.additionally,petitioner birth certificate did not have in the bottom left corner,as was standard in the ussr,a registration or act number along with the date of registration.for these reasons,the embassy report concluded,it appears that the submitted document is a forgery.
the ij considered the evidence submitted by petitioner to rebut the embassy report and found that the rebuttal evidence does not overcome the embassy report,largely because the documents petitioner offered had not been authenticated pursuant to applicable regulations.see note,post.petitioner objects to the ij finding,arguing that the ij erroneously relied on matter of,bia,in concluding that because a government report cast doubt upon the legitimacy of petitioner document,an overall lack of credibility is suggested.in an effort to distinguish this case from matter of,petitioner notes the report here is of uncertain authority because the credentials and expertise of the ins employee who wrote the embassy report are unknown.in contrast,the report in matter of came from the ins forensic document laboratory.see id.at we disagree with petitioner contention that the holding in matter of depended on the particular credentials of the report author.although certain reports deserve greater deference than others,it was not error for the ij to credit the sworn affidavit of an ins employee working at the united states embassy in moscow concerning the authenticity of soviet documents.the ij therefore correctly concluded that,absent a satisfactory explanation or rebuttal by petitioner,the embassy report impeached her general credibility.
the rebuttal evidence proffered by petitioner was such that a reasonable ij could arguably have accepted its validity and set aside the conclusion of the embassy report,but that evidence by no means was sufficiently persuasive to compel any reasonable ij to reject the embassy report.see b b requiring acceptance of ij factual findings on appeal unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.to support her argument that her birth certificate looked unusual,not because it was a forgery,but instead because it was reissued in after state authorities lost the original,petitioner presented an affidavit and accompanying documents from another woman who claimed that her own birth certificate reissued in ukraine in was printed in russian only,rather than in both russian and ukranian a letter from a ukranian official stating that a birth certificate in petitioner maiden name was registered in a kiev civil registry book on september,the date on the certificate proffered by petitioner and that it memorialized her birth on january,petitioner date of birth speculation that some numbers on petitioner birth certificate may constitute a registration number,contrary to the embassy report finding that the document bore no registration number.neither this evidence nor any other evidence or argument provided by petitioner convinces us that the ij determination that the birth certificate was likely fraudulent was not supported by substantial evidence.zhou yun zhang,at.the ij therefore could have rested her adverse credibility determination on this finding alone.
petitioner experiences prior to 
the second ground on which the ij rested her adverse credibility finding was that petitioner narrative of her life prior to in her initial asylum application differed considerably from the account she presented in her supplemental affidavit for instance,petitioner original application described her time in east germany as follows 
in my husband was sent to serve in the eastern germany.i worked as a nurse in a military hospital.our life was balanced,and during that time i did experience negative feelings of people towards me or any restrictions because of my nationality.everything was in my relationships with colleagues and friends.however,some pressure was felt on the part of my husband chiefs.they knew that his wife was a jew,and vitaliy was never promoted despit e many years of service.my husband friends became high ranking officer however,i did know about that,and only his heart felt that pain.
our family experienced the first blow in,when soviet troops started to leave eastern germany.
in contrast,petitioner supplemental affidavit describes the years in east germany as follows 
in,my husband was transferred to serve in eastern germany.there,my family was being constantly watched by kgb agents.my husband and i never went anywhere,because we were afraid of insults and humiliations that i was being subjected to by the personnel,because i was jewish.my husband was badly mistreated by his superiors,because i was jewish.he was never promoted,but often degraded and humiliated because of that.yet,i taught my daughter to be proud of being jewish,and i brought her up in the jewish rites and traditions.my husband supported me in my love for my religion.
upon consideration of these two documents describing the same experiences,the ij concluded that the story changes totally.the ij noted further allegations of persecution in petitioner supplemental affidavit that had been omitted from the form petitioner contends on appeal that her initial application omitted various instances of persecution because,as petitioner told the ij at her hearing,she was instructed when filing the form to describe only the most serious incident.petitioner characterizes the supplemental affidavit as adding detail to her prior account,not contradicting it or changing her story,much less changing it totally.our dissenting colleague describes the supplemental affidavit as ascrib ing more urgency to the claimed discrimination against petitioner husband and containing nothing inconsistent with her statement that she was not persecuted by her colleagues and friends at the time she worked in the military hospital.dissent,post,at.we disagree and hold that there was substantial evidence to justify the ij finding that the documents contained material inconsistencies.
although petitioner initial application mentioned her husband problems at work in east germany,it did not merely omit further details of persecution then suffered by petitioner family.instead,it specifically stated that petitioner did experience negative feelings of people towards herself or any restrictions because of her nationality.in the supplemental affidavit,petitioner asserted that her family was constantly being watched by kgb agents.she also stated that she and her husband never went anywhere,because we were afraid of insults and humiliations that i was being subjected to by the personnel,because i was jewish.although one could imagine a benign explanation for these apparent inconsistencies,our role does not extend to hypothesiz ing excuses for the inconsistencies in an asylum applicant testimony.zhou yun zhang,at see jin yu lin,at cir.we reject petitioner argument that no inconsistency exists between the statement that she did experience negative feelings or any restrictions on the basis of her nationality and the report that kgb agents stalked her family,which feared traveling lest petitioner and her husband be subjected to insults and humiliations.whereas in the initial application all was well for petitioner in east germany except for her husband difficulties at work,in the supplemental affidavit,government agents and others placed petitioner family in constant fear.because such instances of persecution are directly related to petitioner claimed eligibility for on the basis of her hold that these inconsistent statements were material and therefore that the ij did not err in basing her adverse credibility finding upon them.indeed,the ij adverse credibility finding could have rested on these inconsistencies alone.
c.the medical document 
the third ground on which the ij based her adverse credibility finding concerned petitioner testimony about the provenance of a document she presented to support her claim that her leg was broken by attackers.because the instance of persecution allegedly recorded in this document ranks among the most serious described in petitioner supplemental application for asylum,questions about the legitimacy of the document bear a legitimate nexus to petitioner claim.see,at.our dissenting colleague argues that even if we accept the ij characterization of this testimony as inconsistent,the testimony hardly goes to a matter material to borovikova claim.dissent,post,at.since questions concerning the authenticity of documents may be vital to an ij decision whether an asylum applicant is recalling true events or struggling to parrot a script,the testimony at when petitioner received a medical document and how it reached the united material to her claim.
the record includes multiple contradictory statements concerning this document.for example,the ij asked petitioner if she ever saw the document while living in ukraine,and she answered,yes.later the ij asked,when did you get the document petitioner answered,when i filed for political asylum and i had to prove this fact and my daughter made an inquiry to the hospital also,the ij asked petitioner how the document arrived in the united states.petitioner answered that she had obtained it on the date of her injury and left it with her daughter when she fled ukraine,after which acquaintances were going to the united states and my daughter passed a packet of documents with them in june.when the ij informed petitioner that the document was dated,petitioner said,i guess i received assistance and i did take the note,i forgot,but soon clarified,i recall i did take the note then,they gave me first aid,but i did take a note,they gave me the film and that was it,yes.petitioner explained further that her daughter subsequently obtained the document and mailed it to petitioner in the united states.
the excerpts of testimony quoted above clearly illustrate contradictions at issue is whether petitioner contradictions exhibit a changing story or mere confusion.we hold that substantial evidence supports the ij finding even though a reasonable finder of fact could have reached the opposite conclusion.it is not enough that a reasonable person our dissenting colleague does,see dissent,post,at that petitioner testimony hardly reflects obfuscation and provides no reason to reject petitioner argument that she was confused at first and then gave truthful answers about the document.id.the question on appeal is not whether,upon an independent evaluation of the cold record,we would credit or discredit an applicant testimony.instead,precisely because we did not hear and see what the finder of fact did,we affirm the ij factual determinations because we can not conclude that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.because the ij findings were not unreasonable,we hold that the ij could have rested her adverse credibility determination on petitioner conflicting testimony about the medical document alone.
petitioner overall credibility 
each of the three asserted grounds discussed above,standing alone,would have been sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination.nonetheless,even if no single ground had been persuasive enough on its own,the combination of them all surely was.when an ij bases an adverse credibility finding on multiple grounds,we review the totality of the ij decision,instead of dissecting the ij opinion and reviewing each portion in isolation.here,the ij found that petitioner presented a false birth certificate,offered inconsistent written statements,and contradicted herself when testifying.these factors,in combination,convinced the ij that petitioner was not a credible witness.while we can never be certain that the ij correctly evaluated a petitioner truthfulness,the statute that governs our review rests on the presumption that the ij is in a better position than a reviewing tribunal to decide such questions.because the ij properly relied on substantial evidence in finding that petitioner lacked credibility,we accept her findings of fact.
iii.petitioner withholding of removal and cat claims 
an applicant who,like petitioner,fails to establish her eligibility for asylum is necessarily unable to establish her eligibility for withholding of removal.see abankwah ins,cir.accordingly,petitioner request for withholding of removal must be dismissed.
finally,petitioner argues that although she did not seek relief under the cat in her proceeding before the ij,the ij or bia should have considered her eligibility for such relief sua sponte pursuant to c.because petitioner filed her asylum application on december,which is prior to the effective date of that regulatory provision,such sua sponte review was not required.see id.describing procedures applicable to applications filed on or after april.accordingly,the petition for review is denied insofar as it relates to petitioner cat claims.
conclusion 
upon our review of the record,we decline to set aside the ij adverse credibility finding and we find no fault with her application of the law.the ij had the opportunity to question petitioner in person,to evaluate her demeanor,and to review all the documents in the record.her findings can be overruled only if no reasonable could have failed to find the contrary result.jian xing huang,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because we conclude that that high standard has not been met,we can not disturb the ij decision denying petitioner asylum and withholding of removal.
we have considered all of petitioner arguments and found each of them to be without merit.accordingly,we deny the petition for review,as well as petitioner pending motion for stay of removal.
as to the majority dismissal of borovikova cat claims,i concur.however,as to the majority holding regarding borovikova eligibility for asylum and,in turn,its holding as to her eligibility for withholding of removal,i respectfully dissent.i believe the ij adverse credibility finding in this case is unsubstantiated.first,the ij finding that borovikova birth certificate was inauthentic goes against the weight of substantial evidence to the contrary,and it constitutes error.borovikova introduced rebuttal evidence,uncontroverted by the ins,sufficient to establish that her birth certificate was authentic and that she is in fact a ukrainian jew.second,neither of the two remaining grounds for the adverse credibility documentary inconsistency and a testimonial sufficiently material to warrant denial of asylum.
in rejecting the authenticity of borovikova birth certificate,the ij relied exclusively on a affidavit by an ins assistant writing from the embassy in moscow,which stated that borovikova certificate should have been issued in both the ukrainian and russian languages,not just in russian,and the certificate lacked a registration number.the affiant concluded that the document was a forgery.while the ij characterized the affidavit as a forensics report,there is nothing in either the affidavit or the record indicating that the assistant had any forensic expertise regarding the authenticity of birth certificates in the ukraine,nor does the cursory affidavit contain any objectively verifiable facts or criteria to substantiate the conclusion that the birth certificate was inauthentic.furthermore,it is not clear whether the assistant had reviewed an actual copy of the birth certificate,or whether he merely reviewed a copy of its translation.the government brief on appeal concedes that forensic analysis of the document was not possible because the original was unavailable.see brief for resp t at.
in rebuttal to the ins affidavit,borovikova attorney submitted the following documents to substantiate her claim that she was in fact a ukranian jew and that her birth certificate was authentic a letter dated september,from the ukranian ministry of justice,department of civil registry,confirming that the january,birth of novatskaya alla nikolayevna borovikova maiden name,was registered in the civil registry book for the city of kiev on september.the ukrainian birth certificate for borovikova was issued on the same date,september.a notice dated september,issued by the archive of the regional department of civil registry office from the city of,russia,confirming that the birth record for novatskaya alla nikolayevna was not preserved in full.a valid copy of borovikova ukrainian passport identifying her ethnicity as jewish.an affidavit and a copy of the birth certificate of another ukrainian woman,rosita khaymovich,whose birth certificate was reissued in in only the russian language.it should be noted that,according to the translation of borovikova birth certificate the certificate bears the number dez ibk.khaymovich birth certificate also bears a similar number,diz,that the translation identified as a registration number.the ij did not address whether the ins assistant may have been mistaken in failing to notice that borovikova birth certificate bore such a registration number.the ij stated that she considered the rebuttal evidence but concluded that she did not find the rebuttal evidence overcomes the embassy report,because the rebuttal documents were not authenticated.
although the ij relied upon matter of,bia,wl,in rejecting borovikova birth certificate as inauthentic,the facts in this case are distinguishable,and the ij reliance on matter of is misplaced.in matter of,the ij conclusion that the mauritian petitioner in that case had submitted a fraudulent identity card rested on more substantial grounds,namely,a report by the forensics document laboratory of the immigration and naturalization service,and its finding was buttressed by the respondent failure to refute or even address the conclusions of the forensic report.in borovikova case,the ins assistant affidavit can hardly be characterized as a forensics report it states no forensic basis for its opinion,and borovikova has effectively responded and refuted it with far more convincing submissions.furthermore,in the case of borovikova,the ins has failed to respond,object,or otherwise challenge the authenticity of the rebuttal documents,despite specific instructions to do so within days of an october,hearing before the ij.the ij has offered no reason to question the authenticity of borovikova rebuttal documents,and therefore her conclusion that they fail to overcome the ins affidavit lacks any reasonable,substantial or probative support in short,it is error.see,cao he lin dep t of justice,cir finding ij erred in rejecting petitioner notarial birth certificate based on the petitioner failure to authenticate it pursuant to regulation.
because the ij conclusion that borovikova submitted a fraudulent birth certificate is not supported by substantial evidence,and there is substantial uncontroverted evidence sufficient to carry borovikova burden of proof that she is a ukrainian jew,i would accord no deference to the ij adverse credibility finding and conclude that borovikova is in fact a ukrainian jew.
the remaining two grounds cited for the ij adverse credibility finding are immaterial,not based on substantial evidence,and therefore are insufficient to support the denial of asylum.
the first is a supposed documentary inconsistency between borovikova original written application and the subsequent supplementation by affidavit.according to the ij,borovikova written account changes totally because the supplemental affidavit sets forth a more detailed account of the persecutions she suffered.
however,according to c,an asylum applicant may be granted the right to amend and supplement a prior written asylum application.borovikova amended statement clearly described all the incidents discussed in her testimony,and the ij does not cite any inconsistencies between her testimony and the amended application.
while the ij concludes that borovikova story changed totally,the ij has not adequately identified an objectionable or material inconsistency.the only discussion of the inconsistency in the ij oral decision is as follows 
she said in that original statement attached to her application for political asylum that in she worked in a hospital and everything was okay.she says that she had no trouble with her colleagues or with other persons.she then goes on to supplement this and in the supplement the story changes totally.in the supplement,she details many early problems both in grade school and farther on.she says that her grades were changed,she was harassed and she does not paint the same picture that everything was okay,which i believe is a quote and she did not have problems until.so,there is an internal inconsistency with her written application for political asylum.
borovikova original statement said the following regarding her time working as a nurse in a military hospital in east germany,beginning in 
our life was balanced,and during that time i did experience negative feelings toward me or any restrictions because of my nationality.everything was in my relationships with colleagues and friends.however,some pressure was felt on the part of my husband chiefs.they knew that his wife was a jew,and vitaliy was never promoted despite many years of service.
borovikova supplemental written statement says the following about her time in east germany 
in,my husband was transferred to serve in eastern germany.there,my family was being constantly watched by kgb agents.my husband and i never went anywhere,because we were afraid of insults and humiliations that i was being subjected to by the personnel,because i was jewish.my husband was being badly mistreated by his superiors,because i was jewish.he was never promoted,but often degraded and humiliated because of that.
while the supplemental statement ascribes more urgency to the claimed discrimination against her husband,borovikova counsel correctly points out that there is nothing inconsistent about her statement that she was not persecuted by her colleagues and friends at the time she worked in the military hospital,and her amended application containing more detailed claims of persecution and discrimination directed at her husband at that time,particularly since her original application does mention that some pressure was felt on the part of my husband,who was not promoted because his wife was a jew.it is not inconsistent to say that borovikova relationships with her colleagues and friends was okay,but that her husband suffered discrimination at the hands of other individuals.
notably,the ij did not identify any testimony that was inconsistent with borovikova supplemented written application.even where an applicant testimony includes information omitted from a written application,a n applicant failure to list in his or her initial application facts that emerge later in testimony will not automatically provide a sufficient basis for an adverse credibility finding.inconsistencies of less than substantial importance for which a plausible explanation is offered can not form the sole basis for an adverse credibility finding.ins,cir quoting ins,cir.
here,borovikova was asked to explain why she did not detail all the specific events described in her amended submission in the initial application,and she offered a plausible explanation,testifying that when she filled out the initial application,she was instructed by the person assisting her and translating for her that she should be brief and only mention the most serious incident.
as for the ij contention that borovikova statement that everything was okay in is inconsistent with supplemented information regarding earlier persecution in grade school and beyond,the ij has hardly identified an inconsistency.there is nothing nefarious about the fact that borovikova chose to include additional instances of persecution that occurred prior to i
