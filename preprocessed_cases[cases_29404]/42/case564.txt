allen mukamusoni,a woman native to uganda and a citizen of both uganda and rwanda,entered the united states at houston,texas,on may,as a visitor for pleasure,with authorization to remain until november.mukamusoni remained in the united states beyond november,and the immigration and naturalization service ins charged her with removability.before mukamusoni was charged with removability,she submitted an application for asylum,withholding of removal,protection under the convention against torture cat,and voluntary departure.the immigration judge ij granted voluntary departure but denied her all other forms of relief on january,and the board of immigration appeals bia dismissed her appeal on april.mukamusoni then petitioned this court for review.we vacate the bia order and remand.
we recount the facts as they are presented in mukamusoni oral testimony before the ij and in documentation submitted in support of her application for asylum.
mukamusoni was born to rwandan refugee parents on may,in a rwandan refugee camp in uganda.her mother was a tutsi while her father was a hutu,and she had six siblings.she had always considered her self rwandese.her father worked for a ugandan family in mbarara,uganda,and that family told government officials that mukamusoni was their daughter so that she could attend school in uganda.mukamusoni was thus able to attend mary,a catholic boarding school,and lived with the nuns of mary at their convent in uganda.
mukamusoni family lived in uganda until,when every member of the family except mukamusoni returned to rwanda.mukamusoni explained that at that time,many rwandans in uganda decided to return to rwanda in order to fight for their rights.the rwandan migration was also partly due to uganda policy,which advocated the repatriation of rwandan refugees to rwanda.mukamusoni herself stayed behind in uganda to continue high school at mary.
in,civil war broke out in rwanda.according to the human rights watch report for rwanda which was admitted into evidence,in the rwandan patriotic front rpf,composed largely of tutsi refugees who had spent decades in exile,defeated the rwandan government,made up primarily of hutu,who form the great majority of the rwandan population t he government and army carried out a genocide of more than half a million tutsi until they were stopped by the rpf.after their defeat,members of the former government became leaders of the hutu rebels,and s ome of the insurgents,including several senior officers who led the genocide,seemed ready to continue annihilating the tutsi.
during the genocide of the tutsi in rwanda,mukamusoni father was originally in the army of the rwandan patriotic front rpf,but after some time he decided to desert the rpf and joined the hutu rebels because he was hutu himself.mukamusoni eldest brother joined her father with the hutu rebel forces during the war,and he was killed in kigali,rwanda in.mukamusoni other siblings and her mother lived in a refugee camp at mutara,rwanda during this time.mukamusoni said that even though a hutu law required a hutu man married to a tutsi woman to kill his wife,mukamusoni father refused to kill his wife because he was in love with her.but later,a hutu death squad came to the refugee camp and slaughtered mukamusoni mother and her remaining siblings,along with many other refugees.
through most of the genocide,mukamusoni was in uganda.she returned to rwanda in,when the civil war in rwanda slowed down,to take the university entrance exams and to be with her family.while in rwanda preparing for the exams,she received news of the massacre of her mother and siblings.mukamusoni decided to attend the funeral for her mother,siblings,and other victims of the massacre,even though it was very dangerous for her because of her hutu heritage and the fact that most of the people there were tutsi.mukamusoni testified that at the funeral there were s o many people dead and the bodies were cut in pieces and mixed up and buried in the same grave yard,such that one could tell who is who.in fact,mukamusoni was unable to identify the remains of her youngest sibling.
at the funeral,she also saw her father,who could not stay long because the tutsi in the rpf were looking for him.by then the rpf was in control of the government of rwanda.he told her that he was leaving rwanda for zaire now congo with the other hutu rebels.according to the human rights watch report for rwanda,after the rpf victory,the hutu rebels led some two million rwandans into exile,more than half of them to zaire.
mukamusoni began her studies at the national university of rwanda in butare,rwanda in may.she introduced into evidence a copy of her rwandan identity card and a copy of her student identity card at the national university of rwanda.the rpf government posted soldiers,most of whom were tutsi,at the entrances of the university in order to prevent a repeat of the hutu rebels massacre of the students,which had occurred in during the genocide.the soldiers and other students began to harass mukamusoni because she was using her father last name,mukarazizi,which they recognized as the name of a known hutu rebel.mukamusoni studied journalism and was an outspoken proponent of ethnic reconciliation between the hutu and the tutsi.in response,the tutsi soldiers and their student affiliates banned her from publishing letters in the school newspaper and told other students not to listen to her.she received letters from her father from time to time informing her that he was alive,but these letters were interpreted by the rpf soldiers as evidence of her espionage with a hutu rebel.as a result,she was pulled from class and questioned by the soldiers.
at the end of her first semester,mukamusoni was again taken from class to the rpf office,where her student id and rwandan passport were taken from her so that she could not travel and leave rwanda.the soldiers interrogated her about her correspondence with her father and his whereabouts although she showed them her father letters and explained that she knew nothing about the plans of the rebels,the soldiers did not believe her and thought she was lying.she was arrested and taken to prison in butare,rwanda,where she was imprisoned for four months.during this time she was beaten every morning,interrogated twice per week,and tortured by various kinds of forced activity rolling in dry grass in the mornings as a form of wake up walking miles and miles to exhaustion digging ditches digging through giant anthills in hot weather to retrieve the queen ant while being beaten until she passed out and doing other kinds of manual labor.within the first week of her imprisonment she was raped by a tutsi soldier at the prison.this was her first experience of sexual intercourse,and she was terrified that she would contract aids or become pregnant from the rape.during her imprisonment,she wished for death and had no hope for the future.but,to her surprise,she was released when the rpf government realized that she had no information about her father.her passport was returned to her,and she finished her first year at the university in.
in,after her release from prison,she received a letter from someone claiming to be a friend of her father informing her that her father had been killed by the tutsi in kibeho,zaire.because the letter was from a hutu rebel,it was not signed.from that point on,mukamusoni received no further communications from her father.
according to the human rights watch report for rwanda,i n refugee camps in zaire,remnants of the defeated rebel hutu army rearmed,recruited new forces,and began incursions into rwanda.in,tutsi rwandan troops dispers ed the camps,massacring tens of thousands of unarmed civilians,and killing thousands of soldiers and militia.
in her removal proceedings,the ins lawyer and the ij both questioned mukamusoni about whether she could present death certificates for her family.she testified that she never even heard about death certificates they do give out death certificates in rwanda,especially not during the genocide.nor did she know if they gave out death certificates in zaire,where her father had died,as she had never been there.
mukamusoni spent the summer of back in uganda at mary convent.she told sister catherine,a nun to whom she was very close,her fears of returning to rwanda in light of her experiences there.however,sister catherine urged her to return to rwanda to continue her studies.because she had lost her entire family and had no means of economic support,mukamusoni decided that she had to return to school in rwanda.
when mukamusoni started her second year at the university in she changed her last name on the student id from her father name mukarazizi to her own mukamusoni,in the hope that the rpf soldiers would stop harassing her.mukamusoni explained that in africa it was not necessary that children have the same last name as their parents.but,this name change did not work because a fellow student,ndemezo,found out through mukamusoni classmates that she was hutu and that her father was a hutu rebel.ndemezo,a tutsi,targeted mukamusoni for harassment because he felt that she helped to kill his family and reported her to his brother,who was a soldier in the rpf.ndemezo stole mukamusoni ugandan passport.later in the year,mukamusoni was again arrested by the rpf and,this time,she spent two months in prison.she was beaten,forced to do manual labor,and raped by a different tutsi soldier.the rpf again interrogated her concerning her father and her travels to uganda,believing that she was receiving information from hutu rebels.she gave the soldiers all the information they sought,including the address of mary convent in uganda.although she showed the soldiers the letter containing news of her father death,the rpf continued to believe that her father was alive.the soldiers finally released her after she threatened to kill herself.after she was released,she was punished each day with manual labor tasks that took all day such as farming and cleaning university facilities,such that it was nearly impossible for her to attend class.
after a few weeks of trying to do manual labor and to attend class,mukamusoni escaped to mary convent in uganda.there she was confronted on several occasions by ugandan and rpf soldiers.mukamusoni explained that ugandan soldiers worked with the rpf because uganda had supported the tutsi during the civil war.one of mukamusoni friends,fi fi,informed sister catherine that rpf soldiers were planning to arrest mukamusoni in uganda.sister catherine then took mukamusoni to a remote village where she could hide while sister catherine obtained on mukamusoni behalf a ugandan passport,a tourist visa to the united states,and a plane ticket.
sister catherine believed that mukamusoni should go back to rwanda to get her college transcripts so that she could continue her studies in the united states.although mukamusoni pled with sister catherine and explained to sister catherine that such a trip would be very dangerous,sister catherine insisted that it was very important.at sister catherine urging,mukamusoni returned to rwanda on february,to obtain her transcripts.she heard from fi fi that the rpf was planning to arrest her,and she immediately fled back to uganda ten days later,without her transcripts.upon her return,she stayed for a short time at the convent before going back to the remote village to hide.while she was at the convent soldiers hid outside the convent,waiting to interrogate her.mukamusoni also returned to rwanda one more time in another aborted attempt to get her transcripts,staying for only a few days this time because she again heard that the rpf planned to arrest her.mukamusoni introduced into evidence a copy of her ugandan passport.
mukamusoni returned to the convent at the end of april to get her plane ticket,and sister catherine died of cancer shortly after that.mukamusoni left uganda and entered the united states at houston,texas,on may,with a visitor visa.her luggage was lost by the airline.many of her personal documents,such as her rwandan passport and the letter informing her of her father death,were lost along with the luggage.mukamusoni introduced into evidence an apology letter from northwest airlines and the lost luggage tracing claim forms.
mukamusoni moved to waltham,massachusetts,where she lived with a distant relative and worked as a babysitter.on may,she applied for asylum in the united states,a few days more than one year after she entered the united states 
in august of,rachel wolfe,a psychologist of the cambridge health alliance,began to evaluate mukamusoni,upon referral by mukamusoni counsel.wolfe conducted three clinical interviews with mukamusoni and recorded her findings in a psychological evaluation completed on october.this evaluation and a set of notes maintained by wolfe during the time she saw mukamusoni were submitted into evidence.wolfe found mukamusoni to be a reliable historian whose account of her experience was consistent across interviews.wolfe wrote that mukamusoni suffered from ulcers developed in prison,and that she sought hiv testing to be sure that she did not have aids.wolfe reported that every night,mukamusoni experienced nightmares of her tortures in prison and the killings of her family,waking to the sound of her own screams or to a pillow wet with her tears.she wrote that mukamusoni fe lt flooded with terror,experienc ed overwhelming grief and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness,felt cut off from people,and had little control over her crying spells.wolfe described mukamusoni as having a restricted range of emotion,which she said is typical of trauma victims,and that mukamusoni had a sense of foreshortened future where she did not expect to live long.wolfe also wrote that mukamusoni had difficulty falling and remaining asleep at night,unable to get thoughts of her family and fears of what will happen to her out of her mind.
based on mukamusoni symptoms,wolfe diagnosed her with post traumatic stress disorder ptsd.beyond the diagnosis of ptsd,wolfe reported that mukamusoni behavior during her interviews including low voice and low level of energy was typical of individuals experiencing a major depressive disorder under the definition of the american psychiatric association diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.wolfe recommended that mukamusoni receive individual psychotherapy and psychopharmacology,and antidepressant medication for her and depressive symptoms.mukamusoni began to receive psychotherapy from wolfe,and she was also given prozac.wolfe noted that mukamusoni appear ed to have the drive and intelligence to create a productive life for herself in the united states.wolfe noted that mukamusoni was enthusiastic and compliant in treatment,but was not reliable in making her appointments.after a few more sessions,mukamusoni did not continue to see wolfe for treatment.
the ins rejected mukamusoni application on october,because she missed the filing deadline.see a b a.on october,the ins issued a notice to appear,charging her with removability as an alien who remained in the united states longer than permitted.
removal proceedings for mukamusoni commenced before an ij on january,mukamusoni conceded removability and relied on her application for asylum,withholding of removal,protection under the cat,and voluntary departure.a merits hearing was held on april,and continued on january.
during the april,hearing,the ij excused mukamusoni late filing of her asylum application because the ij found her to be suffering from ptsd during the year that she was in the united states,and that this constituted extraordinary circumstances justifying the late filing.no dispute remains as to the timeliness of her filing.
mukamusoni testified to the events in her application and affidavit as recounted above.she testified that she was afraid to go back either to uganda or rwanda for fear that she would be tortured due to her hutu ethnicity and the political activities of her father.she testified that she had heard from her friend fi fi that soldiers still went by mary to ask the nuns about mukamusoni whereabouts.
mukamusoni offered to have wolfe testify at the original hearing on april,but was told by the ij to wait for a later date as the ij wanted to hear mukamusoni testimony first.mukamusoni again offered to have wolfe testify by telephone at the january,hearing,but the ij denied that request as well on the ground that the witness was available.wolfe,however,was not available to appear for the later date and so did not testify.
at the april,hearing,the ij granted a continuance to january,in part to allow mukamusoni to obtain additional documentation,including a death certificate for her father,medical records,and a letter from her friend fi fi.at the later date,mukamusoni submitted her medical records into evidence.the government objected on the ground that wolfe,the maker of the records,was not available to be.the ij nonetheless made the records part of the record,agreeing to consider them de bene in light of the objection.the ij also denied mukamusoni attempt to introduce an affidavit documenting the ultimately unsuccessful attempts to secure a death certificate for her father.
the ij finally denied mukamusoni application for asylum as a matter of discretion in an oral decision dated january.the ij also denied the applications for withholding of removal and cat protection but granted her voluntary departure.
the ij found that mukamusoni has not established the truthfulness of what is stated in her asylum application,documentation in support thereof,and her testimony in these proceedings.that was because,in the ij view,a reasonable person,similarly situated as mukamusoni on this record would not fear persecution or have a fear of persecution on account of one of the five statutory grounds listed in a a.the ij found that mukamusoni testimony was and left a lot to the imagination and determined that she gave no evidence and no corroboration concerning her experiences.
on appeal to the bia,mukamusoni argued that the ij had failed to give her the benefit of the regulatory presumption of a fear of future persecution for establishing past persecution.see b.she also argued that the ij misapplied the reasonable person test set out in matter of mogharrabi,wl bia.finally,she argued that the ij abused his discretion by failing to consider her case fully,and in particular,the ij offered no substantive basis for his adverse credibility findings.
on april,the bia denied her appeal.in its decision,the bia found it unnecessary to address the adverse credibility findings of the ij and implicitly accepted that mukamusoni was credible it nonetheless found mukamusoni failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing past persecution or a fear of future persecution.even though the bia proceeded on the assumption that mukamusoni was credible,it found her testimony to be vague regarding key elements of her asylum claim and scant and generalized.for example,the bia found it significant that mukamusoni testified that she was raped during her incarcerations,but provided no details about the incidents.it discussed wolfe psychological evaluation only in the sense of holding it against mukamusoni because she did not continue to appear for treatment.the bia also found that mukamusoni did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence to support her claim,and that such corroboration was necessary because her testimony was not sufficiently detailed.finally,the bia determined that mukamusoni decision to return to school in rwanda after her first arrest and to return to rwanda on two occasions to retrieve her college transcripts undercut the genuineness of her subjective fear.
on may,mukamusoni timely petitioned this court for review of the bia decision to affirm the ij decision.
it is the bia decision,as the final agency order,that we review.see georcely ashcroft,cir albathani ins,cir.we review the bia determination that mukamusoni failed to meet her burden of proof under the deferential substantial evidence standard.ins,d albathani,at.our review is on the whole record,not solely on the evidence that supports the bia determination.gailius ins,cir.d eference is not due to the bia where findings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the record,viewed as a whole,or are merely personal views of the immigration judge.ins,cir citations omitted.w e may not affirm the bia decision when we can not conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial,when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes,including the body of evidence opposed to the board view.gailius,at quoting universal camera nlrb.alteration omitted.the bia legal conclusions are reviewed de novo,with appropriate deference to the agency interpretation of the underlying statute in accordance with administrative law principles.id.at.
an asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he or she is unable or unwilling to return to the applicant country of nationality because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a a.applicants may meet this burden in one of two ways by demonstrating a fear of persecution on account of one of the statutory grounds,or by establishing past persecution on account of one of the statutory grounds so as to be entitled to a presumption of a fear of persecution.mihaylov ashcroft,cir b.
once an applicant has been found to be entitled to the benefit of such a regulatory presumption based on past persecution,the presumption may be rebutted by a finding that either t here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality,or t he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant country.el moraghy ashcroft,cir quoting b i a b alterations in original.the government bears the burden of rebutting the presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.b ii.
an applicant must pass both an objective and subjective test to show a fear of future persecution.el moraghy,at velasquez ashcroft,cir.the subjective test requires the applicant to prove his fear is genuine,while the objective test requires showing by credible and specific evidence that this fear is reasonable.el moraghy,at.
we conclude on this record,taking mukamusoni as credible as the bia did,that substantial evidence does not support the bia conclusion that mukamusoni failed to establish past persecution on account of her mixed heritage the political activities of her father.the bia committed errors of law and misapplied the law by focusing narrowly on only parts of the record that supported its decision,by raising too high the bar for an asylum claimant seeking to prove past persecution or a fear of future persecution,by unreasonably evaluating the record,and by excessively demanding corroborative evidence.we explain these errors below.
if the bia had squarely found her credible,then on this record,it is very likely that we would have been compelled to conclude that mukamusoni had established past persecution with respect to her testimony of the events in rwanda see,knezevic ashcroft,cir reversing bia finding that there was no past persecution and holding that record compels conclusion that asylum applicants suffered past persecution bellido ashcroft,cir same.in that event,she would have been entitled to a regulatory presumption of having met her burden of proof with respect to fear of future persecution,and we would remand for further proceedings on the basis that she had met that burden.however,since the bia declined to reach the adverse credibility findings of the ij but assumed credibility,we vacate the bia order and remand for further proceedings in light of this opinion.
the record and mukamusoni burden of proof 
because the bia d id not find it necessary to address mukamusoni credibility and solely evaluated the sufficiency of the evidence to meet mukamusoni burden of proof,the bia treated her testimony and her supporting documentation as credible.that is also the position the government has taken in this court.
the bia nonetheless affirmed the ij denial of asylum because it found that mukamusoni ha d not presented sufficient detail so as to provide a plausible and coherent account of the events underlying her claim and failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing past persecution.to support this conclusion,the bia explained that w hile mukamusoni affidavit was replete with information,her testimony was scant and generalized.then,while citing and purporting to follow the analysis in matter of,bia,the bia focused exclusively on mukamusoni oral testimony.the bia painted mukamusoni oral testimony regarding the circumstances of her two arrests,incarceration,and release as general,devoid of information,and vague.in particular,the bia pointed to the fact that mukamusoni provided no details about her rapes.the bia concluded that mukamusoni,like the applicant in matter of,did not offer critical details in her testimony to furnish context to her claim for asylum.see matter of,at.the record does not support any of these conclusions.
the bia focus on only the oral evidence was error in two ways.first,as a matter of fact,mukamusoni had been encouraged to keep her oral testimony short because her extensive affidavit was accepted as the bulk of her testimony and so the affidavit could not be discounted.further,as a matter of law,under ins rules,that affidavit testimony could not be discounted to the extent the bia chose to do.see c i nformation provided in the asylum application may be used to satisfy any burden of proof in removal proceedings.in doing so the bia committed an error of law.
the bia also erred in applying its own precedents.nothing in matter of supports the bia reasoning.in matter of,the bia affirmed the ij decision to deny a mauritanian man claim for asylum on the ground that the alien failed to meet his burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum.at.the bia relied on the fact that the alien application for asylum did not provide additional information regarding his claim.rather,there were significant omissions of references to events he orally testified to in the written application.id.at emphasis added.
in contrast to matter of,the written affidavit of mukamusoni in support of her asylum application is replete with information.every single item that the bia found lacking sufficient detail in mukamusoni oral testimony is supplemented by additional detail in her written answers to the asylum application and the affidavit in support of her application.for example,the bia faulted mukamusoni for giving only general oral testimony about the date or location of her arrests,the manner of her arrests,and details concerning her incarceration,interrogation,and release.yet,all of these details are found in her affidavit and written answers on the asylum application,which are part of the record before the bia the bia identified no instance where she testified to significant events that are omitted in the written application and affidavit.thus,the analysis in matter of does not support the bia conclusion.
the bia failure to take into account the evidence in mukamusoni application and affidavit is contrary to law and particularly egregious in light of the ij limitation of oral testimony.we also note that the government did not object to the admission of the affidavit information into evidence and had ample opportunity throughout the proceedings to cross examine her on the details in the affidavit.
lack of corroboration 
the bia also found that mukamusoni did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence to support her claim.this finding is likewise not supported by substantial evidence.
initially,the bia finding of lack of corroborative evidence is linked to its error in not reviewing the entire record,as noted above.this is so because corroborative evidence is not required to establish an asylum claim in many cases,the applicant own credible testimony is sufficient to support eligibility for asylum as long as it provides a basis for a well founded fear.gailius,at see also a.the bia has also held that the weaker an alien testimony is,the greater the need for corroborative evidence.matter of,at.because the bia failed to consider the entire record and found mukamusoni testimony weaker than it actually was,it demanded a higher level of corroboration than it should have.the combination of detailed testimony and corroborative background evidence is sufficient to establish mukamusoni past persecution.id.
in any event,the record does not support the bia conclusion that mukamusoni insufficiently corroborated her testimony.the bia ignored the presence of the bulk of the corroborative evidence in the record and overstated the role of the absence of certain pieces of corroborative evidence.in support of her application for asylum,mukamusoni offered corroborative evidence in the form of medical records,country condition reports,proof of the loss of certain documents from northwest airlines,and identification documents.in addition,mukamusoni offered to provide an affidavit explaining why she could not obtain a copy of her father death certificate.
first,the overwhelming weight of the evidence from the pages of wolfe notes and wolfe psychological evaluation corroborates mukamusoni claims.the records are literally replete with information which supports the substance of mukamusoni testimony.mukamusoni account of her experiences in rwanda to wolfe is also consistent with the accounts given in her affidavit,application,and oral testimony.wolfe noted the physical evidence that corroborated mukamusoni story ulcers developed in prison,her independently sought hiv testing in light of her fear of having contracted aids from her rapes,ptsd symptoms such as nightmares,hopelessness,sleeplessness,distrust of others,
the bia,however,found that the medical records mukamusoni submitted to bolster her claim actually undercut her claim that she suffers from ptsd because the records show that mukamusoni was not sincere in her attempts to seek medical assistance.the bia based this conclusion on the following handwritten note from wolfe although enthusiastic and compliant,mukamusoni was not reliable in coming to therapy and,after sessions beyond the asylum eval.indicated that she did not have time to come.she recontacted me in early march because her final trial was coming up soon.even if the bia were correct that this indicated mukamusoni lack of dedication in seeking medical treatment,it is not clear how this would undercut her claim with respect to her ptsd condition.the medical records were submitted to corroborate the diagnosis of her treating psychologist and the strength of her fear,which are facts independent of her ability to keep appointments.to the extent that her sincerity in seeking treatment might be relevant to a general credibility determination,the bia already chose not to address her credibility.
the bia interpretation of the medical records is especially inexplicable because,within the very same note from which the bia takes the quote above,wolfe reiterates her diagnosis and recommends continued treatment for mukamusoni with a new therapist,which would be a nonsensical conclusion if wolfe thought mukamusoni ptsd to be fabricated.viewed as a whole,the bia finding that the medical records undercut rather than corroborated mukamusoni claim is simply unsupportable.
the bia also cited the fact that n otwithstanding the long continuance,mukamusoni did not present wolfe as a witness,as she was unavailable as further example of lack of corroboration.this is not a fair or accurate characterization of the history of the proceedings before the ij.the record shows that mukamusoni made repeated offers to have wolfe testify,first in person,and then telephonically,but was not allowed to do so by the ij.the record also shows that the long continuance was not granted by the ij in order to have mukamusoni secure wolfe testimony.
there are other pieces of corroborative evidence in the record that the bia did not discuss and it is unclear whether the bia even considered them the letter from northwest airlines and lost luggage tracing claim forms confirming her lost luggage,her ugandan passport,her rwandan identity card,and her student identity card at rwandan national university.each of these documents provided corroboration for crucial parts of mukamusoni sto
