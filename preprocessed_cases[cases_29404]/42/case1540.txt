vladimir ernesto ortega oliva,a native and citizen of el salvador,sought asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act ina.the board of immigration appeals bia denied his petition,affirming the immigration judge ij determination that oliva did not demonstrate a nexus between the persecution he faced and either of his proposed particular social groups.the bia further held that even if oliva had demonstrated the required nexus,he did not allege membership in a cognizable particular social group.
we conclude that the bia erred by interpreting the nexus requirement too narrowly,and that oliva successfully demonstrated that membership in his proposed social groups was at least one central reason for his persecution.we further conclude that the bia failed to adequately address the record evidence in making its determination that oliva proposed social groups were not cognizable under the ina.accordingly,we grant oliva petition,reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand for proper consideration of the cognizable social group issue.
the facts of this matter show that oliva left his home country of el salvador and entered the united states without authorization in.in july,the department of homeland security served oliva with a notice to appear,charging him with removability under section a a i of the ina,as an alien present in the united states without admission or parole.in july,oliva filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal.
in,the ij held a hearing to assess oliva application.in his testimony and affidavit,oliva explained that at the age of sixteen he joined a gang called mara salvatrucha,also known as ms,while living in san rafael cedros in el salvador he was trained to spy for ms in the territory of rival gangs.
when he was sixteen or seventeen years old,oliva witnessed members of ms brutally murder and dismember a rival gang member.after seeing this,oliva decided to distance himself from the gang.
ms forbids its members from quitting and kills anyone who attempts to leave the gang.however,ms does allow gang members to become inactive members if they either devote themselves to the church or get married and start a family.ms requires inactive members to pay rent,a form of monetary tribute to the gang.this ensures that inactive members contribute financially to the gang,even if they no longer contribute physically.
oliva began distancing himself from the gang and became more involved in his church.when ms noted his increased absence from gang activities,gang members started to threaten oliva.to escape ms,oliva moved to live with his aunt in lourdes colon,el salvador,but found that gangs were active there as well.after about three months in lourdes colon,oliva moved to san salvador,the capital of el salvador,where he stayed with his godmother for roughly two years.
around late or early,oliva returned to san rafael cedros but tried to stay hidden from ms.about a month after his return,the gang realized he was there.according to oliva,the gang reminded him that leaving the gang was not allowed,and threatened to kill him if he did not start paying them rent.after that,oliva paid roughly thirty percent of his income to the gang for seven or eight years.
in,oliva decided to stop paying rent,and on one occasion ran from ms gang members to avoid having to pay.about two months later,in october,members of ms severely beat oliva to send a message that if he did continue paying the rent he would be killed.after the beating,oliva began paying the rent again,and ms would remind him of the rules when they took his money.oliva decided to flee to america to protect himself.
oliva entered the united states without authorization in and settled down in virginia.in the summer of,he began receiving threatening phone calls originating in el salvador.the callers told oliva that if he cross es the border back into el salvador they will kill him as a punishment for trying to quit.
despite finding this testimony credible,the ij denied oliva application for asylum and withholding of removal the ij found that t he evidence indicates that the gang was not targeting oliva because of his membership in a group consisting of former gang members who have either found religion or started families rather,he was targeted for money.
oliva appealed the ij decision.a panel of the bia dismissed the appeal.
the courts of appeals have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal.a martinez holder,cir.in this case,the final order of removal was issued by the bia.see a b i martinez,at.we may affirm the bia only on the grounds stated in the opinion and may not substitute what we consider to be a more adequate or proper basis for its conclusions.crespin valladares holder,cir quoting sec chenery.
a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the united states is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.u.b c.we review the bia legal determinations de novo.martinez,at.while a panel of the bia is entitled to chevron deference for its reasonable interpretations of immigration statutes,a panel of the the one in this case is entitled to the lesser skidmore deference.id.at see skidmore swift.in other words,the opinion of the panel of the bia is not controlling upon this court,but we may consider it as a body of experience and informed judgment,taking into account the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade.skidmore,at.
the bia findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see also temu holder,cir we uphold factual findings unless no rational factfinder could agree with the bia position.citing crespin valladares,at.the bia itself reviews findings of fact made by the ij for clear error.see crespin valladares,at citing d i.
while oliva concedes that he is eligible for removal,he contends that the bia erred in denying his request for withholding of removal under section b a of the ina.under that section,the attorney general may not remove an alien who is otherwise removable if the attorney general decides that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a 
oliva argues that his life would be threatened because of his membership in one of two particular social groups salvadorans who are former members of ms and who left the gang,without its permission,for moral and religious reasons,and salvadorans who were recruited to be members of ms as children and who left the gang as minors,without its permission,for moral and religious reasons.
the bia dismissed oliva appeal on two grounds.first,the bia held that oliva proposed particular social groups were not cognizable under the ina.second,the bia found that oliva failed to demonstrate that the persecution he feared was on account of his membership in either of his proposed social nexus requirement.oliva challenges both determinations on appeal.
if the bia correctly held that oliva failed to establish a nexus between his persecution and his proposed social groups,the court could affirm the bia decision without reaching the question whether his particular social groups are cognizable under the ina.see cordova holder,cir.therefore,we begin our analysis by considering whether oliva satisfied the nexus requirement.
an applicant must satisfy the nexus requirement by showing his past or threatened persecution was on account of his membership in that group.a a.oliva argues that the bia committed reversible error in holding that he had failed to demonstrate the on account of prong.we agree.
a petitioner must show that his membership in the particular social group was or will be a central reason for his persecution.matter of w g r,emphasis added.stated differently,a protected ground must be at least one central reason for the feared persecution but need not be the only reason.crespin valladares,at quoting b b i.membership in a protected social group may not,howe
