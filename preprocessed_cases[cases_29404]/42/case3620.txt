we must decide whether an immigration judge properly required corroborating evidence from an otherwise credible witness in an asylum hearing.
nirmal singh is an indian citizen and former resident of that nation punjab state.singh maintains that as a result of his political activities and affiliation,he was arrested and tortured on four occasions.according to singh,after his fourth confrontation with authorities,a police officer told him if you want to save your life,leave india.singh claims that shortly thereafter,he took the officer advice and fled to canada.singh asserts that he arrived in canada,using a false passport,on october.he says he stayed there for ten days before entering the united states without inspection on october.in the fall of,singh filed for asylum 
on january,singh was issued a notice to appear.at his hearing before an immigration judge ij,singh conceded his removability and sought asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.
the ij rejected singh request for asylum as untimely filed.though he made no adverse credibility finding,the ij found singh testimony insufficient to establish his last date of entry into the united states by clear and convincing evidence.in so ruling,the ij noted that singh had provided no documentation corroborating his claim that he entered this country on october,without an established date of entry,singh could not prove that he filed his application within year after the date of his arrival in the united states.a b.
singh appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,which likewise concluded that his application was because he had failed to establish his date of entry.quoting the text of b b ii,the bia explained that such section specifically provides that,in determining whether an asylum applicant has met his burden of proof,the trier of fact may require an applicant to provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony.ultimately,the bia held that singh failure to provide such evidence was fatal to his application.
singh timely petitioned this court for review.
we only address the timeliness of singh application in this opinion singh contends that for various reasons,the bia improperly concluded that he failed to meet the deadline.the government counters by asserting that this court has no jurisdiction to review the bia ruling,and,in the alternative,that singh application was properly found to be untimely.
we must first assess whether we have jurisdiction to review the bia timeliness determination.any alien who is physically present in the united states irrespective of such alien status,may apply for asylum a.however,an alien can only avail himself of this provision if he demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within year after the date of the alien arrival in the united states.id.a b.section a states that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under section a b.read together,these provisions appear to deprive this court of jurisdiction over determinations that an alien failed to file his application within one year of entering this country.see hakeem ins,cir thus,under section a,we lack jurisdiction to review the ij determination that the applicant failed to file his asylum application within one year of his arrival in the united states.
nonetheless,the real id act of restores our jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law.ramadan gonzales,cir per curiam quoting gonzales,cir see also a d nothing in any other provision of this chapter which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.legal questions include questions of statutory construction and questions involving the application of statutes or regulations to undisputed facts,sometimes referred to as mixed questions of fact and law.ramadan,at.thus,to secure jurisdiction,we must determine whether singh has raised a question of statutory construction or a question involving the application of a provision of law to undisputed facts.
singh argument is legal,not factual.he claims that because his testimony was deemed credible,the agency committed a legal error by requiring corroboration.in his view,credible testimony is necessarily sufficient to meet the clear and convincing standard,and corroboration can not be required.because this is a legal argument about how to construe b b ii,and not a factual argument about whether the evidence in his case proved his date of entry,we have jurisdiction to review it 
singh claims that the ij had no authority to require corroborating evidence from a credible witness.if the ij does possess such authority,we must then determine if it was properly exercised in this case.
in the past,i t was well established in this circuit that the bia may not require independent corroborative evidence from an asylum applicant who testifies credibly in support of his application.kataria ins,cir see also,singh gonzales,cir same kaur ashcroft,cir same ladha ins,cir a n alien testimony,if unrefuted and credible,direct and specific,is sufficient to establish the facts testified without the need for any corroboration,overruled on other grounds by abebe mukasey,cir en banc.
with respect to asylum applications filed after may,however,this is no longer true.as we have previously held in aden holder,congress abrogated these holdings in the real id act of,cir.it is still true that credible testimony can,in some circumstances,sustain the applicant burden of proof.see b b ii t he testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant burden without corroboration,but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant testimony is credible,is persuasive,and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.but the act further provides that w here the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony,such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and can not reasonably obtain the evidence.id.thus,credible testimony may be sufficient to satisfy the applicant burden of proof,but the act also enables the trier of fact to require something more.uncorroborated testimony is sufficient only if the applicant testimony is credible the applicant testimony is persuasive and the applicant testimony refers to facts sufficient to demonstrate refugee status.credible testimony is not by itself enough.aden,at.to the extent our prior decisions hold to the contrary,they are superseded by the real id act.id.
thus,in the case at hand,singh is correct that insofar as the ij made no adverse credibility finding,we must credit him as truthful.see kataria,at.we need not accept all facts to which he testifies as true,however.aden,at.after the real id act,the ij may,in determining whether it satisfies the applicant burden of proof,weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record.id.at quoting b b ii.congress has installed a bias toward corroboration in the statute to provide greater reliability.id.at.thus,we must conclude that the ij possessed the authority to require corroborating evidence.
our conclusion that the ij may require corroborating evidence despite credible testimony does not end the matter,however.singh contends that because he could not reasonably be expected to provide proof of when he entered the united states t he bia and the ij committed error in their application of the real id act as it pertains to him.as we conclude that the ij properly demanded corroborating evidence despite singh otherwise credible testimony,we reject singh contention.
we note at the outset that we do not write on a clean slate as we interpret section b b ii.the bia has interpreted this section as codifying its preexisting corroboration requirements.see in re,i n.when reviewing an agency interpretation of its governing statute,we follow the framework famously set forth in chevron natural resources defense council,d.holder,cir en banc.precedential bia decisions interpreting the immigration and nationality act fall under this rubric.id.at citing united states mead,d see also holder,cir generally,we accord chevron deference where there is binding agency precedent either in the form of a regulation or a published bia case.internal quotation marks,alternation,and citation omitted 
we thus consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if the statutory provision at issue is silent or ambiguous,however,we may not supply the interpretation of the statute we think best,but must limit ourselves to asking whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,at quoting chevron,at.
with section b b ii,congress has expressly empowered the ij to require corroborating evidence even when the applicant has provided otherwise credible testimony.should the applicant fail to offer corroboration,the ij may conclude that despite the applicant credible testimony,he has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he is entitled to asylum relief.accordingly,the ij conclusion that singh uncorroborated testimony was insufficient to carry his burden to prove his date of entry was proper.
our dissenting colleague contends that the ij erred by failing to give singh notice that his testimony required corroboration before concluding that he had failed to meet this burden.according to the dissent,section b b ii mandates a process dissent at.in the first step,an ij must determine whether an applicant uncorroborated testimony is insufficient to carry his burden.in the second step,the ij must identify the portions of the applicant testimony that require corroboration.in the third step,the ij must give the applicant an opportunity to provide that corroboration or an explanation for its absence.this interpretation is belied by the statute text,which omits any reference to such a procedure.as we explained in aden holder,by enacting section b b ii,congress has made immigration litigation more like other litigation,where parties with the burden of proof ordinarily provide whatever corroboration they have when presenting their case in chief.at.thus,just as a plaintiff in a car accident case provides the body shop invoice and his medical records to corroborate his damages claims,an applicant in an asylum case is now expected to provide evidence corroborating the factual assertions underlying his claim for relief.see id.thus,while the statute permits an ij to give an applicant notice that his testimony requires corroboration,it does not require that he do so.see rapheal mukasey,cir.we accordingly reject the dissent interpretation.
moreover,we are not at liberty simply to impose the dissent interpretation of the statute on the bia.even if the statute were ambiguous,we would only need to determine whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.because the bia has exercised its authority to interpret section b b ii,its decision governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the necessarily the only possible interpretation,nor even the interpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.entergy riverkeeper,d.
the bia has held that by adding the provisions regarding corroboration,congress intended to codify the bia corroboration standards contained in in re.in re,at internal quotation marks,alterations,and citation omitted see also rapheal,at concluding that the real id act codified the corroboration rule of in re these standards state that where it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence,the applicant should provide either the evidence or an explanation of why she did not provide it.in re.therefore,an asylum applicant should provide documentary support for material facts which are central to his or her claim and easily subject to verification the absence of such corroborating evidence can lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet his burden of proof.in re,at alterations in original quoting in re,at.as this is certainly a plausible interpretation of the statute,entergy.at,it is entitled to deference.
accordingly,where it is reasonable to expect an applicant to provide documentary support for material facts which are central to his claim and easily subject to verification,the applicant should provide either the evidence or an explanation of why she did not provide it.see in re,at citing in re,at see also balachandran holder,cir i t was reasonable to expect the applicant to secure corroboration from his family in canada.krishnapillai holder,cir there was no error in the immigration judge expectation that the applicant produce additional evidence to corroborate his account of past persecution it was not unreasonable for the judge to look for corroboration from the applicant wife in particular sandie att,cir a n applicant for asylum must provide reliable evidence to corroborate testimony when it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence and there is no satisfactory explanation for its absence.it is reasonable to expect corroboration for testimony that is central to an applicant claim and easily subject to verification.citation omitted khan mukasey,cir where the alien testimony is not itself compelling the absence of easily obtainable corroborating documentation can be the final straw.the bia correctly recognized that a lack of corroborating evidence could be fatal to the applicant case.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as we explained above,this does not mean asylum applicants must provide corroborating evidence to carry their burden of proof credible testimony alone may still suffice.see aden,at.however,as the ij maintains substantial leeway to require absence of which can lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet his burden of proof applicants are well advised to provide it.see in re,at quoting in re,at see also aden,at.we also stress that corroboration may only be required where it is reasonable to expect such evidence.aden,at.ijs are not to place unreasonable demands on an asylum applicant id.
turning to the case at hand,we have little difficulty concluding that because an essential element of all asylum claims is that they be filed within year of the alien arrival in the united states,a b,an applicant date of entry is a material fact central to his claim,in re,at quoting in re,at.this is the sort of fact which is easily subject to verification,whether by some form of official documentation or by supporting documents of a more informal variety,affidavits or letters from family,friends,or traveling companions.id.travelers typically accumulate paper as they move,such as receipts from gas stations,motels,and restaurants,and often take snapshots providing dating information,and reaching a refuge from persecution might well generate a particular desire to preserve souvenirs of arrival.accordingly,it is eminently reasonable to expect an applicant to provide some corroborating evidence of his date of entry.in re,at.
this is especially true in the case at hand,where singh was explicitly informed by an immigration officer that he had failed to establish his date of entry and that his lack of corroborating documents contributed to that failure.the need for adequate documentation was further emphasized by the ij at an initial hearing,when he advised singh counsel to bring whatever documents in the original form that he has to court with him.yet in response to queries from opposing counsel during his testimony before the ij,singh admitted to having no documents to corroborate his claim that he entered this country on october,singh made the same admission to this court.
in any case,the real id act clearly states that corroborative evidence may be required,placing immigrants on notice of the consequences for failing to provide corroborative evidence.rapheal mukasey,cir.
to hold that a petitioner must receive additional notice from the ij and then an additional opportunity to provide corroborative evidence before an adverse ruling,would necessitate two first to decide whether such corroborating evidence is required and then another hearing after a recess to allow the alien more time to collect such evidence.
id.we agree with the seventh circuit that t his would add to the already overburdened resources of the department of homeland security,and such an approach would seem imprudent where the law clearly notifies aliens of the importance of corroborative evidence.id.
as singh admitted that he had no documents to corroborate his date of entry,it was his burden to provide an explanation of why he did not provide such evidence.in re,at see also id.at further,the applicant has not provided any explanation for the lack of information on these issues.aside from his bald assertion that he could not reasonably be expected to provide proof of when he entered the united states,however,the record is devoid of any indication from singh as to why he was unable to corroborate such a basic fact.contrary to his contention,t here is nothing in the nature of singh claims that would compel us to find that corroborating evidence was unavailable to him.eke mukasey,cir chhay mukasey,cir nothing offered by the petitioner compels us to conclude that she could not readily have obtained some corroborating evidence as to her claimed party membership.b no court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence unless the court finds that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.establishing one date of entry does not require,for example,corroboration from a persecutor,in re,at,or documentation from an unfriendly government,khan,at.as we discussed above,various different kinds of materials might have served as corroborating evidence of singh date of entry it was his failure to present such material or an explanation for its absence that undermined his case in the ij eyes.eke,at.
without either corroborating evidence of singh date of entry or an explanation for this deficiency,we have no choice but to conclude that the ij did not err in barring singh application as untimely 
accordingly,singh petition for review with respect to his asylum claim is 
i respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion that the board of immigration appeals bia properly interpreted and applied the appropriate corroboration provision in this case.
nirmal singh came to this country by crossing the border in a car,without inspection.so he has no airplane ticket stub or border crossing record to prove when he came.still,it was singh burden to prove,and by clear and convincing evidence,that he filed his asylum application within a year of his arrival.a b.
singh testified to a date of arrival and gave some background facts concerning his departure from india which were consistent with that date.he also introduced a document confirming that he had not left india before late august or september,thereby corroborating to some degree his arrival date but not with enough specificity to prove that the date he ostensibly filed his asylum application,october,was within a year after his arrival.
the ij understandably developed a concern that without some further corroboration there was not clear and convincing evidence of singh arrival date.but the ij never expressed that concern to singh.he did not ask singh whether he could provide further corroboration,suggest what it might be,and,if singh had no such evidence available,ask why not.it is far from obvious that any further corroboration of singh trek across the border was available someone who crosses the border illegally generates no official record of having done so,and one unfamiliar at that point with our asylum law would have no reason to keep receipts of purchases or places of accommodation.
the procedural details of the new corroboration requirements thus become critical here may the immigration judge fault an alien after the fact for failing to provide corroboration of otherwise credible testimony or does the real id act require some notice that the ij will require corroboration and an opportunity to explain why none is available if it is not my disagreement with the majority centers on these questions.
as a preliminary matter,i do not believe that b b ii applies to the filing requirement at issue in singh case.section b addresses the manner in which an asylum applicant can sustain his burden of proof to establish that he is a refugee,within the meaning of section a a.b b i.the bar,a,was adopted by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat,and is not part of the substantive definition of who qualifies as a refugee.see,d discussing the definition of refugee in a as added by the refugee act of,stat.
instead,it is c b that applies to singh claim that he satisfied the filing requirement this provision,like b b ii,was added to the immigration and nationality act by the real id act of,stat.in language similar but not identical to b b ii,c b sets the standard for sustaining an applicant burden that he has satisfie d the applicable eligibility requirements for relief or protection from removal.c a.asylum is one such form of relief from removal,and the filing requirement is an applicable eligibility requirement for relief.
so c b is the provision actually here applicable.as i note later,it differs in some ways that could possibly matter to the outcome of this case from the provision the bia applies and the majority discusses.also,the recent bia precedent on which the majority relies in the alternative dealt with b b ii,not c b.see matter of,bia.no deference based on chevron,natural resources defense council,d,can be applicable to this case unless and until the bia in a published opinion interprets the statute that does apply here.see holder,cir en banc.
i would remand to the bia for application of the correct legal provision.see azanor ashcroft,cir.
however,even applying b b ii as does the majority,i would hold that the bia did not correctly interpret and apply it to singh claim in my view,the language of the provision contemplates that an ij will perform a sequential analysis in assessing the strength of an applicant testimony,any corresponding need for corroborating evidence,and the reasons requested corroborating evidence is unavailable if it is.that sequence must proceed as follows first,the ij must determine whether an applicant testimony meets the applicant standard of proof.if not,an ij may require corroborating evidence.second,the ij must give an applicant notice of the specific facts for which further corroboration is needed.third,if no such corroboration is produced,an ij must provide the applicant an opportunity to explain on the record why this evidence is not reasonably available.see toure att y of,cir vacating and remanding a id act case where the ij did not provide an applicant with notice and an opportunity to present an explanation for the absence of corroborating evidence and the ij did not indicate she expected such evidence until her oral ruling.because the ij did not perform this analysis in singh case,i respectfully dissent.
the majority treats b b ii as permitting an ij to require corroborating evidence without making such a threshold determination and,apparently,to do so with only the broadest of notice and without inviting an opportunity to explain why additional corroboration is unavailable.the majority reaches this interpretation of the statute by assuming,without deciding,that the statute is ambiguous,and holding that if it is,we must grant chevron deference to the bia interpretation of this provision,announced in matter of,bia.see op.at chevron,at.matter of,the majority says,precludes my sequential reading of b b ii because it made clear that the real id act codified the corroboration rule of matter of,bia.see op.at.under the corroboration rule,in the majority view,applicants should expect that their failure to produce corroboration satisfactory to the ij for any fact on which they rely in their application or their testimony could be grounds for denial of asylum.
as i discuss below,the plain language of the provision compels a conclusion opposite to that of the majority.in the alternative,any ambiguity in the statutory language must be read in light of due process concerns,precluding chevron deference to the bia as to the procedural questions.moreover,neither matter of matter of controls the question whether an ij must provide notice to an applicant of which portions of his application require corroboration and an opportunity to explain the absence of such evidence.as a result,even to the limited extent that b b ii admits of ambiguity,granting chevron deference to these precedential bia decisions is of no assistance in resolving the question before us.
the language of b b ii provides in full 
ii sustaining burden 
the testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant burden without corroboration,but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant testimony is credible,is persuasive,and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.in determining whether the applicant has met the applicant burden,the trier of fact may weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record.where the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony,such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and can not reasonably obtain the evidence.
our circuit interpreted this provision in aden holder,cir.aden left open the question whether b b ii required notice of an applicant need for corroboration and time to provide it,as the ij in that case did continue the proceedings after identifying for the petitioner the fact for which he would require corroboration.id.at.moreover,aden did not examine whether an ij is required to develop the record and enunciate his reasoning with respect to why desired corroborating evidence is reasonably available.see id.at.
i therefore turn directly to the language of the statute.contrary to the majority conclusion,the relevant language clearly establishes a sequential process first,an ij is to determin e whether the applicant has met the applicant burden and in doing so may weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record.where which in this context is equivalent to if or when,see bryan garner,a dictionary of modern legal usage ed the ij in conducting this weighing is not fully persuaded by the applicant otherwise credible testimony,he may determine that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates the testimony.emphasis added.the statute does not use the term should have provided,in the present perfect tense,which would signal that the applicant could be faulted after the fact for not having provided corroboration.see united states wilson,d congress use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes.use of the word should thus expresses an imperative upon the applicant to provide further corroboration to meet the applicant burden once the ij identifies areas where additional corroboration is needed.moreover,necessarily implicit in the should construction is notice to the applicant of the ij determination.
the statutory language then continues in this vein,requiring that if the ij determines that the applicant should provide corroborating evidence,then such evidence must be provided emphasis added.again,and critically,must be provided is conditional on the ij determination that corroborating evidence should be provided it therefore speaks to the future,seen from the perspective of the time the ij identifies the need for additional evidence,not the past.the statute does not use must have been provided or some other backward looking formulation.and again,the must be provided locution signals a requirement that the applicant be informed of what is required.
finally,the statute provides an exception the applicant need not produce evidence corroborating otherwise credible evidence if the applicant does not have the evidence and can not reasonably obtain it.this exception follows the must be provided language,and is stated,again,in the present and future tenses,not the past tense.so the statute contemplates a sequence in which the ij first decides whether the applicant should provide corroboration,and the applicant then has an opportunity,if he does not provide it,to explain that he then does not have it and can not not was unable to reasonably obtain it.the can not reasonably obtain it phrase is,once again,necessarily.why would it matter whether the applicant can the information unless he is to be given the chance to obtain it so in this respect as well the language suggests a sequential process in which an applicant is to be given an opportunity to comply rather than and without not bringing forward additional evidence he was never told was needed.
my plain reading of b b ii would not require the ij to hold two hearings.see op.at quoting rapheal mukasey,cir.rather,the sequential analysis would be a procedural protection,requiring an ij to make a threshold determination that an applicant otherwise credible testimony can not alone meet his burden before the ij imposes further corroboration requirements.the majority need for such evidence is generally foreseeable,most applicants will likely have sought such corroboration before the hearing.so,once corroboration is required,an applicant will most often explain then and there why such evidence is unavailable,rather than seeking a continuance.in other cases,an applicant may request a continuance once he is on notice that a certain type of corroboration,unexpected before his hearing,will be required.that possibility is one that the majority concedes under its reading of the statute.see op.at 
thus,neither the majority interpretation of b b ii nor my own would automatically either require or foreclose a second hearing.
as i recount above,in my view the language of b b ii is absolutely clear as to the sequential analysis in which an ij must engage.it is not as clear in requiring notice to the alien and an opportunity to explain the absence of,as i have explained,those requirements are necessarily implicit in the sequence set out.but even were i to agree that the majority alternative reading of b b ii as excluding notice and opportunity to explain requirements is a plausible interpretation of an ambiguous statute,i could not so conclude in the face of the due process concerns that interpretation creates.i would instead apply the canon of constitutional avoidance,which offers an alternative route to my reading of the provision and eliminates any concern about deference to the bia case,as i discuss below,is not contrary to my interpretation anyway.
real id changed the standards governing application for asylum but did not affect the vitality of our fifth amendment due process case law.that law requires a full and fair hearing in deportation proceedings,cir.as a result,to the extent congress intent in drafting b b ii is not quite clear,we are governed by the canon of constitutional avoidance,which requires a statute to be construed so as to avoid serious doubts as to the constitutionality of an alternate construction.nadarajah gonzales,cir.applying this tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a statutory text,which rest s on the reasonable presumption that congress did not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts,clark martinez,reinforces my conclusion that the real id act requires notice to the applicant that the ij is requiring evidence corroborating his credible testimony and,if the applicant does not provide the requested evidence,an opportunity to explain why he does not have it and can not obtain it.
we have found a due process violation where the bia did not tell an alien that his credibility was questionable,or that any discrepancies appeared to exist nor ask him to explain any such perceived discrepancies before making an adverse credibility finding,at see also abovian,cir.moreover,due process requires
