moussa diallo petitions for review of the march,order of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal from the denial by an immigration judge ij of his applications for asylum in the united states and withholding of deportation to mauritania specifically,diallo argues that the bia erred by requiring him to corroborate his allegedly credible testimony with specific documentary support and then determining,based on his failure to provide this corroboration,that he had failed to meet his burden of proof.in opposition,respondent immigration and naturalization service ins contends that the bia applied the proper standard in assessing diallo claims and that substantial evidence supports the bia ultimate decision to deny his applications.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the bia has articulated an appropriate standard concerning corroboration in asylum and withholding of deportation cases but that it erred in several fundamental ways in applying that standard to the facts of this case.therefore,we grant the petition for review,vacate the bia order,and remand with specific guidance as to how the bia should approach questions of credibility and corroboration to avoid repeating these errors on remand here and in subsequent cases.
background 
in february,diallo illegally entered the united states.in october,he applied for asylum and withholding of deportation under former sections and h of the immigration and nationality act ina,a amended,h repealed based on his past persecution and fear of future persecution in his native country of mauritania.in december,the ins charged diallo with unlawful entry without inspection and referred him to the immigration courts for a hearing.
at his june deportation hearing,diallo put before the ij materials from various sources,including the state department.according to these materials,the government of mauritania engaged in massive human rights abuses against its black citizens between and.the government expelled about blacks from the in many cases that they were forced many of them into refugee camps in neighboring senegal.frequently,the deportations were preceded by destruction of proof of citizenship and expropriation of property,and often accompanied by mass arrests,torture,and executions.
in addition to introducing the above materials in support of his applications,diallo testified at the hearing.he described the conditions in mauritania and his own experience in considerable detail.specifically,he testified that he lived with his wife,parents,and siblings in nouadhibou until june,when several soldiers came to their home,tore up their identity papers,and forced the other members of his family to cross the nearby river into senegal.diallo alone was taken to a nearby village within mauritania,where he was held prisoner along with other blacks and.during this time,diallo was repeatedly beaten and tortured and was required to perform forced labor.in december,diallo was taken halfway across the senegal river by boat where he was thrown into the water and ordered to swim to the other side.a senegalese fisherman rescued him and took him to the senegalese shore.diallo then walked to the united nations refugee camp in horefode,senegal,where he was reunited with his family members and wife and remained until november.after hearing reports that senegal was sending refugees back to mauritania,diallo moved to dakar,senegal capital,where he stayed for a short time earning money before traveling to the united states by boat.
on july,the ij denied diallo applications.she found that,despite providing substantial independent evidence about the persecution of black mauritanians during the period that he claimed persecution,diallo had failed to meet his burden of proof because he did not produce adequate documentary corroboration of his testimony.according to the ij,his inability or unwillingness to provide supporting documentation seriously undermine s the plausibility of his account,particularly since he has not offered specific,credible detail about the circumstances of his detention in mauritania or residence at the refugee camp 
the bia affirmed the ij decision and dismissed diallo appeal.see in re,int.bia,wl,bia lexis.the bia articulated the applicable standard that is critical to this case while an applicant credible testimony alone may be sufficient to meet his burden,where it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts pertaining to the specifics of an applicant claim,such evidence should be provided or an explanation should be given as to why such information was not presented.id.wl,bia lexis,at internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.applying this standard,the bia concluded that diallo had failed to meet his burden of proof because of the conspicuous lack of documentary evidence supporting the specifics of his testimony.id.wl,bia lexis,at.according to the bia,it was reasonable to expect diallo to corroborate certain elements of his,facts that were reasonably subject to verification and he failed to produce any such specific corroborating evidence.see id.wl,bia lexis,at.
two members of the bia dissented in separate opinions.according to chairman schmidt,diallo testimony alone was enough to meet his burden of proof because it was believable,consistent,and sufficiently detailed to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis of his alleged fear of persecution.id.wl,bia lexis,at schmidt,dissenting internal quotation marks omitted.board member rosenberg agreed that it was unreasonable to expect documentary corroboration under these circumstances and argued that,in any event,the majority erroneously ignored diallo reasonable explanations for its absence.see id.wl,bia lexis,at rosenberg,dissenting.this appeal followed.
discussion 
diallo applied both for asylum and for withholding of deportation,each of which implicates a different burden of proof.in order to demonstrate eligibility for asylum,diallo must show that he has suffered past persecution or has a fear of future persecution on the basis of race.see abankwah ins,cir a.an alien fear may be even if there is only a slight,though discernible,chance of persecution.see ins,d.once an applicant demonstrates eligibility for asylum,however,the decision whether to grant a particular application is still within the discretion of the attorney general.abankwah,at.
demonstrating eligibility for withholding of deportation requires carrying a higher burden diallo must establish a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened in a country on account of his race.id.quoting h alteration in original.however,if the applicant shows that he or she suffered persecution in the past such that his or her life or freedom was threatened,then it is presumed that his or her life or freedom would be threatened upon return unless a preponderance of the evidence establishes that conditions in the country have changed to such an extent that it is no longer more likely than not that the applicant would be so persecuted there.b.once the required showing is made,no discretion lies with the attorney general the application for withholding of deportation must be granted.see abankwah,at.
the bia concluded that diallo had failed to sustain his burden of proof with respect to either of his applications,mainly because he had presented neither specific corroborative evidence nor an adequate explanation for the absence of such evidence in addition to his detailed testimony about his experiences and general documentary evidence about conditions in his native country.we believe that the bia employed the proper standard for evaluating whether diallo had met his burden of proof but erred in several fundamental respects in applying that standard in this case.below,we discuss our reasons for accepting the bia corroboration standard,detail the flaws in the bia application of that standard,and point out what we believe to be the correct approach to questions of credibility and corroboration in this context.
in its decision,the bia articulated the following standard concerning the need for corroboration in asylum and withholding of deportation cases 
w here an alien testimony is the only evidence available,it can suffice where it is believable,consistent,and sufficiently detailed to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis of the alien alleged fear.however,the introduction of supporting evidence is not purely an option with the asylum applicant rather,corroborating evidence should be presented where available.
w here the record contains general country information,and an applicant claim relies primarily on personal experiences not reasonably subject to verification,corroborative documentary evidence of the asylum applicant particular experience is not required.however,where it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts pertaining to the specifics of an applicant claim,such evidence should be provided or an explanation should be given as to why such information was not presented.the absence of such corroboration can lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet his burden of proof.
in re,wl,bia lexis,at internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.this is an accurate statement of the standard the bia has developed in recent decisions upon which the bia has announced its intent to rely.see in re,int,wl,bia lexis,at,matter of dass,i n,wl bia matter of mogharrabi,i n,wl bia.while consistent,detailed,and credible testimony may be sufficient to carry the alien burden,evidence corroborating his story,or an explanation for its absence,may be required where it would reasonably be expected.
pursuant to chevron,natural resources defense council,d,when reviewing a determination by the bia,we accord substantial deference to the bia interpretations of the statutes and regulations that it administers.michel ins,cir.in our view,the standard developed and applied by the bia in its recent cases,including the case below,is consistent with ins regulations,international legal standards,and our precedent and therefore is entitled to deference from this court.
first,the ins regulations state that t he testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a,b.the bia interpretation of these provisions is consistent with the language and purpose of the regulations.the use of the permissive term may implies that an applicant credible testimony may not always satisfy the burden of proof.moreover,the regulations were apparently drafted to ensure that lack of corroboration would not necessarily defeat an asylum claim,see aliens and nationality asylum and withholding of deportation procedures,to be codified at various parts of proposed,not to excuse the requirement of corroboration in all cases in which an applicant testimony is credible.
second,international standards do not conflict with the bia expectation of corroborating evidence in certain cases.the handbook of the united nations high commissioner for refugees handbook notes that applicants should m ake an effort to support their statements by any available evidence and give a satisfactory explanation for any lack of evidence.office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees,handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status under the convention and the protocol relating to the status of refugees ii geneva.the handbook,however,also recognizes that applicants may not be able to support their statements by documentary or other proof and thus should be given the benefit of the doubt where their account appears credible.id.the standard applied by the bia adheres to these general parameters,which the bia has explicitly cited and relied upon.see,in re,wl,bia lexis,at.
third,the standard applied by the bia is consistent with our precedent.although we have used language that could be interpreted more broadly,see abankwah,at ins regulations do not require that credible which is consistent and corroborated by objective evidence.slattery,cir corroboration is not required under ins rules melendez united states dep t of justice,cir absent documentary proof,the applicant testimony will be enough if it is credible,persuasive,and refers to specific facts demonstrating a fear of persecution,these cases establish simply that corroboration is not always required where the applicant testimony is credible and detailed,not that corroboration can never be required under these circumstances.we have stopped short of a blanket holding that credible testimony is automatically sufficient and renders corroborating evidence prevailing standard in the ninth circuit,see ins,cir a rule that would run contrary to the permissive language of the applicable ins regulations.
accordingly,the petitioner and the amicus overstate the breadth of the regulations,international standards,and our precedent when they claim,without elaboration of the circumstances when it is so,that an alien credible testimony is sufficient to meet his or her burden of proof.rather,the appropriate formulation is that credible testimony may be enough,depending on the circumstances.
nevertheless,several fatal flaws in the bia application of this standard to the facts of this case undermine its ultimate decision and require vacatur and remand.
we review the factual findings underlying the bia determination that an alien has failed to sustain his or her burden of proof to qualify for asylum or withholding of deportation under the substantial evidence standard.see melgar de torres reno,cir.such findings must be upheld if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.a repealed.we reverse only if no reasonable could have failed to find the past persecution or fear of future persecution necessary to sustain the petitioner burden.see melgar de torres,at.
by contrast,when review involves mixed questions of law and fact,the standard of review is far less deferential.thus,when the situation presented is the bia application of legal principles to undisputed facts,rather than its underlying determination of those facts or its interpretation of its governing statutes,our review of the bia asylum and withholding of deportation determinations is de novo.singh ilchert,cir.
we see no reason to question any of the bia factual determinations here.upon de novo review of the bia application of its corroboration standard in this case,however,we conclude that its decision can not be sustained because the bia failed to rule explicitly on the credibility of diallo testimony explain why it was reasonable in this case to expect additional corroboration or assess the sufficiency of diallo explanations for the absence of corroborating evidence.we elaborate on each of these below.
first,the bia made no pronouncement on the credibility of diallo underlying testimony or of his explanations for the lack of additional corroborating evidence.it is well established that the bia attaches significant weight to the credibility of an asylum applicant.in re,int,wl,bia lexis,at.as noted above,the precedent of the bia and of this court would sustain a petition for asylum or withholding of deportation based on credible testimony alone or,by extension,credible testimony combined with convincing explanations for lack of corroboration.the bia failure to make a credibility assessment may have denied diallo the potential benefit of this rule below and frustrates appellate review on this question.
the government argues that the bia made a supportable adverse credibility finding here.we disagree.to be sure,the ij found that diallo failure to provide corroborative evidence seriously undermine s the plausibility of his account,particularly since he has not offered specific,credible detail about his experiences.the bia noted and did not disturb the ij finding.see in re,wl,bia lexis,at.
but this finding does not withstand even deferential review.on the record before us,we think the ij was plainly in error to find that diallo failed to provide specific,credible detail in his testimony.moreover,we agree with the petitioner that it is inappropriate to base a credibility determination solely on the failure to provide corroborative evidence.the prese
