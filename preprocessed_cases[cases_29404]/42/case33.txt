this court,sitting en banc in castañeda souza,cir.en banc,divided evenly over the question of whether the when released clause in c limits the scope of c.more specifically,the question was whether c categorically bars the attorney general from releasing certain aliens on bond once they have been placed in immigration custody only if she takes those aliens into immigration custody when they are released from criminal custody.castañeda,at opinion of barron,alteration in original.
the result of the castañeda deadlock was a affirmance of the district court judgments as to two specific petitioners but not necessarily of the reasoning underlying those judgments.those judgments had found unreasonable the government delay in detaining the specific petitioners at issue gordon and castañeda and had granted their individual requests for habeas relief,in the form of individualized bond hearings.see id.at gordon johnson,supp.castañeda souza,supp.
we will recapitulate only briefly the positions of the judges on each side of the castañeda divide.to reiterate,the disagreement focused on whether c bars bonded release for any alien who committed a crime described in c a d,regardless of when the alien was taken into immigration custody or for only those aliens who committed such a crime and were taken into immigration custody within some defined or reasonable period following their release from criminal custody.
judge barron,writing for himself and two other members of the en banc court,stated that congress evident intent,castañeda,at,was for the in c to refer to an alien taken into custody pursuant to the duty imposed by c as a whole rather than only to an alien described in subparagraphs a d,id.at.judge barron opinion further concluded that,at least absent an authoritative agency construction of c,the word when does set forth a time constraint on c that expires after a reasonable time.id.at.
judge kayatta,writing for himself and two other members of the en banc court,disagreed on several grounds.as a matter of statutory interpretation,his opinion maintained that a reasonable jurist c ould read the phrase as described in c as not incorporating into c the phrase when released.id.at opinion of kayatta.and even if judge barron opinion was right on that first point,judge kayatta opinion went on,it still d id not follow that the mandate of c is also contingent upon prompt compliance with the mandate of c.id.at.
while that particular issue concerning the interpretation of c was on appeal first to a panel of this court,castañeda souza,cir.withdrawn panel opinion,and then to the full en banc court the district court issued two orders.the first order,issued on march,certified the following class of present and future detainees who had committed or would commit serious crimes 
all aliens who are or will be detained in massachusetts under c,whom the government alleges to be subject to a ground of removability as described in c a d,and who were not taken into immigration custody within hours or,if a weekend or holiday intervenes,within no more than five days of release from the relevant predicate custody.
gordon johnson,emphasis added.
in the second order,issued on may,the district court further explained its reasoning on class certification,granted summary judgment to the class,and issued declaratory and injunctive relief.gordon johnson.this second order the remedial order which builds on the order is at issue in this appeal.
consistent with the order,the remedial order provided relief on a basis and established a,bright line rule as to relief,eschewing any attempt to fashion individualized relief or to permit the board of immigration appeals or the department of homeland security dhs to address the appropriate remedy.in pertinent part,the court ordered the following 
defendants shall immediately cease and desist subjecting all current and future class members that is,aliens not detained within hours of release from the relevant prior custody or if a weekend or holiday intervenes,within no more than five days to mandatory detention under c.
defendants shall immediately determine the custody of every current class member under a and timely provide a bond hearing to every class member that seeks a redetermination of his or her custody by an immigration judge pursuant to d.
defendants shall determine the custody of every future class member under a and provide a bond hearing to every class member that seeks a redetermination of his or her custody by an immigration judge pursuant to d.
we held in abeyance the government appeal of the remedial order,pending our decision in castañeda,because of the obvious relevance of each appeal to the other.the district court entered the remedial order on may,long before this court expressed its views in the en banc castañeda opinions.therein lies the rub.
the government now argues in this appeal that the remedial order is inconsistent with the opinions in castañeda,along several lines of reasoning that neither judge barron opinion nor judge kayatta opinion contemplated,bright line relief of this sort that hours,a deadline imposed by the district court,is a plainly unreasonable choice for a bright line rule,given the variety of possible reasons for dhs delay in apprehending a c eligible alien after the moment of release from criminal custody and that in any event,it is initially within the authority of dhs,and not a federal district court,to determine what constitutes a reasonable time between release from criminal custody and dhs detention the government has also argued that f and the castañeda opinions forbade the district court from issuing a injunction and thereby interfering with dhs enforcement of the statute 
the primary difficulty with the government arguments to us is that those arguments have never been presented to the district court,nor has the government asked the district court to modify the remedial injunction in light of that decision and other developments.we think it best to leave these matters for the district court to address on remand in the first instance.in reaching this conclusion,we wish to be clear that we take seriously the argument that the logic of both principal opinions in castañeda is inconsistent with the assumptions underlying the district court remedial order both as to deference to agency expertise and as to the need for individualized relief,tailored to the factual circumstances presented.
with respect to agency expertise,the supreme court has often reiterated that the views of the agencies implementing a statute constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.bragdon abbott,quoting skidmore swift,see also ins aguirre aguirre,it is clear that principles of chevron deference are applicable to this statutory scheme.citing chevron nat.res.def.council.neither of the two principal castañeda opinions abandoned that principle of deference.
in addition,neither opinion contemplated as an appropriate remedy a bright line rule,hours,fashioned judicially without any agency input.judge kayatta opinion plainly did not endorse such a rule by his reading,the government can reasonably interpret c bar to bonded release as entirely unrestricted by the when released clause of c,and so whether the attorney general complied with c mandate right away is irrelevant to the applicability of c.castañeda,at opinion of kayatta.moreover,his opinion identified numerous factors that might increase the reasonableness of a delay in taking a criminal alien into dhs custody an alien might have evaded detention and gone into hiding upon release from criminal custody,or state officials might have failed to provide federal authorities with timely and accurate information about the impending release of a c eligible alien see id.at.
nor did judge barron opinion contemplate a bright line test for the reasonableness of a gap in custody.his opinion interpreted the when released clause as imposing a limitation on the applicability of c but only a time constraint that expires after a reasonable time,not a line in the sand.id.at opinion of barron,emphasis added
