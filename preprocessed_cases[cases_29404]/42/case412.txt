background 
kozak,a russian national,was admitted to this country in as a refugee.however,after convictions for two crimes of domestic violence,kozak was subject to removal pursuant to a e i any alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of domestic violence is deportable.on july,immigration and customs enforcement ice personally served kozak with a notice to appear.the notice to appear did not set a date for kozak hearing,but rather ordered him to appear on a date to be set,at a time to be set.on january,ice sent kozak a notice stating that his hearing was set for july,at rather than personally serving kozak with this notice,ice elected to send it to him by regular mail.kozak claims that he did not receive the notice at his residence,and that as a result,he never appeared for the hearing.because kozak failed to appear,and because ice presented evidence that kozak was subject to removal,the ij entered an in absentia order of removal against him on july.
ice agents detained kozak two months later,on september.on september,kozak filed a motion to reopen his immigration proceedings,asserting that he never received notice of his hearing date.the ij denied kozak motion on october,by written order stating that kozak failed to allege any new facts that would merit the reopening of his immigration proceedings,see b a motion to reopen will not be granted unless the immigration judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing,and that in any case,the hearing notice had been mailed in accordance with ice regulations,see id.kozak appealed the ij decision to the bia,which affirmed in a per curiam order stating,in part,w e agree with the ij that respondent failed to present substantial and probative evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of proper delivery.kozak now petitions for review of the bia decision to deny his motion to reopen.
ii.discussion 
we start,as is customary,with the standard of review.this court normally reviews decisions of the bia rather than those of an ij.stroni gonzáles,cir.we examine the bia legal conclusions de novo,subject to principles of administrative deference.de massenet gonzáles,cir.we then review the bia ultimate decision to deny a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.id.
an alien who fails to appear for an immigration hearing is subject to having an order of removal entered against him in absentia.b a.however,if the alien can later prove that he did not receive notice of the hearing,he may ask for the immigration proceedings to be reopened.id.b c ii.in the instant case,kozak claims that because he did not receive notice of his hearing,he is entitled to have his proceedings reopened.the bia found that kozak failed to present substantial and probative evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of proper delivery,citing in re grijalva,and rejected his claim.
prior to the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.et,it was somewhat easier to determine whether or not an alien had received notice of a hearing because the version of the immigration and nationality act ina then in effect required that notices be served in person or sent by certified mail.see a.thus,as grijalva makes clear,receipt or constructive receipt could easily be proven by a return receipt signed by the alien or by postal service records indicating attempts to deliver the notice to the alien address.at.accordingly,an alien who wanted to prove had to overcome a strong presumption that service by certified mail was effective by present ing substantial and probative evidence such as documentary evidence from the postal service,third party affidavits,or other similar evidence demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that was not due to the respondent failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.id.at.
in,however,the iirira amended the ina so as to permit federal authorities to serve notices of hearing by regular,rather than certified,mail.stat.see also a in removal proceedings written notice shall be given through service by mail to the alien.while this may have changed the manner in which federal authorities could provide notice of a hearing to an alien,it did not purport to amend b c ii.as such,the focus of our analysis continues to be on whether the alien received the notice,rather than whether the ice provided it.see,lopes gonzáles,cir as the use of the word receive establishes,when considering the motion to reopen,the central issue no longer is whether the notice was properly mailed as it is for the purpose of initially entering the in absentia order,but rather whether the alien actually received the notice.hussain gonzales,fed.appx,cir the relevant question in deciding a motion to reopen is not notice but receipt unpublished disposition.
with this in mind,we find that the use of regular mail renders the standard in grijalva unworkable.as the fourth circuit has noted,t he type of rebuttal evidence required by grijalva,such as documentary evidence from the postal service,simply does not exist i n the common case of failed delivery through regular mail.nibagwire gonzáles,cir second alteration in original quoting ghounem ashcroft,cir it would be inconsistent with the ina to require an alien to prove with evidence that is unobtainable in the ordinary course.
we leave it to the bia to come up with a new standard to be applied to aliens who claim of notices sent by regular mail.although most mail reaches its intended destination,it is commonsensical that at least some does not.joshi ashcroft,cir most letters are delivered,but some are.in some cases,there may be evidence corroborating of a notice,such as when a person other than the alien is also an intended recipient and submits an affidavit of,see,maknojiya gonzáles,cir noting that claim of was corroborated by the fact that alien counsel also failed to receive hearing notice,or when a particularly diligent alien inquires as to when his hearing might be scheduled,see,joshi,at noting that claim of was corroborated by the fact that alien had called to inquire about status.however,in other cases,an alien may be the only person who is aware that his hearing notice did not arrive.in such a case,the only direct evidence of may be an affidavit,signed and sworn by the alien,stating that he did not receive the notice.
this is not to say that every alien who presents an affidavit of should be entitled to have his immigration proceedings reopened.as the government points out,a bare,uncorroborated,denial of receipt,even if sworn,is weak evidence.id.at.certainly the bia is entitled to tak e account of all relevant evidence surrounding the purported.lopes,at holding that the bia should have considered a variety of factors in determining the credibility of an affidavit alleging.
however,we decline to adopt the government position in this case that we should presume that every notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary showing such as the one required by grijalva.the government suggests that its position is supported by our decision in sousa ashcroft,cir.in that case,a alien claimed that he did not receive a notice to appear,and asked for his immigration proceedings to be reopened.id.at.we rejected his appeal,noting that the bia had properly determined that the alien had not submitted sufficient evidence to prove.id.
a number of significant differences make sousa inapposite here.first,kozak has submitted a sworn affidavit that he did not receive his hearing notice in sousa,the alien
