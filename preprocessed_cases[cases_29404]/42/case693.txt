background 
stephen kovacs is an australian national who became a permanent resident of the united states in.while here,kovacs founded international bullion and metal brokers,an importer and distributor of gold and metal jewelry.after kovacs company lost in a burglary,hanover insurance company dispatched a public adjustor named eliot zerring to assess the loss.zerring,who was corrupt,see chubb son kelleher,cv,wl,purportedly convinced kovacs to inflate the claim to.the claim was submitted in september and paid later that month.kovacs ultimately took of the,and zerring kept the rest.
kovacs was charged in october with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud,in violation of and.kovacs instructed his lawyer,robert fink,to negotiate a plea that would have no immigration consequences.fink advised kovacs that a conviction for misprision of felony,would not impact his immigration status.fink allegedly conveyed these immigration concerns to the government,which agreed to the misprision of felony charge.
on november,kovacs pled guilty to a single count of misprision of felony.kovacs immigration concerns were aired during the plea hearing.at the outset,fink sought to seal the minutes of the guilty plea so immigration officials could not see them.the district court warned kovacs that immigration consequences were not in its control and that it would give no such assurance.fink,however,responded that he researched it and we feel comfortable that this is not a deportable offense.special app.at,ecf transcript of plea proceeding.at the conclusion of the proceeding,fink again stated that misprision of felony is not deportable.id.at.the court accepted the plea.
kovacs was sentenced on december,to five years probation and restitution of.the district court granted a downward departure for extraordinary acceptance of responsibility in view of kovacs decision to forgo an available defense based on the statute of limitations.kovacs paid the restitution in full by august.in,the district court granted a motion to terminate kovacs probation early.
kovacs continued his regular international travel until april,when immigration officials questioned kovacs eligibility for reentry on the ground that misprision of felony is considered a crime of moral turpitude.at that point,immigration officials directed him to appear for an interview to evaluate his immigration status.kovacs discussed his options with his lawyers,but allegedly none of them advised him to seek vacatur of his conviction.
before his scheduled interview,on the advice of counsel,kovacs returned to australia,where he currently resides.his wife and children,all united states citizens,remain here.kovacs children have had to adjust their lives to carry on the family business.
kovacs alleges that,notwithstanding his efforts to seek counsel earlier,he first became aware of the possibility of coram nobis relief in october.at about that time,his counsel asked the government to negotiate an motion for a writ of error coram nobis.negotiations failed,and kovacs submitted a petition for the writ in may.the district court denied the petition on the ground that kovacs could not show prejudice within the framework established by strickland washington.because the court denied the petition on those grounds,it did not reach the merits of the government other arguments that the petition was untimely,and that kovacs could not show fink advice was objectively unreasonable at the time the conviction became final.kovacs now appeals the denial of his petition.
discussion 
a writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy,united states morgan,typically available only when habeas relief is unwarranted because the petitioner is no longer in custody.see porcelli united states,cir.we review the legal standards applied by the district court de novo.id.
a petitioner seeking coram nobis relief must demonstrate that there are circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice,sound reasons exist for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief,and the petitioner continues to suffer legal consequences from his conviction that may be remedied by granting of the writ.foont united states,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.there is no doubt that kovacs likely ineligibility to reenter the united states constitutes a continuing consequence of his conviction.the remaining questions are whether fink misadvice warrants granting the writ,and whether the petition was timely.
defendants have a sixth amendment right to counsel,a right that extends to the process.lafler cooper.thus,ineffective assistance of counsel is one ground for granting a writ of coram nobis.see chhabra united states,cir.a claim of ineffective assistance entails a showing that the defense counsel performance was objectively unreasonable and the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland,at see also hill lockhart,holding strickland test applies to guilty plea challenges bennett united states,cir.
the performance component of the strickland test asks whether a counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland,at.a defense counsel performance is unreasonable when it is so deficient that it falls outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.id.at.
as the district court observed,there is no dispute that fink misadvised kovacs regarding the immigration consequences of his plea.memorandum and order,kovacs united states,cv,at,ecf.the transcript of the plea allocution reflects repeated erroneous assurances by fink that misprision of felony was not a deportable offense.we held in united states couto,cir,that an affirmative misrepresentation of the deportation consequences of a guilty plea falls outside this range of professional competence.however,couto was decided the year after kovacs conviction became final.if kovacs had entered his plea after couto was decided,there is little doubt fink performance would be deemed unreasonable.kovacs seeks to apply couto retroactively 
the retroactive application of case law is governed by the rule set forth in teague lane,which looks to a decision novelty.if a decision announces a new rule,a person whose conviction is already final may not benefit from the decision in a habeas or similar proceeding.chaidez united states.only if the court applies a settled rule may a person avail herself of the decision on collateral review.id.a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final.teague,at emphasis in original.such a holding must have been apparent to all reasonable jurists.chaidez.at quoting lambrix singletary.
we have little trouble concluding that,by the time kovacs conviction became final,the couto rule was indicated,and was awaiting an instance in which it would be pronounced.courts had concluded similar misadvice was objectively unreasonable as far back as the our decisions reflected this trend long before kovacs conviction.see united states santelises,cir per curiam since defense counsel does not aver that he made an affirmative misrepresentation,petitioner fails to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.michel united states,cir while recognizing that deportation was a serious sanction,this court noted that there was before it no allegation of misleading by counsel.see also united states zilberov,wl,at cir unpublished summary order t rial counsel alleged warning of possible deportation may have been inaccurate a
