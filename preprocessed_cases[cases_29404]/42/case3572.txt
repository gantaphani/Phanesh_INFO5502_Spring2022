officer olson testified that immigration enforcement agents review detainees alien registration files upon their arrival to select detainees for participation in the stipulated removal program instead of scheduling an appearance before the ij.a detainee is selected for participation in stipulated removal if he or she is a citizen of mexico,has been in the united states for less than ten years,and has been charged with illegal entry into the united states.immigration enforcement agents do not read the further to determine whether detainees selected for the stipulated removal program are eligible for any relief from removal.
after detainees are selected for participation in the stipulated removal program,deportation officers typically prepare an nta and a stipulated removal form for each individual.deportation officers then gather detainees selected for the program for a group presentation.there,an immigration enforcement agent explains in spanish that a detainee has two options first,to accept stipulated removal,or second,to appear before an ij,where the detainee may ask to remain legally in the united states or seek voluntary departure.the agent also advises the group that under the stipulated removal program,a detainee can be removed that very day whereas it could take anywhere from two to three weeks or longer to appear before an ij if the detainee chooses not to sign the form.the agent then reads the text of the stipulated removal form aloud in spanish,and concludes the presentation.next,dhs deportation officers meet individually with each detainee to determine whether he or she wants to sign the stipulated removal form.deportation officers do not review the detainee at any time before or during the individual meeting.no transcriber,interpreter,or attorney is present during the detainee individual meeting with the deportation officer.

officer olson also testified that during the individual meeting,a deportation officer typically verifies the identity of the detainee and information typed on the biographical information sheet,and serves the nta on the detainee.the deportation officer then determines whether the detainee wants to sign the stipulated removal form by asking whether or not they want to have a court hearing or whether they want to be deported that day.when encountering detainees,olson asks in the spanish language a question she understands translates in english to do you want to fight your case or want to sign officer olson translated that phrase into spanish during the hearing.however,the spanish language court interpreter had difficulty comprehending the question,advising the court that the statement was nonsensical in part i would know how to translate certain parts of that.she also faulted officer olson spanish pronunciation.

in his stipulation,respondent states that he understands the consequences of his request and that he has entered his request voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently.the court finds the alien waiver to be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent the court therefore,finds upon review of the charging document and the written stipulation that he is removable based upon clear and convincing evidence in the form of his own admissions.respondent makes no application for relief from removal but instead requests an order removing him from this country as soon as possible.

following his november arrest,ramos was indicted by a grand jury for violation of.ramos pled not guilty,and filed the motion to dismiss the indictment now on appeal.denying this motion,the district court first concluded that ramos stipulated removal order was valid under united states,cir,placing the burden of proof to show an invalid waiver upon ramos.although the district court found some flaws in the stipulated removal proceedings,it concluded that ramos failed to meet his burden of proof because officer olson would have not signed the stipulated removal form if she had any doubts as to ramos understanding of the rights he was relinquishing.alternatively,the court found no showing of prejudice because ramos was not,as he claimed,eligible for relief under the immigration and nationality act ina h,h.following a bench trial,the district court found ramos guilty of violating.

iii.discussion 
validity of waiver of appeal

a valid waiver of the right to appeal must be both considered and intelligent.arrieta,at quoti
