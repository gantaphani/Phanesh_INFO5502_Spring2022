tatiana fedosseeva claims that she is stateless and thus entitled to asylum in the united states.born and raised in russia during the soviet era,she moved to latvia as an adult and stayed there after the soviet union dissolved.she argues that she is stateless because in she used her soviet passport to depart latvia for the united states without acquiring citizenship in either latvia or russia.an immigration judge ij denied fedosseeva request for asylum and withholding of removal the ij found her not credible and held that she failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution.the ij ordered fedosseeva removed to latvia or,alternatively,to russia,see c,and the board of immigration appeals affirmed the ij decision.for the following reasons,we deny her petition for review.
background 
fedosseeva entered the united states as a visitor for pleasure and was authorized to stay until march.she overstayed her visa,however,and in applied for asylum and withholding of removal.because fedosseeva initial application is not included in the record,we do not know why she first sought asylum.in,she amended her application to claim asylum,not on any of the statutory grounds,see a a,but because she purportedly can not return to latvia or russia,and thus is stateless.fedosseeva asserted that she could not return to russia because she never became a russian citizen after the collapse of the soviet union,and that she could not return to latvia because she no longer had a residence permit.
fedosseeva attached a translated statement to her amended application,noting that she is not fluent in english.in her application,fedosseeva stated that she moved with her husband from russia to latvia in and remained there with her daughter after the couple divorced.she found employment at a hotel that served many russians and eventually was promoted to a management position.around,when latvia began moving towards liberation from the soviet union,native latvians became hostile towards ethnic russians.fedosseeva said that in april,an employee boyfriend,who was a member of the zemessardze,a volunteer organization of military reservists similar to a national guard,threatened and assaulted her because she had disciplined the employee.fedosseeva suffered a nervous breakdown and a broken wrist as a result of the altercation.fedosseeva also described a second beating two years later by three men,one dressed as a police officer,who repeatedly kicked her until a nearby bus driver intervened.approximately a month after the second attack,latvian police shut off the electricity,gas,and water to her apartment building,and when she tried to turn the gas back on,the police arrested her and fined her the equivalent of for resisting authority.
in her statement,fedosseeva also wrote that in,a group of latvian teenagers harassed and beat her daughter because she is russian,that the police took no action to assist,and that a latvian doctor refused to treat her.fedosseeva eventually decided to leave her daughter with her mother in the republic of chechnya in the russian federation so she could seek asylum in the united states.at her hearing,fedosseeva said that her daughter gained citizenship in russia because she was a minor before the collapse of the soviet union.by contrast,fedosseeva was not eligible for russian citizenship because she was not a minor and was not residing in russia during the fall of the soviet union.
in,fedosseeva hired a new lawyer and filed a third supplemental application,attaching a new sworn statement in english.on this asylum application fedosseeva marked that she is fluent in english.this application said that fedosseeva moved to latvia from russia when she was very young because her father was stationed in the soviet military there.she said that,since the fall of the soviet union,sentiment in latvia against soviet military families had grown.she stated that she was married in latvia but stayed behind with their daughter when her husband emigrated to germany because her father would not let her leave.she also wrote that when she was a manager at the hotel she was attacked by some members of the latvian home the boyfriend of the employee she described she tried to fire a couple of latvian employees.she explained that on march,she was jumped by three men one was dressed as a latvian police officer,who beat and kicked her.she attached a transcript of a medical record that stated that she was hospitalized for a week beginning march.she then described an event in which the government shut off the utilities to her building.she defied the government by turning the utilities back on and trying to block officials from coming near,but was subsequently arrested,detained for six hours,and fined the equivalent of.
in march,fedosseeva appeared with counsel at her asylum hearing.though her counsel said at an earlier hearing that fedosseeva spoke english,she used a translator at the asylum hearing.fedosseeva conceded removability,but refused to designate a country of removal because she claimed to be stateless.as the only witness at the hearing,fedosseeva said that she would not seek asylum from russia because she believed that russia would not accept her given that she is not a citizen.she testified that she was not a russian citizen because only people residing in russia at the time of the fall of the soviet union automatically became citizens.she said that she came to the united states using a soviet passport that was issued in latvia in,but she did not explain why latvia was issuing soviet passports two years after the collapse of the soviet union.she with her first sworn statement but not her she moved to latvia in with her daughter and husband for his job.she also said that latvian residency laws and her father connection to the soviet military prevented her from becoming a latvian citizen.fedosseeva offered no documentary evidence about the residency or citizenship criteria for either russia or latvia.
fedosseeva also testified that she feared for her life if returned to latvia because she is an ethnic russian,and she had several unpleasant incidents when she last lived there in the early.she described one such incident that she said took place in when several men wearing latvian home guard uniforms approached her and one of them struck her.she testified that she fell and hit her head,but that because she is russian,when an ambulance arrived the medics refused to do anything more than bandage her shoulder.she said that because the medics in the ambulance did not really help,she was forced to get treatment in a nearby militia station with medical facilities.contrary to her written statement and supporting documents,she testified that she was never hospitalized and returned home after a few hours of treatment.when confronted with her inconsistent statements and supporting documents,she said that she was confused and that maybe the medical reports were for her daughter.however,the medical records listed fedosseeva name.
fedosseeva testified about several other incidents.specifically,she testified that in or the gas,electricity,and water were turned off in her apartment building because,she asserts,the latvian government did not like that russians lived there.she said that she turned the gas and electricity back on and guarded the gas pipe with a dog,and had a very unpleasant dispute with the police.she said that the police arrested her and fined her the equivalent of.fedosseeva next testified that she was fired from her job at the hotel because she was not fluent in latvian and because her father was in the soviet military.the government pointed out,however,that she submitted written documents stating that she consented to being laid off.she did not mention the assault at the hotel that she had described in her earlier applications.
after the hearing,the ij found fedosseeva testimony not credible,reasoning that it was not sufficiently detailed,internally inconsistent,and inconsistent with the facts she set forth in her first application.the ij noted fedosseeva inability to identify consistently when the key events she recounted took place.the ij also mentione
