opinion of the court 
luckson augustin petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia concluding that he is removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal.we are called upon to decide whether the bia erred in refusing to impute to petitioner his father years of continuous residence in order to meet the requirement for cancellation of removal.
petitioner luckson augustin,born on august,is a native and citizen of haiti.he was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident lpr on february,at the age of thirteen.
the department of homeland security dhs commenced removal proceedings against petitioner with a notice to appear dated november,charging him as removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.see a a iii.the notice alleged that petitioner had been convicted of eluding police in new jersey and had been sentenced to three years imprisonment on august.
on march,dhs filed an form withdrawing the aggravated felony charge and replacing it with charges that petitioner was removable on two other grounds that he had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude,and that he had been convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm.see a a ii,a c.in support,dhs made additional allegations that petitioner had been convicted in new jersey superior court on december,of receiving stolen property and,on december,of unlawful possession of a handgun 
at a hearing before an immigration judge ij on april,petitioner,represented by counsel,admitted the government allegations.
as evidence of petitioner convictions,the government initially submitted the judgments of conviction for the weapon and eluding police charges,but submitted only the criminal complaint for the receiving stolen property charge.upon the ij objection that he needed the judgment of conviction for the receiving stolen property charge,the government submitted in addition petitioner new jersey rap sheet listing all of his new jersey convictions.the rap sheet indicates that petitioner was arrested for receiving stolen property on march,found guilty on december,sentenced on march,and resentenced on april.
at a hearing on may,the ij,at petitioner urging,granted petitioner counsel motion to withdraw from the case.petitioner then argued that he was eligible for cancellation of removal despite having committed a crime of moral turpitude in,because he did not become removable until being convicted of the gun charge in or his second crime involving moral turpitude in than seven years after his admission as an lpr.a providing that an lpr is eligible for cancellation of removal only after seven years of continuous residence and five years as an lpr.the government responded that the commission of a single crime involving moral turpitude stops the clock accruing time toward the continuous residency requirement,regardless of the existence of a second crime involving moral turpitude rendering the alien removable.see d.the ij pretermitted petitioner application for cancellation of removal.
at a subsequent hearing on petitioner application for relief under the convention against torture cat on june,the ij heard petitioner testimony regarding his fear of returning to haiti and received country reports in support of petitioner application for cat relief.petitioner testified that both of his parents were citizens,his mother having moved to the united states in and his father in.he testified that his father,prior to obtaining citizenship,had been an lpr starting in.he further testified that his parents sponsored him for lpr status,and that he obtained lpr status upon his admission to the united states on february.in an oral decision,the ij found petitioner testimony credible,but denied his cat claim.
on appeal to the bia,petitioner,represented by counsel,raised various arguments,including those he raises again on appeal that the ij erred in finding him ineligible for cancellation of removal because a minor alien can count his parents years as an lpr toward the statute residency requirement and that petitioner conviction for receiving stolen property which cut off his accrual of time toward the requirement does not qualify as a conviction for the purpose of removal because petitioner was sentenced under a diversion program.on october,the bia affirmed the ij in a opinion.
we have jurisdiction over the legal question raised by petitioner regarding his eligibility for cancellation of removal pursuant to congress grant of jurisdiction in a.
we do not,however,have jurisdiction to consider whether the bia erred in finding petitioner removable on the basis of his conviction for receiving stolen property,because the question is moot.the ij held and bia affirmed that petitioner was also removable as charged with having been convicted of a firearm offense.because petitioner does not challenge that ground of removal,his order of removal will stand without regard to whether the stolen property conviction properly qualifies as a ground of removal 
we review legal questions de novo,but defer to the bia reasonable interpretations of statutes it is charged with administering,cir citing ins,d chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
the question before the court is whether the bia erred in refusing to impute to an alien who entered the united states as a minor the alien parent years of continuous residence in order to meet the requirement for cancellation of removal.
the immigration and nationality act ina,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,pub,div.c,stat,provides that,for permanent residents,t he attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,
has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and 
has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
a.under the ina,admission and admitted mean,with respect to an alien,the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.id.a.the ina defines residence as the place of general abode the place of general abode of a person means his principal,actual dwelling place in fact,without regard to intent.id.a.the statute further provides that an alien period of continuous residence for the purpose of meeting the residency requirement ends upon the issuance of a notice to appear or upon the commission of a crime that would render the alien inadmissible.id.d.
the bia interpretation of the ina in an opinion dismissing an alien appeal is entitled to chevron deference.see sun wen chen,cir.under chevron,in reviewing an agency construction of a statute administered by the agency,the court ask s first if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue of law in the case,using traditional tools of statutory construction to determine whether congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.id.quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if congress intention is not evident,the court move s to the second step,where the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.when congress has left a gap in a statute,implicitly leaving the administering agency responsible for filling that gap,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.id.quoting chevron,at.
according to petitioner testimony,which was uncontradicted and which the ij accepted,petitioner was admitted to the united states as an lpr in,at the age of thirteen.in immigrating to the united states,he joined his parents his father had obtained lpr status in,and both his parents were eventually naturalized as citizens.petitioner commission of a crime involving moral turpitude in cut off his accrual of years of continuous residence for the purpose of becoming eligible for cancellation of removal.petitioner contends that,because he was a minor when he was first admitted to the united states in,h
