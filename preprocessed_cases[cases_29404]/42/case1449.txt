introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on he chun chen petition for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal from an order of an immigration judge ij denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal or in the alternative for protection under the convention against torture.inasmuch as we find that substantial evidence in the record supports the findings of both the ij and the bia,we will deny the petition.
ii.factual and procedural history 
chen,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,arrived in the united states at los angeles international airport on december,and applied for admission without valid entry documents.on february,the immigration and naturalization service ins,whose functions since have been transferred to the department of homeland security,initiated removal proceedings against chen by serving him with a notice to appear.at a hearing before an ij in which he was represented by counsel,chen conceded removability but indicated that he intended to seek political asylum,withholding of deportation,and protection under the convention against torture.chen predicates his claims on allegations that chinese authorities forced his wife to terminate two pregnancies and caused her to be sterilized forcibly in accordance with the coercive family planning practices of the chinese government.he also alleges that the chinese authorities ransacked and closed his bookstore because he sold falun gong literature.
in recognition of the circumstance that the ij and the bia premised their denial of his application on chen lack of credibility,we will recount his testimony in detail.chen testified at an october,hearing before the ij that he is from fuzhou city in the fujian province of china,where he graduated from high school in.from through chen worked in construction and in he opened a bookstore.chen married ha yun ni on october,who,on august,gave birth to a daughter.one month later the government family planning authorities took his wife to guan tou hospital for insertion of an intrauterine device iud to prevent pregnancy.according to chen,the family planning regulations required the insertion of an iud after the birth of a child but,after four years,permit a family to request permission to have another child.
chen testified that the iud must have failed because in early his wife discovered that she was pregnant.according to chen,the family planning authorities required his wife once every three months to go for inspections to check on her iud and ensure that she was not pregnant.when chen wife did not go for the scheduled inspection of her iud by the authorities,they came on april,to the family home to find her.at that time chen was at his bookstore.when he returned home that night his wife told him that the authorities had taken her to lian jiang hospital and forced her to undergo an abortion against her will.chen said that while his wife did not tell him about the procedure in detail,she did mention that she was given a shot.on the same day as the abortion the authorities also forced her to have another iud inserted.
chen testified that in he petitioned for permission to have a second child.the authorities denied this request,citing the earlier violation of the family planning policy.unbeknownst to the chinese government,he and his wife then decided to elicit the assistance of a private physician to remove the iud,and in april chen wife had the iud removed.one month later in may chen wife discovered that she was pregnant again.when the authorities notified her that it was time for an inspection of the iud in july,chen wife went into hiding at her parents house in guan tou.on august,the authorities found chen wife at her parents home and took her to lian jiang hospital for another forced abortion.as with the first abortion,chen wife was given a shot.the authorities also inserted another iud on the same day.the following year chen again submitted a request to the chinese government to have another child but this time the authorities granted the request.in october chen wife discovered that she was pregnant.
chen also testified before the ij that he sold falun gong books by li hong zhi in his bookstore from april through april,when the chinese government destroyed and closed the store.government cadres came to his store and notified him that he no longer could sell falun gong books.according to chen,the government officials explained that falun gong was an evil religion.nevertheless,even though he was warned not to sell the falun gong books,chen continued to do so because it was profitable.chen testified that he received a second warning that he should cease all sales of falun gong materials.chen,however,informed an immigration officer in california in february that the chinese government gave him a warning about selling falun gong books.ar at.
chen testified that he was not a member of falun gong,but only sold its books,though at the airport interview conducted on the day of his arrival in the united states,chen told an immigration official that he was a practitioner of falun gong.when asked by the ij why he made this statement even though it was not true,chen responded that t he smuggler taught me to say that,they said that i have to say that.they said,they told me not to say anything else,just say i am a falun gong follower.ar at.chen,however,never mentioned anything at his airport interview about his family difficulties with the family planning policies in china.
chen testified that when he refused to heed the cadres warnings,the chinese authorities in may confiscated his books,destroyed the bookstore,and closed it down.chen then went into hiding.he testified that he stayed with an uncle in changle city until november,though in an earlier interview with united states immigration authorities chen stated that he stayed with a relative until september.when confronted with this inconsistency during the immigration hearing chen responded m aybe i made a mistake ar at.
two months later on december,chen left china with the assistance of snakeheads.chen traveled to hong kong,then to jakarta,indonesia,on to malaysia and finally to los angeles.chen testified that he left china because he knew that if his wife gave birth to a son,she definitely would be sterilized.he explained that his wife did not come to the united states because she was pregnant and not feeling well.
on july,chen wife gave birth to a son.two months later,on september,the chinese authorities sterilized his wife.inasmuch as chen was in the united states when his wife was sterilized,he obtained the information that he provided at the hearing about the sterilization from her.in this regard the ij questioned chen why his wife would be sterilized inasmuch as he was already in the united states and therefore there seemed little risk of pregnancy.chen responded that t hey do care,as long as you gave birth to two,two children,and then they do care,either the male or the female must be sterilized.ar at.
according to chen,his wife stayed at her mother home after he left china,but she had to return to their home because it was the anniversary of the death of chen mother.chen testified that the authorities found his wife at their home and brought her to mawei hospital for the sterilization.a letter submitted by chen from his wife states,however,that the family planning officials found her at her parents home and took her for the sterilization from there.
chen testified that he was applying for political asylum because he violated china family planning policies and sold falun gong books in his bookstore.he indicated that he feared returning to china because he might be sterilized.when the ij asked why the authorities would sterilize him inasmuch as his wife already had been sterilized,he stated that he would not be sterilized and had made a mistake.ar at.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij issued an oral decision denying chen relief.in particular,the ij found that chen failed to establish a fear of persecution,a necessary showing for him to be eligible for asylum.therefore,the ij found that it was not necessary to consider whether chen was eligible for relief as a matter of discretion.the ij also denied chen application for withholding of removal and found that chen had not shown that more likely than not he would be tortured if he returned to china,and,accordingly,he did not merit protection under the convention against torture.
in reaching his conclusions,the ij found that chen testimony lacked credibility in several respects.first,the ij explained that he found chen testimony that on two occasions his wife had an iud inserted on the same day she had an abortion as not only incredible but also implausible.the ij reasoned that due to the physical trauma of an abortion,the court finds that it is unlikely and most likely physically impossible to insert an iud in an individual who has earlier that day suffered an abortion.ar at.
moreover,the ij questioned chen testimony regarding his wife sterilization.he stated that t his line of testimony again is not credible to the court and the court does not understand why the authorities would wish to sterilize the respondent wife since the respondent,himself,was in the united states.ar at.in addition,the ij identified an inconsistency in chen recounting of his wife sterilization.chen testified that the authorities found his wife at their home,while chen wife letter indicated that the authorities located her at her parents home.the ij also pointed out that chen contradicted himself during his testimony regarding his fear of sterilization.thus,while chen first testified that he feared that if he returned to china he would be sterilized,when the ij asked why the authorities would sterilize him inasmuch as they already had his wife sterilized,he responded that he would not be sterilized and had made a mistake.
the ij also questioned chen testimony as to the timing of his departure from china.chen testified that he left china after he and his wife had received permission to have a second child and while his wife was pregnant.the ij stated 
it makes absolutely no sense to the court that if the respondent and his wife were granted permission to have another child,that the government would be considering sterilizing either the respondent or his wife.thus,it makes absolutely no sense to the court and it is implausible testimony that the respondent would wish to leave china due to the family planning policy after he had received permission to have this second child.
ar at.the ij also pointed to the discrepancy in chen testimony regarding the length of time he stayed at his uncle home in changle city while he was in hiding prior to leaving for the united states.at the hearing chen testified that he lived with his uncle until november while he previously had informed an immigration official that he stayed with a relative only until september.
the ij also indicated that chen testimony relating to his bookstore lacked credibility.chen testified that government officials warned him twice that he should discontinue selling falun gong books.however,the ij pointed out that at an earlier interview with an immigration official chen stated that he only had been given a warning.
furthermore,the ij emphasized that while chen testified that he was not a member of falun gong,at his airport interview he informed the immigration officer that he was in fact a member.chen explained during his testimony that the smugglers had told him to say this.the ij also noted that chen never mentioned anything during his airport interview about any difficulties his family had with china family planning policies.the ij explained that chen was alone with the immigration official at the airport,and,therefore,n otwithstanding what the snakeheads had told him to say,i see no reason why the respondent would not tell the inspector the truth,and why his testimony would not coincide with the testimony given to the court today,specifically concerning the problems that his wife has experienced.ar at.
overall,after considering the entire record before him,the ij concluded that chen had not established,due to his lack of credibility a fear of persecution if he were returned to china.accordingly,his application for asylum will be denied.ar at.the ij also denied chen application for withholding of removal and for protection under the convention against torture.thus,the ij entered orders denying chen any relief.
chen appealed from this disposition to the bia.on april,the bia issued its decision dismissing chen appeal.in support of its decision,the bia cited the numerous inconsistencies pointed out by the ij.the bia noted the discrepancy between chen wife account of where she had been when she was taken for sterilization and chen testimony before the ij.the bia further found that chen failed to sustain his burden of proof in showing that his wife was subjected to two forced abortions.while it recognized that chen submitted two abortion certificates,it questioned their validity,citing the department of state country report which states that such purported certificates,if they exist at all,may be documents issued to women who voluntarily submit to an abortion and are entitled to the resulting benefits.ar at.the bia also explained that chen had failed to prove a fear of persecution on account of china coercive family practices because he recognized that he would not face sterilization if he returned to china.
the bia found that the record supported an adverse credibility determination as to chen claim related to his sale of falun gong books.it pointed to the discrepancy in chen account as to how many times he was warned to stop selling the books prior to the chinese officials closing down his shop.ar at.the bia further cited the false story that chen gave at the airport that he was a follower of falun gong.it noted that chen did not support this aspect of his claim with objective evidence that a bookstore owner may have acquired over the years to corroborate his claim that he owned a bookstore and that the bookstore was closed.ar at.the bia concluded that f or those reasons and others cited in the immigration judge decision,the immigration judge correctly denied the respondent application for asylum and withholding of removal.ar at.the bia also upheld the ij determination with respect to chen application for protection under the convention against torture.consequently,it dismissed his appeal.
chen timely filed this petition for review,limiting his arguments to his asylum and withholding of removal claims,thus abandoning his claim for protection under the convention against torture.
iii.jurisdiction and scope of and standard of review 
the bia had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to b,now b,which grants it appellate jurisdiction over decisions of immigration judges in removal cases.we have exclusive jurisdiction under section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a,to review final orders of removal.
we review adverse credibility determinations for substantial evidence.balasubramanrim ins,cir.under this deferential standard of review,we must uphold the credibility determination of the bia or ij unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.accordingly,we are required to sustain an adverse credibility determination unless no reasonable person would have found the applicant incredible.see concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension trust for,d.for chen to prevail,the evidence of credibility must be so strong in his favor that in a civil trial he would be entitled to judgment on the credibility issue as a matter of law.see ins,d holding that the bia decision can be reversed only where the petitioner evidence compels a reasonable factfinder to find in his or her favor.however,adverse credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record,are reversible.dia ashcroft,en banc quoting gao ashcroft,cir.
