in this appeal,we are asked to interpret the united states sentencing guidelines a.the united states sentencing commission the commission has authority to define the terms in the sentencing guidelines.see p.however,until it does,we consider the context and purpose of the sentencing guidelines as a whole in interpreting them.dolan postal.in sentencing guidelines a,we interpret the term arrest to require that the individual be formally arrested the mere issuance of a citation,even if considered an arrest under state law,is insufficient.therefore,we vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing.
at all times relevant to this case,israel leal felix was a citizen of mexico and an alien,as defined by united states immigration law.on april,leal felix was charged with violating a and b,because he was found in the united states after having been removed or deported from the united states and without permission to reapply for admission following removal or deportation.in the charging information,the government alleged that the previous removal or deportation occurred after a conviction for an aggravated felony.
leal felix entered into a binding plea agreement with the government.the plea agreement required that,in exchange for the entry of a guilty plea by leal felix,the government would recommend that he be sentenced at the lower end of the applicable guidelines range,as determined by a total offense level of nine.both parties waived their right to appeal the sentence,provided that the district court imposed a sentence in accordance with the plea agreement.however,leal felix reserved the right to appeal the calculation of his criminal history category.
relevant to this appeal,leal felix criminal history included two citations for driving with a suspended license.the citations were received on november,and november,the november citations leal felix was sentenced for both citations on january,receiving concurrent sentences of months probation on the condition that he serve days in the county jail.
on june,leal felix entered his plea of guilty in the present case,pursuant to the plea agreement.the psr calculated that leal felix was in criminal history category vi with criminal history points,including two points for each of the november citations.leal felix objected to counting the second citation separately under sentencing guidelines a,because the two violations were sentenced on the same day and were not separated by an intervening arrest.
at the sentencing hearing,leal felix argued that the second violation should not be counted in the criminal history,because he had not been arrested for the first violation,but only cited.the district court disagreed.the court held that a citation for a traffic violation was the same as an arrest under a,meaning that the first citation was an intervening arrest.using this interpretation,the court calculated that leal felix had criminal history points,placing him in criminal history category vi.in accordance with the plea agreement,the district court sentenced leal felix to months the low end of the guidelines range for category vi on august.
procedural history 
leal felix timely appealed his sentence on august.a divided panel affirmed on november.the majority concluded we agree with the seventh circuit in united states morgan,cir that treatment of leal felix traffic violations as arrests comports with the sentencing guidelines.united states leal felix,cir.we granted leal felix petition for review en banc on april.united states leal felix,cir.
the applicable guidelines sentencing range is determined by both the calculated offense level and the criminal history category.prior sentences are counted in determining the criminal history category,but may be counted separately or as a single sentence,depending in part on whether there was an intervening arrest.a.
if the defendant has multiple prior sentences,determine whether those sentences are counted separately or as a single sentence.prior sentences always are counted separately if the sentences were imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest,the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense.if there is no intervening arrest,prior sentences are counted separately unless a the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument or b the sentences were imposed on the same day.count any prior sentence covered by a or b as a single sentence.see also e.
id.the definition of an intervening arrest is the subject of our interpretation here.under this guideline,if a citation is equivalent to an arrest,then leal felix two citations for driving with a suspended license must be counted separately.counting each citation as an arrest,and adding two points for each,would place him in criminal history category vi,with a guidelines range of months.however,if a citation is not an intervening arrest,his citations would be counted together and he would be included in criminal history category v,with a guidelines range of months.
we review de novo the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines because it is a pure question of law.united states laurienti,cir,cert.denied.
the sentencing guidelines do not define the term arrest in the context of a.although the commission may define any terms used in the guidelines,see united states labonte,it has not defined arrest.because the commission has not defined the term,we must interpret this provision in order to resolve the present appeal.if,after applying the normal rules of statutory interpretation,the sentencing guideline is still ambiguous,the rule of lenity requires us to interpret the guideline in favor of leal felix.see depierre united states.
to begin,we may not rely on california law to define an arrest.although california may consider a citation the equivalent of an arrest,see code,we do not look to state law to determine the meaning of the sentencing guidelines.a federal sentencing enhancement provision is interpreted according to a uniform,national definition,not dependent upon the vagaries of state law.united states martinez,cir citing taylor united states.in taylor,the supreme court refused to define predicate offenses using state law,holding that the same conduct could not result in a sentencing enhancement in california,but not in michigan,depending solely on how the state defined the offense.at.similarly,in this case,what constitutes an arrest can not vary between states based on state law,but must have a uniform,national definition.see martinez,at.
for the purpose of the sentencing guidelines,an arrest is a formal arrest.a formal arrest may be indicated by informing the suspect that he is under arrest transporting the suspect to the police station booking the suspect into jail limiting arrest to a formal arrest rather than a mere citation is consistent with common usage,case law and the context and purposes of the sentencing guidelines.
arrest is commonly used as it is defined the taking or detainment of a person in custody by authority of law legal restraint of the person custody imprisonment.webster third new international dictionary unabridged,accord black law dictionary ed.taking,under real or assumed authority,custody of another.while this common understanding creates a clear and usable definition,t he definition of words in isolation is not necessarily controlling in statutory construction.dolan,at.interpretation of a word or phrase in a statute depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.id.
there is little precedent in case law addressing a to assist us in making this decision.the seventh circuit opinion in morgan is the only other circuit opinion that has defined arrest in this context.the seventh circuit held that a traffic stop is an arrest in federal parlance.morgan,at citing whren united states.however,morgan reasoning seems in error and rests on questionable authority.morgan reliance on whren and atwater is misplaced.morgan fails to cite where in whren it establishes that a traffic stop is an arrest,likely because whren does not address whether a traffic stop constitutes an arrest at all rather,the opinion held that a traffic stop is a seizure and therefore must be reasonable.at 
atwater contradicts morgan position that a citation is an arrest.in atwater,there was no question that atwater was arrested she was not only handcuffed,she was taken into custody and booked into jail.at.although atwater uses the terms arrest and custodial arrest,it does not consider whether a citation is either form of arrest.instead,it clearly differentiates between any type of arrest and a citation.see id.at noting a police department revised its policy to provide for citation in lieu of custodial arrest emphasis added.
contrary to morgan reasoning that it is the act of apprehension that identifies a recidivist worthy of additional punishment,at,atwater aptly noted that an arrest has a stronger deterrent effect than a citation,at contrasting the likelihood of reoffending of a chronic speeder who is arrested versus one released with a citation in his pocket.thus,one who is subjected only to a momentary detention and later reoffends is less culpable than the defendant who is subjected to the greater deterrence of an arrest yet still reoffends.imposing a higher sentence on the defendant who was arrested,rather than merely cited,is therefore consistent with the sentencing guidelines goal of imposing a just punishment.
moreover,supreme court case law provides ample support in other contexts for distinguishing an arrest from a citation.in berkemer mccarty,the court clarified that custody is the distinguishing characteristic of an arrest.in berkemer,the driver of a car was stopped,questioned,and asked to perform a field sobriety test.id.at.thereafter,the police officer placed berkemer under arrest and transported him to jail,where he was again questioned.id.at.the court concluded that berkemer statements prior to his arrest were not subject to the exclusionary rule for violating miranda,because he was not in custody at the time.id.at.during a traffic stop,a motorist expects that he may be given a citation,but most likely will be allowed to continue on his way,id.at,but someone under arrest has no such expectation.the court repeatedly drew a parallel between arrest and being in custody in holding that t here can be no question that respondent was in custody at least as of the moment he was formally placed under arrest.id.at.while a defendant may be in custody prior to a formal arrest,see id.at,an arrest clearly constitutes placing the defendant in custody.the court further underscored the distinction between a citation and an arrest in knowles iowa,noting that the police stopped knowles,but issued him a citation rather than arresting him.emphasis added.
the sentencing guidelines as a whole also suggest that citations are not arrests.the purpose of the criminal history score is to approximate the seriousness of the defendant criminal history and the danger that the defendant presents to the public.cmt.a citation,where the defendant is not taken into custody,would ordinarily mean both that the defendant presents little danger to the public and that the crime is less serious.see berkemer,at noting that no state requires that a detained motorist be arrested unless he is accused of a specified serious crime.the sentencing guidelines generally exclude from the criminal history calculation sentences imposed for driving with a suspended license,further indicating the commission judgment that such offenses are relatively minor.c 
as indicated,the context of the sentencing guidelines provides support for our interpretation.however,if we interpreted arrest within the meaning of sentencing guidelines to include a citation as suggested by the dissent,then arrest would be tantamount to being charged with an offense.see black law dictionary ed defining citation as a order to appear before a judge on a given date to defend against a stated charge.if we substitute the word charge for arrest in a,then every offense becomes an intervening arrest.see black law dictionary ed defining charge as to accuse a person of an offense.if this were the case,it would render the last two sentences of a meaningless,because there would never be a situation in which there was no intervening arrest.such an interpretation would violate a fundamental rule of statutory construction.see united states ramirez sanchez,cir reasoning that the sentencing guidelines should not be read in such a way that would render part of the guidelines meaningless.
federal sentencing standards,and the guidelines themselves,require that a defendant sentence and criminal history not be overstated.see a requiring courts to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to effect the goals of sentencing united states cruz gramajo,cir.noting that ensures that a defendant criminal history is not overstated,cert.denied.when the criminal history score underrepresents the danger the defendant poses or the seriousness of the crimes,the sentencing guidelines permit an upward departure.u.a see also cmt.this provision further supports defining arrest narrowly,as it permits the district court to use its discretion to apply an upward departure when warranted,rather than considering all citations to be arrests.finally,sentencing guideline c includes resisting arrest as an offense.but one can not resist a citation,indicating that the two terms are not synonymous.
even if the cases and guideline provisions did not warrant differentiating between a citation and an arrest,the rule of lenity produces the same result.if neither the context and purpose of the sentencing guidelines nor supreme court precedent clarifies the meaning of arrest,it must be interpreted in leal felix is,to exclude citations.see depierre.at.therefore,under either the rule of lenity or supreme court precedent,leal felix november citations should not be considered arrests for the purpose of calculating his criminal history score.
conclusion 
nothing in the record suggests leal felix was ever formally arrested for driving with a suspended license.he was not told he was under arrest,he was not transported to the police station,and he was not booked into jail.absent one of these hallmarks of a formal arrest,the district court erred in finding that he had been arrested for purposes of the sentencing guidelines.therefore,his sentence is vacated.the case is remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.
vacated and remanded.
i join the majority opinion,but write separately to highlight the most compelling reason for concluding that a traffic citation is not an arrest for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines the common understanding of the term arrest does not include being pulled over and ticketed for a traffic violation.it is a bedrock principle of statutory construction that unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states.i am confident that an average citizen with or without a law degree would not believe he had been arrested if pulled over,briefly detained and issued a traffic ticket.indeed,if a traffic citation constituted an arrest in ordinary parlance,then aspiring police officers and prison guards might have a lot more to disclose on their job applications young drivers would need to be more concerned about getting into college and those filling out employment applications background checks visa applications and adoption would need to employ an entirely different than commonly understood.it seems unlikely,however,that police departments,prisons,colleges,government agencies and adoption organizations mean or are even concerned about speeding tickets when they ask if applicants have ever been arrested.in other words,treating an ordinary traffic ticket as an arrest defies our common experience and would be a paradigmatic shift.
it is true that most traffic stops involve a brief period of detention while the officer checks the driver credentials and issues the ticket.but just as we would not say that an undersized fish is illegally
