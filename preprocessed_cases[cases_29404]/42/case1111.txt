petitioner calvin brissett brissett appeals from an order of the board of immigration appeals bia,finding him removable under a a iii and a b i,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense.brissett argues that,because his parents,who were jamaican nationals living in new york,separated in,he acquired citizenship automatically upon his mother naturalization in,and that he is therefore not a removable alien.brissett relies on a repealed,which provides that an alien child automatically acquires citizenship upon the naturalization of his or her custodial parent if there has been a legal separation of the parents.
in support of his contention that his parents were legally separated within the meaning of a at the time of his mother naturalization,brissett relies on the following in,when brissett was eleven years old,his parents began living apart from each other,although they remained married,and thereafter brissett lived solely with his mother also in,the family court for the state of new york issued an order requiring brissett father to make support payments to his mother and the children and in and,the family court issued two temporary orders of protection that ordered brissett father not to assault,threaten,or harass brissett mother.
we disagree with brissett assertion that these facts are sufficient to establish that his parents were legally separated within the meaning of a at the time of his mother naturalization.while we need not and do not decide exactly what circumstances will constitute a legal separation,we rule that at a minimum more is required.in our view a requirement of a legal separation is satisfied only by a formal act which,under the laws of the state or nation having jurisdiction of the marriage,alters the marital relationship either by terminating the marriage as by divorce,or by mandating or recognizing the separate existence of the marital parties.the only formal acts on which brissett relies were the family court orders.these orders,however,enforced marital duties they did not terminate the marriage,nor did they require brissett father to stay away from his wife or otherwise mandate or recognize the separate existence of the spouses.
background 
brissett was born in jamaica in.he was formally admitted as an immigrant in,but had apparently resided in the united states with his mother for some time previously.although brissett mother became a united states citizen in,when brissett was years old,his father never naturalized.brissett parents separated sometime after they immigrated to the united states and before brissett mother was naturalized,but they never obtained a divorce or a judicial decree of separation.
between and,brissett was convicted of a series of controlled substance offenses in new york state.in,the immigration and naturalization service ins instituted removal proceedings against him,charging that brissett was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense,and was therefore removable pursuant to a a iii and a b i,respectively.brissett did not dispute that if he were an alien,he could be removed for the offenses of which he was convicted.instead,he contended that he was not an alien because he had derivatively acquired united states citizenship,pursuant to a,upon his mother naturalization in.
section a provides that a child born outside of the united states of alien parents becomes a citizen of the united states if there has been a legal separation of the parents and the parent having legal custody of the child is naturalized while the child is under years of age.it is undisputed that brissett mother became a citizen while brissett was still a minor,and that brissett lived with her at the time.brissett claim of citizenship therefore turns on whether his parents were legally separated in,when his mother was naturalized.
the bia held that brissett parents were not legally separated within the meaning of a because they never obtained a decree of separation or signed a legally recognized separation agreement.in so holding,the agency rejected brissett contention that the family court support order recognized the dissolution of the brissetts marriage and should therefore be considered the equivalent of a decree of separation under new york law.the bia reasoned that the order could not effect a legal separation,because the new york family court does not have jurisdiction to enter divorce or separation agreements,and therefore found that brissett parents never legally separated,and that brissett did not acquire united states citizenship when his mother was naturalized.while we agree with the bia conclusions and affirm its order,we reject some elements of its reasoning,as detailed below.
discussion 
this court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate petitions for review challenging a final order of removal against an alien who is subject to removal because he or she committed an aggravated felony or controlled substance offense.see a c.we retain jurisdiction,however,to determine whether brissett petition for review falls within the statutory prohibition.the question of whether brissett is an alien whose petition is unreviewable under a c is with the sole argument that brissett presents in his petition,that he is a citizen and therefore not removable.we therefore have jurisdiction to consider brissett contention.see drakes ashcroft,cir.
we accord substantial deference to the bia interpretations of the statutes and regulations that it administers.see chevron natural res.def.council,d diallo ins,cir.in such circumstances,where the relevant statutory provision is silent or ambiguous,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.sutherland reno,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in contrast,we review the agency construction of state laws,and federal statutes that it does not administer,de novo.see michel ins,cir sotomayor,mugalli ashcroft,cir sutherland,at.
although domestic relations law is almost exclusively the province of the states,the meaning of the term legal separation within a is a question of federal law.see nehme ins,cir wedderburn ins,cir.because the constitution gives congress the power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization,const.art,cl,naturalization laws must be construed according to a federal,rather than state,standard.nehme,at.where,as here,there is no extant body of federal common law in the area of law implicated by the statute,we may use state law to inform our interpretation of the statutory language.see id.at.
the ins interprets the term legal separation,as it is used in a,to require that the separation be pursuant to proceedings which terminate the marriage completely,as by absolute divorce,or which merely separate the parties without destroying the marital status.ins interp.thus,an informal separation is not sufficient to render the parties legally separated,and children of informally separated parents do not automatically acquire citizenship when their custodial parent is naturalized.we find that the ins reading is a permissible construction of a.see nehme,at wedderburn,at.
section distinguishes between the children of parents,who automatically acquire citizenship only if both parents are naturalized,and the children of legally separated,widowed,and unmarried parents,who automatically acquire citizenship if the custodial parent is naturalized.see a.because parents who are informally separated,but who have not altered their spousal relationship and rights through legal means,are legally indistinguishable from married parents who live together,the structure of indicates that congress intended that the children of informally separated parents be treated like the children of married parents.a contrary interpretation would render superfluous the provision specification that the separation must be legal.because couples can informally separate without legally altering their relationship,including an informal separation within the provision terms would effectively eviscerate the force of the term legal from the statute.see nehme,at.mo
