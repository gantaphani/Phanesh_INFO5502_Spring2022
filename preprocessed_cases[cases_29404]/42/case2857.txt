agents served administrative subpoenas to telephone companies and learned that the and numbers were both assigned to yu home in mckinney,texas and that there had been phone calls between these numbers and various chinese restaurants in the previous eight months,including two with other north dakota restaurants.at one of these restaurants agents found another employee forwarded by yu who was in the country illegally.
based on this information,agents obtained and executed a search warrant at yu house in texas where they found numerous employment contracts similar to those discovered in north dakota.some of the contracts uncovered in texas listed different phone numbers for the employment agency,but the new numbers were also assigned to yu.agents also uncovered business journals which recorded transactions between great texas and numerous chinese restaurants for the prior fifteen months.entries in those journals indicated that restaurants had ordered approximately workers from great texas in that period and that great texas had delivered approximately workers.also discovered were records from bank accounts owned jointly by yu and his girlfriend,ya cao,with a total value of about,comprised almost entirely of cash deposits.in addition there were copies of direct mailings sent to chinese restaurant owners and of advertisements placed in the world journal which listed the area code phone number and chen lily as the contact person.
