jonathan castilho de oliveira,a citizen of brazil,sought asylum and withholding of removal,claiming that brazilian governmental and banking officials were involved in the assassination of his father and are now intent on taking his life.an immigration judge ij disbelieved castilho de oliveira story and also held in the alternative that even if it were true,it did not establish eligibility for asylum.the board of immigration appeals bia adopted and affirmed that decision,and castilho de oliveira petitioned this court for review.
without commenting on the merits of castilho de oliveira claim,we conclude that he did not receive a fair hearing before a neutral immigration judge.the ij repeatedly interrupted the testimony to ask irrelevant and sometimes inflammatory questions,refused to consider important evidence,and decided the case without seriously engaging with the evidence in the record.indeed,so troubling are some of these lapses that we are left with the impression that the ij cared little about the evidence and instead applied whatever rationale he could muster to justify a predetermined outcome.see bosede mukasey,cir.accordingly,we grant castilho de oliveira petition for review,vacate the decision of the bia,and remand for a new hearing.
background 
jonathan castilho de oliveira,a native of brazil,sought asylum and withholding of removal after entering the united states illegally through mexico.at his asylum hearing,he testified that corrupt governmental and banking officials in brazil were conspiring to kill him because of his family ties,that the government of brazil was unwilling or unable to protect him,and that he would be killed if he returned to brazil.
at the center of castilho de oliveira claim is an illegal banking scheme organized to fund the campaigns of two corrupt politicians.castilho de oliveira father,a participant in the scheme,was murdered when castilho de oliveira was only eight years old.the apparent motive for the killing was that his father had threatened to expose the scheme.he was found dead in his car,shot in the head the car was riddled with bullets.castilho de oliveira family believes that the politicians and banking officials involved in the scheme ordered the hit to avoid the scandal and accountability that might have flowed from exposure of their involvement in public corruption.
castilho de oliveira mother turned over incriminating documents and audiotapes to a local prosecutor,who began an investigation,but because the scheme involved important political figures and bankers,local officials dragged their feet so castilho de oliveira mother began to campaign for justice for her murdered husband.her activities enraged her husband former accomplices and led to death threats against the family.these threats form the basis of castilho de oliveira asylum and withholding claims.
castilho de oliveira testified that the harassment of his family began with threatening phone calls but escalated into more ominous conduct.according to an affidavit submitted by castilho de oliveira mother,she began to notice strange men following her family everywhere,sometimes pointing guns at her and castilho de oliveira,and in one incident approaching the family home and knocking on the door.the family went into hiding,moving frequently.castilho de oliveira testified that because of the threats he was,for much of his childhood,unable to go outside to play.although he attended school,he switched schools frequently to prevent his location from being discovered.the threats eventually diminished,and castilho de oliveira and his family moved back to the town where his father had been murdered.there,they were temporarily able to live a more normal life.eventually,though,the threats began anew,and castilho de oliveira mother decided to take her children to the united states.
the united states was not as welcoming as she had hoped.castilho de oliveira mother and sister were only able to obtain tourist visas,and castilho de oliveira application for a visa was denied altogether.his mother decided to flee anyway,bringing her daughter to this country where they now apparently live on expired visas,leaving castilho de oliveira in brazil in the care of an aunt.a cousin resumed the family quest for an investigation into castilho de oliveira father murder.
about two years after his mother and sister left,castilho de oliveira again began to receive death threats from one of the men involved in his father assassination.castilho de oliveira testified that he initially encountered this man in an store the man repeatedly demanded to know where castilho de oliveira lived,where his mother was,and where he went to school.castilho de oliveira gave evasive responses,but the next day the man phoned his aunt house,warning that castilho de oliveira fate would be the same as his father.fearing that his life was in danger,castilho de oliveira fled to the united states via mexico but was detained at the border he then sought asylum and withholding of removal.
the claims were heard by immigration judge john brahos,who rejected castilho de oliveira account as not credible.in the alternative,the ij held that even if castilho de oliveira story was true,it was sufficient to meet the requirements for asylum.the bia agreed,and because it adopted and affirmed the ij decision,adding essentially no analysis of its own,we review the ij decision directly.niam ashcroft,cir.
ii.analysis 
castilho de oliveira challenges all aspects of the ij decision,arguing that the adverse credibility finding was not sufficiently grounded in the record evidence and attacking the alternative castilho de oliveira story was in any event insufficient to establish eligibility for similarly unsupported by the record.in addition,castilho de oliveira takes aim at the ij conduct during the hearing,arguing that the judge behavior reflected bias or a predetermination to reject his claim.
a.the adverse credibility determination 
we begin with the ij credibility finding,which is ordinarily entitled to a high level of deference.see apouviepseakoda gonzales,cir.here,however,we do not defer to the ij credibility determination because it is unsupported by the evidence in the record.see oforji ashcroft,cir.the ij found castilho de oliveira claim to be implausible,but his explanation suggests that he strained to find difficulties with castilho de oliveira testimony while ignoring evidence that corroborated it.
the ij first doubted castilho de oliveira claim that prosecutors in brazil maintained an open investigation of his father assassination,finding it unlikely that such an investigation could still be ongoing more than ten years after a murder.but his skepticism was based on speculation rather than anything in the record.he ignored castilho de oliveira explanation for the prosecutors had deliberately dragged their feet in order to protect officials.the ij also ignored a state department report castilho de oliveira submitted in support of his claim that report concluded that justice in brazil moves slowly and that corrupt justice officials often engage in dilatory tactics to protect politically favored criminals to give only two examples,the report noted that the average case involving corrupt police officers takes eight years to reach a decision and specifically mentioned a case involving police officers who are still awaiting trial for a prison massacre.id.
instead of addressing this corroborating evidence regarding conditions in brazil,the ij reasoned by supposed analogy to prosecutorial practices in the united states,concluding that prosecutors in brazil must expeditiously pursue all reported allegations of wrongdoing and therefore the existence of an open investigation was implausible.the analogy to prosecutorial norms in the united states was odd there was no evidence to support it.to the contrary,the record evidence suggested that the brazilian justice system suffered from corruption and politically motivated delay.according to the state department report in the record,j ustice remained slow and unreliable in brazil,and in certain cases local police often were less diligent in investigating,prosecut
