opinion of the court 
victor aguilar petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia ordering that he be removed because he was convicted of sexual assault under,which the bia determined was a crime of violence under b b,and therefore an aggravated felony under a f.aguilar asserts that crimes involving a minimum mens rea of recklessness can not be crimes of violence under b.accordingly,he argues that,because the minimum mens rea necessary for conviction under is recklessness,the bia erred in finding that his conviction constituted a crime of violence under b.contrary to aguilar assertion,however,our precedent does not foreclose the possibility that a reckless crime can be a crime of violence under b.because sexual assault,as defined by,raises a substantial risk that the perpetrator will intentionally use force in furtherance of the offense,we agree with the bia that it constitutes a crime of violence under b.we will therefore deny aguilar petition.
background 
in,aguilar,a native and citizen of honduras,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident.four years later,in the court of common pleas of berks county,pennsylvania,he was found guilty of both sexual assault,a second degree felony,under and indecent assault,a second degree misdemeanor,under.a.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of months to eight years,followed by two years of probation.in that same proceeding,the jury found aguilar not guilty of rape under.a based on those felony and misdemeanor convictions,the department of homeland security dhs issued aguilar a notice to appear,charging him as removable under ina a a iii,a a iii,because he had been convicted of a crime of violence under b and hence an aggravated felony as defined by a f 
section b defines a crime of violence as any other offense not described in a that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.in an interlocutory ruling on aggravated felony,the immigration judge ij sustain ed the aggravated felony ground of removal under a a iii.ar at.the ij held that,since t he confrontation inherent in engaging in sexual or deviant intercourse creates a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense,sexual assault under is a crime of violence under b.id.the ij reasoned that,although cover s those occasions where a victim is compelled to engage in sexual intercourse or deviant sexual intercourse without consent even where no force was applied,ar at,b can nevertheless cover offenses under because b only requires a substantial risk that physical force may be used against the person in the course of committing the offense,ar at.
aguilar appealed to the bia.like the ij,the bia reasoned that even if the intercourse required by is accomplished without physical force or physical resistance,the offense of penetrating another person without that person consent necessarily disregards the substantial risk of physical force being used to actually overcome the victim lack of consent.ar at.thus,the bia dismissed the appeal.
aguilar has timely petitioned us for review.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
pursuant to a,we have jurisdiction to consider questions of law raised upon a petition for review,including petitions for review of removal orders based on aggravated felony convictions.tran gonzales,cir quoting a d.since the interpretation of criminal provisions is a task outside the bia special competence and congressional delegation and very much a part of this court competence,our review is de novo.see id.noting that de novo review is appropriate in the context of interpreting the criminal provisions of title of the united states code.
iii.discussion 
a.the categorical approach 
this case requires us to interpret the meaning and application of the type of aggravated felony defined by statute as a crime of violence.see singh ashcroft,cir noting that whether a petitioner has been convicted of an aggravated felony turns on a question of statutory interpretation.first,we must ascertain the definition of a crime of violence under the enumerating statute,a f,which incorporates b by reference,and second,we must compare that federal definition to the statute of conviction,namely sexual assault under.restrepo att y of the,cir.case law refers to this kind of analysis as the categorical approach to determining whether a state law conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under federal law.taylor united states,d.applying the categorical approach,we look to the elements of the statutory state offense,not to the specific facts of the case,reading the applicable statute to ascertain the least culpable conduct necessary to sustain conviction under the statute.denis att y of the,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted 
crime of violence 
the question before us is whether sexual assault under,which has a minimum mens rea of recklessness is a crime of violence under b.aguilar argues that it is not,because he reads our precedent as barring any crime that can be committed recklessly from qualifying as a b crime.the government argues that,notwithstanding the possibility that may be violated recklessly,sexual assault,as defined by that statute,is a crime of violence under b because it creates a substantial risk that force may be used.the preliminary issue,then,is whether,under our precedent,the fact that a crime can be committed with a mens rea of recklessness necessarily disqualifies it from being a crime of violence under b.we conclude that reckless crimes can be crimes of violence under b because,under the terms of the statute and applicable case law,the focus must be on the risk of the intentional use of force,not merely on mens rea,as aguilar urges.however,as the relevant precedents are nuanced and deserving of discussion,we will review them first and apply the proper test to the crime at issue,before turning to cases examining similar crimes,which have consistently been held to be crimes of violence.
recklessly committed crimes can be crimes of violence under b 
as already noted,b provides that a crime of violence is any other offense not described in a that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.mens rea is not featured in that definition,but both the supreme court and our court have considered mens rea when determining what constitutes a crime of violence under b.under those precedents,crimes involving a mens rea of negligence or of a variant of recklessness that we have called pure recklessness have been held not to be crimes of violence under b because,by their nature,they do not raise a substantial risk that physical force may be used,tran,at see leocal ashcroft,d.those precedents,however,do not foreclose all crimes with a mens rea of recklessness from qualifying as crimes of violence.although the mental state necessary to satisfy the substantive elements of a crime may have a bearing on the substantial risk inquiry required by b,a reckless mens rea does not necessarily dictate that a crime falls outside of b.case law instead follows the plain language of b and focuses on whether the crime,by its nature,raises a substantial risk that force may be used.thus,a crime that can be committed recklessly may still qualify as a crime of violence under b if that crime,by its nature,raises such a risk.
in leocal ashcroft,the supreme court held that a florida dui is not a crime of violence under b because i n no ordinary or natural sense can it be said that a person risks having to use physical force against another person in the course of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and causing injury.at.the court reasoned that b 
covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.the reckless disregard in relates not to the general conduct or to the possibility that harm will result from a person conduct,but to the risk that the use of physical force against another might be required in committing a crime.
id.at emphasis added.though the court held that b require s a higher mens rea than the merely accidental or negligent conduct involved in a dui offense,id.at,it did so in light of its suggestion that the nature of the dui crime itself,not the particular mens rea associated with the crime,was key in assessing the substantial risk required by b,see id.in no ordinary or natural sense can it be said that a person risks having to use physical force against another person in the course of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and causing injury.moreover,while the court explicitly noted that it was not considering whether a state or federal offense that requires proof of the reckless use of force against a person or property of another qualifies as a crime of violence under,id.at,it at least implied that it could qualify.indeed,by specifically emphasizing that the disregard in b is a reckless disregard,leocal supports the conclusion that crimes that can be committed recklessly may sometimes be crimes of violence.thus,the takeaway from leocal is its instruction to focus the b analysis on whether the crime,by its nature,raises a substantial risk of the use of force,id.at,and not on the crime mens rea.
after leocal,we held in tran that the crime of reckless burning or was not a crime of violence under b.at.as the supreme court did in leocal,we focused on whether the crime,by its nature,raised a substantial risk that the actor will intentionally use force in the furtherance of the offense.id.at.we concluded that the substantial risk involved in the crime of reckless burning or exploding is the risk that the fire started by the offender will spread and damage the property of another,which can not be said to involve the intentional use of force.id.at.
in our analysis,we noted that a crime like reckless burning or exploding,for which the mens rea is pure recklessness,could not be a crime of violence under b.id.at.pure recklessness,which we had defined in united states parson,exists when the mens rea of a crime lack s an intent,desire or willingness to use force or cause harm at all,cir,abrogated on other grounds by begay united states,d thus,while discussing pure recklessness in tran,we again focused the inquiry on whether the crime itself involve d any risk of intentional harm or use of force.at.we contrasted the pure recklessness crime of reckless burning or exploding with the crime of burglary,the classic example of a crime covered by b.id.at quoting leocal,u.at.we noted that a burglary would be covered under b not because the offense can be committed in a generally reckless way or because someone may be injured,but because burglary,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.id.quoting leocal,at emphasis added.thus,as it had been in leocal,the focus in tran was on whether the crime,by its nature,raises the risk of the use of physical force not on the mens rea requirement in the statute of conviction.
like leocal,tran supports our conclusion that some crimes with a minimum mens rea of recklessness can constitute crimes of violence under b.tran teaches that there is a subset of reckless crimes those committed with pure recklessness that do not fit under b for the very reason that the perpetrator runs no risk of intentionally using force in committing his crime.at.tran thereby implicitly recognizes that,when such a risk does exist,the crime does fall within b.the discussion in tran concerning burglary,the same classic b example cited in leocal,also suggests that some crimes that can be committed recklessly will qualify as crimes of violence under b.under common law,burglary is a specific intent crime,see parson,at,the intent being to break and enter a dwelling at night to commit a felony,black law dictionary ed.but for b purposes,what is enlightening is not the mens rea associated with the breaking and entering.it is rather the risk of confrontation,a risk that may be only recklessly undertaken.as tran says,a burglar has a mens rea legally nearly as bad as a specific intent to use force,for he or she recklessly risks having to use force if the occupants of the dwelling are confronted.at quoting parson,at.
accordingly,leocal and tran teach that crimes carrying a mens rea of recklessness may qualify as crimes of violence under b if they raise a substantial risk that the perpetrator will resort to intentional physical force in the course of committing the crime.despite that,aguilar asserts that our decisions undermine that conclusion.the decisions he relies on,however,are distinguishable.
first,in popal gonzales,we held that misdemeanor simple assault under pennsylvania law was not a crime of violence under,cir.in so holding,we stated that we ha d recently held that crimes with a mens rea of recklessness do not constitute crimes of violence.id.citing tran,at.however,as aguilar concedes in his brief,only a was at issue in popal because the simple assault was not a felony,and thus could not qualify under b.at.therefore,any discussion of b was not essential to the decision in that case,and,as such,is dicta 
second,in henry bureau of immigration customs enforcement,we held that the crime,under new york law,of possessing a loaded firearm with intent to use the same unlawfully against another,was a crime of violence under b,cir.we noted that i n tran,decided after leocal,we reaffirmed our precedent from parson,which held that a reckless state of mind does not suffice to satisfy the requirements of b.id.at.however,since the part of the statute of conviction to which henry pled guilty could only have been accomplished intentionally,our commentary in henry on the mens rea of recklessness is,again,dicta,because we were deciding if an intentionally committed crime was a crime of violence under b and did not need to consider the reckless mens rea analysis from tran 
third,in oyebanji gonzales,we held that the crime of vehicular homicide under new jersey law is not a crime of violence under b.at.since that crime is a form of reckless driving that causes death,we found that leocal reasoning seems to suggest that vehicular homicide is excluded from the category of crimes of violence.id.we equated the reckless conduct required for vehicular homicide with the accidental conduct referenced in leocal analysis of the florida dui offense,id.at,and specifically noted that i nterpreting to encompass accidental or negligent conduct would blur the distinction between those lower mens rea offenses and the violent crimes congress sought to be subsumed under b for heightened punishment,id.at quoting leocal,at.thus,the type of recklessness that the oyebanji court found not to qualify under b the type required for vehicular homicide only raised a substantial risk that accidental,not intentional,force would be used.that position is similar to the one taken in tran and holds open the possibility that recklessly committed crimes that create something more than the risk of the accidental use of force can be crimes of violence under b.in short,oyebanji focus on the accidental use of force is akin to tran references to pure recklessness it carves out a class of reckless crimes that fail to create the substantial risk of the use of force that is required by b 
thus,we have never categorically foreclosed the possibility that a recklessly committed crime may be a crime of violence under b,and we will not do so here.
section is a crime of violence under b 
having established that a crime with a mens rea of recklessness can qualify as a crime of violence under b,we must next determine whether in particular fits that definition and is hence an aggravated felony under a f.because we are persuaded by the bia reasoning that the offense of penetrating another person without that person consent necessarily disregards the substantial risk of physical force being used to actually overcome the victim lack of consent,we hold that it is a crime of violence under b.ar at.
our analysis begins with the plain language of b,which requires that for sexual assault under to be a crime of violence,it must be a felony and,by its nature,raise a substantial risk that physical force may be used during the commission of the offense.b.because we are applying the formal categorical approach,we only look to the fact of the conviction and statutory definition of the offense 
section,a second degree felony under pennsylvania law,makes it an offense to engage in sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with a complainant without the complainant consent.in addition to the ordinary meaning of sexual intercourse,the statutory definitions of both sexual intercourse and deviate sexual intercourse include intercourse per os or per anus and penetration.
since it is beyond dispute that sexual assault under is a felony,we turn to the second requirement of b and ask,using the template provided in tran,whether sexual intercourse,by its nature,creates a substantial risk that the actor will intentionally use physical force against the victim.see tran,at w e conclude that b crimes are those raising a substantial risk that the actor will intentionally use force in the furtherance of the offense.we hold that it does.
as discussed in both leocal and tran,burglary is a crime of violence under b because burglary,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.id.at quoting leocal,at.just as a burglary creates a substantial risk that the burglar will have to use physical force to overcome the desire of home occupants to protect themselves and their property,so too does a sexual assault under,by its nature,create a substantial risk that the assailant will use physical force to overcome a victim desire to protect his or her body from sexual penetration.if the risk of force created by an unlawful entry into a victim home qualifies under b,then surely the risk of force when an offender is trying to enter a victim body without consent must qualify as well.
it is useful for contrast to look at the risks created by the crimes at issue in tran and leocal.the substantial risk involved in reckless burning or exploding,which was considered in tran,is the risk that the fire started by the offender will spread and damage the property of another which is a risk that can not be said to involve the intentional use of force.tran,at.the offender does not have to overcome a victim.the substantial risk involved in sexual assault under,however,is that,to achieve penetration,the offender will intentionally use force to overcome the victim natural resistance against participating in unwanted intercourse.thus,unlike the statute of conviction in tran,sexual assault raises a risk that can certainly be said to involve the intentional use of force by the offender.
sexual assault is also unlike the statute of conviction at issue in leocal.the supreme court there determined that b requir ed a higher mens rea than the merely accidental or negligent conduct involved in a dui offense,leocal,at,and concluded that a dui offense could not be shoehorn ed into b because in no ordinary and natural sense could driving under the influence raise a substantial risk of having to use physical force against another person,id.at.in contrast,in an ordinary and obvious sense,an offender risks having to intentionally use physical force against a victim in the course of engaging in sexual intercourse 
we therefore hold that sexual assault under,by its nature,raises a substantial risk that an actor will intentionally use force in furtherance of the sexual intercourse,and,accordingly,that it constitutes a crime of violence under b.
we note that,while this is an issue of first impression in our circuit,our conclusion finds ample support in decisions from several of our sister courts of appeals.in united states reyes castro,the tenth circuit held that sexual abuse of a child under utah law was a crime of violence under b because by its nature it involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used against the person of another,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.in reaching that holding,the tenth circuit affirmed the district court analysis of the role of force in crimes where lack of victim consent is an element.id.the district court had analogized the statute concerning sexual abuse of a child to utah rape statute,which defined rape as sexual intercourse without the victim consent,id.citing utah code ann,a definition that is closely similar to sexual assault under.because violating that rape statute was a crime that involves a act upon another person,the court found that there is a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense.id.thus,the court concluded that sexual intercourse,even without physical force,would constitute a crime of violence under b.id.
the fifth circuit,in zaidi ashcroft,held that sexual battery,defined by statute as intentional touching,mauling or feeling of the body or private parts of any person sixteen years of age or older,in a lewd and lascivious manner and without the consent of that other person,was a crime of violence under b,cir quoting.stat.ann.tit,b.the petitioner had argued that the statute could be violated through an intentional,but nonviolent,physical touching,and thus should not qualify as a crime of violence.id.at.the fifth circuit disagreed,emphasizing that,b ecause the statute at issue presupposes a lack of consent,it necessarily carries with it a risk of physical force.id.at citation omitted.the court went on to say that the nonconsent of the victim is the touchstone for determining whether a given offense involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the commission of the offense.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in sutherland reno,the second circuit determined that the massachusetts crime of indecent assault and battery on a person over the age of fourteen was a crime of violence under b,cir sotomayor.although the language of the statute of conviction did not set forth the elements of the crime,case law defined it to include a lack of consent see,maghsoudi ins,cir noting that,under applicable massachusetts law,l ack of consent i s an element of indecent assault on a person fourteen or older.the second circuit said that it was significant that the lack of consent was a required element,and the court emphasized that the existence of lack of consent by the victim by its nature,presents a substantial risk that force may be used in order to overcome the victim lack of consent and accomplish the indecent touching.sutherland,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in support of that contention,the court referenced an eighth circuit case,united states rodriguez,which held 
t he statutory language may and substantial risk must not be ignored.all crimes which by their nature involve a substantial risk of physical force share the risk of harm.it matters not one whit whether the risk ultimately causes actual harm.our scrutiny ends upon a finding that the risk of violence is present.
though not decided in the context of b,another case provides support for the proposition that the of the victim is a touchstone for determining whether an offense raises a substantial risk that force will be used during the commission of an offense.in united states rooks,the tenth circuit concluded that third degree sexual assault under texas law constituted a crime of violence under a of the federal sentencing guidelines,cir.finding the supreme court decision in begay instructive,the rooks court concluded that s exual assault involving intentional penetration without consent is similar in kind as well as in degree of risk posed to the example crimes set forth in a commentary.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the rooks court also found that t he risk of confrontation,another indicator of violent and aggressive conduct,is inherent in sexual encounters.id.at internal citation omitted 
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the bia did not err in holding that aguilar offense was a crime of violence under b,and thus an aggravated
