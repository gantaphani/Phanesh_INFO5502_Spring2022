this case requires us to analyze the statutory provision d that defines the circumstances under which a defendant charged with illegally reentering the united states after deportation may collaterally attack the validity of the removal order the defendant,dagoberto luna,appeals from the district court denial of his motion to dismiss his indictment for illegal reentry.the district court held that the defendant did not meet the requirements of d.we affirm.
luna background and deportation proceedings 
luna,a citizen of the dominican republic,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.his immediate family members,including his mother,father,and siblings,all live in the united states.luna spent most of his childhood in rhode island,where he attended school until the grade.since that time,he has lived in new york and rhode island.
on april,at age,luna was ordered deported after he was convicted in state court of third degree grand larceny.he returned to the united states at some point thereafter.on january,luna pled guilty in state court to second degree assault.he was sentenced to three to six years imprisonment.while he was serving his sentence,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause charging that luna was deportable on several grounds,including his assault conviction and his previous deportation order and reentry.given serious problems regarding the validity of the previous deportation order the immigration judge ij found that luna was deportable on the sole ground of being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,see immigration and nationality act ina a a iii,a a iii formerly ina a a iii,redesignated,based on his second degree assault conviction.
during his hearing before the ij,luna applied for discretionary relief,requesting a waiver of deportation under former ina c.c repealed the ij did not consider the merits of luna application for relief,stating in his oral decision that the respondent is statutorily barred from this and any other forms of relief from deportation under the attorney general decision in in re soriano,wl bia,
in soriano,the attorney general determined that recent statutory amendments to the ina prevented all individuals with aggravated felony convictions in removal proceedings from obtaining discretionary relief from deportation.see id.at,wl see also and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.codified in various titles illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.codified in various titles although luna pled guilty to second degree assault before the relevant provisions of aedpa and iirira went into effect,the ij concluded that,under soriano,luna could not apply for discretionary relief.
luna,who was represented by a accredited representative,appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.on june,the bia affirmed,also relying on soriano,telling luna that he was statutorily ineligible for c relief.luna did not appeal the agency decision in federal court.on november,he was deported for a second time.
cyr and eligibility for ina c relief 
in,the supreme court corrected the attorney general misapplication of law.see ins cyr,d.the supreme court emphasized that the class of aliens whose continued residence in this country has depended on their eligibility for c relief is extremely large,and that the retroactive repeal of such relief would surely be contrary to familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that the repeal of c relief did not apply retroactively to individuals who had pled guilty to a criminal charge prior to the effective date of the repeal.id.at.
after cyr was decided,the government changed its position on the availability of c relief for individuals who pled guilty or nolo contendere to crimes before the effective date of aedpa and irrira.in,the government implemented procedures for immigrants to reopen their removal cases in light of cyr.see.however,the procedures were not available for immigrants who had already departed the country.see k.
luna indictment for reentry and the district court decision 
at some point after his second deportation,luna reentered the united states.on november,luna was indicted for illegally reentering the united states without the express permission of the attorney general,in violation of a and b.he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,pursuant to d arguing that his deportation was fundamentally unfair and thus could not serve as the basis for his illegal reentry indictment 
in its memorandum and decision of april,april decision,the district court denied luna motion to dismiss,holding that he failed to establish,as required by d,that the ij failure to adjudicate his c application prejudiced him.luna filed a motion asking the district court to reconsider.on june,the district court issued a second memorandum and decision june decision again denying the motion to dismiss.the court held that,in addition to luna failure to demonstrate prejudice,luna also failed to establish the requirement under d that his underlying deportation proceedings improperly deprived him of judicial review.luna appealed.
the underlying facts are not in dispute,and we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.see united states loaisiga,cir applying de novo standard of review to district court decision to grant motion to dismiss an indictment for illegal reentry under a prior version of.
the government argues that we should review the district court prejudice determination for clear error.while we review factual findings under a clear error standard,the prejudice analysis in this case involves the application of law to undisputed facts and is part of an inquiry to determine whether the defendant has established the fundamental unfairness of his deportation hearing.under these circumstances,we agree with our sister circuits that a district court determination of whether a defendant has established prejudice pursuant to d is subject to de novo review.see united states scott,cir applying de novo review to district court determination of whether defendant has established prejudice under d united states,cir en banc same united states,cir same.
under a,it is a crime for an individual who has been deported,removed,excluded,or denied admission to enter the united states unless he or she has the prior approval of the attorney general or shows that no such approval was needed.section b specifies enhanced penalties for illegal reentry based on the person criminal history.
in united states,d,the supreme court held that a person who is prosecuted for illegal reentry based on a previous order of deportation must have meaningful review of the validity of his or her deportation order.the defendants in,having been indicted for illegally reentering the united states,argued that their previous deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair because the ij had failed to inform them adequately of their eligibility for suspension of deportation,a form of discretionary relief.see id.at.the supreme court concluded that the defendants motions to dismiss their indictments should be granted because they had been deprived of their rights to appeal their removal orders,and of any basis to appeal since the only relief from deportation for which they would have been eligible was not adequately explained to them.id.at.as the court explained,where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction,there must be some meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.id.at.emphasis in original.
congress essentially codified the decision as d.see united states wilson,cir motz,concurring discussing the legislative history of d.section d provides 
in a criminal proceeding under this section,an alien may not challenge the validity of the deportation order unless the alien demonstrates that 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
these elements are in the conjunctive therefore,a defendant must satisfy all of them to successfully attack his removal order.see united states,cir wilson,at united states,cir united states lepore,d.
application of d to luna case 
the interpretation of this statute presents us with several difficult issues of first impression.while the parties agree that luna has met the administrative exhaustion requirement of d they disagree about whether luna has met the other statutory requirements.the government argues that we can affirm the district court order on either of its stated luna was not deprived of judicial review under d or that luna has not established prejudice as part of the fundamental unfairness inquiry under d.the government also argues that,alternatively,we can affirm the district court order because the defendant failed to establish that the errors in his hearing,even if prejudicial,rendered his deportation order fundamentally unfair under d.luna argues that he meets all the statutory requirements.we address these arguments and discuss the second and third prongs of d.however,because we conclude that luna has not established prejudice under d,we need not ultimately resolve all the statutory issues.
section d deprivation of judicial review 
under d,a defendant who seeks to challenge the validity of his deportation order must demonstrate that the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review.in its june decision,the district court held that luna did not meet this requirement because he had an opportunity for judicial writ of habeas failed to pursue it luna argues that the ij and the bia effectively deprived him of judicial review by failing to properly inform him of his eligibility for relief,adjudicate his application for relief,or inform him of any right to appeal.
we have not previously interpreted d however,provides some guidance.the supreme court held that an ij failure to adequately explain the availability of relief,resulting in an uninformed waiver of the right to appeal,was an error that deprived the individuals in that case of their opportunity for judicial review,at.other than this specific holding,however,the supreme court has declined to further enumerate which procedural errors are so fundamental that they may functionally deprive the alien of judicial review.see id.at.
in this case,the government essentially argues that,as the district court concluded,the availability of judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus is fatal to the defendant claim under d.however,the conclusions of the few courts that have considered this argument have not been uniform.compare sosa,at t he fact that a chance to file a habeas petition technically existed does not necessarily mean that the defendant had an opportunity for judicial review within the meaning of section d.and united states copeland,cir noting that i n itself,habeas review was apparently available to the aliens,yet the court held that they were deprived of judicial review with,at even though the defendant may have had good reason for thinking that he was not eligible for discretionary relief from removal,because the ij had so informed him,he should have realized that avenues of judicial review were available to him.
given the uncertainty in the law on this issue,we turn to d.because,as we explain below,we conclude that luna has not established prejudice,we need not decide whether,under d,the errors in luna case functionally deprived him of judicial review despite the availability of habeas review.
section d fundamental unfairness 
a defendant who seeks to challenge the validity of his deportation order must demonstrate that the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d.under this prong,courts uniformly require a showing of procedural error and prejudice.see,at perez,at,at wilson,at.
courts disagree,however,on what type of procedural error,if prejudicial,would result in a fundamentally unfair deportation order under the statute.the third,fourth,and fifth circuits have held that d requires a showing that the error in the deportation hearing has resulted in a deprivation of a liberty or property interest.see united states torres,cir wilson,at united states,cir.these courts have rejected the argument that an agency failure to adequately inform an immigrant of his or her eligibility for c relief can establish fundamental unfairness,because an applicant has no liberty or property interest in discretionary relief.see torres,at b ecause discretionary relief is necessarily a matter of grace rather than of right,aliens do not have a due process liberty interest in consideration for such relief.wilson,at s ection c does not create an entitlement,but is rather completely discretionary in nature,at because eligibility for c relief is not a liberty or property interest warranting due process protection,we hold that the immigration judge error in failing to explain eligibility does not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness.
the second and ninth circuits have taken a different approach.these courts have held that an agency violation of the procedural protections in its statute or regulations,if prejudicial to the person facing deportation,can demonstrate fundamental unfairness under d.see copeland,at,at.they conclude,therefore,that an agency failure to adequately inform an immigrant of his or her eligibility for c relief,if prejudicial,can render the deportation fundamentally unfair.see copeland,at the decisions holding that a failure to inform an alien about section c relief can not be a fundamental error collapse the distinction between a right to seek relief and the right to that relief itself the issue,therefore,is not whether section c relief is constitutionally mandated,but whether a denial of an established right under agency regulations to be informed of the possibility of such relief can,if prejudicial,be a fundamental procedural error,at the requirement that the ij inform an alien of his or her ability to apply for relief from removal is mandatory,and failure to so inform the alien of his or her eligibility for relief from removal is a denial of due process that invalidates the underlying deportation proceedings.quoting united states,cir.
although we have not interpreted d,we have analyzed whether a deportation order was fundamentally flawed in the context of a defendant challenge to his indictment for illegal reentry after.loaisiga,at.the defendant in loaisiga claimed that he was not adequately advised of his right to counsel.id.we stated that we would assume without deciding that it would be a fundamental flaw under to fail to advise one threatened with deportation of his statutory right to counsel.id.at.however,we found that the ij complied with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.see id.at.we then stated that it has been left primarily to congress and to ins regulations to dictate the course of both bodies have done in some detail courts normally require nothing more in the way of procedural protection,except to prevent flagrant those rising to the level of due process violations.id.at emphasis in original.having found no statutory or regulatory violations,we asked whether the ij violated the defendant constitutional rights.
we did not resolve all of the constitutional issues,however we held that,for a collateral attack on a deportation order,the defendant must show prejudice.id.at emphasis in original.because loaisiga had not demonstrated prejudice,we held that he could not collaterally attack the validity of his deportation order.
in this case,the ij failed to inform luna of his eligibility for c relief,provide him with an opportunity to apply for that relief,or adjudicate his application for relief the government argues that the errors do not render the entry of the deportation order fundamentally unfair under d.however,as was the case in loaisiga,we do not have to resolve the question of whether the agency errors in this cas
