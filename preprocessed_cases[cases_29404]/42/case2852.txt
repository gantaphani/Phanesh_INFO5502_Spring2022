leonard sholla,a native and citizen of albania,entered the united states with a valid tourist visa.shortly after the visa expired,sholla submitted an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture in which he alleged that he was the victim of political persecution in his native country.an immigration judge ij denied these applications,and the board of immigration appeals the board adopted and affirmed the ij decision.sholla petitions this court for review of the denial of his applications for relief,and we grant the petition.
background 
sholla arrived in the united states from albania on december,with a valid tourist visa.the visa expired on june.on june,sholla applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.on october,immigration authorities served him with a notice to appear charging that he was a removable alien under a b.sholla appeared before the immigration court in chicago and admitted removability,and an ij set a date to hear the merits of his applications for relief.after a venue transfer to louis,sholla had his merits hearing via video conference before an ij in oakdale,louisiana,on september.
the facts presented below derive from the testimony of sholla and his brother milto,the only witnesses at the hearing.their testimony was uncontradicted by the government and found credible by the ij,and we therefore present it as such.
sholla was born in kuçovë,albania,in.he was the oldest of six brothers himself,milto,nikollaq,jovan,koco,and vasillaq.during his childhood and much of his adult life,albania was under communist rule.sholla listened to voice of america and radio vatican and soon became an ardent supporter of democratic reforms and a harsh critic of the communist regime.he spoke to friends,family,and whoever would listen about his beliefs.someone in the albanian government learned of his advocacy.in,communist authorities arrested sholla and placed him,his wife zoica,and his daughter valbona in a internment camp.the three were released in.
three of leonard,nikollaq,and became active in the political movement,and jovan political activities led to his arrest and internment from to.the four brothers joined the democratic party in kuçovë upon its official formation in.sholla served as the chairman of the party commission in his electoral zone.milto and nikollaq both served terms as secretary of the party commission,and jovan took an active role in party publicity.the democrats prevailed in the elections at the national level,although the socialist party won in kuçovë.the elections brought the same result.
the albanian economy collapsed in early,citizens rioted in the streets,and the prime minister a democrat resigned.the parties formed a coalition government in march of that year and set an early election date for the new government in late june.sholla and his brothers campaigned for the democrats and appeared at rallies and meetings for the party in may and june.the police at that time were controlled by the socialists,and sholla faced numerous threats from police officers during the campaign.on three occasions,those threats were accompanied by violence.in may,police officers approached sholla after a democratic promotional event in the town of gegë and stated that they needed to clarify some things with sholla.they pushed him into a van,told him that he must withdraw from the party or they would make him disappear,and beat him with rubber batons until he lost consciousness.the police were gone when he awoke,and two strangers found him and returned him to his home.it took three days for sholla to recover from the beating,which bruised his body and left a permanent scar on his upper lip.
less than one month later,sholla was returning from a party meeting when he was stopped by two officers,one of whom he recognized and identified by name for the ij.they led him to their car,drove him to another location,and told him to cease his campaigning efforts for the democrats.sholla refused.the officers beat him while making threats against his life and the lives of his family members.sholla suffered bruises on his arm and head,and he carries a scar on the left side of his head from the beating.he believed that the officers did not kill him because,due to his prominent position in local democratic politics,the murder would have been big news.he spent two days recovering from his injuries and then continued his campaign efforts undeterred.three weeks later and four days before the election,as a peaceful demonstration of democrats was winding down in kuçovë,sholla was again accosted by police officers who threatened his life and beat him in a barbarous way.nikollaq was beaten by two different officers on the same day.
the socialists won the election,and sholla and his brothers continued their work for the democratic party.in january,a bomb exploded in milto house,wounding milto youngest son.he reported it to police,but investigators took no action.milto and his family slipped away to a different part of the country and traveled to the united states in september of that year.he was granted asylum.
around the same time that milto arrived in the united states,a bomb destroyed jovan store.jovan reported it to the authorities,and the chief of police told him that next time his head would disappear.jovan accused the local police of setting the bomb.as a result of his allegations,police arrested and interrogated him but did not file formal charges.jovan and his family went into hiding and ultimately sought refuge in the united states,where jovan was granted asylum.
sholla remained in albania during the two years following the bombings.on the night of september,days before a local men came to his door,armed with assault rifles.they stood outside and sprayed gunfire into sholla home.sholla escaped the attack unharmed,but a bullet wounded the left leg of his youngest son,arnato,who was then fifteen years old.sholla attached a photo of the wound,as well as photos of the bullet holes in his door,to his application for asylum.sholla reported the attack to the authorities,but they took no action.he believes the socialist police were behind the attack because he never received any threats from anyone else.
sholla and his family fled to stay with his in sarandë,albania.sholla obtained a tourist visa from the embassy and entered the united states on december.his wife paid for false documentation and entered the country illegally two years later to rejoin her husband.their three children remain with his wife family in albania.nikollaq also left albania and came to the united states at the same time as sholla,and he was granted asylum one month prior to sholla hearing by a different ij in the same immigration court as the ij who decided sholla case 
milto testified at sholla hearing,as well.he corroborated sholla testimony concerning the family extensive political involvement,the beatings by police,and the brothers fear for their lives in albania.he also authenticated sholla photographs of a wounded arnato and the aftermath of the attack on sholla home.
sholla application for asylum included a letter from the head of the kuçov ë branch of the democratic party describing sholla party activism and corroborating the attacks against him a document from the persecuted association in albania stating that sholla was a member of the group and had been imprisoned in for political activities and other documentation verifying his identity and the identities of his family members.
the ij rendered an oral decision at the close of the hearing.the decision summarized sholla testimony,noting the numerous incidents of violence against him and his brothers and the apparent political motives behind many of the incidents.the ij found sholla testimony to be credible,although it was somewhat troubl ing that the respondent knew of the three beatings in and described them in detail but his corroborative witness,his brother,seemed to believe that one of the events happened in while the other two occurred in.this perceived discrepancy was illusory.in reality,milto testified that sholla was beaten once in may and twice in june,and that sholla suffered an attack on his home in,after milto had fled to the united states.sholla testimony was identical as to the timing of the beatings and the attack on his home.
the ij proceeded to deny sholla claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.as to asylum and withholding of removal,the ij did not dispute the events described in sholla testimony,but nevertheless found that the things that happened to sholla in are not sufficient to meet the burden of proof that the respondent has a fear of future persecution because the record included reports asserting that conditions in albania have improved since that time.as to the attack,the ij gave it little weight and did not credit sholla circumstantial evidence of a political motive,concluding that there just not enough evidence to show that it was carried out or directed by police officers,or that they acquiesced in it.in sum,the ij opinion largely ignores the question of whether the internment,beatings,and attack constituted past persecution,even though the ij found sholla credible and noted that the country reports supported sholla testimony regarding the past incidents of violence against him.the ij opinion contains only one clause addressing the issue of past persecution while the respondent may have been harassed or even subject to police brutality on some isolated occasions seven years ago,the court can not find that rises to persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act.
the ij also denied sholla claim for relief under the convention against torture,finding that there is nothing to show that the experiences that the respondent suffered were so severe that they amount to torture within the meaning of the regulations.
sholla appealed to the board,and it adopted and affirmed the decision of the ij without comment.
ii.discussion 
in an asylum case,w e review the board factual findings for substantial evidence and its legal determinations de novo.ntangsi gonzales,cir.when the board affirms the decision of the ij without a separate opinion,we review the decision of the ij.bushira gonzales,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,we must affirm unless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find that the petitioner qualifies for asylum.ins,d.
to meet the eligibility requirements for asylum relief,an applicant must show that he is unable or unwilling to return to the designated country for removal because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.persecution is an extreme concept that excludes l intimidation and harassment.shoaira ashcroft,cir quotation omitted.it is also a fluid concept,bellido ashcroft,cir,one this court has defined to include the threat of death,the threat or infliction of torture,and the threat or infliction of injury to one person or one liberty on account of a protected ground.ins,cir.if an alien establishes that he was the victim of past persecution,the ij must presume that his fears of future persecution on the same basis are.b.the burden of proof then shifts to the government.id.b ii.to meet this burden,the government must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances that renders the alien fears of persecution unfounded,or that the alien could effectively and reasonably avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the country of removal.id.b i a,b.
at the outset,we note that the ij opinion did not proceed according to analytical framework of.sholla clearly and unquestionably alleged past persecution by state officers on account of his political beliefs.this allegation raises the threshold question of whether he met his burden of proof to establish past persecution,which would entitle him to the presumption of a fear of future persecution in his native country.the ij opinion either ignores this initial step or conflates it with steps that would become appropriate only after deciding this threshold issue.when an alien alleges past persecution,the ij commits legal error if she fails to make a finding on whether the alien did in fact establish past persecution.see bushira,at.in such cases,we will generally remand the case to the board to make such a determination and apply the correct legal standard.id.at.
the opinion proceeds as if sholla had never sought the benefit of the presumption based on past persecution the ij describes the incidents in sholla testimony in light of evidence of improved conditions in albania and concludes that sholla failed to meet the burden of proof to show that he has a fear of persecution.without more,this would warrant remand under the reasoning of bushira.id.at.several pages later,however,the opinion does include an isolated,conclusory statement that the incidents described by sholla do not rise to persecution.while we question whether this statement amounts to a clear,cogent finding on the issue of past persecution given its context,it is nevertheless possible to characterize it as a finding that sholla failed to establish past persecution because the ij believed the incidents in his past were not severe enough to constitute persecution 
fortunately,we need not engage in a delicate interpretation of the ij opinion the question of whether the ij statement amounted to a finding on the issue of past persecution is ultimately irrelevant to our disposition of this case on appeal.even if the ij did make such a finding,substantial evidence would not support it.for the reasons discussed below,we believe the record compels any reasonable factfinder to conclude that sholla suffered past persecution on a protected ground.
sholla,his wife,and his toddler daughter spent two years in a camp because sholla preached the tenets of democratic government in a communist state.one of his brothers served a internment for the same reason.after the cold war ended,sholla and his brothers took an active role in promoting the democratic party in albania.in the three years before sholla fled albania,the police threatened sholla and his family members with death,singled out and brutally beat sholla on several occasions with rubber batons,beat at least one of his brothers,and ordered sholla to cease his political activities.one brother home was bombed,wounding sholla nephew.another brother store was bombed,and a police officer told his brother that next time his head would disappear.masked men with assault rifles fired bullets into sholla home,wounding his youngest son.sholla provided corroborating evidence of these events,including his brother milto consistent testimony,and the ij specifically found sholla credible and gave no valid reasons for questioning the veracity of his claims.
in short,sholla persecutors made numerous and credible threats to kill sholla and his family because of their political activities,punctuated by savage beatings,imprisonment,bombings,and gunfire directed at his home.this country asylum statute would be quite hollow indeed if our definition of persecution required sholla to wait for his persecutors to finally carry out their death threats before sholla could seek refuge here.our accepted definition of persecution is far less demanding,and the numerous incidents that sholla describes fall squarely within it.therefore,we find the evidence sufficient to compel a finding of past persecution.
sholla was therefore entitled to the presumption of a fear of future persecution,which shifts the burden to the government to prove either that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances that negate his otherwise fears of persecution,or that it would be reasonable for sholla to live in a different part of albania and that he could avoid persecution by doing so.b i.the ij did discuss the current country conditions in albania and raised the possibility of relocation,but never with the burden of proof upon the government.on the contrary,the ij repeatedly emphasized that the burden of proof was upon sholla,even when discussing chan
