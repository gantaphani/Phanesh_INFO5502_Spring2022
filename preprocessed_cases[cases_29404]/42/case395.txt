claudy journal,a native and citizen of haiti,petitions for relief from an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the decision of the immigration judge ij denying his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.after careful consideration,we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the bia.
factual background 
on february,journal entered the united states at charlotte amalie,virgin islands without valid entry documents.one month later,he filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal with the immigration and naturalization service ins.the ins issued a notice to appear,charging that journal was subject to removal pursuant to a a i.a removal hearing was scheduled for april,in the virgin islands.journal failed to appear and the ij ordered him removed in absentia.
journal,through counsel,successfully moved to reopen his case.he admitted to the factual allegations in the notice to appear,conceded removability as charged,and sought asylum.he also moved for a transfer of venue and the case was transferred to the district of massachusetts.on november,journal appeared before another ij and testified that he had fled haiti because he was threatened by lavalas,the political party associated with aristide.
the events at issue in this case allegedly occurred in the months leading up to the november presidential election.at the hearing,journal testified about his political activities in speaking out against aristide candidacy and lavalas generally.as a result of those actions,he allegedly received threats from lavalas supporters.specifically,journal testified that on november,lavalas members came to his home and spoke with his mother while he was away at work.his mother later warned him that they were looking for him.the next day,journal and a group of eight to ten other people were distributing leaflets when two lavalas supporters allegedly arrived and assaulted several of the group members.journal testified that he was hit on the head and shoulders before he was able to escape into the crowd and hide.with the assistance of others,he was able to travel,in disguise,away from his hometown of torbeck cayes to,five hours away.two days later he fled haiti,bound for the united states via the dominican republic.
upon questioning by the ij,journal maintained that he was unable to stay in because he feared that the members of lavalas would be able to find and hurt him.his mother and three sisters,who had resided with him in torbeck cayes,were also allegedly threatened as a result of journal political activities and eventually moved to.journal testified that they continue to reside in without any further threats or problems.
on november,the ij denied journal claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat.although the ij found journal to have an honestly held fear of being harmed if he were to return to haiti,she concluded that he had established neither that those fears were nor that he faced a clear probability of future persecution in haiti.she also noted that even at the time of his flight from haiti,his departure did not appear to be imperative to his ability to find safe haven,journal does not appear to have been so active politically that individuals would have known him had he simply chosen to remain in.
on december,the bia reviewed the findings of the ij and affirmed the ij conclusion that journal had failed to meet his burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal.dismissing his appeal,the bia concluded that journal was never harmed and that his family moved to another city in which they have continued to live without incident.journal now appeals 
ii.discussion 
on petition for review of a decision of the bia,this court reviews factual findings under the deferential substantial evidence standard orelien gonzáles,cir.under this standard,we must uphold determinations by the bia unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
in a claim for asylum,the petitioner carries the burden of proving that he qualifies as a refugee by showing either that he has suffered past persecution or has a fear of future persecution on the basis of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.to constitute past persecution,the conduct must extend beyond unpleasantness,harassment,and even basic suffering.topalli gonzáles,cir quoting nelson ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a sufficient showing of past persecution entitles an applicant to a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution.b.absent that presumption,a petitioner must demonstrate that his fear is both genuine and reasonably objective.gonzáles,cir.
in this case,to establish past persecution,journal carries the burden of demonstrating that he was persecuted on the basis of his political opinions.see a b.in determining whether alleged incidents rise to the level of persecution,one important factor is whether the mistreatment can be said to be systematic rather than reflective of a series of isolated incidents.bocova gonzáles,cir.during his testimony,journal alleged only one incident of violence in which he was struck on the head and arms.although the full extent of his injuries is unclear,he testified that he was able to flee without seeking medical treatment substantial evidence supports the ij conclusion that the few events testified to by journal were insufficient to support a claim of past persecution.see,attia gonzáles,cir two altercations in a period and a general climate of discrimination do not suffice as past persecution topalli,at seven arrests accompanied by brief detentions and beatings over a two year period do not rise to the level of persecution bocova,at two beatings by the police accompanied by death threats over a two year period do not amount to persecution.
looking next to whether journal demonstrated a fear of future persecution,we apply a test entailing both subjective and objective elements.see velásquez ashcroft,cir,abrogated on other grounds by bocova,at.in this case,the ij concluded that while journal had testified credibly that he genuinely felt fearful,he failed to meet the objective test which requires a showing by credible and specific evidence that this fear is reasonable.mukamusoni ashcroft,cir.with respect to the threats leveled against journal and his family,all of those threats occurred in his hometown and he conceded that his mother and sisters have not encountered any further threats since their move to.their ability to relocate and continue to live in haiti safely and without harassment significantly undercuts his contention that he would not be safe there.see nikijuluw gonzáles,cir finding that petitioner could not establish a reasonable fear of future persecution where her family lived safely in the country of deportation and there was no other record evidence of risk of future harm.moreover,although he testified that he felt compelled to leave haiti because his fears did not subside after fleeing torbeck cayes,he neither provides an explanation for his continued fears nor references other additional threatening incidents occurring when he was in.
journal ability to obtain an official haitian passport,issued october,than four years after his flight from undermines the reasonableness of his fear.see kheireddine gonzáles,cir petitioners ability to obtain passports in their own names undercuts their claim of persecution.thus,the particular harms and threats suffered by journal fail to support his argument that his fear of future persecution is reasonable.
finally,we address journal claim for withholding of removal.to qualify for relief,the petitioner must meet a more stringent burden of proof than that required for an asylum claim.see ins,d petitioner must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution quoting ins stevic,d internal quotation marks omitted ang gonzáles,cir explaining that withholding of removal requires an alien to establish a clear probability,rather than a fear,of persecution.having failed to meet t
