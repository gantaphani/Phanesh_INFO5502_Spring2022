this case vividly illustrates the labyrinthine character of modern immigration maze of statutes and regulations that engender waste,delay,and confusion for the government and petitioners alike.the inscrutability of the current immigration law system,and the interplay of the numerous amendments and alterations to that system by congress during the pendency of this case,have spawned years of litigation,generated two separate opinions by the district court,and consumed significant resources of this court.with regret and astonishment,we determine,as explained more fully below,that this case still can not be decided definitively but must be remanded to the district court,and then to the board of immigration appeals bia,for further proceedings.
the government appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,judge granting a writ of habeas corpus to petitioner,david anthony drax,who was ordered deported by an immigration judge on the basis of a drug conviction and a conviction for attempted weapons possession.we disagree with the reasoning of the district court and grant the writ on alternative grounds.however,we take this opportunity to commend the district court heroic efforts.we are mindful that district courts are severely constrained in the time and resources they can allocate to any one case and that it is frequently the case that only a court of appeals,at its relative leisure,can devote the excessive time required to penetrate in part this dark thicket of the law.
the principal questions presented on appeal are i whether the immigration and nationality technical corrections act of intca c,stat,codified at,operates retroactively to foreclose discretionary relief from deportation under immigration and nationality act ina c,c,to aliens who,like the petitioner,pleaded guilty to attempted weapons offenses prior to the passage of the intca and ii whether the immigration judge at the petitioner immigration hearing erred by informing the petitioner that no relief was available,precluding him from applying for a combination of relief from deportation and adjustment of status known as gabryelsky relief.
on the first issue,the district court held that ina c relief from deportation remains available to the petitioner because the intca does not operate retroactively to render attempted weapons convictions deportable offenses for which no c relief is available.we hold that the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus on this ground was error because c of the intca does operate retroactively to make attempted weapons convictions deportable offenses and to foreclose c relief from deportation for petitioners like drax who pleaded guilty to such offenses prior to the passage of the intca.
on the second issue,the district court held that because the petitioner chance of success under the gabryelsky process was too attenuated,the immigration judge did not err in failing to recognize that gabryelsky relief was possible.we hold that the petitioner had a reasonable likelihood of success under the gabryelsky process and that,in the circumstances here presented,the immigration judge erred by failing to recognize the availability of such relief.
accordingly,we affirm on alternative grounds the judgment of the district court granting the writ of habeas corpus.we remand to the district court with instructions to remand the cause to the bia to allow the petitioner to pursue gabryelsky relief.
background 
the facts relevant to this appeal are set forth below,as well as in the district court opinion in drax reno,wl,cv,drax i and its superseding opinion in drax ashcroft,d drax ii.
drax convictions 
drax,a citizen of trinidad and tobago,entered the united states years ago,at age fifteen.he obtained lawful permanent resident status in at age.he was married to a lawful permanent resident from until her death in,and he married a united states citizen in april.his father and siblings are naturalized united states citizens.
drax pleaded guilty in new york state supreme court,kings county,on may,to attempted criminal possession of a firearm in the second degree,a class c felony.he also pleaded guilty in that court on april,to sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree,a class d felony.drax was sentenced simultaneously in april to concurrent terms of incarceration of years for the weapons charge and years for the drug charge.
ii.statutory overview 
at the time of drax drug and attempted weapons convictions,he was eligible for discretionary relief from deportation for his drug offense pursuant to ina c c no such relief was required for his attempted weapons conviction because that offense was not a deportable crime under ina a,a c.see discussion,section,post.
in,however,congress enacted the intca,which made numerous changes to the ina including,in intca,changes that made attempted weapons possession a deportable crime for which no c relief is available.intca,stat.at see discussion,section,post.accordingly,assuming that the intca applies conclusion we reach attempted weapons conviction is a deportable offense for which c relief from deportation is not available.
for his attempted weapons conviction,drax may nonetheless apply for a form of relief called adjustment of status,in which a deportable alien status is adjusted,pursuant to ina a a,a,to the status of admissible alien seeking to enter the country see united states,cir describing adjustment of status matter of rainford,same.
adjustment of status,however,is not available for drax drug conviction.see jenkins ins,cir holding that an alien with a drug conviction is barred from adjusting his status to that of a lawful permanent resident under a because his drug conviction renders him inadmissible to the united states pursuant to a a i ii,overruled on other grounds,aguirre ins,cir.
in ins cyr,d,the supreme court,affirming this court decision in the same case,cir,held that certain changes to the immigration laws that would significantly alter the above analysis do not apply retroactively to petitioners such as drax who pleaded guilty prior to the effective date of the changes.see cyr,at.affirming cyr,at.in particular,the supreme court held that congress april,enactment of d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,which severely curtailed the availability of c relief,and its subsequent enactment of b of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,div.c,title iii,stat,which eliminated c relief altogether,do not operate retroactively to bar c relief to petitioners such as drax.cyr,at.
iii.proceedings before the immigration judge and the bia 
in january,the immigration and naturalization service ins commenced deportation proceedings against drax by order to show cause.in july,drax appeared pro se before an immigration judge,admitted his two convictions,and was found deportable.drax i,at.at this appearance,drax asked the immigration judge if he was qualified for any type of a waiver of deportation.id.
the immigration judge,ruling several years prior to our decision or the supreme court decision in cyr,erroneously informed drax that no relief from deportation was available to him under c for his drug conviction because the restrictions in aedpa d applied retroactively to bar any such relief he further informed drax that he was ineligible for an adjustment of status under a because adjustment of form of relief from deportation available to aliens with weapons not available to aliens with drug convictions.ruling that drax was ineligible for relief from deportation under c or adjustment of status under a,the immigration judge ordered drax deported.
on march,drax,still acting pro se,filed an appeal with the bia,which the bia rejected as untimely in july,the legal aid society of new york entered the case as counsel for petitioner and obtained permission to file a late appeal to the bia.in that appeal,counsel for drax argued that aedpa d did not apply retroactively to preclude c relief from deportation to drax because that provision did not apply to aliens who had pleaded guilty,prior to aedpa,to deportable crimes for which c relief was available at the time of the plea.
on may,the bia dismissed drax appeal pursuant to the attorney general opinion in matter of soriano,op.att y,which had to our later holding and the supreme court later holding in aedpa d operates retroactively to restrict the availability of c relief from deportation in all cases,except where an application for c relief was filed prior to the enactment of the statute.in re drax,bia decision,file.the bia therefore held that aedpa d operated to preclude c relief from deportation for drax.
iv.habeas corpus proceedings in the district court 
on june,drax,still represented by counsel,filed a petition in the district court for a writ of habeas corpus.in his petition,he claimed that he should be permitted to apply to an immigration judge for c relief from deportation on the ground that,according to certain district court opinions foreshadowing the supreme court opinion in cyr,such relief remained available to him.see,mojica reno.in opposition,the government asserted for the first time that,even if aedpa d did not apply retroactively,drax would still be ineligible for c relief from deportation for his attempted weapons conviction under the reasoning of cato ins,cir,discussed below in discussion,section.
drax counsel responded by a letter submitted in july,in which he asserted for the first time that,should drax prevail regarding the nonretroactivity of aedpa,drax should be permitted concurrently to seek i c relief from deportation for his drug conviction,and ii a adjustment of status for his weapons conviction.under the holding of matter of gabryelsky,the fact i that c relief from deportation was unavailable because of the weapons conviction,and ii that a adjustment of status was unavailable because of the drug conviction,would both be remedied by the legal fiction that c relief and a adjustment of status take place at exactly the same time,thereby negating each ineligibility as an obstacle to the other proceeding.see drax ii,d at.
on october,the district court granted drax petition for a writ of habeas corpus,holding that drax should be permitted to pursue gabryelsky is,he should be permitted to apply for simultaneous relief under c and a.the district court first concluded that drax had properly exhausted his administrative remedies,as then required by ina c,c,repealed by iirira b,stat.at although drax had not specifically requested gabryelsky relief from the immigration judge or the bia,the district court deemed his pro se requests for any kind of relief and for any type of a waiver,and the immigration judge denial that any relief was available,to be sufficient for exhaustion.drax i,at.
on the merits,the district court concluded that drax remained eligible to apply for c relief from deportation for his drug conviction under cyr,because he had pleaded guilty to his offenses prior to the enactment of aedpa.drax i,at citing cyr,at.with respect to drax weapons conviction,the district court concluded that drax was eligible to apply for a adjustment of status because his father filing of an petition in october had caused a visa to be immediately available before the bia denied drax appeal in may drax i,at.the district court held that because drax had demonstrated that he met the separate eligibility requirements for c relief from deportation for his drug conviction and a adjustment of status for his attempted weapons conviction,he was entitled to a new immigration hearing at which he could request gabryelsky.e,apply for both forms of relief simultaneously.id.
on october,the government filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e requesting that the district court alter or amend its october,judgment.the government argued principally that the district court had misunderstood the application process for adjustment of status pursuant to a,and that,under the actual process,drax had neither made a proper application for adjustment of status nor had a visa immediately available at the relevant time,as required by statute.
on november,the district court issued a second opinion,drax ii,d,in which it adopted the government arguments.the district court held that drax did not qualify for gabryelsky relief because he did not meet the requirement of an immediately available visa.id.at.the court further concluded that no visa ever was immediately available to drax at any relevant time,and that any prospect of eligibility for gabryelsky relief in the future was too attenuated.id.at.because drax failed to meet the independent requirements of a,the district court held,he could not qualify for gabryelsky relief.id.
however,the district court granted a writ of habeas corpus on different grounds by sua sponte identifying a new argument favorable to drax attempted weapons conviction did not render him deportable and,therefore,drax could seek relief from deportation solely by applying for c relief from deportation for his drug conviction id.at.the district court held that drax attempted weapons conviction was not a deportable offense because he had pleaded guilty to the offense one year before the enactment of intca,which for the first time included attempted weapons crimes in the category of weapons crimes for which an alien could be deported under ina,a c drax ii,d at.the district court held that of the intca did not render drax attempted weapons conviction a deportable offense because c did not unambiguously evidence congress intent that it operate retroactively.id.at.the district court gave particular weight to the word technical in the act immigration and nationality technical corrections that t he act innocuous title raises a doubt that congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application of the new law.id.at quoting cyr,at.
a new judgment granting drax petition for a writ of habeas corpus was entered on november.drax ii,d at.
claims on appeal 
the government timely appealed the district court judgment entered on the basis of drax ii,arguing that the district court erred in holding that intca c does not apply retroactively to convictions entered prior to its enactment.the government further argued that the district court was not empowered to consider such a retroactivity argument because drax had not exhausted the claim in ins proceedings.
drax did not the district court denial of his claim for gabryelsky relief.he did,however,renew his argument that he is eligible for gabryelsky relief in his opposition to the government arguments.we hold that drax renewal of his gabryelsky claim in his appellate brief is sufficient for us to consider the claim.an appellee may,without taking a,urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record,although his argument may involve an attack upon the reasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it.international ore fertilizer sgs control,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted appellee in this case does not seek to enlarg e his own rights,under the appeal,but seeks merely to sustain a judgment on grounds with support in the record,that were the basis of district court opinion granting relief in drax i,which was later rescinded upon reconsideration in drax ii.see arlinghaus ritenour,cir t he judgment of a lower court may be affirmed without on the basis of any argument that is supported by the record,whether it was ignored by the court below or flatly rejected.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.drax claim is not an impermissible claim for supplement al relief,see beharry ashcroft,cir,but rather a claim that is inextricably intertwined with the relief ultimately granted by the district court 
accordingly,on appeal we consider the government argument that the district court grant of relief was improper because the intca applies retroactively to bar c relief to aliens with attempted weapons convictions and the petitioner argument that,even if the government is correct,the district court should have remanded to the bia to allow him to pursue coordinated c relief from deportation and a adjustment of status under gabryelsky.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus de novo and the factual findings supporting the grant for clear error.theodoropoulos ins,cir.
ii.the government retroactivity claim 
in drax ii,the district court held that intca does not operate retroactively to make attempted weapons convictions deportable offenses for petitioners such as drax who pleaded guilty prior to the statute enactment.thus,notwithstanding what the court perceived to be the unavailability of gabryelsky relief,it concluded that drax was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus to pursue c relief because intca did not operate retroactively to render drax weapons conviction a barrier to such relief.the government appeals this holding.
we hold,contrary to the conclusion of the district court,that intca operates retroactively to render drax attempted weapons conviction a deportable offense for which c relief is not available.accordingly,the district court erred in concluding that petitioner could pursue c relief from deportation for his drug conviction independent of the gabryelsky system because his weapons conviction served as a bar to such relief.
section c relief 
prior to its partial repeal by aedpa,and subsequent complete repeal by iirira,ina c,c,permitted aliens convicted of certain deportable crimes to seek relief from deportation in the discretion of the attorney general.see note,ante full text of c.in considering an application for c relief,an immigration judge was obligated to balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the granting of section c relief appears in the best interests of this country.united states perez,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
former c by its terms provided relief only from exclusion,and made no mention of relief from deportation.c emphasis added specifically,it provided that aliens convicted of a criminal offense rendering them excludable under a,a,could be granted relief from exclusion in the discretion of the attorney general,provided that the alien had not been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of five or more years.c.
in francis ins,cir,we extended c discretionary relief,which was previously available only to aliens subject to exclusion under a,a,to aliens such as drax who were subject to deportation under a,a current version at a.francis,at see also,cyr,at cato ins,cir.however,because c relief from deportation arose as a judicial extension of that section provision for relief from exclusion,we held that in order for an alien to be eligible to apply for c relief from deportation,an alien deportable offense under a must be analogous to a ground of exclusion contained in ina a.see ins,cir.thus,a c waiver is available in a deportation proceeding only if the reason for deportability under a is substantially equivalent to a ground of exclusion listed in a.cato,at quoting,at emphasis added.
in we recognized an additional category of eligibility for c for aliens whose ground for deportation under a could not possibly be analogous to a ground for exclusion under a because of the inherent differences between deportation and exclusion.see,at holding that,a t least with respect to entry without inspection,a ground of deportation that could not conceivably have such an analogue,there is no basis in statutory text or legislative purpose to preclude this modest extension of the francis rule.
thus,as we later summarized in cato,an alien subject to deportation under a could fall into one of only three categories in terms of the availability vel non of c relief 
the deportee ground of deportation is congruent with a ground of exclusion listed in a.such a deportee is eligible for c relief.
the deportee ground of deportation is one that could not possibly be analogous to a ground of exclusion.such a deportee is also eligible for c relief.
the deportee ground of deportation is one that could conceivably have an analogous ground of exclusion under a but congress has not chosen to include that ground in a.such a deportee is not eligible for c relief.
cato,at emphases added.
at the time of drax plea on his drug charge,his conviction fell into the first,a ground of deportation that is congruent with a ground of exclusion listed in a,rendering the deportee eligible for c relief.accordingly,at that time,he was entitled to apply for c relief from deportation for the drug conviction.
at the time of drax plea on his attempted weapons charge,such an offense did not render him deportable under a,so there would have been no need for c relief on the basis of that conviction.thus,regardless of his attempted weapons conviction,drax was eligible for c relief from deportation for his drug conviction,and if he had received such discretionary relief,then he no longer would have been subject to deportation.
retroactivity of the intca 
in,congress enacted the intca,of which made changes to the above regime that affect the status of drax attempted weapons conviction in particular,b a added attempted weapons crimes to the list of deportable offenses under ina a.however,a,which modified the list of excludable offenses under ina a,did not add attempted weapons offenses to the list of excludable crimes under ina a.under the reasoning of cato,at,thus not only made attempted weapons possession a newly deportable offense,but also rendered attempted weapons possession a deportable offense for which no c relief was available because the crime lacked a mirroring ground of exclusion under a 
accordingly,if intca applies retroactively to petitioners such as drax who pleaded guilty to attempted weapons offenses prior to its passage,then drax attempted weapons conviction clearly precludes him from obtaining relief from deportation under c,notwithstanding his apparent eligibility for such relief on the basis of his drug conviction.we have not previously considered whether intca reclassification of attempted weapons crimes as deportable offenses applies retroactively to deprive aliens convicted of such offenses of c relief from deportation.we conclude,contrary to the holding of the district court,that the clear language of retroactivity in c renders it applicable to convictions for attempted weapons offenses entered prior to the intca effective date,thereby eliminating the availability of c relief from deportation for aliens convicted of such crimes.
section c of the intca states as follows the amendments made by this section shall apply to convictions occurring before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this act.intca c,stat.at see note,ante full text of.in kuhali reno,cir,we considered a nearly identical iirira,stat.at,amending the offenses considered aggravated felon ies under the ina and stating that the amended definition would apply to convictions entered before,on,or after the date of the enactment,applied to convictions entered prior to the statute effective date.kuhali,at.we determined that the before,on,or after language in iirira satisfied the supreme court requirement that there be clear congressional intent favoring a retroactive result.id.quoting landgraf usi film products,d internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore held that kuhali,whose convictions had not rendered him deportable prior to the passage of iirira,was not eligible for c relief.see also united states,cir noting the retroactivity of the same before,on,or after language of iirira in the context of an sentencing enhancement 
unlike the provision of iirira at issue in kuhali,however,the intca immigration and nationality technical corrections that the act makes only technical corrections.the district court emphasized that the word technical in the act title could be read to indicate that congress did not clearly intend to amend c substantively and retroactively,thereby rendering the language contained in c insufficiently clear to justify its retroactive application.drax ii,d at.however,regardless of the meanings that may be attributed to the term technical,the plain language of the body of c erases any doubt about retroactivity that could possibly be inferred from the word technical in the title.while the title of a statute is a tool available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute,united states,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted,the title of a statute can not limit the plain meaning of the text,pennsylvania dep t of corrections yeskey,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.for interpretive purposes,a title is of use only when it sheds light on some ambiguous word or phrase.id.internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted.the phrase before,on,or after contained in c is not ambiguous therefore,the word technical in the title can not limit the plain meaning of c,and the district court erred in relying on it for interpretive purposes.
the word technical failing to create any meaningful distinction between the language of retroactivity used in intca c,and that contained in iirira,the instant case is indistinguishable from kuhali.the amendment at issue here,like the amendment considered in kuhali,expressly states that its expansion of the offenses considered to be deportable crimes under a applies to convictions entered before,on,or after the amendment effective date.intca c,stat.at iirira,stat.at.based on the plain meaning of the language before,on,or after,and our interpretation of indistinguishable language in kuhali,we conclude that c of the intca retroactively renders aliens convicted of attempted weapons possession deportable,without the possibility of c discretionary relief from deportation.
because we hold that intca operates retroactively,drax attempted weapons conviction is a deportable offense for which c relief from deportation is not available.the district court thus erred in allowing drax to rely solely upon the availability of c relief for his drug conviction to avoid deportation 
iii.petitioner gabryelsky claim 
we now turn to drax claim that the immigration judge at his immigration hearing erred by holding that,pursuant to aedpa,he was not eligible for any type of a waiver,thereby precluding him from applying for gabryelsky relief.
relying on ins regulations in force the bia in matter of gabryelsky,held that an alien such as drax who 
i on his drug conviction,is eligible for c relief from deportation but ineligible for a adjustment of status yet 
ii on his weapons conviction,is eligible for a adjustment of status but ineligible for c relief from deportation,
can simultaneously apply for both forms of relief.gabryelsky,at.gabryelsky relief operates under the legal fiction that the c and a procedures occur at exactly the same time,thereby eliminating the obstacle to relief otherwise posed by the other conviction.see drax ii,d at.
as the district court noted,the t he gabryelsky method has been adopted by the bia,and endorsed by the courts.drax ii,d at citing,inter alia,snajder,cir demore,no,wl,at,cinquemani ashcroft,rjd,wl,at,calderon reno,d,in re,see also united states,cir citing gabryelsky,without discussing gabryelsky relief.we agree that the gabryelsky process is a viable method of seeking discretionary relief from deportation in this circuit.
under gabryelsky,in order to have been eligible to apply for relief before the immigration judge,drax had to be simultaneously eligible to apply for both i c relief from deportation for his drug conviction and ii a adjustment of status for his weapons conviction.we hold i that drax remained eligible for c relief for his drug conviction at the time of his initial hearing before the immigration judge and ii that although drax was not eligible for an adjustment of status at the time of his immigration hearing,the immigration judge erred in holding that drax could under no circumstances become eligible for such relief,because such relief as described below was a reasonable possibility if the immigration judge had been willing to grant drax a continuance.
because the immigration judge erroneously indicated to on his understanding that aedpa d applied no relief at all was available and that he had no discretion to allow drax to seek any type of a waiver,drax was deprived of the opportunity to seek a favorable exercise of discretion through the gabryelsky process that could have prevented his deportation.we therefore grant the writ of habeas corpus to permit drax the opportunity to petition an immigration judge simultaneously for discretionary relief under c and a 
c relief for drax drug charge 
we hold that c relief remains available for drax drug charge,notwithstanding the numerous changes to the immigration law regime that have taken place since his april,plea.
on april,congress enacted aedpa,of which d expanded the category of criminal convictions that would render an alien ineligible to apply for c relief.cyr,at.specifically,d provided that c relief could not be granted to an alien convicted of any aggravated felony regardless of the associated prison term,almost all drug offenses,certain weapons or national security violations,or multiple crimes of moral turpitude.see aedpa d,stat.at drax ii,d at.shortly thereafter,on september,congress enacted iirira.section a of iirira,which applies to all proceedings commenced after april,repealed c in its entirety,replacing it with a form of relief called cancellation of removal.see iirira,a,stat.at,codified at a.
if the stringent standards of aedpa and iirira were applied retroactively in this case,they would clearly bar any possibility of c relief from deportation for the petitioner drug charge.however,in ins cyr,d,the supreme court affirmed this court conclusion that the provisions of aedpa and iirira limiting and repealing c do not apply retroactively to an alien defendant who pleaded guilty before the passage of aedpa id.at.the court held that c relief remains available for aliens,like drax,whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.id.
however,the government argued in its reply brief before the district court that the supreme court decision in cyr did not preserve drax eligibility for c relief on his drug conviction because drax was not in fact eligible for c relief from deportation at the time of his plea to that charge on april.the government asserts that drax was ineligible for c relief from deportation for his drug conviction because,in accordance with our holding that his weapons conviction is a deportable offense for which no c relief is available,his attempted weapons conviction precluded such relief at the time of his plea to the drug offense.
we reject this argument for two reasons.first,it conflates the independent disadvantages that resulting from each of drax two convictions.it is not the case that drax,at the time of his plea,was ineligible to apply for c relief from deportation for his drug conviction rather,he was eligible for such relief,but application for such relief alone would have been futile in light of his independent deportability on the weapons offense.second,an application for c relief from deportation for drax drug offense at the time of his plea would not have been futile as part of an application for relief under the gabryelsky process,which offers coordinated relief from both convictions.
thus,because the enactment of aedpa and iirira had no effect on drax continued eligibility for c relief from deportation for his drug conviction,the key factor determining whether drax may apply for gabryelsky relief is the availability of an adjustment of status for his attempted weapons conviction.
a adjustment of status for drax attempted weapons charge 
the adjustment of status regime 
adjustment of status is a form of relief that allows a deportable alien who would be admissible to the united states if he were seeking to enter the country to adjust his status to that of an alien seeking entry.ina a,a see,at see also matter of rainford,a n adjustment of status is merely a procedural mechanism by which an alien already within the united states is assimilated to the position of one seeking to enter the united states.like c relief from deportation,an adjustment of status under a is entirely discretionary.thus,even where an alien satisfies the statutory requirements of eligibility for an adjustment of status discussed below,the ins has discretion under section to deny the application.jain ins,cir see also ins bagamasbad,d holding that the ins need not examine an alien statutory eligibility for adjustment of status where the ins exercises its discretion to deny such relief.
it is clear i that drax is not eligible for an adjustment of status under a on the basis of his drug conviction because an alien with a drug conviction is not considered to be admissible,see jenkins ins,cir,overruled on other grounds,aguirre ins,cir,but ii that drax could be eligible for an adjustment of status on the basis of his weapons conviction alone because a weapons conviction will not preclude a showing of admissibility for purposes of section a,rainford,at.therefore,if we find that drax is eligible for adjustment of status based on his weapons conviction,then that eligibility,combined with his eligibility for c relief from deportation for his drug conviction,would entitle him to pursue gabryelsky relief.accordingly,we must examine in detail the complex requirements of the a process to determine whether an adjustment of status is available to drax with respect to his weapons offense.
the text of a states that an adjustment of status is available to an alien only if the alien makes an application for such adjustment,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.a see note,ante full text of statute.drax meets the second requirement because,as noted above,drax is admissible to the united states and eligible to receive an immigrant visa despite his weapons conviction,and he the gabryelsky for c relief from deportation to eliminate the adverse impact of his drug conviction.
compliance with the statute first and third requirements requires an alien to undertake a process.first,either the alien or a family relative must file a petition for an immigrant visa,so that at some point in the future such a visa may become immediately available to the alien,a.second,the alien must file an application for adjustment of status when such an immigrant visa becomes immediately available.a.
an alien who,like drax the son of a united states citizen,seeks to obtain an immigrant visa on the basis of a familial relationship must cause the relevant family member to file an visa petition,or petition for alien relative,on his behalf.ina a,a ina a a i,a a i a.after the relative has filed the petition,the ins will approve the petition after verifying that the claimed familial relationship is bona fide.an approved petition carries with it both a preference category and a priority date.the preference category corresponds to the familial relationship between the alien and the person filing the form.see ina,the priority date is the date on which the approved petition was filed.c g.subject to a limited exception an alien beneficiary may file the adjustment application only after the ins has approved the visa petition.a i b emphasis added.
the processing time for approval of an petition varies depending on whether an alien is involved in deportation proceedings.for aliens subject to deportation proceedings,the government informs us that petitions are frequently processed in an expedited manner that takes between sixty days and six months,although processing sometimes takes longer.macpherson aff.of.for aliens not subject to deportation proceedings,the government informs us that processing of petitions currently takes between eight and months.laramie aff.of.when the ins approves an petition,the petition is forwarded to the national visa center for further processing,and a notice of approval is sent to the alien.
once an alien petition has been approved by the ins,an alien must still wait until a visa is immediately available in order to file his application.a see g an alien is ineligible for the benefits of section of the act unless an immigrant visa is immediately available to him or her at the time the application is filed.emphasis added a i a.whether a visa is immediately available depends on the alien priority date and the length of the waiting period for a visa in the alien preference category,as indicated in the department of state bureau of consular affairs visa bulletin at the time the application is filed.see g see also rainford,at.according to the applicable regulation,a n immigrant visa is considered available for the purpose of accepting and processing the application form i f the preference category applicant has a priority date on the waiting list which is earlier than the date shown in the bulletin or the bulletin shows that numbers for visa applicants in his or her category are current.g emphases added 
to illustrate the intricate provisions for adjustment of status more concretely,we consider drax situation.
drax eligibility for adjustment of status 
in drax i,the district court erroneously relied solely upon drax father filing of an petition in october to conclude that drax had a visa immediately available,and was thus immediately eligible for an adjustment of status and,hence,gabryelsky relief.drax i,at.the court mistakenly believed i that the filing of an petition was sufficient to constitute an application for adjustment,as required by a,and ii that a visa was immediately available at the time the petition was filed because the january visa bulletin which appears to be the most recent visa bulletin the court had available showed that there was no for a visa in drax preference category.id.at.
after the government filed its rule e motion,the district court in drax ii reconsidered its ruling and concluded that a visa was not available to petitioner at any time before his case was closed and that the immigration judge statement you are not eligible for any kind of relief was not a misstatement given that drax was not prima facie eligible for adjustment of status or gabryelsky relief at that time.drax ii,d at.the court rejected drax argument that the immigration judge could have granted him a continuance to pursue an adjustment of status because it found the argument to be a rather remote possibility that was too attenuated for it to be the basis for a successful habeas corpus petition.id.
we agree with the district court determination that drax was not at any relevant time eligible for an adjustment of status or gabryelsky relief.drax father first filed an petition in october.the record is unclear as to whether that petition was ever approved,but assuming,arguendo,that it was approved in a relatively short period of time,two to six months,at no point during the course of his deportation proceedings did a visa ever become immediately available.an examination of the relevant visa bulletins shows that a visa was not available until february for any petition with a priority date of october.see dep t of state,bureau of consular affairs,visa bulletin,id.because drax appeal to the bia was denied in may,he did not have an immediately available visa on the basis of his father petition at any time during the pendency of his deportation proceedings.nor was a visa immediately available to drax on the basis of his wife petition because it was not filed until may,which also the bia rejection of his appeal.
drax potential eligibility for adjustment of status 
we can not,however,agree with the district court conclusion that the immigration judge error of law was harmless because the possibility of gabryelsky relief in the near future was too attenuated for it to be the basis for a successful habeas corpus petition.drax ii,d at.we believe that gabryelsky relief was a reasonable possibility if the immigration judge had recognized that c relief from deportation for petitioner drug charge remained available,and had granted drax a continuance to pursue relief.
at petitioner immigration hearing on july,drax then proceeding pro se asked,a m i qualified for any type of a waiver after reviewing drax file and noting that he was the son of a naturalized american citizen and had been convicted of both a drug offense and a weapons offense,the immigration judge stated as follows during a colloquy with the petitioner 
ij i told you there is no relief available for you.and,i want you to understand one simple thing about that.that means when the,when the congress says that a person is convicted of selling drugs ca stay there.it means the judge discretion or his decision making powers is taken away from him.i do have any discretion in your case.that why i not listening and considering all those things that you told me already.i did listen,you know i listened.i heard you.i heard every word of it.but,i ca consider it to help you because you are legally barred by the laws of the congress from staying here in this country.
ij okay.i going i said,there is no relief available to you.i going to outline every one of them for you that i know of.
ij you not eligible for a c because it been taken away.you have an aggravated felony drug sale.you not eligible for an adjustment of status.you never were eligible for an adjustment of status because adjustment will not waive a drug offense.and,it never did.so you not eligible for that 
as discussed in the preceding sections,the immigration judge conclusion was incorrect because,contrary to what he believed,c relief had not been eliminated by aedpa or iirira with respect to petitioner drug charge.instead,the supreme court decision in cyr made clear that such relief remained available to petitioners such as drax,who pleaded guilty prior to the enactment of aedpa to crimes for which c relief was then available.cyr,at.with c relief from deportation available for drax drug charge,and an adjustment of status under a potentially available for his weapons conviction,gabryelsky relief was indeed a possibility at that time.however,two separate times the immigration judge,no doubt acting in good faith,emphasized to the petitioner that he had no discretion,and that congress had tied his hands,though in fact such discretion existed.
with the benefit of a favorable exercise of the immigration judge discretion,drax could indeed have become eligible for an adjustment of status and gabryelsky relief.to allow drax to pursue an adjustment of status,the immigration judge could have i informed drax of the availability of an adjustment of status,ii instructed drax to have a relative file an form on his behalf,and iii granted a continuance for a reasonable amount of time to enable drax to obtain a visa.had the immigration judge given drax such instructions at his july,hearing,and if drax father had thereupon promptly filed an petition,the petition would have had a priority date in july.assuming that it would have taken the ins less than months to approve the petition a realistic assumption,see discussion,section,ante,an immigrant visa would have become immediately available to drax in october of.see dep t of state,bureau of consular affairs,visa bulletin.therefore,had the immigration judge been willing to grant a continuance of months,drax would have become eligible for an adjustment of status,and hence gabryelsky relief,during the course of his immigration hearing 
furthermore,even if the immigration judge had recognized the nonretroactivity of aedpa d and the potential availability of gabryelsky relief but,in the exercise of his discretion,declined to grant him a continuance to pursue such relief,drax still might have secured relief.if drax father had filed an petition in july,at the same time that drax was ordered deported,drax would have had a visa immediately available to him in october,see visa bulletin,allowing him to file an application at that time.an application filed at any time prior to the bia rejection of his appeal in may would likely have been considered timely under the a regime.see,at noting that petitioner could have requested that the bia consider the petition in determining whether he was eligible for an adjustment of status,which suggests that an application filed before the bia would be timely.although it seems doubtful that an petition filed after the bia has rendered a final decision would be timely the fate of an petition filed after an immigration hearing,but before a final bia determination,is at the very least an open question.see drax i,at discussing the absence of clear authority on this question.it suffices to note that,even without a continuance from the immigration judge,drax might have succeeded in petitioning for relief from deportation if the immigration judge had merely recognized that gabryelsky relief was a possiblity.
it is clear in this case that the immigration judge had the discretion to craft relief that would have prevented drax from being deported.however,because of an error of law,the immigration judge believed that he lacked such discretion,and drax was thus precluded from seeking gabryelsky relief.we have frequently held in the sentencing context that a failure to exercise discretion,where a judge mistakenly believes that he lacks the authority to exercise discretion,warrants a remand for resentencing.see,united states ventrilla,cir united states thorpe,cir collecting cases see also cyr,at.holding that it is historically appropriate,on habeas review,to correct a failure to exercise discretion,even where it is not clear that such discretion would have been exercised favorably.we hold that the immigration judge failure to exercise his discretion in the mistaken belief that he lacked the authority to do so was prejudicial error 
the immigration judge error of law with respect to the retroactivity of aedpa d,and his consequent failure to exercise his discretion to determine whether to facilitate such relief,warrant the reopening of drax deportation proceedings.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus to permit drax to pursue gabryelsky relief before an immigration judge.as both c relief from deportation and a adjustment of status are discretionary,the immigration judge will need to determine whether petitioner case merits a favorable exercise of the judge discretion.
we instruct the bia on remand to permit the petitioner to pursue gabryelsky relief by allowing drax to make a renewed application to adjust his status pursuant to a.to the extent that drax may benefit from any changes in his circumstances since his appearance before the immigration judge in such as his marriage to a united states citizen in april,and his having obtained an approved petition on the basis of that relationship,the bia is instructed to give drax the benefit of those changed circumstances.furthermore,to the extent that drax is prejudiced by having to begin the process than starting immediately following his hearing before the immigration judge in july,as he presumably would have done if the immigration judge had not erroneously informed him that no relief was bia is instructed to fashion such relief as may be appropriate to return him to the position in which he would have been absent the immigration judge error.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,and with an appreciation of the extraordinary effort invested in this case by both the immigration judge and the district court,the judgment of the district court granting drax petition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed,as modified i to preclude c relief from deportation outside of the gabryelsky process because such relief is foreclosed by retroactive application of intca,and ii to permit the petitioner to pursue gabryelsky relief before an immigration judge.the cause is remanded to the district court,with instructions to remand to the bia.in light of the extended prolongation of the administrative and judicial proceedings in this case,we direct the bia and ij to give expedited consideration to this matter.
