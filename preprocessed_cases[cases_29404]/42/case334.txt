the petitioner,eduardo,sees due process violations at every twist and turn.we distill his array of arguments into three claims of error namely i that the immigration judge ij failed to initiate a competency hearing ii that the board of immigration appeals bia incorrectly affirmed the ij adverse credibility determination and iii that the bia adjudicated his administrative appeal despite a gap in the administrative record discerning no merit in any of these claims,we deny the instant petition for judicial review.
background 
the facts,which we draw mainly from the ij decision and the exhibits referenced herein,are uncomplicated.
the petitioner is a native and citizen of colombia.he was apprehended while attempting to enter the united states,using his brother passport,in october of.an immigration officer interviewed him at the point of miami airport.in a sworn statement given to this interviewer,the petitioner stated that his motivation for repairing to the united states was largely economic he had been out of work in his native land and wanted a job.as an apparent aside,he also mentioned some vaguely defined trouble with the national liberation army eln,a paramilitary guerilla group.according to country reports admitted into evidence,the eln exercised some significant control over parts of colombia notwithstanding the colombian government efforts to curb the group demonstrated penchant for violence.
two days later,a different immigration officer conducted a credible fear interview.during that session,the petitioner denied having an affiliation with any political faction,describing the eln interactions with him as attempted extortion that came about after eln members mined the records of the local chamber of commerce in search of prospects.
immigration officials referred the matter to the immigration court.removal proceedings were instituted,and the petitioner for asylum.
at a hearing held in november of,the petitioner told a new and different story.he explained that he had been a liberal party activist in colombia from forward.in that capacity,he had spent his weekends campaigning year after year for various liberal party candidates.his duties included making speeches,handing out political,counting votes,and monitoring elections.he testified that,on two occasions in,eln members directed him to curtail his political involvement and ordered him to give them money.he paid off his tormentors but did not forgo participation in partisan politics.
the petitioner further testified that his brother,a fellow liberal party member,was shot and killed in.the petitioner witnessed the slaying.he asserted that his family subsequently received a letter from the eln taking credit for the homicide and linking it to the family political activism.
the petitioner grisly tale did not end there.he said that his was killed in killing that he also attributed to the eln,citing his family receipt of a letter to that effect.
notwithstanding these alleged maraudings,the petitioner recounted that he remained in colombia and persisted in his political activities.in,however,he claimed to have been shot twice during a confrontation with the eln.he complained to both the police and the army,but to no avail.shortly thereafter,he fled to the united states.
the ij considered the petitioner testimony,the country reports,and other documentary evidence.he emphasized the stark contrast between the petitioner hearing testimony and the petitioner earlier statements as well as the utter absence of any extrinsic evidence corroborating either the petitioner political involvement or any problems with the eln.on that basis,the ij found the petitioner testimony incredible,denied his request for asylum,and ordered his removal.
the petitioner attempt to appeal to the bia was at first stymied because the administrative record had disappeared.when the record was located,the petitioner claimed that it was incomplete inasmuch as it did not contain the transcript of a master calendar conference,held on a date not specified by the petitioner,at which he purportedly appeared with a high fever and handed the ij notes from the emergency room records of a local hospital.the petitioner described this conference as brief and acknowledged that the only business transacted was the rescheduling of the merits hearing.
deeming the record sufficiently intact to permit intelligent review,the bia overruled the petitioner objection and processed his appeal.in the end,it affirmed the ij ukase.this timely petition for judicial review followed.
ii.standard of review 
following the filing of a petition for judicial review of a final order of removal,this court typically reviews the decision of the bia.but when,as now,the bia adopts portions of the ij opinion,we review those portions of the ij opinion as well.bebri mukasey,cir romilus ashcroft,cir.
findings of fact,including credibility determinations,are reviewed under the familiar substantial evidence rubric.under this deferential formulation,contested findings will be upheld as long as they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.segran mukasey,cir quoting ins,d.this means that the agency determination must stand unless the facts,taken in the aggregate,point unerringly in the opposite direction,laurent ashcroft,cir,or compel a contrary conclusion,segran,at.given these precepts,a credibility determination will endure if and to the extent that the ij has given reasoned consideration to the evidence and has provided a cogent explanation for his finding.chhay mukasey,cir pan gonzales,cir.
we review most legal questions,including the due process challenges launched here,de novo.see ins,cir.we accord deference,however,to the agency reasonable interpretations of statutes and regulations that it administers.see segran,at see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
iii.analysis 
the petitioner brief is not a model of clarity.as best we can tell,he appears to be making three basic claims of error.we address these claims sequentially.
competency.
the petitioner most loudly bruited claim is that his mental impairment was so obvious throughout the course of the proceedings that the ij,acting sua sponte,should have initiated a competency evaluation.in the petitioner view,this failure transgressed the due process clause.we do not agree.
as a matter of background,it is important to recognize that not every trial error sinks to the level of a due process violation.this principle has special relevance in asylum proceedings,in which the relief sought comprises a discretionary grant by the attorney general.see laurent,at see also b a.aliens seeking asylum are entitled to basic procedural protections and to a fair not to a one.see pulisir mukasey,cir brue gonzales,cir.
in this context,fundamental fairness means in general terms that the alien must have a meaningful opportunity to present evidence and be heard by an impartial judge.see,sok mukasey,cir,at.in managing an asylum hearing,however,an ij may work within wide margins without offend ing the principle of fundamental fairness.laurent,at.
an incompetent alien is entitled to additional procedural safeguards to help ensure the realization of his due process right to a fundamentally fair hearing.as authorized by statute,b,the attorney general has promulgated regulations that spell out the additional rights of aliens who are handicapped by mental incompetency.see,c.as we shall explain,this case does not require us to probe those regulations 
whether an alien is competent is a different question.the petitioner here was represented by in the first instance,it is the advocate role,not the ij,to broach the issue of mental competence.see brue,at see also sok,at.in this instance,the petitioner counsel failed to raise the issue of competency in the immigration court,nor did he request that an evaluation of the petitioner competency be undertaken.the failure to raise a competency issue in a timely manner renders an ensuing claim of error particularly weak.see sok,at.put another way,where as here a petitioner fails to bring the possibility of incompetence to the attention of the immi
