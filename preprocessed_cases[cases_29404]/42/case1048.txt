petitioner hong ying gao gao petitions for review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision summarily affirming an immigration judge ij denial of her claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,treaty doc.gao argues that the ij erred in finding that she did not have a fear of forced marriage and in finding that a forced marriage,even were it to occur,would not constitute persecution under paragraph a of title of the united states code,which sets forth the grounds for establishing asylum eligibility.
we agree with gao that the ij,in finding that gao problems were not on account of a legally protected ground,failed to apply the correct definition of the particular social group ground as established by bia and judicial precedent.as this precedent makes clear,the statutory term particular social group is broad enough to encompass groups whose main shared trait is a common one,such as gender,at least so long as the group shares a further characteristic that is identifiable to persecutors and is immutable or fundamental.we further find that the ij decision was based,in part,on certain factual conclusions reached without substantial evidence namely,that the government might be willing and able to protect gao and that gao could internally relocate within china.accordingly,we remand for further proceedings.
background 
factual history 
because the ij found gao to be credible,we take as true the facts gao presented to the ij.see bocova gonzales,cir.gao,who was twenty years old when she left china,grew up in a rural village in the fujian province.in this region of china,parents routinely sell their daughters into marriage,and this practice is sanctioned by society and by the local authorities.
when gao was nineteen years old,her parents,through a broker,sold gao to a man named chen zhi in return for an payment of rbm,gao parents promised that gao would marry zhi when she turned.gao parents used this money to pay off previous debts.at first,gao acquiesced in the arrangement under pressure from her parents.however,because zhi soon proved to be,and gambled,and beat her when she refused to give him money,gao decided that she did not want to marry zhi.when gao tried to break their engagement,zhi threatened her.he also threatened that,if she refused to marry him,his uncle,a powerful local official,would arrest her.gao had heard that zhi uncle had arrested other individuals for personal reasons,and so she was afraid the same would happen to her.
to escape zhi,gao moved an hour away by boat and took a job in the mawei district of fuchou.zhi continued to visit gao family and demand that she marry him,and when her parents refused to tell him where she had moved,he vandalized their home.zhi also figured out that gao was living in mawei by following her to her boat one night when she was returning from a visit with her family.about half a year later,gao fled to the united states out of fear that,if she remained in china,she would be forced to marry zhi.since gao left,zhi and his cohorts have continued to harass her family,to the point where the family has had to move repeatedly.
ii.procedural history 
at her hearing,gao testified to the events described above.in addition to gao testimony and a corroborating affidavit from her mother,the ij had before her the state department country report on human rights practices in china country report,which described widespread domestic violence and trafficking in brides and prostitutes.the country report explained that this problem is fueled by the gender imbalance that has resulted from selective abortions and infanticides of female offspring,and that the problem is worse in rural areas.the country report also stated that,although the central government has been trying to prevent trafficking in women,its efforts have been hampered by official corruption and by active resistance on the part of village authorities.
at the end of the hearing,the ij issued an oral decision denying gao asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.the ij found gao credible,but concluded that gao had not made out a claim for asylum or withholding of removal.specifically,the ij found that gao predicament did not arise from a protected ground such as membership in a particular social group,but was simply a dispute between two families.the ij also found that the record did not establish that the government would not protect her from zhi.finally,the ij found that because gao was able to relocate safely to another city,she did not need asylum in the united states.the ij also,without separate analysis,denied gao cat claim.the bia summarily affirmed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the ij determination of mixed questions of law and fact,as well as the ij application of law to facts.ins,cir.we review bia interpretations of ambiguous immigration and nationality act as the meaning of particular social group with the deference described in chevron natural res.def.council,d.we do not,however,give chevron deference to summary bia affirmances of ij interpretations.see shi liang lin dep t of justice,cir 
by contrast,the scope of our review of an ij factual findings is narrow,and we uphold such findings so long as they are supported by substantial evidence.jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the substantial evidence standard,however,is slightly stricter than the standard generally applied to a district court factual findings.id.at.we require more than a mere scintilla of evidence,or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we also require some indication that the ij considered material evidence supporting a petitioner claim.poradisova gonzales,cir see also anderson mcelroy,cir w e can not assume that the bia considered factors that it failed to mention in its decision.internal quotation marks omitted.it is not our role,moreover,to assume factual findings supporting denial on the basis of record evidence not relied on by the bia.jin shui qiu,at.
applying these principles here,we review de novo the ij interpretation of the legal term particular social group assume without deciding that the ij interpretation might be entitled to skidmore deference based on its inherent persuasiveness accord chevron deference to relevant bia precedent and review under the substantial evidence standard the ij findings of fact as to whether gao could have sought government protection relocated within china.
ii.the governing law 
to establish eligibility for the discretionary relief of asylum,a petitioner must show that she has suffered past persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or that she has a fear of future persecution on these grounds.see a.an alien fear may be even if there is only a slight,though discernible,chance of persecution.diallo ins,cir citing ins,d.if an applicant satisfies the higher burden of demonstrating that such persecution is more likely than not,she is automatically entitled to withholding of removal under b.see diallo,at.an applicant is also entitled to cat relief if she establishes that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c see ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.
the three issues in this case,which we address in turn,are whether gao established that she might be forced into marriage on account of membership in a particular social group whether the ij had a substantial basis for finding insufficient evidence that the chinese authorities would not protect gao and whether the ij had a substantial basis for finding that gao could safely relocate within china.the government appears to concede,as it must,that forced marriage is a form of abuse that rises to the level of persecution.moreover,as the ij and bia failed to address gao cat claim,we simply remand that claim for consideration by an ij or the bia in the first instance.
particular social group 
the five grounds protected under paragraph a race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,and political verbatim from the united nations protocol relating to the status of refugees protocol,entered into force,congress expressly modeled its law on the protocol so that the two would be consistent,at,as reprinted in.of the various categories,particular social group is the least on its face,and the diplomatic and legislative histories shed no light on how it was understood by the parties to the protocol or by congress.there is,fortunately,a substantial body of case law,although its value as precedent is somewhat limited by the nature of asylum cases.
the landmark bia case for what can constitute a social group is matter of acosta,which,in the context of holding that salvadoran taxi drivers were not a cognizable social group because they could change professions,set forth the following standard 
w e interpret the phrase persecution on account of membership in a particular social group to mean persecution that is directed toward an individual who is a member of a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic.the shared characteristic might be an innate one such as sex,color,or kinship ties,or in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.the particular kind of group characteristic that will qualify under this construction remains to be determined on a basis.however,whatever the common characteristic that defines the group,it must be one that the members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.
bia emphasis added,overruled in part on other grounds by matter of mogharrabi,bia see also in re fauziya kasinga,bia recognizing as a particular social group young women of the tribe who have not had female genital mutilation,as practiced by that tribe,and who oppose the practice matter of,bia recognizing cuban homosexuals as a particular social group matter of fuentes,bia recognizing that former members of the salvadoran national police could comprise a particular social group,but finding insufficient evidence of future danger.
courts of appeals have deferred to matter of acosta broad interpretation of particular social group as encompassing any group,however populous,persecuted because of shared characteristics that are either immutable or fundamental.in fatin ins,cir,for example,alito writing for the third circuit considered and rejected a petition by an iranian woman who had been living in iran since before the islamic revolution and who claimed that,if she were removed to iran,she would be forced to conform to fundamentalist islamic norms.id.at.the court reasoned thus 
we believe that there are three elements that an alien must establish in order to qualify for withholding of deportation or asylum based on membership in such a group.the alien must identify a group that constitutes a particular social group within the interpretation just discussed,establish that he or she is a member of that group,and show that he or she would be persecuted or has a fear of persecution based on that membership.
in the excerpt from acosta quoted above,the board specifically mentioned sex as an innate characteristic that could link the members of a particular social group.thus,to the extent that the petitioner in this case suggests that she would be persecuted or has a fear that she would be persecuted in iran simply because she is a woman,she has satisfied the first of the three elements that we have noted.she has not,however,satisfied the third element that is,she has not shown that she would suffer or that she has a fear of suffering persecution based solely on her gender.
id.at.the court reached this last conclusion because there was no record evidence that women in iran were systematically persecuted for being women.id.at.
the fatin court went on to consider fatin suggestion that her social group was those iranian women who find those laws so abhorrent that they refuse to though,according to the petitioners brief,the routine penalty for noncompliance is lashes,a year imprisonment,and in many cases brutal rapes and death.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court agreed that this may well be a cognizable social group under the asylum law but found that fatin had not demonstrated that she was part of such a social group because she was not politically active here,testified that she would try to avoid complying with the government dress code and other norms but not that she would take any risk necessary,and failed to establish that the new iranian norms were abhorrent to her,as opposed to merely objectionable.id.at.
the reasoning in fatin may be taken to suggest that the proper balance to strike is to interpret particular social group broadly requiring only one or more shared characteristics that are either immutable or fundamental while interpreting on account of strictly such that an applicant must prove that these characteristics are a central reason why she has been,or may be,targeted for persecution.as the tenth circuit explained in niang gonzales,the focus with respect to claims should be not on whether either gender constitutes a social group which both certainly do but on whether the members of that group are sufficiently likely to be persecuted that one could say that they are persecuted on account of their membership,cir quoting a a.
other circuits have also deferred to matter of acosta broad definition of particular social group.see ins,cir recognizing as a particular social group in mexico gay men with female sexual identities,and holding that a particular social group is one united by a voluntary association,including a former association,or by an innate characteristic that is so fundamental to the identities or consciences of its members that members either can not or should not be required to change it lwin ins,cir recognizing parents of political dissidents as particular social group under matter of acosta immutability test ins,cir recognizing petitioner family as a particular social group courts of appeals have also followed the bia holding in in re fauziya kasinga,at,that young women who reasonably fear customary genital mutilation are eligible for asylum under the particular social group rubric.see mohammed gonzales,cir niang,at abay ashcroft,cir.although this court has not had occasion to consider de novo whether women facing genital mutilation could comprise a particular social group,we did find an applicant eligible for asylum based on her fear of genital mutilation in a case where the bia conceded that the alleged harm was on account of abankwah social group but found that she had not presented sufficient proof of past or future harm.see abankwah ins,cir accord balogun ashcroft,cir noting agency concession.
the general law in our own circuit on particular social groups is less clear.in gomez ins,we denied the petition of a woman whose asylum claim was based on the fact that she had been raped and beaten by guerilla forces on five different occasions between the ages of twelve and fourteen,cir.gomez argued that,because of her past,she belonged to a particular social group women who have been previously battered and raped by salvadoran guerillas that was likely to be singled out for further persecution.id.at.in rejecting this argument,we used broad language that could and has been read as conflicting with matter of acosta,see,niang,at.in particular,in our general statement of law,we wrote that p ossession of characteristics such as youth and gender will not by itself endow individuals with membership in a particular group.gomez,at see also saleh of justice,cir citing gomez,and rejecting as potential social groups yemeni moslems residing outside of yemen and poor yemenis who could not afford to pay blood money to buy their way out of a death sentence for murder.
however,in the analysis portion of gomez,this court rejected gomez claim not because the social group she defined was too but rather because there is no indication that gomez will be s
