qing hua lin petitions this court for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals board dismissing her appeal from the immigration judge ij order finding that she was not eligible for asylum,withholding of removal,or deferral of removal under the convention against torture cat.for the reasons stated below,we deny lin petition for review.
lin is a native citizen of the people republic of china china.she illegally entered the united states near hidalgo,texas on august.on october,the department of homeland security commenced removal proceedings against lin by issuing a notice to appear,charging her with removability under a a i i of the immigration and nationality act,a a i i,as an alien who,at the time of application for admission to the united states,was not in possession of valid entry documents.lin then sought relief from removal in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.ja.following several hearings,the ij issued an order and written opinion denying lin application and ordering her removed to china.ja.lin appealed to the board,which affirmed the decision of the ij.lin then timely appealed to this court.
the disposition of this case turns primarily on discrepancies between petitioner statements at different stages of the asylum process.accordingly,we detail below the relevant testimony and materials from lin interviews,hearings,and written application for asylum.
border patrol interview,august,
lin was interviewed by a border patrol agent immediately upon being apprehended entering the country the border patrol interview or interview.during the interview,lin stated that she was not married and that she had one child.ja.when asked what her purpose was for entering the united states,she responded t o avoid population control regulations in china.ja.when asked whether she feared persecution if sent back to china,she indicated that she planned to have more children,and that she would be forced to have an abortion or undergo a tubal ligation if she became pregnant again.ja.she also stated that she feared she would be unable to get married if she was sterilized.id.finally,lin explained that because she had given birth out of wedlock,which is seen as in china,she instructed her son to refer to her as auntie.id.
credible fear hearing,september,
by this time lin had retained an attorney.ja.during the hearing,and in contrast to the border patrol interview,lin stated that she was married to a man named dehua jiang,who continued to reside in china with their son.ja.notably,she also stated that she left china because she had been forced to undergo an unwanted abortion on january.ja.this fact was not mentioned during lin border patrol interview.following the abortion,her husband went into hiding for fear that he would be sterilized and he encouraged lin to seek refuge in the united states.ja.
asylum application and supporting documents 
on april,lin submitted an application for asylum and a written statement.the statement provided that lin married jiang on september.ja.in,four months after the birth of her son,family planning officials from the chinese government forced lin to have an iud implanted and submit to regular gynecological checkups.id.the statement also discussed the forced abortion.id.
in support of her asylum application,lin also submitted several documents an abortion certificate from the first hospital of fuzhou,a notice from yang zhong village committee requesting that lin appear for an iud and pregnancy checkup,and a notice from yang zhong village committee notifying lin that she had violated the family planning regulations and fining her yuan.ja.lin also submitted a statement from her,providing that lin and her son were married in.ja.her described lin forced abortion and how family planning officials continue to visit her house on a regular basis looking for lin and her husband.ja.finally,lin submitted a statement from her husband.he provided that the two were married in september and that the marriage was permitted and blessed.ja.he also recounted the circumstances of lin forced abortion and the couple decision that she seek refuge in the united states.ja.
state department report on china 
the government submitted a report from the united states department of state on china population control policies.ja.the report stated that the policies were no longer strictly enforced and that there have been few reports of forced abortions or sterilizations in fujian province over the last twenty years.id.
first merits hearing,august,
lin gave the following testimony in support of her asylum claim before an ij on august,
lin married jiang on september.ja.their only child,a son,was born on march.ja.four months after his birth,family planning officials came to her home and took her to a birth control office to insert an iud.ja.lin was instructed that she would have to attend seasonal checkups to ensure the iud remained inserted and that she had not become pregnant again.ja.
on january,after learning that lin was pregnant again five family planning officials came to lin rented house in fuzhou city,forced her into a van,and performed an unwanted abortion on her at a local hospital.ja.after the procedure,she was told that she would have to pay a yuan fine,and that if she did not her husband would be arrested and forcibly sterilized.ja.
when asked by the ij whether she was given any documentation regarding the abortion,lin stated that originally she was not,but a few days after the procedure she returned to the hospital and requested an abortion certificate.ja.when asked why she requested the document,she first stated that she wanted to have proof for the future,and because she assumed that america has human rights,and i think that certificate will be useful in the future.ja.the ij then asked her whether she was already planning to come to america,and she stated not yet i just assumed that this certificate would be useful to me in the future.ja.under further questioning,lin then changed her answer,stating that she requested the document so she could take a vacation from work.id.when the ij noted that lin was,she changed her answer once again,stating that she was in fact planning on applying for asylum in the united states at the time she requested the documentation and thought it would be helpful for that purpose.ja.
status conference and submission of additional government evidence,november,
the ij held a status conference in the matter on november.at the hearing,the government requested that the court consider additional evidence that was part of lin file but had not been discovered by the government attorneys until after the close of evidence.ja.the additional evidence consisted of the recorded notes from lin september,border patrol interview.id.over petitioner objection,the ij decided to accept the evidence and hold a second evidentiary hearing so the parties would have an opportunity to address the new evidence.id.
second merits hearing,january,
at the second hearing,lin was asked why she told the border patrol agent during the interview that she was not married.lin responded,i n our village,our practice is,if you did not have the,you know,banquet,if you did not have the chinese ceremony,you really are not consider ed married.id.when asked why she responded differently at the credible fear hearing,she said that her attorney had told her in the interim that in the united states if you are registered at the court you are considered as married.ja.in essence,lin blamed the contradictory testimony on a cultural misunderstanding.lin conceded,however,that she registered her marriage with the chinese government in.ja.
lin was also questioned why she did not mention the forced abortion during the border patrol interview.in vague and answers,she indicated that the agent conducting the interview told her not to provide details of her claim and that she could tell her full story to a judge later.ja.she also stated that she did not think there was room on the agent form to record detailed answers.ja.
on march,the ij issued a decision denying lin applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat,and ordered her removed to china.ja.the ij found lin not credible in light of the inconsistencies,implausibilities,and contradictions in her testimony,her application,and her statements during the border patrol interview.ja.the ij also found that lin attempts to explain the inconsistencies and omissions were vague,and did not provide credible explanations.id.
specifically,the ij noted that lin told the border patrol agent that she was not married and 
s he was afraid that she would be forced to have an abortion or tubule sic ligation and that if she were forced to have a tubule sic ligation,she was afraid that she would never be able to get married.despite discussing her fear of a future forced abortion,lin did not tell the border patrol officer that she had previously had a forced abortion.in marked contrast,lin testified in court that she was already married and had been forced to have an abortion.
ja.the ij found lin explanations for the inconsistencies wholly inadequate and incredible.id.the ij noted that lin cultural misunderstanding explanation regarding her marital status was undermined by the fact that during her first hearing she repeatedly testified that she was married,and only after she was confronted with her inconsistent testimony did she manufacture her explanation.ja.the ij also found that lin husband affidavit referring to their marriage as permitted and blessed undercut lin claim of a misunderstanding.
of even greater significance to the ij,however,was lin failure to mention her forced abortion during her border patrol interview.id.the ij explained 
lin attempted to blame the omission on the border patrol officer rushing her.lin was repeatedly evasive and unresponsive when asked directly whether she told the border patrol officer that she had a forced abortion.only after being asked repeatedly did lin admit that she did not tell the border patrol officer about her alleged forced abortion.lin attempted to explain that she wanted to tell the officer about the abortion,but he told her that there was no space for details and to tell the judge.the court finds this explanation entirely incredible.the alleged forced abortion is not a detail,but rather is the crux of lin entire asylum claim it is wholly implausible,therefore,that lin would not have mentioned an experience as pivotal and traumatic as a forced abortion,when she had sufficient opportunity to describe other details about her alleged fear of returning to china.
the ij also noted that he had reservations about lin credibility even before the omission regarding the forced abortion came to light.id.specifically,the ij found implausible lin explanations for why she obtained the abortion certificate.ja.the ij noted that lin changed her testimony on this issue several times,first stating that she requested the certificate because she knew the united states protected human rights,then stating she needed it in order to take a vacation,and then finally reverting back to her original position.id 
given these inconsistencies,the ij determined that lin testimony was not credible.ja.noting that an adverse credibility determination can be overcome if the alien can independently prove past persecution,the ij determined that lin had not provided sufficient evidence to prove she was the victim of a forced abortion.id.the ij discredited the abortion certificate as unauthenticated and suspect in light of lin testimony,and noted the state department report that population controls are no longer strictly enforced in china.id.accordingly,the ij denied all of lin claims.
the board agreed with the ij decision in all pertinent parts and adopted its decision denying lin claims.ja.it held that the ij provided specific and cogent reasons for the adverse credibility determination,repeating the ij concerns with lin testimony.ja.the board also agreed that lin failed to provide independent evidence proving that she suffered past persecution.ja.additionally,the board rejected lin argument that the ij decision allowing the government to submit additional evidence violated her due process rights.id.the board noted that ijs have the authority to set and extend deadlines and that lin was given an opportunity to respond to the new evidence.id.
where the board affirms and adopts the ij decision,we review both decisions as the final agency action.marynenka holder,cir.we are obliged to uphold the agency determination unless it is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.lizama holder,cir.the agency abuses its discretion if it fail s to offer a reasoned explanation for its decision,or if it distort s or disregard s important aspects of the applicant claim.tassi holder,cir.factual determinations are reviewed only to ensure they are supported by substantial evidence.marynenka,at.substantial evidence exists to support a finding unless the evidence was such that any reasonable adjudicator would have been compelled to conclude to the contrary.id.review of the agency overall conclusion that an applicant is ineligible for asylum is similarly limited to whether the applicant evidence was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.ins elias zacarias.this standard is very deferential,and does not permit a of the evidence.see niang gonzales,cir if the record plausibly could support two results the one the ij chose and the one the petitioner advances,reversal is only appropriate where the court find s that the evidence not only supports the opposite conclusion,but compels it.quoting balogun ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the ina vests in the attorney general the discretionary power to grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees.dankam gonzales,cir.a refugee is someone who is unable or unwilling to return to his native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of political opinion or other protected grounds.id.quoting a a.asylum applicants may satisfy their burden of proving that they meet the definition of a refugee by showing either that they were subjected to past persecution or that they have a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.marynenka,at quoting b.a person who was forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization shall be deemed to have a fear of persecution on account of political opinion.a.
aliens face a heightened burden of proof to qualify for withholding of removal.dankam,at.the alien must establish a clear probability that she would suffer persecution if repatriated.id.if an alien meets this heightened burden,withholding of removal is mandatory.id.lin also seeks protection from removal under the cat,which requires aliens to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that they would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal,regardless of the grounds for the torture.id.
lin first contends that substantial evidence does not support the agency adverse credibility determination.applicants can establish their eligibility for asylum simply by providing credible testimony about their experiences.marynenka,at citing c.a.review of an adverse credibility determination is limited to ensuring that substantial evidence exists to support it.dankam,at.we accord broad deference to the agency credibility determination.this deference,however,is not absolute,for the agency must provide specific,cogent reasons for making an adverse credibility determination.djadjou holder,cir.we have recognized that omissions,inconsistencies,contradictory evidence and inherently improbable testimony are appropriate bases for making an adverse credibility determination.id.even the existence of only a few such inconsistencies can support an adverse credibility determination.id.following passage of the real id act of,an inconsistency can serve as a basis for an adverse credibility determination without regard to whether it goes to the heart of the applicant claim.b b iii.
as recounted above,the agency gave multiple reasons for the adverse credibility determination.chief among them,however,were the inconsistencies between lin statements during the border patrol interview and her later testimony and application materials.lin gave shifting,contradictory accounts of her marital status and omitted any mention of her forced abortion.after reviewing the record,we agree with the agency that these omissions and inconsistencies provide sufficient justification for the adverse credibility determination.
the foundation of lin claim is that she was subjected to a forced abortion however,when interviewed upon entering the country,she failed to mention the incident at all.we are highly skeptical of such an important omission.as the agency noted,the forced abortion is not a detail,but rather is the very heart of lin claim for asylum.the traumatic details of the incident as later described by lin,including being forced into a van and whisked away to the hospital,make it wholly implausible that she would fail to even mention the incident during the interview.see xiao mukasey,cir holding a petitioner failure to mention a past forced abortion during an airport interview sufficient to warrant an adverse credibility determination.the omission is particularly suspect in light of the fact that lin specifically referenced a fear that she would have to undergo future forced abortions if she was returned to china,but failed to mention the fact that she previously had been subjected to the very same experience.
lin explanation for the omission that the border patrol agent told her he could not record the details of her claim is undermined by the fact that lin was able to mention several other details of her past,such as the fact that she was unmarried,had a child out of wedlock,and instructed her son to refer to her as auntie.perhaps most importantly,lin acknowledged that she obtained the abortion certificate with an eye toward using it to help her gain asylum in the united states.this indicates that she was already aware of the significance of the incident with regard to a future asylum claim,making her omission all the more suspect.
we also agree with the ij decision discounting lin explanation that a cultural misunderstanding accounted for her inconsistent testimony regarding her marital status.her explanation is undermined by the fact that she repeatedly and unqualifiedly referred to herself as married throughout the asylum process,only to change course when confronted with her earlier,inconsistent testimony.further undercutting her claim are her husband affidavit attesting that the couple marriage was permitted and blessed,and the statement from her referring to the couple as married.taken together,these facts give ample support for the ij determination that lin testimony was not credible.
in concluding that,under the facts and circumstances of this case,lin inconsistencies and omissions between her border patrol interview and her later testimony are sufficient to support the agency adverse credibility determination,we note our hesitation in relying so extensively on statements made in such a setting.most airport interviews are brief affairs given in the hours immediately following long and often dangerous journeys into the united states.these circumstances caution against basing an adverse credibility determination solely on inconsistencies and,especially,omissions that arise out of statements made in such environments.as evidenced by the questions asked of lin,the purpose of these interviews is to collect general identification and background information about the alien.ja.the interviews are not part of the formal asylum process,and are conducted without legal representation and before most aliens are aware of the elements necessary to support a claim for asylum.requiring precise evidentiary detail in such circumstances ignores the reality of the interview process and places an unduly onerous burden on an alien who later seeks asylum.
it is for these reasons a significant number of our sister circuits have limited the extent to which credibility determinations may be based on airport interviews.see,moab gonzales,cir a irport interviews are not always reliable indicators of credibility i nterviews in which the questions asked are not designed to elicit the details of an asylum claim,or the ins officer fails to ask questions that would aid the alien in developing his or her account are less reliable.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir sotomayor,the airport interview is an inherently limited forum for the alien to express the fear that will provide the basis for his or her asylum claim,and the bia must be cognizant of the interview limitations when using its substance against an asylum applicant.see also joseph holder,cir citing singh ins,cir tang attorney general,cir zubeda ashcroft,cir.we hereby note our general agreement with the concerns expressed by these and other circuits over the agency unqualified reliance on statements made in airport interviews.
with these considerations in mind,we repeat why they fail to rescue lin claim for asylum.lin allegation of a forced abortion is not a minor evidentiary detail whose absence can be overlooked,it is the very core of her claim.moreover,her acknowledgment that she requested documentation of the procedure for the express purpose of supporting a future asylum claim indicates that she understood the importance of the incident.we therefore simply can not countenance her complete failure to mention it during her interview.we also note that lin testimony regarding her marital status was not a mere omission,but a direct contradiction for which she later was unable to provide a believable explanation.
we also agree with the agency assessment that lin demeanor and during questioning on certain topics support the adverse credibility determination.for example,lin testimony as to why she requested the abortion certificate was initially hesitant and confused.as explained above,she changed course several times before finally admitting that she thought the certificate would be helpful in supporting a future asylum claim.ja.similarly,lin gave a series of answers to direct questions from the ij asking whether she told the border patrol agent about the forced abortion.ja.only under repeated questioning did she acknowledge that she did not mention the procedure.id.lin dubious testimony in these areas is especially significant given that they relate directly to the forced abortion,a topic about which there is already considerable question.
in sum,far from compelling a contrary result,the evidence in this case reliably supports the agency adverse credibility determination.see niang,at.the ij provided specific and cogent reasons for the decision,and we will not disturb the result in the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary 
although adverse credibility determinations are generally fatal to an asylum claim,an applicant may still prevail if she can prove actual past persecution through independent evidence.camara ashcroft,cir.we conclude that the agency properly reviewed the record and determined that lin failed to provide independent evidence demonstrating past persecution.
as discussed above,the abortion certificate provided by lin is suspect in light of her unreliable testimony.in addition,her evidence of a fine for a violation of family planning regulations,which by itself is hardly demonstrable proof that she suffered a forced abortion,is countered by reliable evidence from the department of state that family planning regulations are no longer strictly enforced in the area.see suarez valenzuela holder,cir noting that state department reports are highly probative evidence of conditions in foreign countries quoting gonahasa ins,cir.the agency also considered the affidavit from lin husband,but determined that it in fact hurt lin claim by contradicting her testimony regarding the couple marital status.in any event,we have previously held that evidence offered as corroborating evidence must be objective for it to be considered by the immigration judge and bia.letters and affidavits from family and friends are not objective evidence in this context.djadjou holder,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.and although lin is correct in noting tha
