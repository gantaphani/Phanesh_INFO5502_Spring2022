petitioner jean yves brezilien,a native and citizen of haiti,petitions for review of the final decision of the board of immigration appeals bia sustaining the government appeal of an immigration judge ij grant of asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.the ij initially found brezilien removable under a a i i,as an alien who had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.brezilien,appearing pro se,conceded removability but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.he asserted a fear of future persecution on account of his ties to former haitian president aristide and the lavalas political party,and a fear of torture on account of his criminal status in the united states,which he argued would subject him to indefinite detention in deplorable conditions in haiti.
on three separate occasions,the ij granted brezilien relief from removal.the government appealed the ij rulings to the bia,and each time the bia reversed the ij decision.the bia held that brezilien fear of future persecution was speculative,that he could avoid harm through internal relocation,and that there was no pattern or practice of persecution of aristide or lavalas supporters in haiti.
all of the bia decisions leading up to its final decision are properly before us in this proceeding.brezilien raises a number of challenges to the bia rulings,some of which are unexhausted or the bia failed to address,and therefore we do not reach the merits of those arguments.we agree,however,with brezilien main argument that the bia violated its own d i iii when it engaged in factfinding to deny brezilien asylum,withholding,and cat claims.the bia also improperly reversed the ij factual finding,without applying the clearly erroneous standard of review,that brezilien and his family suffered persecution because of their ties to the lavalas party.the bia errors of law require that we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.in light of our disposition on this issue,we need not address brezilien remaining challenges to the bia disposition of his asylum and withholding claims.
flight from haiti 
brezilien is a native and citizen of haiti.from until he fled haiti in,brezilien was an active supporter of former haitian president aristide he distributed leaflets and attended rallies for aristide,wore an aristide that had been personally autographed by aristide,and posted many pictures of aristide in his neighborhood,including one in front of his family home.he also canvassed the countryside and urban neighborhoods before and on the day of the election,garnering support for aristide.when brezilien stood at the polls on election day and showed voters how to vote for aristide party,several government soldiers observed his activities.
brezilien family was associated with aristide and aristide party,lavalas,primarily through brezilien father remon.remon had known aristide from a young age and served as his personal bodyguard during his election campaign and presidency.two of brezilien older brothers,corlod and renoll,also worked for aristide.as a boy,brezilien sometimes accompanied his father to work and thus was seen with aristide.
on september,the night before the coup that displaced aristide,brezilien was at home in with his father and his younger brother,gerald.his father was not on duty that day as aristide bodyguard.insurgent soldiers known as ton ton macoutes,who would eventually oust aristide,shot at brezilien house that morning.in the evening,brezilien father received phone calls from friends warning him to stay at home.later that night,the soldiers returned and shot at the house again.when brezilien father opened the door to see who was outside,the ton ton macoutes shot and killed him.
brezilien and gerald hid in the basement while the ton ton macoutes,who knew the boys were inside,continued firing at the house.after spending a day in the basement,brezilien came out when he heard a neighbor talking outside.the neighbor allowed brezilien and gerald to spend that night at his house,and the next day drove them forty kilometers to leogane,where they stayed with the neighbor relative for one month.after about one month of living in fear and hiding from the rebel military search for aristide supporters,brezilien and his brother fled by bus to a remote village,louis.
on november,when brezilien was years old,he and gerald left haiti in a boat with other people.after two or three days,the coast guard intercepted the boat and transported its occupants to the guantanamo naval base in cuba.immigration officials interviewed brezilien and paroled him into the united states.he was subsequently granted asylum on june,and lawful permanent resident status in.
visits to haiti 
brezilien subsequently returned to haiti three times,each time for less than two weeks.in,brezilien traveled to haiti because two of his older brothers had been killed by the ton ton macoutes.his mother told him that they had been working in a political office for rene preval and aristide in.according to brezilien mother,one of his brothers was gunned down as he entered the office,and then the ton ton macoutes went inside the office and shot his other brother.no one was arrested in connection with the murders.
although he was afraid to do so,brezilien returned to haiti for his brothers funerals.fearing that someone would recognize and kill him,brezilien dressed as a woman after his arrival in haiti.because the ton ton macoutes knew that brezilien mother and his deceased father were affiliated with aristide,he felt that he could not safely stay at his mother house.brezilien stayed instead with his aunt,who was not,and did not travel to at all.brezilien attended his brothers funerals,both held on the same day,though he felt that it was dangerous for him to do so.when he left haiti,brezilien again took precautions so as not to be recognized.
despite ongoing political turmoil in haiti,brezilien returned on two other occasions,in and,to visit his mother,who was hospitalized with heart problems.although brezilien did not want to return to haiti,his mother thought she was going to die,and asked him to come see her.during both trips,brezilien disguised himself at the airport.he stayed with his aunt and uncle and did not go out,fearing that his life was in danger.
arizona criminal conviction 
on february,following an encounter with sonya white,who is the mother of brezilien united states citizen daughter,brezilien was charged with aggravated assault under arizona revised statutes sections a,b,a,a,and.he ultimately pled guilty to attempted aggravated assault and was sentenced to a deferred period of four months in maricopa county jail with furlough consideration and three years probation,which he completed in one year and six months.thereafter,brezilien conviction was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor.
when brezilien returned from haiti in july after visiting his ailing mother,he applied for admission as a returning lawful permanent resident at the miami international airport.he was told to report to the department of homeland security dhs office in phoenix with copies of his criminal record.when brezilien reported to dhs,he was taken into custody and issued a notice to appear,which charged him as removeable under a a i i as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.brezilien admitted the factual allegations in the notice to appear,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat,arguing that he would be subject to persecution and torture if returned to haiti.
additional facts relevant to asylum and cat claims 
brezilien testified before the ij in that it would be dangerous for him to live anywhere in haiti.he testified that if he were to return,the ton ton macoutes would kill him,as they had killed his father and brothers.brezilien further testified that although many of the ton ton macoutes left haiti,some of them remain,hoping to return to power.brezilien fears that they will recognize him as a lavalas supporter.brezilien continues to support lavalas and believes that aristide reelection in represented a positive change for the people of haiti.
brezilien also fears that if he is removed to haiti,he will be imprisoned upon his return because of his assault conviction,and will be killed in prison by incarcerated affiliates of the ton ton macoutes.
while brezilien was in custody,he was unable to speak with his family in haiti.when brezilien spoke in september with his younger brother gerald who lives in phoenix,he learned that his two older brothers,osni and jean lobar,are in the dominican republic.the whereabouts of brezilien mother,sister jeana,and brother osnar are unknown.
first hearing and appeal 
on august,brezilien appeared before an ij for his initial asylum hearing.brezilien requested a continuance to consult with an attorney,which the ij granted.at his next hearing,on september,brezilien appeared without counsel,though he stated that a lawyer with whom he had spoken told him she would be at the hearing.the ij decided to proceed in her absence because brezilien was not on his list of detainees represented by counsel.upon questioning by the ij,brezilien admitted that he was a citizen of haiti who had been granted asylum in and that he had been convicted of attempted aggravated assault in.on the basis of these two admissions,the ij found brezilien removable as charged.although brezilien had previously been granted asylum,he reapplied for asylum,and also applied for withholding of removal and cat relief.on december,the ij granted brezilien second application for asylum.the ij found that because he had admitted the factual allegations in the notice to appear,brezilien had conceded the charge of removability,a finding he now contests.the ij then found by clear and convincing evidence that the removal charge had been sustained.nevertheless,the ij noted that brezilien had been granted asylum in,and at that time had established a fear of persecution.the ij determined that the government bore the burden of showing that circumstances in haiti had changed so dramatically that brezilien fear was no longer valid.
the ij found that brezilien was a credible witness.because brezilien had been in haiti when the coup occurred and when the ton ton macoutes had stormed his house,kidnapped and killed his father,and fired shots into the house,the ij found that brezilien was entitled to the presumption of future persecution upon which his previous grant of asylum had been based.the ij also assessed the record and found that brezilien had suffered past persecution.the ij granted brezilien asylum and withholding of removal,but did not rule on the application for cat relief.
the government appealed,and on september,the bia reversed the ij decision.rejecting the ij determination that brezilien had suffered past persecution,the bia stated that its review of the record revealed no evidence that brezilien had ever been the intended target of harm,and that therefore he had no objective fear of persecution.without reversing the ij credibility finding,the bia remanded to the ij to allow brezilien to demonstrate that changed country conditions qualified him for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.
second hearing and appeal 
on remand,the ij once again found brezilien credible and examined his testimony in light of changed country conditions in haiti.the ij concluded that brezilien had established a fear of persecution on account of his political opinion or imputed political opinion.in so ruling,the ij did not specifically consider whether it would be reasonable for brezilien to relocate within haiti.on december,the ij again granted asylum and withholding of removal,and again declined to rule on the application for cat relief.
the government appealed,and on november,the bia again reversed.the bia noted that the ij provided no analysis as to whether brezilien would be identified as a lavalas supporter and concluded that brezilien had failed to demonstrate that he would be recognized as such.relying on its determinations that brezilien had failed sufficiently to explain how anyone would recognize him after approximately years outside of haiti,had not shown that the deaths of his brothers and aunt were tied to their political involvement with the lavalas party,and did not claim that his mother or brother had been harmed on account of their involvement with the lavalas party,or that brezilien had been threatened or harmed during his trips to haiti since his original grant of asylum,the bia found that brezilien had failed to demonstrate a fear of persecution in haiti.the bia further found that brezilien could avoid identification as a lavalas supporter by living outside of.the bia reversed the grant of asylum and withholding of removal and remanded to the ij for consideration of other forms of relief.
third hearing and appeal 
at his third hearing,brezilien asked the ij to consider his asylum and withholding of removal claims in light of worsening conditions in haiti.the ij declined,noting that the bia had already reversed his two prior asylum rulings.on january,the ij issued an oral decision granting brezilien application for cat relief.the ij found that criminal deportees who are returned to haiti are detained for an indeterminate amount of time,and that the conditions of detention in a haitian prison could amount to torture.
both parties appealed the ij january,decision to the bia.the bia reversed the ij grant of cat relief,finding that such relief could not be based solely on prison conditions in haiti and the indefinite detention of detainees,in light of in re,bia and theagene gonzales,cir.the bia also rejected brezilien argument that he would be targeted for torture by the authorities while detained due to his political affiliations,as well as his argument that worsening country conditions qualified him for asylum because,in its view,brezilien had failed to establish how he would be recognized throughout the country as an aristide supporter.the bia remanded to the ij to enter a final order of removal that encompassed all of the ij and bia decisions.the ij entered the order on june.brezilien timely petitioned for review.
