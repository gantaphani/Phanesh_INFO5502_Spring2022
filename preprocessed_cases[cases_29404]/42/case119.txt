after congress passed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of prwora,narrowing the eligibility of for medicaid and other federal benefits,the state of maine responded in by extending medical assistance benefits to certain legal aliens rendered ineligible for medicaid.in,the maine legislature terminated these benefits.the appellants allege that this termination of their benefits violated their rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,and presently appeal from the district court denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction.finding no constitutional violation,we affirm the district court denial of a preliminary injunction and remand for dismissal.
medicaid is a cooperative program created in as an amendment to the social security act in order to help states provide medical assistance to certain needy citizens.see fed of indep.bus.sebelius.a state participation in the medicaid program is voluntary,but once a state chooses to participate it must comply with federal statutory and regulatory requirements in order to receive federal matching funds.see,id.at id.at,roberts,joined by breyer and kagan,jj.frew ex rel.frew hawkins.the eligibility requirements for medicaid coverage are governed by federal law.under the medicaid act,participating states must provide full medicaid services under the approved state plan to certain groups of individuals who meet the eligibility criteria,including categorically needy groups.see a a i,a lewis thompson,cir.for years,federal medicaid extended medical assistance to eligible individuals without regard to citizenship status or durational residency.by act of congress,however,the alien eligibility requirements for benefits,including medicaid,changed dramatically in.see.
in enacting prwora,stat.also known as the welfare reform act,congress restricted the ability of aliens to access federal public welfare benefits,including medicaid.see.prwora divided into categories of qualified and aliens,see id,b,and further restricted eligibility for federal welfare benefits by imposing a united states residency requirement for most qualified aliens,see id.although prwora authorized states to expand the category of qualified aliens eligible for federal benefits,it prohibited the states from extending federal benefits to most aliens residing in the united states for less than five years.see id.b 
prwora left the states more discretion in the dispensation of state public benefits,authorizing the states to determine the eligibility for any state public benefits of an alien who is a qualified alien,including qualified aliens residing less than five years in the united states.id.a.the maine legislature accordingly responded to prwora by enacting public law,chapter,section a the state legislation,codified at.tit,b,as amended,which empowered the state department of health and human services dhhs to provide medical assistance benefits to aliens residing in maine.although these benefits were purely,this program was jointly administered with the cooperative medicaid program for eligible citizens and qualified aliens,and both the program and the state medicaid program became known as mainecare.in june,however,the maine legislature passed public law,chapter,section kk the state legislation,a budgetary measure that terminated medical assistance benefits for aliens residing less than five years in the united states,essentially repealing the state legislation.in september,dhhs sent form termination notices to approximately,informing them that their mainecare benefits were being terminated and that they would remain eligible only for emergency care benefits.
the appellants hans bruns and kadra hassan represent a class of aliens residing in maine and rendered ineligible for medical assistance benefits as a result of the state legislation.bruns filed this class action complaint against mary mayhew in her official capacity as the commissioner of dhhs in april,and moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the state legislation.in the complaint,bruns alleged that the state violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by continuing to provide mainecare benefits to united states citizens while denying those benefits to similarly situated due solely to their alienage.
the commissioner opposed the motion for a preliminary injunction,and also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.in november,the district court denied without prejudice the commissioner motion to dismiss.although the relevant legislative history and statutory provisions strongly suggested that the appellants were not similarly situated to united states citizens and eligible aliens receiving medicaid and thus that they were not treated unequally by the state of maine,the district court concluded that this determination ultimately came too close to a factual finding and was therefore inappropriate to resolve on a motion to dismiss.
in march,the district court denied the appellants motion for a preliminary injunction.the court found that the state had effectively operated two separate medical assistance programs and that the appellants,as aliens receiving benefits from a state program,were not similarly situated to recipients of federal medicaid.accordingly,the court concluded that the appellants were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim.secondarily,the court also concluded that the appellants had not established a potential for irreparable harm.this appeal followed.
we review the denial of a preliminary injunction under a deferential standard,reversing only upon finding a mistake of law,a clear error in,or other abuse of discretion.org.for marriage daluz,cir.to obtain a preliminary injunction,a plaintiff must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council.we have recognized the first two factors,likelihood of success and of irreparable harm,as the most important in the calculus.gonzález droz gonzález colón,cir.the appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that they had demonstrated neither a likelihood of success on the merits of their equal protection challenge nor a likelihood of irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction.because we hold that the appellants can not succeed on the merits of their claim,we need not consider the likelihood of irreparable harm.
the appellants argue that the termination of their medical benefits under the legislation represented selective treatment by the state of maine.in the appellants estimation,the state action discriminated against a suspect class and therefore warrants strict scrutiny,requiring the state to demonstrate that the alienage classification advances a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means available.
the commissioner advances no argument that the state legislation would survive strict scrutiny.instead,the crux of the commissioner defense,and of the district court ruling,is that maine did not discriminate against aliens and in favor of citizens at all.the commissioner suggests that the only distinction implicated in this case was the one drawn by congress in prwora,a distinction subject only to deferential rational basis review in light of the federal government broad authority over immigration and naturalization.
this case thus intertwines a core question of equal protection jurisprudence,concerning the proper scope of comparison in determining whether a plaintiff is similarly situated to another group or entity treated more favorably under the law,with notions of federalism concerning the respective roles of federal and state governments in immigration policy and medicaid alike.before turning to the merits of this case,we therefore pause to limn some overarching equal protection principles in the context of alienage.
equal protection framework 
in order to establish an equal protection violation,a plaintiff must show disparate treatment compared with others similarly situated in all relevant respects.barrington cove.hous.mortg.fin,cir quoting dartmouth review dartmouth,cir,overruled on other grounds by educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir.in determining whether two groups are similarly situated,we have identified the somewhat imprecise test as whether a prudent person,looking objectively would think them roughly equivalent.dartmouth review,at.put differently,the proponent of the equal protection violation must show that the parties with whom he seeks to be compared have engaged in the same activity the government entity without such distinguishing or mitigating circumstances as would render the comparison inutile.cordi allen conlon,cir.
alienage,like race and nationality,constitutes a suspect classification under the fourteenth amendment.see graham richardson,invalidating classifications.because a liens as a class are a prime example of a discrete and insular minority,a state classifications inherently raise concerns of invidious discrimination and are therefore generally subject to strict judicial scrutiny.id.quoting united states carolene prods.though states traditionally enjoy broad power to regulate economics and social welfare,even the otherwise valid interest in preserving the fiscal integrity of state programs is generally insufficient grounds for a burden on alienage to survive an equal protection challenge.id.at.
the calculus is markedly different for congressional acts distinguishing on the basis of alienage,evaluated under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.see mathews díaz,holding that congressional restrictions on federal medicare benefits did not violate due process.unlike other suspect classifications such as race and nationality,congressional disparate treatment of aliens is presumed to rest on national immigration policy rather than invidious discrimination.see id.at.because congress acts with plenary authority when it legislates the rights and benefits to be afforded aliens present in this country,such congressional acts are appropriately afforded rational basis judicial review.see id.at.states do not share in this plenary federal power,though they obviously are impacted by its exercise.see plyler doe,hampton mow sun wong,congress and the president have broad power over immigration and naturalization which the states do not possess.the supreme court has,however,stated that if the federal government has by uniform rule prescribed what it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of an alien subclass,the states may,of course,follow the federal direction.plyler,at.
because medicaid,unlike medicare,is not solely funded and administered by the federal government,this case does not fall neatly within the holding of mathews.on the other hand,the distinction in this case does not originate purely from state legislation,unlike the restrictions struck down in graham.instead,this case presents a gordian knot of federal and state legislation effecting an adverse impact on resident aliens a cooperative program medicaid,the eligibility for which was subsequently limited on the basis of alienage by federal legislation prwora,to which the state of maine responded by first creating,and then terminating,supplemental medical assistance benefits for aliens only.we now examine this state legislation in more detail in order to properly evaluate the equal protection claim before us.
in concluding that the appellants were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim,the district court explained that because there were two separate programs in maine distributing medical benefits to qualified aliens and citizens and citizens were statutorily unable to receive health benefits under the same program,the plaintiffs are unable to show that they were similarly situated with citizens for equal protection purposes.bruns mayhew,d.it arrived at this conclusion after a thorough analysis of the c ontours of the d isputed p rograms,noting inter alia that t he statutorily mandated separate funding structures for mainecare,which receives federal and state funds,and the program,which received only state funds,is the first indicator of the programs independence that these separate funding structures also signify that the programs were separately controlled by the governments that funded them and that the history of the benefit programs,specifically the federal government express relinquishment of its former obligation to provide benefits for qualified aliens subject to the residency requirement and the state decision to assume that obligation only underscores their autonomy.id.at.
the appellants aver that t he district court erred as a matter of fact and law when it concluded that there was no class of citizens who were similarly situated to the plaintiffs,because in their view maine operated a unitary medical assistance benefits program for citizens and aliens alike.to evaluate this contention,we begin where the district court did by examining the legal contours through which such benefits have been provided to maine residents.
as we have explained above,prwora seismically shifted the landscape of medicaid funding in.despite the cooperative nature of medicaid benefits,prwora classifies medicaid as a federal program from which many subclasses of aliens are excluded,including legal residents who have not yet resided in this country for five years.participating states are statutorily obligated to alter medicaid benefits available to their residents in order to remain compliant with evolving federal law.nevertheless,in enacting prwora congress authorized the states to provide purely welfare benefits to legal aliens,and in,the state of maine enacted legislation to ameliorate the effects of prwora for legal aliens who would have remained eligible for medicaid benefits but for prwora.maine therefore dispensed both the medicaid medical assistance funds for eligible residents and the state supplemental medical assistance funds for alien residents under the auspices of mainecare.in,the state legislature repealed the state legislation grant of state supplemental medical assistance benefits for aliens.at present,medical assistance remains available to eligible maine residents through medicaid funding still known locally as mainecare.
with this context established,we turn to the appellants first contention that the district court erred in construing the state legislation as establishing a new state program distinct from medicaid.the state legislation mandated that funds must be expended 
t o provide financial and medical assistance to certain noncitizens legally admitted to the united states.recipients of assistance under this subparagraph are limited to the categories of noncitizens who would be eligible for the tanf or medicaid programs but for their status as aliens under prwora.eligibility for the tanf and medicaid programs for these categories of noncitizens must be determined using the criteria applicable to other recipients of assistance from these programs.
me,ch,a codified at.tit,b,as amended.in the appellants interpretation,the last sentence bespeaks a single medical assistance program provided by the state of maine for citizens and aliens alike.parsing its language closely,they suggest that had the legislature intended to create a separate and distinct program for ineligible aliens,it would have referenced other recipients of those programs,rather than these programs.
the appellants,however,gloss over the immediately preceding sentence,which expressly limits state assistance to the categories of noncitizens who would be eligible for the tanf or medicaid programs but for their status as aliens under prwora.this sentence clearly evinces the legislature awareness that this subclass of aliens was ineligible for medicaid due to their status as aliens under prwora.we therefore agree with the commissioner suggestion that a sensible reading of the final sentence shows only that the legislature intended to utilize the same eligibility standards save citizenship requirements for aliens applying for state assistance as were utilized for medicaid applicants.
the appellants also allege that,in practice,maine operated a single state healthcare program,mainecare,which did not distinguish between eligible citizens and aliens on the one hand and aliens on the other.the appellants emphasize,inter alia,that the state referred to all public medical assistance benefits as mainecare and informed aliens in that their mainecare benefits were being changed that the state applied the same eligibility criteria and used the same application form for all mainecare applicants that citizens and received the same full benefits and that the state occasionally submitted its expenditures on aliens to the federal government,which later sought reimbursement from the state.the commissioner acknowledges that the appellants materials collectively suggest that the maine department of health and human services did not distinguish,both outwardly and in certain aspects of its internal administration,between the medicaid benefit provided to citizens and eligible aliens and the benefit that was provided to aliens.nevertheless,the commissioner maintains that public perception and common administration do not render the medicaid benefits and the state benefits legally indistinct for equal protection purposes.
we agree with the commissioner.the veneer of a single mainecare program merely obscured the legal reality that,from to,mainecare recipients received benefits from two distinct programs one funded jointly by the federal and state governments,with the federal government retaining ultimate authority over,inter alia,eligibility criteria and the other fully funded and controlled by the state government.it was the federal government that determined the appellants ineligibility for medicaid benefits by enacting prwora,to which the state responded by extending equivalent medical assistance benefits to the appellants for a time.
the ninth circuit analysis in pimentel dreyfus,cir,rejecting a comparable equal protection challenge to the termination of a state food assistance program for aliens only,is particularly instructive here.like mainecare,washington basic food program jointly provided food assistance to aliens and federal supplemental nutrition assistance program snap benefits to citizens and eligible aliens.the agency employed a single application form and identical eligibility criteria for all aid recipients,and the aid recipients themselves were not informed of the source of their benefits.id.at.the state was also authorized to issue federal snap benefits to ineligible aliens so long as it then reimbursed the federal government for the value of the benefit and associated administrative costs.id.at.the ninth circuit nevertheless held that t he appearance of a single program does not overcome this fact the two programs are,in reality,two separately administered programs funded by two distinct sovereigns,leaving the plaintiffs dissimilarly situated to snap recipients.id.at.the court elaborated 
a careful consideration of the contours of the snap program,including the statutory scheme,source of funding,extent of state involvement,and history,demonstrates that snap is a federal program which the state merely assists in administering,rather than a state program which receives federal assistance,and that its beneficiaries are differently situated from,and can not be compared to,the named plaintiff.
id.at see also hong pham starkowski,examining the contours of medicaid and finding plaintiffs,aliens formerly receiving supplemental state medical assistance benefits,dissimilarly situated to medicaid recipients i n light of the scope of federal control over the federal medicaid program and the extent to which the federal government funds that program.
contrary to the appellants suggestion that maine operated a single state medical assistance program for all state residents,we therefore agree with the district court conclusion that mainecare comprised two separate medical assistance programs cooperative medicaid and a state supplemental program for aliens only.when it repealed the supplemental program,the state of maine did not deprive the appellants of a benefit that it continued to provide to citizens or to anyone else,for that matter.consequently,the appellants can not point to any similarly situated individuals who remain engaged in the same activity the government entity.cordi allen,at emphasis added see also hong pham,at t he equal protection clause does not require the state to treat individuals in a manner similar to how others are treated in a different program governed by a different government.pimentel,at soskin reinertson,cir khrapunskiy doar,
the fact that maine voluntarily participated in medicaid does not alter our analysis.by the appellants logic,maine continued voluntary participation in medicaid and compliance with prwora violated the equal protection clause,requiring the state to either withdraw from medicaid altogether or to create an equivalent medical assistance benefit for aliens.of course,maine did the latter for a time according to the appellants,the state termination of those equivalent benefits placed it in violation of the equal protection clause,just as it would have been had it never extended those benefits in the first place.
the equal protection clause does not place the state in such a procrustean bed.the fact that congress discriminated on the basis of alienage in enacting prwora does not also establish discrimination by maine merely because of its continued medicaid participation and required compliance with prwora.while the federal government determines certain baseline eligibility requirements and selects particular classes of categorically needy persons who are eligible to receive medicaid benefits,a state,by choosing to participate in medicaid,generally adopts the grouping of federal eligibility requirements as a whole.like the hong pham court,we therefore conclude that if maine can be said to have discriminated at all,it only did so on the basis of federal medicaid eligibility,a benign classification subject to mere rational basis review.see id.at soskin,at.
like other courts facing similar equal protection claims,we therefore conclude that the state was under no constitutional obligation to fill the gap created by prwora by extending equivalent benefits to aliens.see korab fink,wl,at,cir,pimentel,at hong pham,at khrapunskiy,at sudomir mcmahon,cir.because maine was not obligated to extend equivalent benefits to the appellants in the first place,it follows that the termination of those benefits does not violate the equal protection clause.see pimentel,at hong pham,at.
as a last stand,the appellants rely on graham proclamation that congress does not have the power to authorize the individual states to violate the equal protection clause.at.more specifically,they contend that t he commissioner can not seek shelter for her equal protection violation in congress enactment of prwora because prwora did not create a national uniform immigration policy with respect to access to medical care,and instead left the decision of whether to provide medical assistance for medically indigent who have been in the country less than five years to the individual states.however,as we have explained above,the appellants argument rests on the assumption that a state mere participation in medicaid,subject to prwora mandatory eligibility restrictions,represents discrimination.because we conclude that the state drew no distinctions on the basis of alienage,graham proscription does not apply here,and we therefore need not reach the question of whether maine acted in accordance with uniform federal policy 
in short,the disparate treatment challenged by the appellants is not attributable to legislation enacted by the state of maine.instead,the appellants are experiencing the impact of a congressional decision prwora mandatory residency requirement restricting their eligibility for public welfare benefits,including cooperative programs such as medicaid.as a result,there is no class of similarly situated citizens with whom the appellants can be compared the state of maine.we therefore conclude that the appellants equal protection c
