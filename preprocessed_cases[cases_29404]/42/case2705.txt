emil roman and his wife dochita are romanian natives and citizens who seek review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision to deny their application for asylum under the immigration and nationality act ina a,a,and for withholding of deportation pursuant to ina h,h.roman claims that he and his wife are unable to return to romania because he has suffered,and will continue to suffer,political persecution from former members of nicolae ceausescu communist regime who now hold positions of power in the new democratic government.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the decision of the bia.
backgrounda.facts 
roman troubles began in as a high school student in sibiu,romania,when he refused to join the youth communist union.he claims that,as a consequence,he had no position in the school even though he was one of the best students,and his application to college was initially rejected.he ultimately was admitted to mechanic s college two hundred miles away in bucharest,where he believed that he could more freely express his political opinions.one year later in,roman took part in a student demonstration against ceausescu communist regime.according to roman,he was constantly under surveillance because of his participation in the demonstration.
after college,roman was hired by the tarom airlines as an aviation engineer.he worked at tarom for twenty years until he left for the united states in.roman claims that every time he left the country for business,he was warned that,if he tried to apply for asylum,his possessions would be confiscated,his wife a flight attendant at the same company would be fired,and his daughter would be placed in an orphanage.the securitate secret police questioned him hundreds of times,once for nine hours however,he was never jailed.according to roman,his wife dochita had been married to a securitate officer,and,after she divorced the officer,she lost everything including her son.roman also alleges that dochita informed the securitate that her family had subversive characteristics.id.
while at tarom airlines,roman was asked to join the communist party many times,but always refused.as a result,he contends,he never was promoted.he claims that he never was fired,however,because he was highly qualified.about twice a year he would travel outside romania for the company and,on one occasion,he was sent to the united states for training.
roman was in nigeria on business when ceausescu regime was overthrown in december.he returned to romania in january of and participated in demonstrations against the communists who remained in power after the revolution.according to roman,in september,he was beaten by three miners because,he suspects,of his political beliefs.
at that time,roman belonged to a group at tarom that was attempting to privatize the company.the new leaders at tarom told roman that his efforts were futile,demoted him,and warned him that,if he did not mind his own business,he would have an accident.roman also was threatened over the telephone.in may,he discovered that the tires of his car were punctured one week later,the lug nuts on one wheel were loosened.afterward,roman received an anonymous phone call warning him that if he did not shut up,he would have more serious problems.according to viorica seceleanu,a former tarom flight attendant,roman was considered a troublemaker at tarom,although she did not know why.
after the overthrow of ceausescu communist regime,there were no restrictions on roman travel outside of romania.prior to his july arrival in the united states,he was permitted to travel to this country with his wife for vacation in december and again in april.roman decided to leave romania for good when the new communists who were part of the old regime came into power and threatened that,if he did not mind his own business,they would create a file for him and tell everyone that he was an informer.the romanian government granted roman an exit permit to leave the country.
administrative proceedings 
roman and his wife entered the united states in july as nonimmigrant visitors authorized to stay in the country for six months.they remained in the country after the authorization period ended,and,on may,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause and notice of hearing charging the romans with deportability under ina a b,a b.a deportation hearing was held on november,in which the romans admitted that they overstayed their authorized visit and requested asylum,withholding of deportation,and,in the alternative,voluntary departure.
roman attached an narrative statement to his asylum application detailing his claims of past persecution and his fears of reprisal should he return to romania he also submitted published articles commenting on the repressive ceausescu regime and the aftermath of the overthrow.on march,the immigration judge ij held an evidentiary hearing on the romans application for asylum and withholding of deportation.the ij demeanor at the hearing fairly could be described as brusque and impatient the judge often criticized roman counsel for not getting to the point quickly enough further,the ij repeatedly interrupted counsel examination to ask questions of the witnesses.
at the request of the ij,the state department board of human rights and humanitarian affairs bhrha issued an advisory opinion in january,observing that under the ceausescu regime,roman and his wife prospered in terms of education,employment,and travel abroad and that there is no way that somebody repeatedly threatened and harassed as he claims would have been so successful for so long under ceausescu.the bhrha further noted that roman account of persecution after the overthrow comports badly with country conditions.id.in a december country profile,the bhrha opined that romania has undergone fundamental changes since the overthrow of ceausescu repressive communist regime in.although the country still struggles with the transition from a totalitarian and centralized state to a democracy with a economy,civil liberties,freedom of speech,press,assembly,association,religion and travel are respected.the bhrha observed that sentiments cited by many asylum applicants now place them within the mainstream of political opinion.although the bhrha deemed the national elections a success,it noted that some romanians are still suspicious of their leaders,many of whom held office under the previous regime.but the bhrha opined that current country conditions have so altered as to remove any presumption that past mistreatment under ceausescu or in the chaotic first year after his overthrow will lead to mistreatment in the future most romanians have a difficult task in plausibly establishing that they would face severe and targeted sic mistreatment upon return to their country.the bhrha also noted that a number of romanians have abandoned refugee status and returned to romania to claim property or arrange for relatives to join them in the united states.
after considering roman testimony as well as his narrative statement,the ij denied the romans application for asylum and withholding of deportation,finding that roman claim was based upon generalized statements,speculation,all of which are uncorroborated by any credible evidence.the ij noted that roman was never imprisoned in romania,was not prevented from attending school or college,and was able to keep his job at a airline for twenty years until he left for the united states.the ij then granted the romans alternative request for voluntary departure on or before june.the romans appealed the ij decision to the bia.
over five years later in september,the bia rendered its decision dismissing the romans appeal.first,the bia addressed the romans argument that the ij limited their right to present their case,finding any alleged errors to be harmless because they did not identify any specific additional testimony that would likely change the result in the case.nonetheless,the bia did not adopt the analysis of the ij,nor did the board credit the opinion of the bhrha as to roman treatment prior to the overthrow.instead,the board found credible roman account of events before the revolution,observing that it is not inconsistent with country conditions in romania that a needed technocrat such as roman would be subject to surveillance,threats,and harassment,particularly if he was seen as not following the communist party line clearly the management of the government owned airline for which roman worked viewed him as not supporting the communist party philosophy.the bia concluded,however,that such conduct did not rise to the level of persecution.
relying on the bhrha december country profile,the bia also found that the romans failed to show a fear of future persecution,observing that the changes in romania were inconsistent with roman perception that he may be harmed in the future if he returned.the bia also deemed seceleanu testimony unhelpful and the voluminous documentary evidence provided by roman irrelevant to present country conditions.the romans timely appealed the bia denial of asylum.
discussion 
on appeal,the romans argue that the ij violated their due process rights at the deportation hearing by repeatedly interrupting roman testimony and cutting off questioning the bia violated their due process rights by failing to decide their appeal for more than five years the bia erred in finding that roman had not suffered past persecution and the bia erred in finding that roman had not established a fear of persecution.
due process violations 
full and fair hearing 
the romans first argue that the ij denied their right to a full and fair deportation hearing by repeatedly interrupting roman testimony and cutting off his counsel questioning.they cite podio ins,cir,for the proposition that,in the past,the particular ij who presided over their hearing has flouted asylum applicants due process rights.this court reviews de novo the bia determination that the ij did not violate due process.see id.at.
first,unlike in podio,the ij in this case allowed the romans corroborating witness to testify.id.ij refused to allow asylum applicant siblings to testify that ukrainian police were looking for him.although the ij did appear to curtail counsel examination of the witnesses in a manner,the judge interruptions and questions were apparently intended to focus the hearing more directly on roman specific allegations of persecution.the ij assured roman at the hearing that he had read roman narrative statement and,in the decision,noted that roman testified and essentially reaffirmed the contents of this narrative which he had carefully read and considered.see,iliev ins,cir possibly brusque conduct of ij did not deny asylum applicant a fair trial based on lack of opportunity to fully present case.moreover,roman was permitted to testify about specific instances of mistreatment,including the problems he endured at tarom even after the revolution.the ij impatience with the romans attorney does not suggest bias he was equally brusque with the ins attorney,nor does it prove that the romans were deprived of a fair hearing.see,morales ins,cir an alien right to fair hearing was not violated despite ij impatience when alien was allowed to testify as to association with labor union and record did not indicate ij ignored evidence mikhailevitch ins,cir judge questioning of alien counsel was not intended to prevent alien from presenting evidence but to clarify time period and focus on alien situation.
second,to prevail on a due process claim,an asylum applicant must show prejudice.see mojsilovic ins,cir.the romans fail,however,to allege any testimony excluded by the ij that,if admitted at a new hearing,would potentially affect the outcome of their case.see ins,cir alien must produce concrete evidence that violation of procedural protection actually had potential to affect outcome of deportation proceedings.thus,their claim that the ij violated due process is without merit.
undue delay 
citing our decision in batanic ins,cir,the romans argue that the bia delay in rendering its decision denied them due process and,as a consequence,they should be granted asylum retroactively to the date of their application.the romans reliance on batanic is wholly misplaced.there,the petitioner was found deportable at a hearing in which he was denied the right to counsel.see id.at.the bia provided batanic a new hearing,but in the interim,congress enacted an amendment to the ina that rendered batanic ineligible for asylum.see id.at.in reliance on the amendment,the ij denied batanic asylum application,and the bia affirmed.see id.on appeal,we noted that a procedural defect,such as the denial of the right to counsel,is generally cured by holding a new hearing in which the defect is not present with the assistance of counsel.see id.at.however,where the procedural defect has also resulted in the loss of an opportunity for statutory relief,we observed that a new hearing alone can not cure the defect.see id.the delay caused by the procedural defect in batanic case operated to deprive him of his statutory right to apply for asylum.see id.as a result,we allowed batanic to apply for asylum nunc pro tunc to the time of his initial hearing.see id.at.
by contrast,in this case,there was no evidence that a procedural defect worked to deprive the romans of a specific statutory right.reno,cir.the romans argument that they would have been granted asylum had the bia rendered its decision earlier is no more than mere speculation.see id.batanic,in comparison,was unequivocally barred from seeking asylum because of an intervening amendment to the statute.thus,the romans have failed to show a denial of due process comparable to that in batanic.
the romans also appear to argue that had the bia timely adjudicated their appeal,it would have granted them asylum in view of this court opinion in borca ins,cir.in borca,this court reversed the bia asylum determination because it had employed the wrong standard.the romans do not assert,however,that the bia reviewed their case under an improper standard they simply contend that the bia erred in crediting the state department report over roman own account of his fears of reprisal.thus,borca also does not help the romans.
we are troubled,however,by the bia prolonged and unexplained delay,as we are faced with the predicament of reviewing a decision that may be based on information that is now outdated and obsolete.but because the romans do not contend that this is the case,we fail to discern any prejudice from the delay.
to qualify for asylum,roman must show that he is a refugee,or a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.to meet his burden of establishing the requisite fear of persecution,an asylum applicant must present specific facts demonstrating that he has actually been the victim or sic persecution or has good reason to believe that he will be singled out for persecution.petrovic ins,cir.our review of the bia determination of asylum eligibility is deferential we shall reverse only if the record lacks substantial evidence to support the bia factual conclusions.see sofinet ins,cir.
past persecution 
although there is no statutory definition of persecution,we have described it as punishment or the infliction of harm for political,religious,or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.see id.quoting mitev ins,cir.the alleged conduct need not threaten the asylum applicant life or freedom,but it must rise above mere harassment to constitute persecution.id.here,roman argues that the constant surveillance,threats,and beatings,as well as the sabotaging of his car and his demotion at tarom,compel a finding that he was persecuted on account of his political beliefs the bia deemed roman account believable but concluded that such conduct did not rise to the level of persecution.
our difficulty with the bia finding as to persecution is that it only appears to address events that occurred before the revolution the decision ignores roman allegations of more serious mistreatment that occurred after ceausescu overthrow.see dobrota ins,cir bia f
