opinion of the court 
the immigration and nationality act ina allows a child under the age of whose alien parent has married a citizen abroad to obtain a temporary visa to accompany her parent to the united states and,based on the parent marriage,to apply to adjust her status to that of a lawful permanent resident.on a petition for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,we now consider the validity of a regulation that makes it impossible for a child who entered on such a visa to remain with her family and adjust her status from within the united states if she was over the age of eighteen at the time of her parent marriage.because the regulation departs from the plain language of the ina,contravenes congressional intent,and exceeds the permissible scope of the attorney general regulatory authority,we conclude it is invalid.we therefore will grant the petition for review and will reverse and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
background 
as a general matter,aliens abroad who have relatives in the united states may be eligible to obtain lawful permanent residence,but because it can take months or even years for the pertinent paperwork to be processed,these aliens may spend significant time separated from their loved ones while they wait in their home countries for the appropriate visa approval.see,cong.rec.describing the lengthy delays faced by those seeking visas.congress sought to ameliorate this problem for the immediate family members of citizens through the creation,initially,of visas for alien fiancé e s of citizens and then,more recently,of visas for alien spouses of citizens.in addition,and of particular significance for this case,congress also provided for and visas for,respectively,the minor children of fiancé e s and spouses,up to age 
once reunited with their families stateside,aliens with one of these may apply for and,subject to the discretion of the attorney general,attain lawful permanent residence without leaving the united states through a process called adjustment of status.petitioner in this case properly obtained a visa as the daughter of a alien spouse and accompanied her mother to the united states to live with her stepfather,a citizen,while petitioner and her mother applied for adjustment of status.petitioner applications have been denied,however,on account of a regulation that effectively bars any child with a visa who was between the ages of eighteen and at the time of her parent marriage from obtaining lawful permanent residence without first returning overseas.our analysis of petitioner challenges to the validity of this regulation requires an understanding of the statutory and regulatory regime that governs holders,as well as the factual and procedural history of petitioner case.we address each below.
statutory and regulatory context 
the story of begins in,when congress created and visas to allow the fiancé e s of citizens and such fiancé e s unmarried children under the age of,respectively,to obtain temporary,nonimmigrant status.assuming the fiancé e and the citizen married within three months,that status would allow the fiancé e and children to await processing of their applications for lawful permanent residence from within the united states.act of,pub,b,stat.in their original form,and visas triggered automatic lawful permanent residence for the visa holders once the marriage was complete.see id.at b.this feature had the perverse effect,however,of encouraging fraudulent marriages whereby some aliens obtained visas and married citizens with the intention to dissolve the marriage once they obtained lawful permanent residence.in re sesay,bia describing this marriage fraud problem.
in,congress sought to curb such marriage fraud by passing the immigration marriage fraud amendments imfa,pub,stat,which replaced and aliens streamlined method of obtaining lawful permanent residence with the more structured adjustment of status process.imfa c see also carpio holder,cir.describing the requirement that holders file an application for adjustment of status in order to obtain lawful permanent residence.since the passage of the imfa,and aliens are required to apply to adjust their status like other aliens through the strictures of a,which gives the attorney general the discretion to provide lawful permanent residence to certain aliens without requiring them to first return to their countries of origin.see imfa c.holders adjustment of status under a is constrained by,which renders an alien permanent status conditional for two years,after which time the government conducts an interview with the couple to reaffirm the legitimacy of the marital union if the government is satisfied,the status for both the alien spouse and her children becomes truly permanent.imfa.
to apply for status adjustment under a,an alien must take three steps file an application to adjust status demonstrate eligibility under existing law to adjust status and show that a permanent visa is immediately available a.once an application is filed,the ultimate decision as to whether that application is granted is left to the discretion of the attorney general,who also has authority to promulgate regulations governing the adjustment of status process.id.the imfa also created d,which,in its first iteration,barred the attorney general from adjusting a nonimmigrant status solely on the basis of the.imfa e,b.that had the effect of forcing and aliens to satisfy a eligibility requirement through the traditional means available under the ina to alien family members by proving a legally cognizable familial relationship with the citizen petitioner under b a i,such as a marital or a relationship.see,kondrachuk citizenship immigr,no.c cw,wl,at cal.june,describing the adjustment process for holders under a.procedurally,this meant that once the marriage took place,not only the alien parent but also each stepchild would need to prove eligibility through the submission of an petition a petition filed by the citizen attesting that the alien was the child of the citizen.see dep t of homeland,instructions for form,petition for alien relative,available at last visited,hereinafter instructions for form.
this new requirement,however,produced an unintended consequence for some children because,under the ina,a stepchild only qualifies as a child of a citizen if the child had not reached the age of eighteen years at the time the marriage creating the status of stepchild occurred.b b.thus,an alien child up to age could obtain a visa and accompany her alien parent and any younger siblings to the united states,but,if she was eighteen to years old when the marriage took place,the stepparent could not file an petition on her behalf.the stepchild,in other words,had no mechanism to satisfy the requirements of a and no other means to adjust status from within the united states.see,kondrachuk,wl,at recounting the effect of the imfa on visa holders see also memorandum from michael aytes,citizenship immigr.servs.domestic,regarding adjustment of status for aliens,available at last visited,aytes memorandum confirming the unintentional gap.the upshot was that,upon expiration of her visa,the stepchild was required to separate from her parents and siblings and to return to her home country to apply for admission to the united states from abroad based on her alien parent newfound status as a lawful permanent resident.see a kondrachuk,wl,at explaining that because an immigrant visa is not immediately available to a child based on the lawful permanent resident status of her alien parent,such child may not adjust status within the united states via a.
this unintentional gap for older children prompted the immigration and naturalization service ins to take corrective action only two years after the imfa passed,which led in conjunction with statutory amendments passed by congress in the same year to the regime that governs the status adjustment process for children today.the ins promulgated k ii the,under which a visa holder is deemed eligible to apply for status adjustment based solely on her parent contracting a valid marriage to the citizen who originally petitioned for the visa so long as the marriage occurs within ninety days of the parent admission as a nonimmigrant pursuant to a valid visa.see also marriage fraud amendments regulations,fed.reg,supplementary information.this regulation eliminated the need for a child to prove eligibility through her stepparent petition by hinging the child eligibility instead on her parent marriage and not on her relationship with the stepparent.see in re akram,bia citing in re le,bia and in re sesay,at in re le,i at aytes memorandum.
while the rulemaking process for the was underway,congress also was legislating to the same effect,and only a few months after the was finalized,president reagan signed into law the immigration technical corrections act of itca,pub,stat,which added language to d that serves virtually the same function as the for and visas the only then in existence.the itca amended d to allow the attorney general to adjust the status of a holder as a result of the marriage of the nonimmigrant or,in the case of a minor child,the parent to the citizen who filed the petition to accord that alien or nonimmigrant status,thus making explicit that eligibility for even an older child status adjustment turned on the marriage and not whether the alien qualified as her stepparent child under b b.see itca b.
more than a decade later,in recognition of the fact that benefited only alien fiancé e s and their children while alien spouses and their children who were already stepchildren of citizens still had to wait out approval of their lawful permanent residence from abroad,congress expanded the program to create visas for foreign spouses and visas for their minor children.see the legal immigration family equity life act,pub,a,stat,as amended,at.because the marriage has already taken place,the process for obtaining these visas and adjusting status under the life act varies slightly from that governing and visa holders.to obtain a visa,the spouse must file two forms an petition,which lists the alien spouse children,requires submission of a valid marriage certificate,and serves as the petition for the itself,and an petition,which identifies the marital relationship between the spouses and begins the process for conferral of permanent residence.see in re akram,at k dep t of homeland,instructions for petition for alien fiancé e june,available at last visited,instructions for form.upon approval of the petition and a subsequent interview at a united states embassy or consulate in the aliens home country a visa is issued to the alien the alien spouse under the age of.in re akram,at k.a visa then lasts for two years or until a child birthday,whichever comes first.k.
consistent with the goal of reunifying families stateside pending approval of their permanent residence,the life act also amended certain portions of the ina,reflecting an intention that and children would be accorded the same treatment.the life act reorganized the subsection that creates all by authorizing visas for fiancé e s in a k i,visas for spouses in a k ii,and and visas for both categories of children the children of and,respectively in a k iii.life act a.thus,congress provided for the issuance of both and visas in the same statutory section,defined their intended recipients in the same terms as the minor child ren of or visa holders who are accompanying,or following to join their alien parents,a k iii,and extended d the section that tied children eligibility for adjustment of status under a to the marriage of the child parent to the citizen to children as well,see life act c.
notwithstanding congress clear articulation of its intent to accord the same reunification benefits to children as enjoyed by their counterparts,the ins took the opposite tack.it not only failed to amend the k ii to reach older children or to promulgate a new regulation to plug any perceived gap for such individuals,it also promulgated i the regulation,which recreated for older children the very gap that d and k ii had filled for older children.see k nonimmigrant classification for spouses of citizens and their children under the legal immigration family equity act of,fed.reg,supplementary information.that is,instead of signaling that a child may adjust status without being the beneficiary of a separate petition an impossibility for an alien child who does not qualify as the child of her stepparent by virtue of having been over eighteen at the time of the marriage,the regulation provides 
an alien admitted to the united states as a under a k iii may apply for adjustment of status to that of permanent residence pursuant to at any time following the approval of the form petition filed on the alien behalf,by the same citizen who petitioned for the alien parent status.
i emphasis added.
the regulation thus ensnares a child who was over the age of eighteen at the time of her parent marriage in a legal quandary.having qualified for the visa to accompany her parent and younger siblings to the united states to reunite with her stepparent,a child between ages eighteen and is limited by the regulation to obtaining lawful permanent residence only by way of an petition filed by her stepparent a petition which b b precludes that stepparent from filing for a stepchild in this age group.such a child,in other words,has no recourse but to leave her family behind in the united states and return to her home country to apply for a permanent visa from abroad 
it may seem strange to impose this plight on the children of alien spouses given that the children of alien fiancé e s may adjust status as a direct consequence of the marriage and without having to independently demonstrate a relationship with their stepparents under b b that both and children obtain their nonimmigrant visas under a k iii and that both and children derive their eligibility to adjust status from the same source d.the regulation,however,does just that.in re akram,at,confirming that the regulation establishes this for older children and expressly acknowledging that the k ii regulation absolves children of the same fate.although the seventh circuit,in akram holder,cir,struck down the regulation as ultra vires,the government has continued to enforce it outside that circuit in this case visiting its consequences upon petitioner si min cen.
factual and procedural background 
cen is a chinese national who was nineteen when her mother married a citizen in china.after properly obtaining her visa and moving to the united states with her mother,cen filed an application to adjust her status.as required by the regulation,cen stepfather filed an petition on her behalf,but that petition and hence cen application were denied because cen was nineteen when her mother married and therefore could not be deemed her stepfather child under b b for purposes of her stepfather petition 
at the same time,however,the regulation also precluded cen from adjusting her status on the basis of her mother immigration status.after becoming a lawful permanent resident,cen mother filed an petition on cen behalf,which,because cen is the biological child of her mother,was approved by the government.on the basis of this approved petition,cen again applied for adjustment of status,but she was denied this time because even though her mother petition on her behalf had been approved and even though her mother by that point had become a naturalized citizen the regulation specifies that,in order to be eligible for status adjustment,a child petition must be filed by the same citizen who petitioned for the alien parent status,the stepparent.i.
thwarted at every turn,cen turned to the courts,challenging the regulation and the denial of her application in the district court for the district of new jersey.at least initially,cen was again blocked when the government opened removal proceedings against her for overstaying her original visa and served her with a notice to appear.because that action created a new administrative remedy for cen to pursue,the district court lost subject matter jurisdiction and cen complaint was voluntarily dismissed.
cen duly appeared before an immigration judge ij in newark,who determined that cen was not entitled to relief due to the regulation.bound by the bia precedential opinion in in re akram,bia,the ij concluded that cen could only seek to adjust through an petition filed by her stepfather,not her mother,and that her stepfather petition could not be approved because cen,who was nineteen at the time of the marriage,did not qualify as her stepfather child under b b.cen appealed this decision to the bia,which affirmed the ij and rooted its decision in in re akram.the bia determined that the legislative history and structure of the relevant immigration laws supported the regulation requirement that only the stepparent may file an petition for a visa holder,that the bia did not itself have authority to declare regulations invalid in any event,and that despite the seventh circuit having previously rejected in re akram and struck down the regulation,see akram,at,the bia was not bound by that decision outside the seventh circuit.
cen now petitions this court for review of the bia decision,arguing that the regulation is ultra vires under chevron,natural resources defense council,and that she therefore should be able to adjust her status either by way of an petition filed by her mother or,like her counterparts,automatically upon her mother adjustment,on the basis of the marriage itself 
ii.jurisdiction and standards of review 
we have jurisdiction to review final decisions of the bia under.in this case,we review the bia decision de novo,subject to the principles of chevron deference because we are considering the propriety of a regulation that has gone through rulemaking,united states mead,and because the bia decision rests on legal determinations made in its precedential opinion of in re akram,see ins,att y,wl,at cir,
iii.discussion 
under the familiar chevron analysis,we first determine under step one if congress has directly addressed the precise question at issue,and if so,we strike down a regulation that is contrary to congress unambiguously expressed intent.chevron,at.at step one,we consider the statutory text,as well as traditional tools of statutory construction,including canons of construction and the broader statutory context.shalom pentecostal church acting sec y dep t of homeland,cir.united states geiser,cir.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we move on to step two,where the question for the court is whether the agency regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.at step two,we may consider the plain language of the statute,its origin,and purpose in reviewing the reasonableness of a regulation.zheng gonzales,cir.quoting appalachian states radioactive waste comm,cir.step two affords agencies considerable deference,and where congress has not merely failed to address a precise question,but has given an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,then the agency legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.zheng,at quoting chevron,at.but deference under step two is not absolute,and the regulation must still harmonize with the statute,id.at quoting,at,and be reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design,nationsbank of,variable annuity life ins.here,both parties urge that we resolve the case at step one,and there we begin.
a.the legitimacy of the regulation can not be resolved at step one 
the government argues that d plain text unambiguously evinces congress intent to bar older children from eligibility to apply for adjustment of status under a because they can not establish a b b compliant relationship with their stepparents.cen urges the opposite reading that because d authorizes status adjustment as a result of the marriage of the parent and stepparent,all children under are unambiguously eligible to adjust status on the basis of the marriage alone rather than the relationship with their stepparents.were the government correct that the plain language of the ina categorically bars older children from eligibility,we would have no need to proceed beyond step one because the regulation would reflect congress clearly stated intent.as explained below,however,we can dispose of this contention in short order because the two arguments pressed by the government at step one are untethered from the text of the statute.
first,the government language from d to urge that its authorization for the attorney general to adjust status on account of the citizen who filed the petition to accord that alien nonimmigrant status expressly identifies the stepparent as the basis for any adjustment and amounts to an unambiguous,affirmative requirement that a child prove a legally cognizable relationship with that stepparent to be eligible to adjust status under a.but,in full,the relevant portion of d reads that the attorney general may adjust the status of an alien as a result of the marriage of the nonimmigrant or,in the case of a minor child,the parent to the citizen who filed the petition to accord that alien nonimmigrant status under a k.d emphasis added.the government,in other words,would have us excise the as a result of the marriage of the parent language that immediately precedes the excerpt on which it relies and thereby accord the statute an entirely different meaning.we do not pay such short shrift to congress words.see,inhabitants of montclair twp.ramsdell,it is the duty of the court to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.instead,the reference to the marriage between a child parent and the stepparent precludes reading d to unambiguously require a child to prove a relationship with her stepparent.indeed,not only does the text of d nowhere indicate that a relationship must be proven,but by its terms,it expressly predicates a child eligibility on the marital relationship between her parent and stepparent a topic to which we will return in part below.
the government second attempt to anchor the regulation requirement in the plain text of the statute fares no better.the government would have us string together a series of ina provisions that it insists,when read in tandem,plainly and unambiguously require a child to demonstrate a relationship with her stepparent to be eligible to adjust status under a.specifically,the government argues that d does not absolve children from satisfying the three adjustment of status requirements of a that a child therefore must demonstrate eligibility and availability of an immigrant visa like any other alien family member of a citizen by complying with a a i,which provides that a citizen claiming that an alien is entitled to an immediate relative status may file a petition with the attorney general for such classification and that the supreme court statement in ins miranda,per curiam,that a visa petition is sufficient to satisfy the a visa availability requirement means that an petition which,in the case of children,would require compliance with the b definition of child is the proper method of satisfying a a i.ergo,according to the government,d clearly and unambiguously provides that the filing of an petition by the child stepparent is the exclusive means by which a child may adjust status.
as a threshold matter,we would hesitate to conclude that congress clearly intended to deprive older children of any opportunity to adjust status from within the united states when the several disparate sections of the ina that,together,supposedly erect this bar lack a single.see restrepo att y,cir.according significance to the absence of a when interpreting a statute united states alvarez,cir.same.the government premises,in any event,suffer three fundamental flaws.
first,there is no question that,when congress has not provided otherwise,the eligibility of an immediate relative to adjust status under a is typically satisfied by the filing of an petition in accordance with a a i.for holders,however,the language of d suggests congress did provide otherwise,authorizing these aliens to apply instead on the basis of the qualifying marriage.
second,the language in a a i is neither mandatory nor exclusive indeed,while one may file an petition to prove eligibility,that is not the only method of adjustment,nor would that be a sensible reading given that the k ii already allows children to adjust under a without filing an petition at all.likewise,ins miranda merely recognized that a visa petition would have satisfied the a requirement it did not hold that a visa petition was the exclusive means to satisfy a.at.
third,even assuming arguendo that a separate petition may be required for a child to adjust status,nothing in d or a a i supports the regulation requirement that such a petition be filed by the stepparent and not by the alien parent once he or she has obtained lawful permanent residence or,as in this case,citizenship status.
in view of these deficiencies in the government plain language argument,we can not resolve this case at chevron step one.nor need we linger at step one on account of cen own plain language argument,for even assuming that the ina on its face permits older children to apply for adjustment of status under d,congress expressly delegated to the attorney general in a the authority to regulate eligibility to apply for adjustment of status,and we held in zheng gonzales that the text of ina section a leaves some ambiguity about whether the attorney general may determine by regulation what classes of aliens are eligible to apply for adjustment of status,thus precluding reliance on the first prong of the chevron test.at.as in zheng,the regulation bars a category of aliens from adjusting their status under a,and such regulations are subject to review for reasonableness under the second prong of the chevron test.id.at.we therefore proceed to step two to consider whether the regulation falls within the scope of the attorney general delegated authority.
b.the regulation is invalid under step two 
in zheng,we held that where the ina appears by its plain terms to render a class of aliens eligible to apply for adjustment of status under a and the attorney general by regulation has barred that class from eligibility,we review the regulation at chevron step two to determine whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute,its origin,and purpose.so long as the regulation bears a fair relationship to the language of the statute,reflects the views of those who sought its enactment,and matches the purpose they articulated,it will merit deference.at quoting,at.that deference,however,is not unconditional,for while the attorney general discretionary authority under a may be ambiguous enough to allow for some regulatory eligibility standards,it does not so totally abdicate authority to the attorney general as to allow a regulation that essentially reverses the eligibility structure set out by congress.id.at.
here,as in zheng,we conclude the regulation does reverse congress eligibility structure and must be struck down as manifestly contrary to the ina.id.at quoting chevron,at.as explained below,our conclusion rests on the plain language of d the broader structure of the ina,as informed by canons of statutory construction the regulatory and statutory context of the life act the congressional purpose behind the adjustment of status process and our own precedent circumscribing the scope of the attorney general regulatory authority under a.we address these grounds in turn.
plain language 
while the government argues that the plain language of d imposes the regulation requirement that a child prove a relationship with her stepparent in order to adjust status under a,we read the statutory text to strongly indicate that congress intended the opposite that the marriage of the child parent to the child stepparent would itself render her eligible to apply for adjustment of status and that the only relationship of relevance to a child is the one between the child and her alien parent not her stepparent.
by its plain terms,d provides that the attorney general may adjust a holder status as a result of the marriage of the nonimmigrant or,in the case of a minor child,the parent to the citizen who filed the petition to accord that alien nonimmigrant status.d.a child eligibility to adjust status thus accrues as a result of the marriage of her parent and stepparent,not as a result of the child b b relationship with her stepparent.indeed,the only relationships referenced in the text of d are the marital relationship between the parent and the stepparent and the relationship between the parent and the child nowhere in d can we identify the source of the regulation procedural requirement that a child be the beneficiary of an petition that proves she is the child of her new stepparent as defined in b b.thus,while the government rests its statutory interpretation of d on the language referring to the citizen who filed the petition to accord the child nonimmigrant status,see supra part,we read as a result of the marriage to be the operative words of the statute,making clear that it is the marriage between the parent and the stepparent that renders any child up to age eligible to apply for adjustment of status as such,it would stretch the meaning of the text beyond its limits to read the mere mention of the citizen petitioner in d to require that a child separately prove she qualifies as the child of her stepparent under b b 
moreover,the government itself has already rejected the very argument it makes here in two different regulations.first,in the k ii,the government read d even before it was amended by the itca to dispense with any need for the stepparent to file an petition in order for a child to be eligible to adjust status.and the government continued adherence to the indicates that it has not departed from that reading of d in the years since the itca,aytes memorandum see also in re akram,at citing in re le,at and in re sesay,at.put another way,the government reading of d in this case would seem to render its own regulation ultra vires because both and children derive their eligibility to seek status adjustment under a from the same statutory language in d.we are to see how that plain language can be read to require an petition for a child,but not for a child.the government can not have it both ways.
second,in defining how and aliens may adjust status under a,c ii provides that a child appl ies for adjustment of status based upon the marriage of the spouse to the united states citizen who filed a petition on behalf of the spouse.with this language,which is materially identical to language in c i defining eligibility for and visa holders and which tracks the statutory text of d,the government itself has read a child eligibility to apply for adjustment of status to turn on the relationship between the spouse and citizen not on whether the child meets b b definition of child in relation to her new stepparent.
indeed,tying adjustment to the petition filed on behalf of the spouse,c ii,rather than to a second petition filed on behalf of the child,makes sense given that a child obtains her visa as a derivative of her parent,no separate petition is filed in order to afford a child her initial nonimmigrant visa.obtaining a visa pursuant to a k is obviously a separate process from adjusting status under a.but because the visa like the visa is designed to reunify families and,ultimately,to serve as a toward permanent residence,the most logical reading of the statute as a whole is that,whatever paperwork is required once stateside,congress meant to authorize an application for adjustment based on the marriage.in the case of a child,that is handled by the filing of an petition,which identifies the basis of such child eligibility to apply for status adjustment as the marriage of her parent to a citizen,requiring only that the child append a copy of the parent petition approval notice and marriage certificate.dep t of homeland,form,application to register permanent residence or adjust status revised,available at last visited.the regulation requirement that a child,in contrast,have her stepparent file an on her behalf can not be reconciled with the plain language of d itself nor with the government prior interpretations of the very same text as embodied in k ii and c ii.
canons of construction 
the irreconcilable conflict between the regulation and the statute becomes even more apparent when we consider d within the broader framework of the ina.while the government urges that we should interpret in isolation,we do not approach statutory construction as a myopic exercise,but rather as a holistic endeavor in which we interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,and fit,if possible,all parts into an harmonious whole.fda brown williamson tobacco,first quoting gustafson alloyd,then quoting ftc mandel,shalom pentecostal,at considering the overall design of the ina when assessing the plain meaning of a statutory provision under a chevron step one analysis alaka att y,cir.considering the overall design of the ina when interpreting a single provision.we therefore apply this traditional tool of statutory construction to interpret d in its statutory context,see chevron,at bautista att y,cir,and,in doing so,identify no less than six relevant canons of statutory interpretation that support our conclusion.
first,where a statutory provision lists multiple categories of individuals without differentiating between them,congress is presumed to have intended that all such categories be treated the same.see clark martinez,concluding that,when a section of the ina listed three categories of aliens without differentiating between them,the statute clearly expressed that all categories be treated the same because to treat each category differently would give the same words a different meaning for each category and would be to invent a statute rather than interpret one.here,congress authorized both and visas in a single subsection,a k iii,reflecting congressional intent to accord the same treatment to the two categories of visa holders.the government urges that a k is irrelevant to the propriety of the regulation because it defines only the mechanism by which one obtains a and has nothing to do with adjustment of status under a and d.we agree that a k on its face does not speak to adjustment of status,but congress decision to address and visas together and without differentiation in both a k iii and d provides textual and structural support for according them the same treatment for adjustment purposes.see clark,at.
second,we normally give identical words and phrases within the same statute the same meaning,powerex reliant energy,and,here,congress used the term minor child in both of the subsections dealing with holders a k iii and d.the government nonetheless would have us read minor child in a k iii to mean the child of the alien parent for purposes of a child obtaining a,but then read minor child in d to mean the child of the stepparent for purposes of a child adjusting status thus triggering b b definition of stepchild for adjustment purposes only and justifying the regulation bar to status adjustment for children whose parents wed after the child turns eighteen.even putting aside that the government eschews the latter interpretation of this very term in d as it relates to children,there is no textual basis for its reading of the statute,see supra note,nor any indication congress intended to alter whose child a minor child must be for purposes of the versus adjustment of status.rather,the text and this interpretive canon lead us to conclude the term should be interpreted the same way in both places,covering the b children of the alien parent up to age,see supra note,both for purposes of obtaining a visa and for adjusting status once stateside.
third,our duty to construe statutes,not isolated provisions,gustafson,at,means that definitions in other parts of the ina may also shed light on what congress envisioned would be necessary for a child to apply to adjust her status.in this case,the provision explicitly in d that describes the conditional lawful permanent residence status for which holders apply under a and d provides further evidence that congress did not intend to require a child to prove she is the child of her stepparent to apply for adjustment of status.section h defines the alien son or daughter who is subject to the strictures of as an alien who obtains the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence by virtue of being the son or daughter of an individual through a qualifying marriage.h emphasis added.the government reading of d would require us to interpret the word individual in h to refer only to the petitioning stepparent.but where congress intended to distinguish between the terms alien spouse and petitioning spouse,it did so,as reflected elsewhere in.see,id.c a ii if the alien spouse and petitioning spouse appear at the interview to remove the conditional nature of the alien spouse lawful permanent residence id.h,separately defining alien spouse and petitioning spouse,respectively.congress opted not to do so in defining alien son or daughter in h,and,as the supreme court has said,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it from another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion,russello united states,quoting united states wong kim bo,cir.see also shalom pentecostal,at.we thus accord significance to congress decision to describe an alien son or daughter basis for admission to legal permanent residence under and,by extension,under d not as her status as the child of the petitioning spouse,but as her status as the son or daughter of either parent,so long as it is through a qualifying marriage.h.
fourth,we find confirmation of congress intent in the title of a statute and the heading of a section,both of which are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.united states,quoting of trainmen balt.ohio.the part of the life act that created visas and extended d to cover them is entitled encouraging immigrant family reunification,pub,tit.xi,stat,as amended,making apparent that congress intended visas to enable family reunification for parents and children up to age who were seeking lawful permanent residence not to authorize a temporary visit and concomitant statutory bar on the eighteen to year olds in that group from ever adjusting status from within the united states.to interpret the life act to require these children to separate from their parents and younger siblings in the united states and return to their home countries to apply for lawful permanent residence would hardly encourag e immigrant family reunification it would statutorily impede it.
fifth,we interpret statutes consistent with the canon that congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions it does not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes.whitman am.trucking ass ns.yet the government would take us on a circuitous route through the ina to explain how d should be read to impose by virtue of stringing together a,a a i,and b b,see supra part a devastating burden on children that is inconsistent with the statutory treatment of,and the agency own preexisting regulatory framework for,children.the strictures of statutory construction compel us instead to stay on the clear path paved by the language of d.
finally,we avoid interpreting statutes in a way that would render them absurd.see,republic of iraq beaty,discounting a proffered statutory interpretation in part because it would have been an absurd reading,not only textually but in the result it produces holy trinity church united states,construing a law to avoid absurdity.under the current regime,if a child of an alien spouse stays behind in her home country while her alien parent moves to the united states and adjusts status,that child would be eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence from abroad,albeit through a long and arduous process.the very purpose of,however,is to allow for family reunification stateside pending adjustment of status for the alien parent and minor children of the new family.it is therefore surely unreasonable to believe that the legislat ure intended,holy trinity church,at,that,in granting visas to older alien children,it was,in effect,disqualifying any such child who chose to exercise that visa from seeking lawful permanent residence from within the united states.indeed,the government reading of d would transform visas for older children into nothing more than tourist visas,giving their holders only a glimpse of what life with their families might have been like in america before being sent home because they are legally incapable of fulfilling a eligibility requirement.such a reading defies common sense.
statutory and regulatory context 
the regulatory and statutory backdrop to the life act further demonstrates that the regulation is incompatible with congress eligibility scheme,for congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change or adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law,at least insofar as the prior interpretation affects the new statute.lorillard pons,citations omitted.here,before passing the life act in,congress was aware that the ins had promulgated k ii to fill the gap for older children and to ensure they would be eligible to apply for adjustment of status on the basis of the qualifying marriage,without having to demonstrate a relationship with their new stepparent.and,of course,congress itself had amended d in to specify that children could apply for status adjustment as a result of the marriage.itca b.against this backdrop,congress of this language without alteration when it extended d to the and visa holders indicates it expected children to likewise benefit from the.
the government counters that congress also was aware of the age restriction for a stepchild to qualify as a child under b and thus intended the life act to create a gap for older children.we reject this argument for three reasons.first,by adding the as a result of the marriage language to d in,congress created an alternative basis for eligibility to apply for status adjustment,eliminating the need for and children to qualify as the child ren of their stepparents under b.see supra part.second,the statutory text makes plain that the only adult with whom a child must have a b relationship is the alien parent.see id.third,lorillard counsels that,while congress was presumptively aware of b definition of child when it passed the life act,it was also presumptively aware that the ins had long interpreted minor child to mean an individual under age and already interpreted d,through the regulation,to relieve children of the strictures of b for purposes of adjusting status see at.thus,had congress intended to deviate from the existing interpretation,we would expect such deviation to have been explicit.see id.
congressional purpose 
setting aside the text,structure,and history of the ina,the government contends the regulation is a reasonable exercise of the attorney general regulatory authority because it furthers congress intent to combat marriage fraud.according to the government,there is a greater risk that and aliens will fraudulently obtain lawful permanent residence than their and counterparts because the marriages take place on foreign soil and because alien spouses are subject to fewer prophylactic fraud prevention measures than alien fiancé e while the government interest in combatting marriage fraud is indisputably a valid one,the government fails to explain how the regulation furthers this goal and thus can not justify the regulation on this basis.
first,the ina already provides the government with several means of combatting marriage fraud.a parent must have her initial visa petition which includes proof of a valid marriage approved before she and her children may even enter the united states,and the lawful permanent resident status that and aliens obtain thereafter is conditional under.see supra part.this conditional status remains in place until the married couple jointly files to lift this designation in the window preceding the second anniversary of obtaining conditional legal status.see c a,c b,d a.only if,after an interview with the couple,the government concludes that the marriage is not fraudulent does the alien status and that of her children become truly permanent.see id.c b,c.on the other hand,if at any time during this period the government concludes the marriage was fraudulent or has been annulled or terminated,the alien permanent resident status is rescinded and she and,by extension,her children are rendered removable.see id.b,c c a d i.this temporary,conditional status thus provides the government with a backstop to prevent fraudulent marriages from resulting in permanent legal status and an additional mechanism to catch fraud that may have slipped through an initial review.accord gallimore att y,cir.the purpose of the scheme is obvious to ferret out sham marriages entered into for the purpose of obtaining entry into the united states.
second,and more fundamentally,the government has failed to explain why a regulation that targets the children and more precisely,the older children of alien spouses in any way advances the underlying effort to combat marriage fraud.that goal may be served by careful scrutiny of the parent and petitions and the documentation required at the visa interview to prove both the parent relationship with the and the children relationship with their parent,but the government has not shown how it is served by requiring a second petition on behalf of a child.indeed,the government candidly conceded at oral argument that the regulation effect of forcing older children back overseas does not prevent marriage fraud.oral arg.at 
the stated goal of combatting marriage fraud thus can not explain the regulation differential treatment of and children or why the government should,in effect,accord less value to the dignity and integrity of a family unit when a citizen is already married to an alien spouse than when an alien is entering the united states with the stated intention of marrying a citizen.in short,the government has failed to show the regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute,zheng,at quoting chevron,at,or comport s with congress stated intent,id.at,to combat marriage fraud.
limits on the attorney general regulatory authority 
finally,the considerations that led us in zheng to hold that the regulation in that case exceeded the permissible scope of the attorney general regulatory authority under a compel the same conclusion here.zheng instructed that we pay heed to our obligation to respect the decisions of the immigration agencies but recognized our even higher obligation to respect the clearly expressed will of congress.at.and while acknowledging the attorney general authority under a to regulate eligibility to apply for adjustment of status,zheng demarcated the bounds of that authority where congress has made clear through the statutory language,structure,history,and purpose its intent to authorize a certain class of aliens to apply for adjustment of status,a regulation that strips such aliens of eligibility altogether can not be deemed reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design.id.at quoting nationsbank,at see id.at.
here,the attorney general overstepped those bounds.whereas congress envisioned that an alien spouse and her children up to age could enter the united states and live as a family with the spouse while applying for adjustment of status,the regulation makes it legally impossible for an older child to apply at all,so long as she remains part of the family unit.and whereas,by enacting d,congress closed a gap that would have forced such children to return to their home countries if they had passed their eighteenth birthday by the date of their parent marriage,the regulation essentially reverses the eligibility structure set out by congress,id.at,by reopening that gap and thereby categorically barring the otherwise eligible class of older children from applying for adjustment within the united states.thus,as in zheng,the regulation can not be harmonize d with the plain language of the ina,its origin,and purpose,id.at quoting,at,and can not survive scrutiny under chevron step two 
iv.conclusion 
while the nation immigration laws are at times labyrinthine,we decline to hold today that they offer older children nothing more than a legal dead end.for the aforementioned reasons,although we reach our decision at chevron step two rather than step one,we ultimately agree with the thoughtful decision of the seventh circuit in akram and likewise hold that i is invalid.accordingly,we will grant cen petition for review,reverse the board decision,and remand cen case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the statutes relevant to and visa holders refer to them as minor child ren,a k iii,d,a term the bia has long held,and the parties do not dispute,has the same meaning as child under b.see,in re le,bia see also k.child is defined as an unmarried person under who fits within one of the subcategories under b,some of which impose additional age requirements.for purposes of this case,petitioner was born to her biological mother by all representations,in wedlock and thus is not subject to additional age restrictions.b a.accordingly,our regular reference in this opinion to children under the age of should not be construed to implicitly remove the additional age restrictions on accessing a that would accompany certain categories of children,b e i generally restricting adopted children from the definition of child under the ina if they were over the age of sixteen at the time of the adoption.as discussed in more detail below,infra notes,we accept the bia interpretation of the term minor child.
this third requirement refers to the limited number of permanent visas apportioned to a given nation.spouses and children of citizens do not have to wait for such visas because a separate statute makes permanent visas always available to them regardless of their country of origin.b a i.meanwhile,children of lawful permanent residents may obtain lawful permanent residence themselves,but must wait for a visa to become available.a.notably,even if a holder parent becomes a citizen as has petitioner mother,a holder must adjust through the a process and can not invoke a different basis for adjustment at a later date,adjustment based on her parent naturalization.see c ii.
throughout this opinion,we use the descriptors older and older to refer to a child who is under and thus young enough to obtain a or visa,but who was also over eighteen at the time of her parent marriage and thus too old to qualify under b b as the child of her new stepparent.
on march,the ins was disbanded as an independent agency within the united states department of justice,and its functions were reassigned to the united states department of homeland security.homeland security act of,pub,stat,codified at.the ins was the agency responsible for promulgating all the regulations at issue in this case.
while the petition is still called the petition for alien fiancé e,its instructions expressly indicate that it is also the proper form to file on behalf of a spouse.fed.reg,explaining that,upon passage of the life act,the ins would use the form to consider petitions for and visas until further notice.
at this interview,each alien seeking a or visa must provide the following an individual form application for each individual including one for each child,though each child eligibility is ultimately tied to the single form filed by the american citizen a valid passport original or certified copies of birth certificates,the marriage certificate for the marriage to the citizen spouse,divorce or death certificates for any previous marriages,and police certificates identifying past and present countries of residence proof of a medical examination evidence of financial support photographs additional evidence of the spouse relationship with the citizen and application fees for each visa recipient.dep t of state bureau of consular affairs,nonimmigrant visa for a spouse,last visited.
a child who was under eighteen at the time of her parent marriage is still able to apply for adjustment of status under the regulation because,due to her age at the time of the marriage,she would still qualify as her stepparent child under b b.her petition thus could be approved and would render her eligible to apply for permanent residence under a.
it is undisputed that,once cen passed her birthday,her visa expired,k,and if she remains in the united states today,she does so without authorization.
in the alternative,cen argues that the regulation irrationally distinguishes between and children in violation of her constitutional right to equal protection under the law.because we resolve this case on chevron grounds,we do not reach cen constitutional claim.see,lyng nw.indian cemetery protective ass n,a fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.accord akram,at.
in its brief,the government references the deference courts afford to an agency interpretation of its own regulations under auer robbins.here,the bia interpreted the regulation effect in in re akram in a manner that is indeed consistent with the language of the regulation.we address below the underlying question whether the regulation itself is a permissible construction of the ina,and we therefore review it through the lens of chevron.
of course,a determination that the language of d is itself ambiguous would be an independent reason to proceed to chevron step two.on the one hand,for the reasons set forth below,there is a compelling argument that the statutory language and structure of the ina clearly and unambiguously authorize older children to apply for adjustment of status on the basis of their parent marriage and without proving an independent relationship with their stepparent.see infra part.on the other hand,the government argues that the interplay of b b,a a i,a,and d makes the statute at worst ambiguous,and,while no party here disputes that the term minor child in a k iii and d has the same meaning as child in b,the ina is not explicit on this point.we need not decide whether d is itself ambiguous,however,because zheng mandates in any event that we review the regulation at step two as an exercise of the attorney general delegated authority to regulate eligibility.at.to the extent there is arguably ambiguity as to the meaning of minor child in d,moreover,we note that the bia interpretation that the undefined term minor child means a child,as defined in section b of the ina,in re le,at see also k,is consistent with the language and purpose of the ina as described below and therefore is entitled to chevron deference.akram,at implicitly recognizing the reasonableness of the bia interpretation of minor child by citing to in re le for the proposition of defining a minor child as a child under the ina.
the language referencing the citizen who filed the petition to accord that alien nonimmigrant status was added to d in during congress attempt to stem the tide of marriage fraud.read in context,this language simply forecloses a holder from adjusting status based on a or alien marriage to a different citizen than the one who filed the petition on that alien behalf.in the case of an alien fiancé e,the statute thus would prevent a child from adjusting status if her parent were to marry someone other than the original citizen petitioner,and in the case of an alien spouse,the statute would prevent a child from adjusting status if her parent were to divorce,once stateside,from the citizen spouse who initially filed the petition to accord the and aliens their nonimmigrant visas and,perhaps,remarry a different citizen.
nor is there a plausible argument that the parent referenced in the clause or,in the case of a minor child,the parent,refers to the stepparent,as a child eligibility to adjust status would then accrue as a result of the marriage of the citizen to the citizen.this clearly can not be correct.in contrast,reading d as contemplating a relationship between the parent and the child,rather than between the stepparent and the child,accords with the plain langua
