jose medina lara medina,a mexican citizen and lawful permanent resident of the united states,seeks review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals board authorizing his removal to mexico.the board held that medina is removable because his california drug conviction is both an aggravated felony and a conviction relating to a controlled substance and because a sentence enhancement appended to that conviction is a firearm offense,as those terms are defined by the immigration nationality act ina,a.because each of these conclusions is erroneous,we grant the petition.
factual background and procedural history 
immigration authorities admitted medina as a lawful permanent resident in.in,a california court convicted medina of violating california health safety code and applied an enhancement for carrying a firearm during that offense in violation of california penal code c.in,a california court convicted medina of violating california health safety code.all convictions were entered pursuant to plea agreements.we refer to these convictions by their statute number,the conviction.we refer to the and the convictions collectively as the drug convictions.
after he completed his sentence for the conviction,the department of homeland security dhs took medina into custody and initiated removal proceedings although the charging documents in the record are somewhat unclear,it appears that dhs alleged that the drug convictions render medina removable because each is both an aggravated felony and a conviction relating to a controlled substance under the ina dhs further alleged the conviction renders medina removable because it is a firearm offense under the ina medina denied these allegations and,in the alternative,applied for cancellation of removal 
proceedings before the agency were protracted.medina first appeared before an immigration judge ij in san francisco,california,on november.medina requested an initial continuance to obtain counsel and later requested additional time to pursue a.for its part,dhs requested several continuances to supplement the record with documents pertaining to medina convictions.this was necessary because the parties and the ij seemed to agree early on in the proceedings that the drug convictions were not categorically predicate offenses under the ina,thus requiring application of the modified categorical approach as described in shepard united states.
the first round of ij proceedings took about six months and involved at least five separate requests by the ij to have the government supply documents which would unambiguously establish the nature of medina convictions.at an early hearing,dhs represented that it was seeking additional documents to supplement the record,and the ij granted a continuance,in part,to allow the government to respond to that request when,at a hearing six weeks later,the government produced no new documents,the ij got specific,noting that there must have been a super s eding charging document at some point and we do have that in the record.once again,the ij requested additional documentation,and later on in the same hearing,it appears dhs attorney agreed to provide it,saying w e need to get the super s eding indictment.the ij granted another continuance two weeks later,the government failed to produce the requested documents and yet again asked for more time.the ij granted the government request,saying,let see what the government can come up with by way of documents and the more the better.two weeks after that,the government did submit additional documents however,even these appear to have been insufficient,because the ij requested further documents so that the court could get into a position where there no ambiguity whatsoever about medina convictions.the ij specifically noted he wanted to avoid a situation where it turns out later someone makes an assertion he was convicted of something and there a dispute about it.
two and a half months later,the parties reconvened.the ij,noting that the complaint contained a complicated set of charges,called the minutes of the state court proceedings a jumble and once again asked the government to clarify if it had requested a transcript of medina plea colloquy,saying,i think the transcript ought to be requested.because the government was not sure if it had requested the documents,the ij gave the government one more month to supplement the record.medina,by now detained for five months,consented to the continuance even though he was ready to proceed on that date finally,at a june,hearing,the government admitted it was unable to produce the transcript and instead attempted to submit a probation report to clarify the nature of medina convictions.the ij excluded that report under shepard 
though the government neither produced the requested plea colloquy nor any additional unambiguous documents,the ij nevertheless ordered medina removal,holding that each drug conviction is both an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense under the ina and that the conviction is a firearm offense under the ina.medina appealed to the board.in an order dismissing medina appeal the order,the board held that medina was removable on all five grounds identified by the ij put another way,the board reached a conclusion as to all of dhs allegations.
medina then sought review in this court.before we could hear the case on the merits,the board sua sponte reopened medina case to reconsider his application for cancellation of removal.divested of jurisdiction,we dismissed the pending petition for review.medina lara holder,ecf cir,order.
the board remanded the reopened case to the ij for reconsideration of medina cancellation application.at this point,litigation virtually began anew.following a transfer of venue to the immigration court in tacoma,washington,where medina was detained,medina renewed his efforts to terminate removal proceedings based on his theory that none of his convictions suffices as a predicate for removal,initiated state proceedings in an effort to vacate his california convictions,and restarted his efforts to obtain a.dhs opposed these efforts and sought a new removal order.the ij ordered medina removal.the ij held that,though not categorically an aggravated felony or a controlled substances offense,is divisible and that an application of the modified categorical approach showed that the conviction constitutes both an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense.the ij further held that is categorically a firearm offense under the ina,and thus ordered medina removed on that ground as well.the ij did not address the conviction.medina appealed to the board,which affirmed,also without addressing the conviction.medina again sought review in this court.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
notwithstanding a d,we have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction and to determine as a question of law whether the underlying predicate offenses render medina removable.a d malilia holder,cir.while we may consider only those arguments raised in administrative proceedings,barron ashcroft,cir,we deem exhausted any issues addressed by the board.kin holder,cir.
where,as here,the board incorporates the ij decision into its own without citing matter of burbano,bia,this court will review the ij decision to the extent incorporated.ahir mukasey,cir citation omitted.thus,we refer to the board and ij collectively as the agency.we review the agency legal conclusions de novo.malilia,at.
i.the conviction 
we hold that medina conviction is neither an aggravated felony nor controlled substance offense under the ina.
breadth and divisibility 
to determine whether the conviction is a predicate aggravated felony or controlled substance offense,we use the framework set out in taylor united states,as refined by its progeny,most notably descamps united states.the taylor descamps framework lays out a process for determining whether a specific conviction is a predicate offense mandating removal under the ina at the first step,we ask whether the statute of conviction is a categorical match to the generic predicate offense that is,if the statute of conviction criminalizes only as much or less conduct than the generic offense.taylor,at rendon,wl,at.if so,the inquiry ends,because the conviction categorically constitutes a predicate offense.if not,we move on to step two and ask if the statute of conviction comparatively overbroad element is divisible if not,then our inquiry ends,because a conviction under an indivisible,overbroad statute can never serve as a predicate offense.see descamps.at.but if the overbroad element or elements is divisible,we then continue to the third step,an application of the modified categorical approach,which we describe in more detail below.
here,because the agency proceeded to step three and relied upon a modified categorical analysis,we,too,must consider all three issues breadth,divisibility,and the modified categorical approach.the parties concessions make the analysis simple at steps one and two.our focus is on the controlled substance element of the government concedes that is not a categorical match to the generic offense,because california list of controlled substances includes one or more substances not controlled by federal law.see also cheuk fung s yong holder,cir we have previously found that california law regulates the possession and sale of many substances that are not regulated by the federal csa.this concession ushers us to step two,where medina concedes that our recent decision in coronado holder,cir,amended by,wl july,forecloses his previous argument that controlled substance element is indivisible.based on this concession,we assume,without deciding,that controlled substance element is divisible that is,that the specific controlled substance,cocaine is an element of the crime.
modified categorical approach 
we now confront the third step in the taylor descamps procedure an application of the modified categorical approach.the modified categorical approach centers on a conviction elements,not the facts underlying it.under descamps,it makes no difference if medina actually possessed or purchased,for sale,cocaine.rather,what matters is whether medina was convicted of possessing or purchasing,for sale,cocaine,where cocaine is an element of the crime.to make this determination,the agency and we may look to only those documents sanctioned by shepard,namely the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,or to some comparable judicial record of this information.at.
we permit reliance on an abstract of judgment in combination with a charging document to establish that the defendant pled guilty to a generic crime under the modified categorical approach.ramirez villalpando holder,cir.sitting en banc,we have held that i n order to identify a conviction as the generic offense through the modified categorical approach,when the record of conviction comprises only the indictment and the judgment,the judgment must contain the critical phrase as charged in the information.united states vidal,cir en banc quoting li ashcroft,cir.
subsequently,we have not been so exacting as to require that the phrase as charged in the information appear on the abstract of judgment,cabantac holder,cir per curiam looking to the allegations in a complaint where the abstract of judgment and transcript of the plea colloquy clearly referenced the count to which the defendant pleaded guilty id.at we hold that where,as here,the abstract of judgment or minute order specifies that a defendant pleaded guilty to a particular count of the criminal complaint or indictment,we can consider the facts alleged in that count.ramirez villalpando,at similar.
however,we have never retreated from vidal core requirement when a court using the modified categorical approach to determine whether an underlying conviction is a predicate offense relies solely on the link between the charging papers and the abstract of judgment,that link must be clear and convincing.put another way,where,as here,the government bears the burden of proof to show by clear and convincing evidence that the conviction is a predicate offense,c a accord fregozo holder,cir,the government must demonstrate that the abstract clearly and convincingly shows that medina pleaded guilty to the cocaine element as alleged in the complaint.
the agency relied on two documents,a written,amended complaint and an abstract of judgment,and so we look only to these.the amended complaint,which alleges five counts of misconduct,seems to have two docket numbers.the first,typewritten,is.the second,handwritten,is ss.the complaint is marked filed in court on april.count of the complaint alleges that on or about december,the crime of possession for sale of a controlled substance,in violation of section of the health and safety code,a felony,was committed by jose luis medina,who did willfully and unlawfully possess for sale a controlled substance,to wit,cocaine.the complaint is certified by the clerk of the superior court of monterey county,california.
box on the abstract of judgment lists medina two convictions.the first row in this box deals with medina conviction.the second row pertains to the conviction.we discuss that conviction below.under count,the document lists.under code,it lists hs.under section,it lists.under crime,it lists poss cont subs.under year crime committed,it lists.and under date of conviction,it lists.
box pertains to enhancements.the first line in this box and the only line containing any information lists under count the number and under enhancement the reference to pc c.the only other relevant box on this form appears toward the corner.it is labeled a and contains this number.
here,the government has failed to carry its burden of showing a clear and convincing link between the abstract and the charging papers.recall that our focus is on the controlled substance element of.while the complaint clearly bases count three on the alleged possession for sale of cocaine,the abstract does not list the specific controlled substance element to which medina pleaded guilty.instead,it simply contains the phrase cont sub.this critical ambiguity materially distinguishes this case from cabantac,in which the abstract clearly specified that the conviction was for possession of methamphetamine.at see also ramirez villalpando,at holding that the abstract,which contained the term pers prop,was sufficient to establish that the defendant pleaded guilty to the element of theft of personal property.
this is not the only ambiguity in the link between the abstract and the complaint.the abstract states medina pleaded to count,not count as it is denominated in the complaint.the tacoma immigration judge posited that the reflected the fact that the third count of the complaint contained both the charge and the enhancement,in that order,and so the a referred to the main charge rather than the count as a whole or the enhancement.the government defends this theory and also advances its own,namely,that the refers to the a box toward the upper side of the abstract,in which a docket number is printed.
while these are both plausible explanations of what the abstract might mean,they suffer a common and fatal flaw if,as the ij posited,the were a function of the bifurcation of the third count of the complaint,we would expect the enhancement listed on this same abstract to be coded.likewise,as the government argues in the alternative,if the a in the relates to the case number in the corner box,we would expect the enhancement to be coded.but the enhancement is coded with no letter appended,casting significant doubt on both of the government theories.
while the government theories are certainly plausible,just as plausible is that the a in stands for amended.indeed,the record suggests that count might have been amended beyond even the written amendment in the administrative record.the san francisco ij noted that there is a disconnect between the charging document and the abstract because the counts do correspond.by way of explaining why this might be,the ij went on to speculate that there must have been a super s eding charging document at some time.the dhs attorney seemed to agree,saying,we need to get the super s eding indictment.moreover,because california allows for indictments to be amended orally in open court,see people sandoval,d,cal,there would not necessarily be any written record of a superseding indictment in the state court papers.
against this backdrop,we are to say that there is a clear and convincing link between the in the abstract and the in the amended complaint.there are three competing explanations for the extra letter,and none is wholly satisfactory.and,problematically,this still does not exhaust the ambiguities between the documents.
the docket number on the abstract also has an unexplained a appended to it.the ij speculated that this extra letter was the result of a clerical error.standing alone,perhaps this would not negate an otherwise clear and convincing showing.but,as we have discussed above,this extra letter is far from the only ambiguity in the purported link between the complaint and the abstract and may also refer to an amended complaint not present in the administrative record.
we note that the record does not contain any serious suggestion that medina was apprehended with any substance other than one controlled by federal law.but,as we observed above,under descamps,whether medina actually possessed or purchased,for sale,cocaine makes no difference.at.we must look only to the elements to which medina pleaded guilty.because on this record it is not clear and convincing that he pleaded guilty to possessing or purchasing,for sale,cocaine,the government has not carried its burden of establishing that his conviction is an aggravated felony or a controlled substance offense.
ii.the conviction 
medina also challenges the agency holding that his is a firearm offense as that term is defined by u.a c here,unlike the conviction discussed above,the agency stopped at the first step of the taylor descamps analysis,holding that the statute of conviction is a categorical match to the generic offense.
for this proposition,the agency relied on gil holder,cir.indeed,gil seems on point,and if gil were still good law,it would appear to preclude medina challenge.recognizing this,medina directs us to our recent decision in united states aguilera rios,cir,which holds that moncrieffe holder,overruled gil.the government contends that aguilera rios does not control the outcome here.
medina has the better argument.the issue in gil was whether california definition of firearm was a categorical match to the federal definition.the ina expressly excludes antique firearms from the generic definition of a firearm.see a c incorporating into this provision the definition of firearm located at a a the term firearm does not include an antique firearm.at the time of his conviction,the term firearm in was defined by former california penal code b,which does not exclude antique firearms thus,a plain language comparison of the statutes would suggest that b is overbroad.
however,the board had determined in matter of mendez orellana,bia,that the antique firearm exception was an affirmative defense to removability,and gil accepted that reading of the statute.because recourse to a hypothetical affirmative defense,one not actually advanced in the underlying proceeding may not necessarily impact a subsequent court taylor analysis of a statute of conviction,gil held that california definition of a firearm categorically matched the federal definition.aguilera rios,at we are not holding that gil distinction between affirmative defenses and elements of a crime is invalid for all categorical analyses.rather,we read moncrieffe as applying particularly to definitional provisions,and as holding that as to such provisions,the allocation of the burden of proof is not relevant to a categorical analysis.
aguilera rios holds that moncrieffe implicitly rejects gil analysis and mandates the conclusion that california firearm definition is overbroad.at.we do not repeat aguilera rios reasoning,here as a three judge panel,our task is to determine whether it binds us,or if,as the government suggests,aguilera rios is distinguishable.we hold that aguilera rios applies to any california statute based on the definition of firearm formerly appearing at b.although the underlying conviction in aguilera rios was obtained under former california penal code c,that statute incorporates by reference the same definition of firearm as does c,the statute of medina conviction.this is sufficient to bind us to aguilera rios holding.
the government argues that there is only a theoretical possibility and not a realistic probability that california would prosecute an individual under c where the firearm in question was antique.see gonzales duenas alvarez.to support this argument,the government points to the absence of any reported california case upholding a c conviction based on possession of an antique firearm.by contrast,medina notes that c simply incorporates by reference the definition of firearm appearing at former b,and that there are a good many cases in which california obtained a conviction based on that definition in which the firearm in question was antique.
medina is correct that our inquiry must focus on california interpretation of former b rather than convictions based on c.no conviction could have arisen under former b,because it simply defined the term firearm as used in title of part of the california penal code.other statutes in that title criminalize conduct.it does not matter if the conduct is criminalized by former c,as in aguilera rios by c,as here or by former a,as in gil.because the common link in these cases is the b definition of firearm,our analysis should center on that statute.indeed,the agency implicitly conceded as much when it cited gil to sustain the firearms charge against medina.because gil analyzed a,the board could have applied it to medina case only if gil holding was rooted in the definition appearing at former b.
having framed the inquiry correctly,medina challenge easily passes the duenas alvarez bar.california obviously prosecutes individuals for firearm crimes arising under the former b definition even when the firearm in question is antique.aguilera rios cites several appellate cases from the past decade in which california courts held that,as for example,a replica pistol,a family heirloom replica rifle incapable of using modern ammunition,and a black powder,firearm,are firearms within the meaning of former b.aguilera rios,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also,people mcgraw,wl unpub.sustaining conviction where firearm was,disassembled antique revolver.these recent examples of california prosecutions demonstrate a realistic probability that california may obtain a conviction based on the b definition even where the firearm in question is antique.thus,because b is overbroad,the board conclusion that is categorically a firearm offense can not stand.
although the agency did not assess the divisibility of former b,we may proceed to do so without first remanding to the board.divisibility is a purely legal question which does not require any additional.ruiz vidal gonzales,cir declining remand where no further remains to be done.we owe no deference to the board interpretation of a criminal statute it does not administer,see fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir en banc,meaning that if we remanded to the board to determine whether former b is divisible,we would review that conclusion de novo rather than under chevron,natural res.def.council.mandujano real mukasey,cir.in short,the interests of judicial and administrative economy dictate that we consider divisibility at this juncture.
former b is indivisible.as we discuss above,the statute does not even mention antique firearms.like california penal code,the statute analyzed in descamps,former b and,when read together,clearly criminalize a swath of conduct not contemplated by the generic offense.this is not a situation where the statute effectively creates several different crimes,descamps.quoting nijhawan holder,where at least one,but not all of those crimes matches the generic version.id.as in descamps,there is a simple discrepancy between the generic crime and th
