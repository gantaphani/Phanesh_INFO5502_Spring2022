the united states citizen and immigration services uscis denied petitioner nelly supangan lockhart lockhart or lockhart application for an adjustment of status to that of permanent united states resident on the ground that she was statutorily ineligible for such adjustment because she was no longer an immediate relative under the immigration and nationality act ina,et,upon the death of her husband.lockhart filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,seeking injunctive,declaratory,and mandamus relief to compel respondent janet napolitano,secretary of the department of homeland security secretary of dhs,to find,as a matter of law,that she is an immediate relative under ina,b a i,b a i,and to reopen and readjudicate her application for adjustment of status.the sole issue before us is a question of law,which requires us to interpret language of the ina to resolve a matter of first impression in this circuit.the question is whether an,whose filed the necessary immediate relative petition form under,c,but died within two years of the qualifying marriage,qualifies as a spouse under the immediate relative provision of the ina.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that a surviving is a spouse within the meaning of the immediate relative provision of the ina.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for lockhart.
background 
factual background 
the facts are not in dispute.lockhart is a citizen of the philippines who was lawfully admitted to the united states on december.shortly thereafter,on january,she married gerald lockhart,a united states citizen.following the marriage,on february,lockhart filed a form petition for alien relative petition with the cleveland,ohio field office of the uscis attesting lockhart status as his spouse and requesting her classification as an immediate relative under b a i.on the same day,lockhart filed a form application to register permanent residence or adjust status under a.as described below,immediate relative status is a prerequisite to eligibility for adjustment of status under a.
four months later,on june,lockhart gave birth to a son,justin carlyle lockhart.lockhart was listed as justin father.during this time,the uscis began processing the lockharts form petition and form application.in april or may,the uscis interviewed the lockharts.at the interview,both and lockhart testified as to the validity of their marriage.on april,the uscis requested additional evidence from lockhart,which she subsequently sent to the cleveland,ohio office in april.
on december,lockhart died suddenly of a heart attack.at the time of lockhart death,he and lockhart had been married for one year and eleven months,and the uscis had not adjudicated the form petition or the form application.on june,more than two years after lockhart filed his petition and his wife filed her application,the uscis requested a copy of lockhart death certificate.thereafter,on october,the uscis denied the form petition and the form application.uscis denied the form petition solely on the ground that,upon the death of her united states citizen husband,lockhart was no longer the spouse of a united states citizen and was,therefore,not entitled to treatment as an immediate relative under b a i.the uscis subsequently denied lockhart form application because it was dependent on approval of the form petition.
on november,lockhart filed a motion to reopen and reconsider the denial of her deceased husband form petition.on december,the uscis denied this motion without explanation.currently,lockhart is in removal proceedings before the united states immigration court in cleveland,ohio.
procedural background 
on march,lockhart filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.lockhart later amended the complaint to request injunctive,declaratory,and mandamus relief to compel the secretary to find that,as a matter of law,she is an immediate relative under ina b a i,b a i,and to reopen and readjudicate lockhart form petition and her application for adjustment of status.thereafter,the secretary filed a motion to dismiss lockhart petition for mandamus relief and her complaint.lockhart filed a motion for summary judgment.after considering the motions,the district court concluded that lockhart is a spouse under b a i,denied the secretary motion to dismiss,and granted summary judgment in favor of lockhart.this timely appeal followed.

standard of review 
this court reviews the district court determination of a purely legal question,such as the proper definition of spouse under b a i de novo.freeman gonzales,cir citing de martinez ashcroft,cir see also sanusi gonzales,cir.
b.the ina statutory framework 
the ina provides numerical limits on the number of aliens who may be issued immigrant visas or admitted to the united states for permanent residence.a.however,the immediate relatives of united states citizens are not subject to the direct numerical limitations.see b.in order for an alien to immigrate as an immediate relative based on a close family relationship to a citizen or resident,a qualifying family relationship must exist.the alien is not automatically accorded the status of immediate relative under this provision instead,the united states citizen or lawful permanent resident to whom the alien is related must file a form petition on the alien behalf with the uscis to establish the existence of the relationship.a a i.the uscis shall approve the petition if it determines,after investigating the facts in each case,that the facts stated in the petition are true and the alien is an immediate relative.b.
following the uscis approval of the citizen petition,an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien,and the alien is eligible for an adjustment of status to that of permanent resident.a a.adjustment of status under is a process.first,the alien must prove statutory eligibility for the adjustment,and second,the attorney,in the context of deportation proceedings,the immigration exercise his discretion to grant relief.
the question before this court is whether an whose filed the necessary immediate relative form under,c,but died within two years of the qualifying marriage,nonetheless remains a spouse under b a i and is entitled to treatment as a spouse when the dhs adjudicates that alien petition to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident.two other circuit courts have weighed in on this precise issue,but they reached opposite conclusions.see freeman gonzales,cir and robinson napolitano,cir.in freeman,the ninth circuit held that the language,structure,purpose and application of b a i indicate that congress intended a surviving to remain a spouse under the immediate relative provision despite the death of the.see freeman,at.in robinson,the third circuit reached the opposite conclusion,finding that a surviving is not an immediate relative under b a i.robinson,at.
the secretary argues that lockhart is no longer the spouse of a united states citizen because,as a matter of law,her marriage ended when lockhart died.put simply,the secretary argues that because lockhart is no longer legally married,she is likewise no longer lockhart spouse,and,therefore,no longer an immediate relative.we disagree.as set forth below,we are persuaded by the reasoning of the ninth circuit and,therefore,hold that a surviving whose filed the necessary immediate relative form under,c,but died within two years of the qualifying marriage remains a spouse under b a i.
c.the plain language of b a i 
the supreme court has established a framework for interpreting statutes first,a natural reading of the full text second,the meaning of the statutory terms and finally,consideration of the statutory and legislative history for guidance.united states ex rel.a homecare,medshares mgmt.group,cir citing united states wells,d.in interpreting the immediate relative provision,we begin by examining the language of the statute itself to determine if its meaning is plain.plain meaning is examined by looking at the language and design of the statute as a whole.united states parrett,cir quoting united states wagner,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,if the statutory language is not clear,we may examine the relevant legislative history.id.the relevant part of defines an immediate relative as 
the children,spouses,and parents of a citizen of the united states,except that,in the case of parents,such citizens shall be at least years of age.in the case of an alien who was the spouse of a citizen of the united states for at least years at the time of the citizen death and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen death,the alien and each child of the alien shall be considered,for purposes of this subsection,to remain an immediate relative after the date of the citizen death but only if the spouse files a petition under section a a ii a a ii within years after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries.for purposes of this clause,an alien who has filed a petition under clause iii or iv of section a a of this act a a remains an immediate relative in the event that the united states citizen spouse or parent loses united states citizenship on account of the abuse.
b a i.according to the plain language of the first sentence of b a i,spouses are immediate relatives.in the first sentence of the immediate relative provision,o nly alien parents are subject to any limitation,with the grant of immediate relative status being restricted to those whose citizen child is at least years of age.freeman,at see also b a i.given that t here is no comparable qualifier to be a spouse that is,a requirement that the marriage must have existed for at least two years we must assume that congress intended no limitation on that term beyond the requirement that both parties are present for the marriage ceremony.freeman,at quoting keene united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.
the question,then,is whether the second sentence of the immediate relative provision modifies the first,such that an alien widow or widower is no longer a spouse if she or he had not been married for two years at the time of the death.we find that it does not.the second sentence of the immediate relative provision provides 
in the case of an alien who was the spouse of a citizen of the united states for at least years at the time of the citizen death and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen death,the alien and each child of the alien shall be considered,for purposes of this subsection,to remain an immediate relative after the date of the citizen death but only if the spouse files a petition under section a a ii a a ii within years after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries.
b a i.the grammatical structure of the immediate relative provision provides evidence that the first and second sentences of b a i are two distinct provisions.unlike the limitation placed on parents,congress did not explicitly impose a requirement on the term spouse in the first sentence.as the ninth circuit aptly notes,
i t is relevant that congress introduced the durational requirement for certain alien widows in a separate sentence of the statute.the grammatical structure of this statute suggests that the second sentence stands independent of the first and does not qualify the general definition of spouse.
freeman,at citing united states ron pair,d quotation marks omitted.we agree with the freeman court that the durational language in the second sentence of b a i grants a separate right to an alien widow to,within two years of the citizen spouse death,by filing a f orm where the citizen spouse had not filed an immediate relative petition prior to his death.id.at.under the regulations implementing the ina,a widow or widower may for classification as an immediate relative only if she had been married for at least two years to a united states citizen,the petition is filed within two years of the death of the citizen spouse,the alien petitioner and the citizen spouse were not legally separated at the time of the citizen death,and the alien spouse has not remarried.b i iv.from this,the freeman court reasoned that the more logical and statutorily substantiated interpretation of the second sentence is that it applies to those aliens whose citizen spouses did not initiate an adjustment of status proceeding before they died,granting such surviving spouses a beneficial right to file an immediate relative petition even without a living citizen spouse to vouch for the fact of the marriage.freeman,at.
according to the freeman court,the framework of immediate relative petitions as set forth in supports this conclusion.id.at.a describes the types of petitions that may be filed for an alien classification as an immediate relative under b a i of the ina.under a a i,a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the united states petitioning under section a a i or a b i of the act for a qualifying relative classification as an immediate relative under section b of the act must file a form p etition for the a lien r elative.while under section a of the ina,an whose had not filed a petition on his or her behalf prior to the death,may file a under section a a ii of the act for immediate relative status but must file a form petition.the freeman court explained that the distinction the regulations draw between the rights of a citizen spouse to petition as compared to those of an alien widow to is consistent with a congressional intent to create two different processes,such that one or the other the citizen spouse petitions or,if he dies without doing so,the alien widow may do so.freeman,at.but,there is no provision that the citizen spouse pending petition and consequently the alien spouse immediate relative status is voided on his death,requiring the widow to start over with her own.id.at.
like the freeman court,we conclude that the second sentence expands immediate relative status to include a surviving whose citizen spouse failed to file an application on his or her behalf prior to the death,but that sentence has no effect on the status of a surviving whose citizen spouse filed a petition for immediate relative status prior to his or her death.the language in the second sentence of the immediate relative provision appears to be a procedural requirement for a in the event that the dies,rather than a restriction on who is considered a spouse when the petitions on behalf of the alien spouse.
the use of the term spouse throughout the immediate relative provision also supports our conclusion.the term spouse is used in the second sentence of b a i to refer to a surviving.in the second sentence,an alien spouse whose citizen spouse has died and not filed a form petition on the alien spouse behalf may only if the spouse files a petition and only until the date the spouse remarries.b a i emphasis added.here,instead of referring to the surviving as a widow or widower,or with a qualifying term such as former or surviving,congress described the surviving as a spouse.the secretary,however,contends that congress use of the phrase was the spouse in the second sentence of b a i indicates that it considered a surviving spouse as separate and distinct from the common,ordinary meaning of the term spouse.we disagree.the more natural reading of the second sentence indicates that the word was does not merely modify the term spouse but modifies the entire phrase in order to establish a requirement for,the was a spouse for at least two years.b a i emphasis added.the grammatical structure of the entire second sentence supports our reading.there,the word was modifies the entire phrase,and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen death.b a i.accordingly,we conclude that surviving,whose petitioned on his or her behalf prior to death are spouses,are immediate relatives within the meaning of b a i.
common,ordinary meaning of the term spouse includes surviving spouses 
the meaning of the term spouse supports our reading of the ina.first,w
