said petitioner or and bahya safi petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia,which summarily affirmed an immigration judge ij decision to deny applications for asylum and withholding of deportation under the immigration and nationality act ina or act.challenges the propriety of the bia summary affirmance in his case.for the following reasons,we will deny the petition for review.
the ij found to be credible regarding his subjective narrative.the facts below are accordingly taken largely from his testimony.
petitioner was born on june,in khan younis,a town located in the area known as the gaza strip of what was then palestine.during the war of,israeli forces occupied the gaza strip,and entered petitioner house by force.in response,petitioner attacked one of the israeli soldiers with a stick.recalling a fearful memory from the sinai war where he had witnessed israeli soldiers lining up and shooting a group of palestinian youths,fled as the israeli soldiers shot at him.petitioner believed that the israeli soldiers had come to destroy his home,and that if he remained in gaza they would arrest and kill him in retaliation for his attack on the israeli soldier.he escaped to jordan.
from through,israeli soldiers approached petitioner parents and other family members demanding his whereabouts.specifically in,israeli soldiers forced parents from their home and demolished it.as a result of this ordeal,mother became mentally ill and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital,where she passed away in.other relatives were killed by israeli authorities.petitioner cousin,a judge in the gaza strip,was tortured and killed by israeli authorities for refusing to impose unlawful judgments against palestinian youths.according to petitioner testimony and an affidavit from the office of the palestinian national liberation movement,petitioner cousin essam was arrested during the great intifada in but managed to escape.petitioner testified that essam was tortured.
petitioner remained in jordan until october,when jordan agreed to issue travel documents to any palestinian refugee willing to leave.he traveled to kuwait,where he succeeded in receiving a sponsorship from a kuwaiti citizen.his residence permit,however,expired in and the sponsor refused renewal.he next lived in iraq until december,but returned to jordan to establish an importing business.petitioner operated his business from july until december.during this period he entered the united states on several occasions for business purposes.after his business in jordan came to a close,traveled to syria,turkey,greece,bulgaria,cyprus,and yugoslavia.he spent five and months in egypt,where he married his present wife in.
petitioner testified that israeli authorities will not permit him to return,and that the palestinian authority is powerless.as corroborated by a letter dated march,from the palestinian national liberation movement,the palestinian national authority denied his application for reunification with his family in gaza,because they were not processing applications at the time.he does not possess a palestinian passport,but has a traveling document from jordan.his wife,who was also born in khan younis but raised in egypt,has a traveling document from egypt.although he may enter jordan,his wife can not,and he will be asked to surrender his passport to jordan authorities.his children,who are all united states citizens,may only enter jordan on tourist visas.petitioner believes that neither he nor his wife will be accepted by any other country.
petitioners entered the united states on or about april,on a visitor visa issued with authorization to remain until october.on june,the former immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause in which it charged petitioners with remaining in the united states beyond the authorized period.on october,petitioners admitted the allegations,and the ij thus concluded that they are subject to deportation pursuant to section a b of the ina.seeking relief,petitioners applied for asylum and withholding of deportation.
the ij found said to be credible but denied his application for asylum.after identifying petitioner as a stateless palestinian,the ij observed that it was the conditions of unrest and battle brought about by the war,and not any individualized persecution of petitioner,that prompted petitioner flight from gaza in.in addition,the ij recognized that the war involved attacks and abuses by both israelis and palestinians.the ij reasoned that harm resulting from such violence in a situation of civil strife is not necessarily persecution on account of a statutory factor,and thus petitioner is not a refugee by virtue of past persecution.with respect to petitioner fear of future persecution claim,the ij found that the substantial amount of time that passed between petitioner flight and the present renders his subjective fear of retaliation objectively unfounded.addressing petitioner status as stateless,the ij concluded that statelessness alone does not warrant a grant of asylum,and noted as an additional matter the lack of any evidence,other than testimony,that the palestinian authority would deny him admission into the area it controls.in light of petitioner inability to qualify for asylum,the ij rejected his request for withholding of deportation,but granted the application for voluntary departure.on december,the bia affirmed without opinion the ij decision pursuant to e 
because petitioners were placed in deportation proceedings before april,and the final order of deportation was issued by the bia after october,our jurisdiction arises under,as amended by the transitional rules for judicial review in section c of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.the bia jurisdiction arose under b and 
the ij denied applications for relief,but granted voluntary departure.the bia affirmed without opinion,pursuant to e w hen the bia issues an affirmance without opinion under the streamlining regulations,we review the ij opinion and scrutinize its reasoning.dia ashcroft,cir en banc.under the substantial evidence standard,we must uphold the ij factual findings if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d.findings of past and future persecution are factual determinations and are accordingly subject to this deferential review.lukwago ashcroft,cir.
asserts that the bia erred in its decision to apply the streamlining regulations to his case because the criteria set forth in e were not met specifically,he contends that the ij decision is not correct the ij failed to review critical evidence the bia failed to address changed circumstances and new arguments were presented by petitioner to the bia.we conclude that the bia decision to streamline was not arbitrary and capricious.
substantial evidence supports the ij determination that petitioner does not qualify for asylum.pursuant to b,the attorney general may grant asylum to an otherwise removable alien who demonstrates that he or she meets the definition of refugee as defined by a a 
a ny person who is outside any country of such person nationality or,in the case of a person having no nationality,is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided,and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
petitioner mounts four specific challenges to the merits of the ij decision the ij finding that petitioner does not qualify as a refugee as defined by a a by virtue of past persecution is not supported by substantial evidence the ij finding that petitioner does not qualify as a refugee by virtue of a fear of future persecution on account of membership in a particular social group is not supported by substantial evidence the ij denial of asylum is incorrect because petitioner qualifies for a discretionary grant of asylum based on humanitarian grounds and the ij denial of asylum is incorrect because petitioner status as a stateless palestinian renders him eligible for asylum.
turning first to petitioner claim of past persecution,t o establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past persecution,an applicant must show an incident,or incidents,that rise to the level of persecution that is on account of one of the grounds and is committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.abdulrahman ashcroft,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
substantial evidence supports the ij determination that the incident that occurred between petitioner and the israeli soldier in along with the ensuing encounters between the israeli forces and petitioner family do not rise to the level of persecution as contemplated by the act.persecution is not a limitless concept.while it includes threats to life,confinement,torture,and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom,we have explained that it does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair,unjust,or even unlawful or unconstitutional.if persecution were defined that expansively,a significant percentage of the world population would qualify for asylum in this it seems most unlikely that congress intended such a result.fatin ins,cir.persecution must be extreme conduct to qualify for asylum protection.id.at.in this case,israeli soldiers entered petitioner home by force.petitioner responded by attacking an israeli soldier with a stick and fleeing the country.the israeli forces continued to harass petitioner family and demand his whereabouts until,when they expelled petitioner parents from their home and demolished the house.neither petitioner nor his parents were arrested,detained,abused,or physically harmed as a result of this incident.in addition,the context in which these encounters occurred is extremely significant.at the time of this event in,war had broken out between israel and what was then palestine.the record reflects that the threat of injury or harm in gaza affected the entire population in that region and was a function of the israeli takeover,occupation,and claim to the lands of gaza and the west bank.according to petitioner affidavit,his parents house was among thousands destroyed in pursuant to an israeli policy designed to force families to leave and make room for jewish settlements.
petitioner burden in showing persecution is high,and we have held that generally harsh conditions shared by many other persons do not amount to persecution.fatin,at quoting matter of acosta,bia see ambartsoumian ashcroft,cir matter of sanchez and escobar,bia,aff sub nom ins,cir.while troubling,petitioner allegations do not arise to the level of persecution required by fatin.indeed,the ij noted that congress had specifically rejected a definition of refugee that would have encompassed displaced persons,individuals who flee widespread conditions of indiscriminative violence resulting from civil war or military strife in a country.sanchez and escobar,at.furthermore,as the ij properly noted,harm resulting from civil strife is not persecution on account of an enumerated statutory factor.see matter of,bia,rev on other grounds,cir sanchez and escobar,at.petitioner has furnished no evidence,short of speculation,that these past incidents were perpetrated on account of anything other than ongoing civil controversy.this record does not compel a finding that petitioner suffered past persecution.
this finding extinguishes claim that the ij erroneously failed to grant him a discretionary grant of asylum for humanitarian reasons.in matter of chen,bia,the board acknowledged that in limited circumstances past persecution alone may warrant a grant of asylum,even in the absence of a future threat of persecution.the board stated 
if an alien establishes that he has been persecuted in the past for one of the five reasons listed in the statute,he is eligible for a grant of asylum.the likelihood of present or future persecution then becomes relevant as to the exercise of discretion,and asylum may be denied as a matter of discretion if there is a little likelihood of present persecution 
however,there may be cases where the favorable exercise of discretion is warranted for humanitarian reasons even if there is little likelihood of future persecution 
it is frequently recognized that a person whose suffered under atrocious forms of persecution should not be expected to repatriate thus,while the likelihood of future persecution is a factor to consider in exercising discretion in cases where any asylum application is based on past persecution,asylum may in some situations be granted where there is little threat of future persecution.
id.at quoting the handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status under the convention and the protocol relating to the status of refugees geneva.
in this case,however,we affirm the ij finding that petitioner did not suffer past persecution.therefore,he is not eligible for a grant of asylum pursuant to this rationale.
in the absence of past persecution,an applicant for asylum can establish that he or she has a fear of persecution.gao ashcroft,cir.demonstration of a fear of persecution carries both a subjective and objective component.the applicant must show a subjective fear of persecution that is supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility.chang ins,cir.testimony alone may be sufficient to satisfy this burden,so long as it is found credible.gao,at.
taken in conjunction with the documentary evidence of conditions in israel and the occupied territories,testimony,while credible,does not establish that a reasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution on account of social group or nationality.
to qualify for asylum on account of membership in a particular social group requires that an applicant identify a group that constitutes a particular social group,establish that he or she is a member of that group,and show persecution or a fear of persecution based on that membership.lukwago ashcroft,cir.petitioner argues that the ij erred in failing to find that he has a fear of persecution based on membership in the social group of his family.it is not clear whether this argument was raised before the ij,but any error he may have committed in failing to entertain or address it is harmless in light of the failure of the record to substantiate it.while violence against a family member may support a claim of persecution and in some instances is sufficient to establish a fear of persecution,baballah ashcroft,cir,petitioner has not sufficiently established that his family members suffered persecution because of their familial relationship.the record reflects that one of petitioner cousins was arrested and tortured in the intifada in,and that another cousin who served as a judge in gaza was killed because he refused to unlawfully apply laws to the palestinians before him.according to petitioner,his parents house was among the thousands destroyed in pursuant to an israeli policy aimed at emptying gaza to make room for jewish settlements.
substantial evidence supports the ij finding that petitioner fear of retaliation from israeli forces as a result of his attack on an israeli soldier in is not objectively reasonable.putting aside that such fear is not on account of an acceptable statutory factor,see,at a liens fearing retribution over purely personal matters or those fleeing general conditions of violence and upheaval in their native countries would not qualify for asylum.such persons may have fears of harm but such harm would not be on account of any statutory factor,this fear is objectively unreasonable given that approximately years have passed since the incident,and approximately thirty years have passed since the israelis last inquired of petitioner whereabouts.petitioner has put forth no evidence that the israeli authorities possess a present interest in him.
contention that he possesses a fear of persecution based on his nationality as a palestinian is also unpersuasive.this claim is exclusively premi
