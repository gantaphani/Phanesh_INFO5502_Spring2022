monica castro for herself and as next friend of,a minor child collectively castro,brought suit against the united states of america the government under the federal tort claims act ftca,et.castro alleged,inter alia,that the government negligence caused the wrongful deportation of,a citizen.the government filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b or,alternatively,for summary judgment pursuant to rule.the district court held that the government is protected from suit due to a,the discretionary function exception of the ftca.subsequently,the district court entered a final judgment dismissing castro tort claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissing her constitutional claims as moot.castro timely appealed.
factual and procedural background 
the pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute.castro,a united states citizen,moved with her parents from corpus christi,texas to lubbock,texas when she was approximately fifteen years old.around that time,castro met omar gallardo,an illegal alien and mexican national.when castro was sixteen,she and gallardo moved together into a trailer near the trailer that castro parents rented.on december,castro gave birth to her and gallardo daughter,who was born at the university medical center in lubbock,is a citizen of the united states.castro was seventeen at the time of birth.
castro and gallardo had a history of arguing with each other,and castro contends that gallardo abused her during the course of their relationship,although she informed neither her parents nor law enforcement authorities of this abuse.castro maintained that gallardo was a good father to,and that he never abused their daughter.
on november,castro and gallardo got into an argument,and as a result,castro called and asked her grandparents to come and pick her up.they came the following day,and castro left the trailer remained with gallardo.immediately thereafter,castro commenced efforts to recover from gallardo.specifically,she contacted the lubbock county sheriff department,texas child protective services cps,and the lubbock police department.the agencies told her that since she was married to gallardo pursuant to a marriage and because gallardo was the child father,gallardo had as much right to as she did.further,castro was told that her issues with gallardo constituted a civil dispute,and that she would have to hire a private attorney to seek a custody order.cps did tell castro that she could fill out an application to start the process for obtaining assistance from cps,but that the process would take one to two days.castro did not fill out the application because she said she did not want to wait one to two days.
on december,castro,along with her aunt,sophia rodriguez,went to the lubbock border patrol station to report that gallardo was an illegal alien.they spoke with border patrol agent manuel sanchez,and they told sanchez that while gallardo currently had,castro wanted to recover from him agent sanchez informed castro that she needed to get a court order for temporary custody of however,agent sanchez said that if castro was present when border patrol apprehended gallardo and certain of his relatives,who were also illegal aliens,border patrol would leave with castro,since they both were citizens.however,castro did not wish to be present when border patrol went to the trailer because she was afraid of what gallardo and his family would do to her.accordingly,on the morning of december,castro was not present when border patrol agents arrived at the trailer castro shared with gallardo rather,castro watched the events unfold from her relatives trailer across the street.
border patrol took gallardo,three of his brothers,and his cousin to the lubbock border patrol station.since gallardo had with him,was also taken to the station.gallardo,and gallardo relatives were all placed in a holding cell at the station.
shortly thereafter,castro arrived at the station and requested that her daughter be returned to her.however,gallardo informed the border patrol agents that castro had walked out on him and and that he wanted to remain with him.at the direction of greg kurupas,who was the,agent sanchez contacted debbie of the texas department of family and protective services dfps in lubbock.since there was no evidence that was abused or neglected,agent sanchez was informed that dfps would not get involved meanwhile,border patrol processed gallardo and his relatives and prepared to repatriate them back to mexico.while in custody,gallardo admitted he was in the united states illegally and chose to reinstate an earlier deportation order.the transport to mexico from lubbock left at daily,and border patrol made plans to send gallardo and his relatives at that time.
around in the afternoon,castro and her relatives retained an attorney,lisa trevino,in order to obtain a temporary custody order.trevino drafted the necessary paperwork and proceeded to the courthouse to get a judge signature on the order.trevino told agent kurupas that she was working on obtaining a judge signature on a temporary custody order however,the agent told her that the repatriation transport had to leave by by the time the transport left,trevino had been unable to obtain a judge signature.trevino never filed any documents with the state court regarding the custody of,and she did not further pursue a custody order for castro.
the transport left lubbock around on december,with gallardo onboard,along with.in september,gallardo was detained in the amarillo area on charges of illegal reentry.while he was in custody,gallardo and castro came to an agreement whereby,who was living in mexico with gallardo parents,would be returned to the custody of castro.was returned to castro custody on december.
castro filed a lawsuit on february,in the united states district court for the southern district of texas on her own behalf and as next friend of her daughter.in her original complaint,castro sought monetary damages and injunctive relief pursuant to the fourth,fifth,and tenth amendments of the united states constitution,as well as claims of negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and false imprisonment against the united states pursuant to the ftca.the district court dismissed castro constitutional claims for monetary relief,holding that such claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.castro then filed her first amended complaint on may.in this complaint,castro asserted claims for injunctive relief under the fourth and fifth amendments of the united states constitution as well as claims of negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,false imprisonment,abuse of process,and assault pursuant to the ftca.castro also asserted a claim for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to,et.
on november,the government filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,and in the alternative,motion for summary judgment pursuant to rule.the government argued,inter alia,that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over castro tort claims because they are barred by the discretionary function exception to the ftca.on february,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the court also held that castro claims for relief under the fourth and fifth amendments and her claim for injunctive relief pursuant to,et.were moot and therefore dismissed them as well.on april,the district court dismissed castro only remaining claim which sought declaratory relief in the form of determination of the validity of any statute,regulation,policy or other procedure relied on to detain and deport plaintiff for lack of standing.that same day,the district court entered its final judgment dismissing the action in its entirety with prejudice.
castro timely filed her notice of appeal.the only issue castro raises on appeal is whether the district court erred in dismissing her ftca claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

discussion 
as the sovereign,the united states is immune from suit unless,and only to the extent that,it has consented to be sued.truman united states,cir citing fed.deposit ins.meyer,d.through the ftca,the united states has consented to suits for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment b see also truman,at through the enactment of the ftca,the government has generally waived its sovereign immunity from tort liability for the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its agents who act within the scope of their employment.
there are a number of statutory exceptions to the ftca,two of which are relevant to the resolution of this appeal.first,the intentional tort exception provides that the ftca does not apply to a ny claim arising out of assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights.h.however,that same provision also waives sovereign immunity for the intentional torts of law enforcement and investigative officers.id.explaining that the ftca shall apply to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the united states government for any claim arising out of assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,abuse of process,or malicious prosecution.
the other relevant exception is the discretionary function exception,which provides that the united states is not liable for 
any claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the government,exercising due care,in the execution of a statute or regulation,whether or not such statute or regulation be valid,or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.

under this prong,we determine whether a statute,regulation,or policy mandates a specific course of action.if such a mandate exists,the discretionary function exception does not apply and the claim may move forward.when no mandate exists,however,the governmental action is considered discretionary and the first prong is satisfied.

as already noted,in the proceedings below,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.while the district court stated that the aforementioned law enforcement provision of h applied to castro assault,abuse of process,and false imprisonment claims,the court ultimately concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because her ftca claims could not survive the discretionary function exception.the district judge first determined that the first prong of the gaubert test was satisfied because the border patrol agents actions were the product of judgment or choice.in reaching that determination,she highlighted that castro failed to obtain a custody order granting her custody of,and because of that,she placed the agents in a difficult situation namely,they had to either forcibly remove from gallardo custody even though there was no court order directing them to do so,or let gallardo continue with possession of,even though gallardo was being repatriated to mexico.after concluding that there were no statutes,regulations,or policies mandating that the agents take a certain course of action in this and rejecting castro argument that the agents had made an unauthorized custody determination as to,the district judge concluded that the agents were left to make a difficult decision,one that was a product of judgment or choice she also held that the border patrol agents actions satisfied the second prong of the gaubert test because their decision was unequivocally subject to policy analysis,as it involved the use of government resources and necessarily involved a decision as to what the border patrol should do with a united states citizen child in the unique circumstances presented by such a case.see,baum united states,cir a decision as to the best allocation or use of resources is inherently bound up in considerations of economic and political policy,and accordingly is precisely the type of governmental decision that congress intended to insulate from judicial.
on appeal,castro argues that the district court unduly narrowed the coverage of the ftca by improperly expanding the scope of the discretionary function exception.she contends that the district court wrongly interpreted and applied the holdings of gaubert and related precedent,because,while the border patrol agents actions were the product of choice or judgment,their actions not only exceeded the scope of their authority,but also violated the federal constitution.further,according to castro,the agents actions lacked any connection to the social or economic policy of the regulatory regime that establishes the authority of the border patrol.the government urges this court to affirm the district court determination,contending that the agents actions in this case are clearly covered by the discretionary function exception of the ftca.it argues that the district court properly applied gaubert,and that its judgment dismissing castro ftca claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be affirmed.
we first observe that we agree with the district court that the law enforcement proviso applies to some of castro ftca claims since border patrol agents are federal law enforcement officers for purposes of the ftca.see ysasi rivkind,explaining that border patrol agents are federal law enforcement officers for the purposes of the ftca.however,we disagree with the lower court conclusions regarding the discretionary function exception.even though an argument can be made that the district court properly analyzed the two gaubert factors,that court erred by not first considering whether the border patrol agents exceeded the scope of their authority.in sutton,we explained w e have not hesitated to conclude that such action does not fall within the discretionary function exception of a when governmental agents exceed the scope of their authority as designated by statute or the constitution.at.this principle of law has been recognized by a majority of other circuits as well.see,raz united states,cir we must also conclude that the fbi alleged surveillance activities fall outside the ftca exception because plaintiff alleged they were conducted in violation of his first and fourth amendment rights.medina united states,cir noting that the starting point of analysis is that federal officials do not possess discretion to violate constitutional rights or federal statutes quoting united states fid.guar.united states,cir nurse united states,cir holding the constitution limits the discretion of federal officials such that the discretionary function exception will not apply prisco talty,cir concluding that the discretionary function exception was inapplicable to an ftca claim based on conduct that violated plaintiff constitutional rights red lake band of chippewa indians united states,a corollary to these principles,and our basis for affirming the district court holding on this issue,is that a decision can not be shielded from liability if the decisionmaker is acting without actual authority an employee of the government acting beyond his authority is not exercising the sort of discretion the discretionary function exception was enacted to protect.birnbaum united states,cir a discretionary function can derive only from properly delegated authority.authority generally stems from a statute or regulation,or at least from a jurisdictional grant that brings the discretionary function within the competence of the agency.discretion may be as elastic as a,but it,too,has a breaking point.an act that is clearly outside the authority delegated can not be considered as an abuse of discretion.internal quotation marks and citations omitted but see kiiskila united states,cir holding that conduct by commanding officer of military base,although constitutionally repugnant,fell within the discretionary function exception.
admittedly,this court and others have been less than clear about where this scope of authority analysis fits within the gaubert factors arguably some courts have treated it as a prerequisite,see,nurse,at,while others have seemingly integrated it into the first gaubert factor.see,mcelroy united states.nevertheless,it is overwhelmingly clear that,as the first circuit has written,courts have read the supreme court discretionary function cases as denying protection to actions that are unauthorized because they are unconstitutional,proscribed by statute,or exceed the scope of an official authority.thames shipyard repair united states,cir internal citations omitted.because the constitution can limit the discretion of federal officials such that the ftca discretionary function exception will not apply,if the agents acted in violation of constitutional rights,and therefore outside their scope of authority,that conclusion would eclipse the district court analysis under the gaubert framework.
we now turn to consider whether castro sufficiently alleged that the border patrol agents violated the scope of their authority here.in her complaint,castro states that the agents violated fourth and fifth amendment rights when they detained her in immigration custody with gallardo and his relatives even though they knew she was a citizen,and that such actions not only went beyond the scope of their authority,but also violated the constitution while it is that violations of constitutional mandates are not actionable under the ftca,see meyer,at.the united states simply has not rendered itself liable under b for constitutional tort claims,the occurrence of such a violation would involve the performance of a function for jurisdictional purposes,if the constitutional tort is also cognizable as an intentional tort under state law.as a federal district court explained 
a court must determine whether there is a specific and intelligible constitutional mandate that involves or is related to the alleged intentional torts of the accused officer s.if such a mandate exists,the court will conclude,for jurisdictional purposes only,that the alleged torts occurred during the performance of a function.upon reaching such a conclusion,the court may determine the merits of the section h intentional tort claims under the applicable state tort law.
mcelroy.at.as the mcelroy court recognized,t he gaubert test merely instructs the reviewing court to determine whether the alleged conduct involve s mandatory compliance with a federal statute,regulation,or policy,not whether the statute,regulation,or policy was violated.id.at see also garcia united states,because we can not at this point preclude the possibility that the inspectors conduct was unconstitutional,we can not hold that the challenged conduct falls within the discretionary function exception.accordingly,the issue before us is whether the complaint and any facts could support a finding that the border patrol agents alleged conduct exceeded the scope of their statutory or constitutional authority,not determining whether such a violation actually occurred.
we hold that castro complaint does sufficiently allege that the border patrol agents actions exceeded the scope of their authority.the border patrol,officially called the bureau of customs and border protection,is an agency of the department of homeland security,and is specifically included as a defined agency subject to the immigration and nationality act of ina,et.see.fundamentally,the ina scope is limited to regulating the entry of aliens as well as their detention,and naturalization.see,a a.within this statutory grant of authority,border patrol agents have,inter alia,broad discretion in making determinations in matters such as the detention,parole,or deportation of foreign nationals illegally present in the united states.see,ins yang,d explaining the broad ins discretion in determining who,along a class of eligible aliens,may be granted relief from removal.however,the power of border patrol agents to detain citizens is quite limited.while border patrol agents possess a general arrest authority for crimes committed in their presence,a,generally speaking they do not have authority to arrest or detain citizens.see,united states,d writing that the fourth amendment forbids stopping or detaining persons for questioning about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they may be aliens.
the government makes two arguments for why the agents were within their statutory grant of authority.first,it cites b which states that immigration officials may attach to the granting of voluntary departure any conditions they deem necessary to ensure the alien timely departure from the united states the government contends that this is simply all the agents did here.second,it cites a which provides that the secretary of homeland security shall establish such regulations prescribe such forms of bond,reports,entries,and other papers issue such instructions and perform such other acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his authority under the provisions of this chapter.the government then relies on language from gaubert to make the argument that the agents actions were all decisions that are covered by the discretionary function exception.see at.where congress has delegated the authority to an independent agency or to the executive branch to implement the general provisions of a regulatory statute and to issue regulations to that end,there is no doubt that decisions establishing programs are protected by the discretionary function exception,as is the promulgation of regulations by which the agencies are to carry out the programs.
both of these arguments are unavailing.the government first argument fails because,as castro highlights,gallardo was removed in december pursuant to the reinstatement of a prior order of removal and not by voluntary departure therefore b is simply irrelevant.the government second argument is without merit because even though governmental actors have wide discretion to carry out their statutory and regulatory obligations,courts have never interpreted delegated authority so broadly as to infringe upon rights and freedoms.see,hernandez cremer,cir explaining that courts should construe narrowly all congressionally delegated powers that curtail or dilute constitutional protections.citing kent dulles,d.the government contention that could be interpreted so broadly as automatically to override fourth amendment right from unreasonable seizure or her fifth amendment right to due process is simply untenable.
we are cognizant of the challenging circumstances in which border patrol agents undoubtedly often find themselves because of the complexities of immigration enforcement,and we agree with the district court that,particularly in this instance,they were faced with a difficult situation.as such,we emphasize the narrowness of our holding.had the border patrol agents not known citizenship status or if they had doubted castro assertions that was a citizen,their decision to detain the child with her father would likely not be intertwined with the constitutional strands that are prominent in this appeal of a b dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.however,here the agents concede that they knew was a citizen.
castro alleges a plausible set of facts supporting subject matter jurisdiction because based on her complaint,the border patrol agents actions in detaining implicate constitutional concerns and,therefore,may have been.we hold that the district court legally erred in concluding that the discretionary function exception to the ftca deprived it of jurisdiction without first determining whether the agents conduct was outside their scope of authority we remand this case for the district court to consider in the first instance to what extent the alleged constitutional violations are cognizable under castro ftca claims.we highlight that our holding is limited to the jurisdictional question presented on appeal nothing we have written should be interpreted to speak to the merits of either castro allegations of constitutional violations or her ftca claims.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court as to castro ftca claims is reversed,and this case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
and the king said,bring me a sword.and they brought a sword before the king.and the king said,divide the living child in two,and give half to the one,and half to the other.kings.
we face a situation at least as old as the one faced by king solomon,and one requiring his wisdom what to do when two parents claim a child.i am no solomon,and neither is the majority.i do not know the right answer,if there is one,and neither do my able colleagues.it is not the job of the federal courts to make that choice or to the decision of those to whom the heavy responsibility is given.
for two reasons,i respectfully dissent.first,the majority fundamentally misunderstands sovereign immunity and the federal tort claims act ftca,falling for the alluring but empty belief that if something really unfortunate occurs,someone always must pay.prodded by that misunderstanding,the majority eviscerates much of the discretionary function exception,holding that whenever a border patrol officer violates the if he has no reason to know he is doing necessarily acts beyond his discretion.the majority approach subjects the united states to substantial liability that is neither authorized by statute nor compelled by precedent.second,even under the majority misguided theory,the united states should not be liable,because,under castro complaint,the border patrol agents did not violate constitutional rights or otherwise exceed their lawful authority.
i.the majority misunderstands sovereign immunity.
because of sovereign immunity,matters of the federal fisc are left to the political branches unless the government has explicitly waived its immunity.see truman united states,cir.under the ftca,the united states has consented to certain types of suits,b,but the waiver of immunity is far from complete,and there are a number of exceptions,including the discretionary function exception,a,which denies jurisdiction to the federal courts over a great deal of potentially unlawful conduct likewise,consistently with the purposes and history of sovereign immunity,the exceptions that do appear in the ftca must be strictly construed in favor of the government.truman,at citing atorie air,fed.aviation,cir.these basic principles of sovereign immunity are not contested.
the majority nonetheless cites dictum from sutton united states,cir,and opinions from other circuits,for the astoundingly broad proposition that the ftca discretionary function exception does not apply whenever a federal without good reason to someone constitutional rights.nothing in sutton,however,turned on whether a constitutional right was violated the defendants did not plead any such violation.see id.at.rather,the case concerned the interplay between the discretionary function exception and the intentional tort exception law enforcement proviso,with the entire matter remanded because the district court decided it on inadequate factual allegations which prevent ed us from evaluating the appellants cause of action in light of the differing statutory policies of the two exceptions.id.at.
thus,until now,sutton outlier and truncated musing that constitutional rights are somehow categorically outside of the discretionary function exception has not been the law of the fifth circuit.it is,first and foremost,irreconcilably inconsistent with supreme court precedent.for instance,it contravenes united states gaubert,d,which holds that the discretionary function bars federal jurisdiction to review a federal officer conduct unless a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribe d a course of action,provided that the decision was of the type that ought not be ed because it is grounded in social,economic,and political policy the omission of constitution from the court explicit list of sources that can create a mandate that nullifies the discretionary function exception should be dispositive here.
this obvious reading of gaubert finds additional support in fdic meyer,d,which says that the united states simply has not rendered itself liable under b,the ftca for constitutional tort claims.if all violations of the federal constitution render the discretionary function exception inapt,meyer is effectively voided.in sum,the majority strained attempt to eclipse the district court analysis under the gaubert framework utterly fails.
it is difficult to conceive of a violation of a constitutional right that does not also give rise to a state cause of action.for instance,many violations of the eighth amendment by prison officials likely also constitute negligence under state law.unconstitutional searches theoretically can be cognizable as trespass.violations of the third amendment can be characterized as a trespass or an invasion of privacy.until now,under meyer,we lacked jurisdiction to consider these constitutional tort claims.
under the majority framework,by a plaintiff artful pleading,the united states can be liable whenever the constitution is violated even though,under meyer,the sovereign is not subject to liability for constitutional torts.the majority rubric would go like this first,allege a constitutional violation,thereby avoiding the discretionary function exception.second,plead a state cause of action that overlaps with that constitutional violation,then seek damages under that state cause of action.voila no more sovereign immunity.
properly understood,however,federal sovereign immunity is more robust than that.in santos united states,wl cir,per curiam unpublished,we affirmed the dismissal of a prisoner state law negligence claim that overlapped with his contention that the eighth amendment had been violated.the
