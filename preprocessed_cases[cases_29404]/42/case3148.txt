nelson andrade garcia is a native and citizen of guatemala who entered the united states illegally in,and.he was apprehended and ordered removed on june,and was removed a day later.
two weeks later,on july,andrade garcia reentered the united states again and was apprehended near the border.he conceded that he entered the country illegally and admitted that he had previously been removed pursuant to a removal order.the government issued him a notice of intent to reinstate the prior removal order.andrade garcia expressed a fear of returning to guatemala,so the government referred his case to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear hearing.
at the hearing,andrade garcia testified that he had decided to return to the united states to avoid paying the members of a guatemalan gang the quetzals about that they demanded in phone calls to him.he stated he was afraid to return because the gang members had threatened to shoot him and cut off his arm.he believed this threat because they had killed his aunt three years before for not paying the money they demanded.andrade garcia testified that the police had investigated his aunt murder,but his cousin decided not to do anything because she was already dead and they thought that they would not find anything out.in response to the asylum officer questions,andrade garcia testified that he had not been physically harmed,nor had he suffered any psychological or emotional harm.he also testified that he would not be harmed because of his religion,political opinion,membership in any group or organization,or family relationships.further,he testified that his parents,wife,and children remained in guatemala and had not been physically harmed or threatened.although andrade garcia stated that he did not know of any connection between the gang members and the guatemalan government,he speculated that the gang members are able to influence the police because the guatemalan government is corrupt and he had seen cases where a robber is caught and then released the same day after bribing the police.
the asylum officer determined that andrade garcia failed to demonstrate either a reasonable fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground or a reasonable fear of torture.on appeal,the ij concurred with the asylum officer determination.the ij ruled that andrade garcia failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of past or future persecution on account of a protected ground and did not demonstrate a reasonable possibility of future torture under cat because he did not establish torture by the government or torture inflicted with the government acquiescence.
andrade garcia timely petitioned for review on the ground that the ij erred in concluding that he had failed to demonstrate that the guatemalan government had acquiesced in any torturous actions against him.
