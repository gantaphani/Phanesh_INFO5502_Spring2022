cipriano appeals his conditional plea of guilty on the grounds that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained as the result of an unconstitutional stop by a united states border patrol agent.we find the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress,and accordingly,we vacate and remand.
this case concerns the constitutionality of a border patrol stop near the rio grande city store,just yards from the border in starr county,texas.based on his experience working along the border border patrol agent victor soliz testified at the evidentiary hearing that the area around the rio grande city store in starr county is for drug smuggling due to its close proximity to the border.soliz also testified that the parking lot was as an area where illegal aliens were often smuggled into the united states from the rio grande river.
at approximately on the morning of november,soliz passed the parking lot and observed two vehicles exiting the parking lot onto highway.because soliz felt the passengers looked suspicious,he made a to get a better look at the two vehicles.soliz recalled that one vehicle was a white pickup,and the other vehicle,a ford explorer,followed behind the pickup.
as the explorer passed soliz patrol unit,soliz made several observations about the driver and the three passengers.soliz first noticed that the driver initially looked straight ahead,but when soliz patrol unit approached the explorer,soliz noticed that the driver looked at him and made eye contact.in contrast to the driver,soliz observed that the three backseat passengers avoided eye contact,were,and looked straight forward.according to soliz,the passengers did look at him enough and the driver looked at him too much.he further testified that the three backseat passengers were all wearing their shoulder seatbelts.
soliz followed the explorer for a couple more miles,noting that the backseat passengers never once conversed with each other and were sweating pretty bad.soliz also observed that the windows were rolled up and the passengers appeared very stiff.because the windows of the explorer were not tinted,and because soliz border patrol unit rides higher than normal street vehicles,soliz and his partner could see clearly into the backseat of the explorer.soliz noted that the floorboards of the explorer were devoid of any shopping bags.
based on the aforementioned reasons,soliz decided to stop the explorer and conduct an immigration check.the driver of the vehicle,acceded to the stop without incident.upon stopping the vehicle,soliz discovered that all three passengers in the backseat were illegally in the united states.
as a result of the stop conducted on november,was charged with one count for conspiracy to unlawfully transport undocumented aliens and two counts for unlawfully transporting undocumented aliens,in violation of a a ii,a a v i,a a v ii,and a b i.he subsequently filed a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence that the agents obtained as a consequence of his detention.he argued that the agents lacked reasonable suspicion to stop his vehicle and that the evidence that they recovered as a result of the stop therefore was inadmissible.the government filed a response,and the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress.
the district court denied motion on its merits.in so ruling,the court relied on the following factors to determine that soliz had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant vehicle the proximity of the stop to the border the fact that is frequently used as a staging area for alien smuggling and there had been numerous apprehensions of aliens in the area over previous months the fact that soliz observed two vehicles driving in tandem the fact that the passengers of the explorer failed to converse with one another and sat rigidly the absence of shopping bags in the explorer the fact that the passengers were sweaty the fact that the rear passengers wore seat belts and the fact that the backseat passengers made no eye contact with soliz,while the driver made repeated eye contact.the district court also denied the defendant motion for reconsideration.
entered a conditional plea of guilty to count two charging unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens of the original indictment,pursuant to the terms of a written plea agreement.he has now timely appealed the district court denial of his motion to suppress.
argues on appeal that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress.in reviewing a district court denial of a defendant motion to suppress,this court reviews factual findings,including credibility choices,for clear error,while we review legal conclusions de novo.united states santiago,cir see also united states rodriguez,cir the district court overall finding that reasonable suspicion existed for the stop is a conclusion of law that we review de novo.thus,the question before this court is whether the district court was correct in determining that soliz had reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle.
to temporarily detain a vehicle for investigatory purposes,a border patrol agent on roving patrol must be aware of specific articulable facts together with rational inferences from those facts,that warrant a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle is involved in illegal activities,such as transporting undocumented immigrants.united states,cir.in considering whether the agent had reasonable suspicion to stop vehicle,n o single factor is determinative the totality of the particular circumstances known to the agents are examined when evaluating the reasonableness of a roving border patrol stop.united states hernandez,cir.factors that may be considered include the characteristics of the area in which the vehicle is encountered the arresting agent previous experience with criminal activity the area proximity to the border the usual traffic patterns on the road information about recent illegal trafficking in aliens or narcotics in the area the appearance of the vehicle the driver behavior and,the passengers number,appearance and behavior.id.no single factor is dispositive,and each case must be examined based on the totality of the circumstances known to the agents at the time of the stop and their experience in evaluating such circumstances.rodriguez,at.
we begin our analysis here by noting our appreciation of the difficult task our border patrol agents face along our nation southern border.our decision herein and the reasoning to follow does nothing to detract from the court respect for the challenges our agents face in attempting to secure our nation borders.however,in evaluating the reasonable suspicion behind an agent detention of a specific individual vehicle,this court must ensure that the basic precepts of the fourth amendment have been met.in some instances,the most efficacious of stops will not pass constitutional muster.this is one of those instances.
upon review of the record,we conclude that the detention of vehicle lacked reasonable suspicion.while it is clear that the proximity of the stop to the border in this case a mere yards is afforded great weight in this court fourth amendment analysis,it is equally clear that this factor alone does not constitute reasonable suspicion to stop and search an individual vehicle.were we to rule otherwise,law enforcement agents would be free to stop any vehicle on virtually any road anywhere near the border.united states diaz,cir.this court has consistently found reasonable suspicion concerning stops conducted near the border where other factors,in addition to the proximity of the stop to the border,also supported a finding of reasonable suspicion in the present case,however,there are no such additional factors 
the various supplemental factors the district court did cite to support its conclusion fail to contribute sufficient reasonable suspicion to satisfy the constitutional analysis.for instance,the district court noted that all of the passengers in the vehicle wore seatbelts,sat rigidly,refrained from talking to one another,and had no shopping bags.this court,however,can not infer reasonable suspicion from these factors since there
