simone taylor sought a writ of mandamus to compel the social security administration ssa to pay benefits to which she claims entitlement.the district court denied her motion.we affirm,although we note that an unexplored avenue of possible relief for taylor remains available.
taylor was born in the united kingdom in and remains a british citizen.she was adopted by citizens of the united american serviceman and his the united kingdom in,and she moved to the united states with her adoptive family that year.according to photocopied documents included in the record,taylor entered the united states on august.her adoptive father filed a petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa,listing taylor as a beneficiary.the petition was approved in september,and taylor was thus classified as an immediate relative of a united states citizen.see b a i,a.
the visa petition records the date that taylor stay would expire as indefinite,and states that b eneficiary is in the united states and will apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident in the office of the immigration and naturalization service at kansas city,missouri.a notice of approval of relative immigrant visa petition,dated october,and completed by the immigration and naturalization service in kansas city,states that taylor adoptive father should contact the above office for further information concerning the beneficiary adjustment of status.the record includes no evidence concerning whether taylor or anyone acting on her behalf ever applied for adjustment of status.
on june,taylor filed an application for disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act the act.taylor application was initially denied,but after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj found that taylor was disabled.
in november,the ssa wrote to taylor explaining that her application for disability benefits had been approved,but that the ssa could not pay her benefits for any month in which she was not lawfully present in the united states.this letter presumably was designed to implement a provision of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,which limits the eligibility of aliens for benefits under the subchapter of the social security act that governs disability benefits.the statute provides that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,no monthly benefit under this subchapter shall be payable to any alien in the united states for any month during which such alien is not lawfully present in the united states as determined by the attorney general.y emphasis added.the november letter to taylor explained that based on the information available to the ssa,taylor did not meet the lawful presence requirement.
two months later,as a to the decision of the alj,the ssa sent a second letter to taylor seeking further information to establish the months in which she worked during her period of disability.that letter also reminded taylor that in order to receive benefit checks,she must furnish the ssa with documents to show that she was legally admitted to the united states.
taylor responded in january with a legal memorandum to the ssa,arguing that the restrictions on benefits for aliens did not apply to her.the record shows that in march,the ssa explained to taylor attorney that no determination had been made regarding taylor lawful presence in the united states,and that taylor must submit original immigration documents to demonstrate her lawful presence.
a subsequent review of taylor records by the ssa office of disability and international operations odio raised concern about whether she had engaged in substantial gainful activity since the onset of her disability which would render her ineligible for benefits,b,so on september,odio requested that the ssa appeals council review the decision.the ssa sent taylor another letter explaining that it was suspending benefits pending further investigation of her earnings for through and proof of her citizenship or lawful presence.the appeals council reopened the decision with respect to whether taylor had engaged in any substantial gainful activity from through,and remanded taylor case to a different alj for consideration of that question.
alj james stubbs sent taylor a letter explaining the issues to be considered at the second hearing.these issues did not include the question of taylor lawful presence in the united states.the alj invited taylor to submit a written response if she objected to the statement of issues.in response,taylor submitted a memorandum arguing that the restrictions on payments to aliens did not apply to her.
after a hearing to determine whether taylor had engaged in substantial gainful activity since the onset of her disability,the alj found that taylor was disabled as alleged,but engaged in substantial gainful activity for four months after the onset of her disability.the alj did not make any findings on her lawful presence in the united states.
taylor then petitioned the district court in march for a writ of mandamus compelling the commissioner of social security to pay benefits.the district court granted the commissioner motion to dismiss,finding that the ssa acted in accordance with its procedures,that the decision of the alj did not entitle taylor to benefits because immigration requirements were not decidedly within the purview of the alj,and that taylor failed to show that she was lawfully residing in the united states.
the district courts have original jurisdiction over any mandamus action to compel an officer or employee of the united states or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.t he writ of mandamus is intended to provide a remedy for a plaintiff only if he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant owes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.hatcher heckler,cir.stated differently,a party seeking issuance of a writ of mandamus must have no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires and must show that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and undisputable.in re.dep t of natural,cir alteration in original quoting allied chem.daiflon,d per curiam.
taylor argues that the ssa has a clear duty to pay her benefits under the social security act.taylor acknowledges that an alien who is not a qualified alien within the meaning of generally is ineligible to receive any federal public benefits.a.taylor observes,however,that this general rule shall not apply to any benefit if nonpayment of such benefit would contravene an international agreement described in section of the social security act.b.taylor claims that the agreement on social security between the government of the united states of america and the government of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland,the agreement,entitles her to benefit payments.
section of the social security act authorizes the president to enter into agreements establishing totalization arrangements between the united states social security system and the social security system of a foreign country.a.such an agreement is not a treaty ratified by the united states senate,pursuant to article ii,section of the constitution.rather,the act provides that such an agreement shall become effective on the date specified in the agreement,provided that the date occurs a sufficient period of time after the president transmits the agreement to the congress,and neither house of congress has adopted a resolution disapproving the agreement.e but see ins chadha,d.the declared purpose of these agreements is to establish entitlement to and the amount of benefits based on a combination of an individual periods of coverage under the united states social security system and the social security system of such foreign country.a.
in,the united states entered into the agreement on social security with the united kingdom.while taylor never worked in the united kingdom,and thus does not require a totalization of periods of coverage under separate social security systems,the authorizing statute also provides that a ny such agreement may contain other provisions which are not inconsistent with the other provisions of this subchapter and which the president deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.c.taylor contends that one such other provision,article of the agreement,supports her claim to benefits.article provides 
a person who is or has been subject to the laws of one party and who resides within the territory of the other party shall,together with his dependants,receive equal treatment with nationals of the other party in the application of the laws of the other party regarding the payment of benefits.
taylor argues that because she was born in the united kingdom and was subject to the laws of that country for the first ten years of her life,this provision demands equal treatment for is,she should be treated as a national of the united states for purposes of social security benefits.she contends that because a national of the united states with her disability would be entitled to benefits,she is entitled to equal benefits under article.
however the agreement is interpreted and applied to taylor situation,we conclude that it does not afford taylor a basis for mandamus relief.even were the agreement interpreted as taylor suggests,her claim for benefits faces another hurdle.an act of congress passed subsequent to a treaty nullifies or supersedes the treaty to the extent that the two conflict,see breard greene,d per curiam,and that same rule applies a fortiori to an international agreement that lacks the constitutional status of a treaty.in,as noted,federal law was amended to provide that no monthly disability benefit shall be payable to any alien in the united states for any month during which such alien is not lawfully present in the united states as determined by the attorney general.y emphasis added thus,taylor eligibility for benefits ultimately turns not merely on the agreement,but on whether she is or has been lawfully present in the united states during any period of disability.we turn now to that question.
the prohibition of y on payment of benefits to an alien not lawfully present in the united states dovetails with a provision of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of,b.this statute establishes that the general prohibition on payment of federal public benefits to an alien who is not a qualified alien does not apply to disability benefits for an alien who is lawfully present in the united states as determined by the attorney general.id.the federal regulations that implement the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of explain that 
for the purposes of section b of.only,an alien who is lawfully present in the united states means an alien who has been inspected and admitted to the united states and who has not violated the terms of the status under which he or she was admitted or to which he or she has changed after admission.
a emphasis added.
this definition of an alien lawfully present in the united states provides a potential avenue of relief for taylor.taylor was inspected and admitted to the united states in as an immediate relative of a citizen of the united states.see b.the district court thought that her adoptive father petition for immediate relative status was automatically revoked when taylor reached age,pursuant to a i f,but the record does not appear to support that conclusion.the automatic revocation occurs only if the alien reaches age before commencing her journey to the united states which taylor did not or if the alien reaches age before a decision on a pending application for adjustment of status becomes final and there is no evidence in the record that taylor ever applied for adjustment of status.see a.thus,it is possible that the petition for immediate relative status was not revoked when taylor reached age,but the visa petition was currently valid as of her converted to an approved petition for classification as an unmarried daughter of a citizen of the united states,pursuant to i.see a.in that case,taylor may have been legally present throughout her time in the united states.
while this possibility ultimately may provide taylor with a basis for relief,she has not raised this precise argument in the administrative process or in this litigation,and we conclude for two principal reasons that it is insufficient at this time to justify a writ of mandamus.first,taylor has not exhausted all other avenues that could secure the requested relief.the record shows that the ssa has never reached a final determination concerning taylor lawful presence in the united states.the ssa informed taylor that she must produce original immigration documents to establish her lawful presence.after taylor submitted photocopies of documents,an ssa representative explained the requirement of original documents to taylor attorney on march.but because taylor apparently never furnished original immigration documents,the ssa never reached a final determination on the crucial issue of lawful presence 
the program operations manual system,the ssa internal procedural guidelines,explain that in order to receive benefits 
a n individual who is not a united states citizen or a national and is present in the must have authorization from ins to lawfully remain in the ssa accepts evidence of alien status,in support of a claim for benefits,based on established legal principles governing the rules of evidence.only original,unexpired documents are acceptable.
poms gn a emphasis added.the poms provisions regarding developing lawful presence of an alien in the state that t he claimant must submit an original document or a copy certified by the issuing agency,and that a copy of a department of homeland security document rather than an original is not acceptable evidence of lawful presence.poms rs c.these directives reflect the ssa efforts to prevent document fraud,and to implement the requirement of y that only persons lawfully present in the united states are eligible for benefits.under ssa procedures,the agency can not process an application without original immigration documents,and when immigration documents appear to be genuine,the agency must verify the alien immigration status with the department of homeland security dhs.see poms rs c poms rm b.consistent with section y,which provides that the secretary of homeland security formerly the attorney general determines whether an alien is lawfully present,ssa procedures provide that the dhs ultimately adjudicates lawful presence upon a referral from the social security administration.see also poms rm.
we have said that the poms are entitled to respect as publicly available operating instructions for processing social security claims,reutter ex rel.reutter barnhart,cir internal quotation omitted,and we see no reason why the ssa is not entitled to require original documentation before making a determination on lawful presence in taylor case.if taylor expeditiously provides the necessary original documents to the ssa,then we expect that the ssa should promptly obtain a determination from the dhs on her immigration status,including whether her adoptive father initial visa petition from,together with the automatic conversion provision of i,is sufficient to establish that taylor has been lawfully present in the united states since her entry because taylor has not exhausted this possible avenue of relief,however,she has not satisfied one of the essential prerequisites for mandamus relief.
second,we conclude that mandamus relief is not warranted at this time,because we can not say it is clear and undisputable that taylor is lawfully present based on her adoptive father initial visa petition.the immigration regulations define an alien lawfully present in the united states as one who has been inspected and admitted to the united states and who has not violated the terms of the status under which he or she was admitted.a emphasis added.as noted,the initial visa petition provided that taylor would apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident,thus presumably making such application one of the terms of the status under which she was admitted.there is no evidence in the record that she ever made such an app
