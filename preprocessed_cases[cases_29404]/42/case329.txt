petitioner bernardo seeks review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision denying his motion to terminate removal proceedings,and upholding the immigration judge decision to pretermit his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c.discerning no legal or factual error in the bia decision,we deny the petition.
background 
is a native of spain who became a lawful permanent resident of the united states in.in,his successful medical career in this country was derailed when a jury convicted him of four counts of larceny of more than for misappropriating funds from boston children heart foundation bchf,a corporation organized to serve boston children hospital.he was subsequently sentenced to three to five years in prison for one count and one year each for the remaining three counts in separate proceedings,he was also found liable to bchf in federal civil proceedings for more than million,see boston children heart,cir,and he entered into a consent order before the commonwealth of massachusetts board of registration in medicine to have his medical license suspended indefinitely 
shortly after his conviction,traveled abroad at least twice to visit his ailing mother once in june,and again in january.despite his prior convictions,which rendered him inadmissible unless he obtained discretionary relief from the government under statutory provisions in force at the time,he reentered the united states without incident at the conclusion of each trip.
in,again traveled abroad and again attempted to reenter the country,presenting a foreign passport and his permanent resident alien card greencard to the examining officer for inspection.this time,however,the department of homeland security dhs denied him admission on the basis that he was an arriving alien who had been convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude punishable by five or more years imprisonment in aggregate.the dhs subsequently charged him,explicitly as a native and citizen of spain,with inadmissibility under the relevant provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina,sections a a i i,a a i i,and a b,a b 
during his removal hearings in front of an immigration judge ij,raised two arguments relevant to this petition.first,he argued that the dhs had failed to produce competent evidence of his alienage,and therefore the ij lacked jurisdiction over the removal proceedings.he admitted that he had presented a foreign passport and a greencard to the immigration official when he attempted his reentry,but he asserted that it was the government burden to establish his alienage,and that the government proof was inadequate to do so.the government resisted both of these propositions,maintaining that the burden fell to,as a convicted felon,to prove his citizenship,and relying on passport as adequate evidence of alienage.the ij agreed with the government,finding that passport and greencard constituted sufficient evidence of alienage to establish jurisdiction.
second,argued to the ij that he should be allowed to apply for discretionary relief from removal under the former ina c,which at the time of his readmission to the country would have permitted him to make such an application,but which was repealed before his travel and subsequent removal hearings asserted that he had relied on the continued availability of c relief when he decided to pursue a jury trial,and therefore he should be excused from the retroactive application of its repeal.finding no evidence in the record of any such reliance,the ij denied the request.the ij eventually found removable as charged and pretermitted his applications for cancellation of removal and a waiver of inadmissibility.
on appeal,the bia affirmed in a separate written opinion.in response to renewed argument that his alienage had not been established,the bia explicitly found that was a lawful permanent resident who,because of his convictions,was correctly categorized as an arriving alien.it further held that,because he was an arriving alien,bore the burden of proving his admissibility,and it rejected assertion that the government bore the burden of establishing his alienage.finally,the bia concluded that had failed to establish that he was entitled to be admitted to the united states because he presented no reliable evidence of citizenship and had not shown that his spanish passport confers anything less than full nationality and citizenship of spain.
the bia further held that had not established his eligibility to apply for c relief.citing ins cyr,d,and dias ins,cir,the bia reasoned that because his convictions were obtained after trial rather than by plea agreements,was subject to the retroactive application of c repeal.the bia additionally rejected argument that he should be allowed to apply for c relief nunc pro tunc to the date of his first admission into the united states,an admission which he characterized as contrary to law and having the effect of denying him the opportunity to apply for discretionary relief.the bia held that it lack ed jurisdiction to interfere with what it characterized as the dhs prosecutorial discretion to decide if and when to commence removal proceedings against aliens,but it also considered the merits of argument and found that had failed to demonstrate any basis for seeking nunc pro tunc relief under section c.this petition for review followed.

iii.discussion 
alienage and the bia jurisdiction 
first argument to us is that the government failed to establish his alienage during the administrative proceedings,and therefore the bia lacked jurisdiction.his attack is he argues that the bia erred as a matter of law in holding that the dhs did not bear the burden of establishing that he is an alien,and that the evidence in the record showing alienage is insufficient to establish his present alienage.we disagree.
the burden of establishing alienage 
as to the burden of establishing alienage,concedes that,if his alienage had been established,he would have borne the burden of proving his admissibility to the united states.he argues,however,that the bia erred by expecting him to shoulder that burden without first requiring reliable evidence of alienage from the government.
on the contrary,the bia properly treated as an arriving alien and made no error of law in exerting jurisdiction over him.all persons attempting to enter the united states must apply in person to an immigration officer at a.a.a person claiming citizenship must establish that fact to the examining officer satisfaction,and if such person fails to satisfy the examining immigration officer that he or she is a citizen,he or she shall thereafter be inspected as an alien.b.and,as the bia properly noted,an alien who is an applicant for admission has the burden of establishing that he is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section of the ina.c a see also b an arriving alien must prove that he or she is clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted to the united states and is not inadmissible as charged.
moreover,even though an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence is not normally regarded as seeking admission into the united states for purposes of the immigration laws,a c,an exception to that rule exists for an alien who,like,has committed multiple crimes involving moral turpitude other than purely political offenses for which the aggregate sentences to confinement were five years or more.under such circumstances,that alien must be regarded as seeking admission and deemed inadmissible.a c v an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the united states for purposes of the immigration laws unless the alien has committed an offense identified in section a of this title a a b listing categories of aliens who are inadmissible,including those who have been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude other than a purely political offense after the age of eighteen where the maximum possible penalty exceeded one year imprisonment,and those who have been convicted of two or more offenses other than purely political offenses,regardless of whether the offenses involved moral turpitude,for which the aggregate sentences to confinement were five years or more see also de vega gonzales,cir denying a lawful permanent resident petition for review where the petitioner had been charged as an arriving alien and found inadmissible based on a prior conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.
it is undisputed that when applied for admission to the united states,he presented a foreign passport and his greencard,and that he did not otherwise claim united states citizenship.that this application did not satisfy the examining officer of that is what the documents were intended to unsurprising nothing about a foreign passport and a greencard could alert an examining officer to a person citizenship,or even to a claim of citizenship.moreover,and as discussed in further detail below,the passport and greencard were introduced as evidence of alienage at the removal hearing and were never rebutted with reliable contradicting evidence.these documents,which both the bia and the ij relied upon as evidence of alienage,were undoubtedly enough to make out the adequate prima facie case of alienage referred to in our case law.see,ins,sint ins,cir campbell,concurring.accordingly,the bia made no error of law when it concluded that was a lawful permanent resident who,because of his prior convictions,was properly treated as an arriving alien bearing the burden of proving admissibility.
the evidence of alienage 
alternative argument attacks the documents the bia relied upon in reaching its alienage conclusion,specifically,his passport,greencard,and customs declaration.in particular,he argues that the photocopies of his passport and his customs declaration card were not translated into english,and that the photocopies of his passport and greencard are largely illegible.
these arguments are unpersuasive.the greencard,combined with prior convictions,provided compelling evidence supporting the dhs decision to inspect him as an alien for purposes of admissibility.this is especially so given that the record contains no other claim of citizenship.while it is true that the bia did not explicitly rely on the greencard as evidence of alienage in its decision,t he law is pellucid that each piece of evidence need not be discussed in a decision,pulisir,at quoting morales ins,cir,and the bia opinion is clear in recognizing his status as a lawful permanent resident,evidence of which was his greencard.
additionally,the passport,which acknowledges to be foreign and which was explicitly mentioned in the bia decision,provided further evidence of alienage.it is true that foreign language documents are normally required to be accompanied by an english translation,and that illegible documents are often useless.in this case,however,the fact that the relevant evidence was not translated or entirely legible did not preclude it from the ij or bia consideration under the circumstances.the evidentiary significance of each document was facially apparent to the adjudicators,and there was no question as to the authenticity of the documents the greencard bore name and photograph,and there was no direct evidence offered to show that his status had changed similarly,the passport bore name and photograph,and was clearly and admittedly not issued by the united states.see united states diaz,cir no plain error in a criminal case where untranslated foreign language documents,including a passport,were admitted under the federal rules of evidence because the evidentiary significance was facially apparent toure ashcroft,cir t he federal rules of evidence do not apply in ins proceedings,rather,the less rigid constraints of due process impose outer limits based on considerations of fairness and reliability.quoting yongo ins,cir.the bia therefore did not err in considering the government evidence of alienage 
as to the sufficiency of that evidence,although the government has not explicitly argued the point,we are doubtful of our jurisdiction to consider the evidence of alienage in this case,as prior convictions appear to bring him within the ambit of the provisions of a c.in any event,we note that at no point did offer the ij or bia any evidence capable of casting a reasonable doubt upon the examining officer decision to inspect him as an alien,or upon the government evidence.moreover,evidence adduced during his administrative hearings tended to support the examining officer actions and the government evidence of alienage.specifically,his marriage license lists his place of birth as arta,spain,and we have held that an individual born abroad is presumed to be an alien and bears the burden of rebutting that presumption by a fair preponderance of the evidence.leal santos mukasey,cir.the record offers no support for the conclusion that carried that burden we therefore have no basis to upset the bia factual finding that was an alien for purposes of his removal hearings.see b b administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.
eligibility for relief under c 
second argument is that he should have been permitted to apply for c relief nunc pro tunc to june,the date of his first admission to the united states.contends that this admission was contrary to law because his prior convictions should have rendered him excludable.he argues that,had he been denied admission at that time,he would have applied for c relief instead,because he was not denied admission until after c was repealed,he has been wrongly deprived of his opportunity to seek that relief.alternatively,argues that the abolition of c had an impermissible retroactive effect under cyr,and that we should therefore allow him to apply for that relief.neither of these arguments is persuasive.
section c relief nunc pro tunc 
principal authority for his nunc pro tunc argument is matter of l,wl bia.in matter of l,a petitioner who had previously been convicted of larceny left the country and was erroneously admitted upon his return when the examining officer failed to ask about,and the petitioner failed to mention,the prior conviction,which should have rendered him excludable from the country.apparently realizing its error,the government issued an arrest warrant against the petitioner and commenced deportation proceedings four months later.under the laws in place at the time,had the petitioner been excluded,he could have applied for discretionary relief because he had been admitted,he could not.during the deportation proceedings,the petitioner therefore requested the opportunity to apply for discretionary relief from exclusion nunc pro tunc to the time of his erroneous admission,arguing that the government mistake in not excluding him had deprived him of the opportunity to avail himself of the discretionary relief.the petitioner was eventually granted the opportunity to apply out of time,and he ultimately received the discretionary relief he desired.
despite the obvious factual similarities between the instant case and matter of l,the cases are distinguishable in two material and ultimately dispositive ways.first,the matter of l decision explicitly relied on the relatively inconsequential nature of the petitioner prior offense,describing it as in no way aggravated.id.at,wl.the
