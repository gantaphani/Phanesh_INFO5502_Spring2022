petitioner salvatore caroleo seeks our review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion for a discretionary waiver of removal pursuant to c of the immigration and nationality act ina.because we agree with the bia determination that an aggravated of which caroleo has been found removable on the basis of his state court conviction for attempted no statutory counterpart in a of the ina,we will deny caroleo petition.
petitioner salvatore caroleo,a native and citizen of italy,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident on an immigrant visa on april.in december,caroleo was indicted in new jersey superior court on a number of charges related to an attack he committed on a woman in middlesex county.by letter dated march,new jersey state assistant prosecutor robert brass offered caroleo a plea agreement.the terms of the proposal required caroleo to plead guilty to three counts attempted murder,burglary,and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.under the terms of the plea offer,caroleo maximum custodial sentence would be twelve years,with a period of parole ineligibility.
on november,caroleo appeared in court with his attorney,louis esposito,and formally accepted brass march,plea offer.on january,caroleo was sentenced,in accordance with the plea agreement,to a total of twelve years imprisonment.the sentence provided that caroleo would not be eligible for parole prior to serving four years.
on june,while still incarcerated,caroleo was served by the ins with a notice to appear,charging him with being removable under ina a a iii,a a iii,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,as that term is defined in ina a,a.in particular,the notice to appear contained two charges relating to two separate aggravated felonies.the first charge alleged that caroleo had been convicted of an aggravated felony consisting of a crime of violence attempted murder for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.ina a f,a f.the second charge alleged that caroleo was convicted of the aggravated felony of a theft offense or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.ina a g,a g.
a hearing was held before an immigration judge ij on april.at the hearing,caroleo,who was represented by counsel,conceded the removal charges,and sought to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation under ina c.counsel for caroleo acknowledged that the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,which took effect in,foreclosed c relief to individuals such as caroleo who had been convicted of aggravated felonies.he argued,however,that caroleo might still be entitled to relief under the second circuit decision in cyr ins,cir,which held that aedpa restriction on c relief to aggravated felons could not be applied retroactively to aliens who pled guilty prior to aedpa effective date of april.caroleo conceded that he had pled guilty after that date,but asserted that,because his crime had been committed in to the enactment of principles of cyr should be extended to render aedpa inapplicable to him.
on april,the ij issued an oral decision ordering that caroleo be removed.the ij rejected caroleo argument that the holding of cyr should be extended to aliens like caroleo whose crime had been committed prior had pled guilty effective date.the ij therefore held that cyr was inapplicable to caroleo because caroleo has conceded that he pled guilty on november,which was after the april,effective date of aedpa.
caroleo filed his appeal to the bia shortly after the supreme court affirmed cyr on june.on appeal,caroleo again argued that he was not subject to aedpa limitations on c relief because his offense was committed in,prior to the enactment of aedpa.on july,the bia dismissed the appeal.in its order,the bia stated that caroleo acknowledges that he pled guilty to attempted murder and burglary on or about november,a date after aedpa had taken effect,and that cyr only applies to aliens who pled guilty prior to aedpa effective date regardless of when their crimes were committed.
on april,caroleo filed a special motion with the bia seeking c relief.caroleo specifically relied upon regulations then recently adopted by the department of justice to implement cyr.those regulations provide that an alien need only have agreed with the prosecutor informally to plead guilty prior to aedpa effective date to avoid the limitations imposed by aedpa.in his motion,caroleo asserted,for the first time,that although his guilty plea was not formally entered in court until november,he had in fact informally accepted the prosecution march,plea offer prior to aedpa april,effective date,and that he was therefore eligible to be considered for c relief under standards.to support this assertion,caroleo submitted an affidavit from louis esposito,the attorney who had represented him in his criminal case.in the affidavit,esposito stated 
due to the quantity and quality of the evidence the state had against caroleo,he and i never seriously considered a trial.we therefore immediately opened plea negotiations with assistant prosecutor robert brass.
on march,brass made a plea offer.the offer was transmitted in a letter to me dated march,this offer was accepted by caroleo and me shortly after i received the letter.
due to my busy trial calendar and the mental health problems and several mental health hospitalizations experienced by caroleo,the offer was not formally acted upon until november,the day caroleo entered his guilty plea on the record in the superior court of new jersey 
the initial offer which we received in writing in brass letter dated march,was never rejected and accepted as presented almost immediately 
i have a clear recollection of the facts of the case,the plea negotiations with the state,the time that the state made the offer,the time that caroleo and i accepted that offer,and would,if required,be willing to testify in open court to this knowledge.i can state with certainty that we accepted the state plea offer dated march,before april.
caroleo acknowledged that,under amendments to the ina that were in place since,c relief was unavailable to any alien who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years for an aggravated felony.at the time his special motion seeking c relief was filed in april,caroleo was still incarcerated,and had,to that point,served more than eight years in prison.
caroleo presented two main arguments that he was nevertheless entitled to relief.first,as a matter of statutory interpretation,caroleo argued that the time at which to evaluate whether an alien has served a term of imprisonment of at least five years,thus rendering him ineligible for consideration under c,is when the alien first seeks to apply for such at the latest,upon entry of a final order of removal.in the present case,caroleo had sought to apply for a c waiver at the hearing before the ij on april,at which time he had served fewer than five years.moreover,caroleo had still not served five years at the time when the bia issued its july,order affirming the ij decision.
second,caroleo argued that,even if he was found to be statutorily barred from relief under c,the bia should nevertheless consider his application on equitable grounds.caroleo asserted that it would be unjust to deny him c relief on the basis of his now having served more than five years incarceration,when he had,in fact,sought such relief prior to having served five years,but had been wrongly denied the opportunity to do so.caroleo therefore asked the bia to employ the equitable remedy of nunc pro tunc to consider his c application as though he had properly filed it before serving five years.
in an order dated july,the bia denied caroleo motion.first,the bia ruled that caroleo was ineligible for a c waiver because the aggravated felony convictions on the basis of which caroleo was found,crime of violence and theft or burglary offense,do not have a statutory counterpart in section a of the act.as a second ground for denying his motion,the order stated it appears that the respondent has served more than years of incarceration for his aggravated felony convictions.if this is true,it would also render him ineligible for a section c waiver.caroleo then filed this timely petition.
we have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review from a final order of the bia pursuant to ina a,a as amended by section of the real id act of,div.b,stat.we review such constitutional claims and questions of law de novo.kamara att y,cir.
in order for caroleo to establish his eligibility for c relief,he must demonstrate i that he agreed to plead guilty prior to aedpa effective date,and is therefore not subject to aedpa absolute bar on c relief to aggravated felons ii that he is entitled to invoke c despite having now served more than five years in prison and iii that the basis for his removal has a statutory counterpart ground for exclusion in ina a.caroleo must prevail on all three grounds to succeed in his,to establish his eligibility for relief under ina c.
were we to reach the first two issues,we would hold that caroleo should be permitted,on equitable grounds,to apply for c relief despite having now served more than five years in prison,and that caroleo application should be remanded for a determination of when caroleo agreed to plead guilty.these issues are mooted,however,by our conclusion that caroleo is ineligible for c relief as a result of his failure to satisfy the statutory counterpart requirement under c because at least one of the grounds upon which the government seeks his aggravated felony of crime of violence attempted murder does not have a statutory counterpart in ina a.thus,even if we held for caroleo on the first two issues listed above,his petition must nevertheless be denied.
the principle that c is available in removal proceedings only where the ground for removal has a statutory counterpart ground for exclusion has been firmly in place and consistently applied since at least this requirement has also recently been codified in the ins regulations 
f limitations on discretion to grant an application under section c of the act.an application for relief under former section c of the act shall be denied if 
the alien is deportable under former section of the act or removable under section of the act on a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section of the act.

caroleo argues he should not be removed because he satisfies the statutory counterpart requirement in that his criminal attempted murder,burglary,and unlawful possession of a weapon for an unlawful crime s involving moral turpitude,one of the grounds for exclusion under ina a.see a a i.our analysis,however,leads to a different conclusion.
section of the ina,entitled deportable aliens,lists the grounds upon which the attorney general may order an alien removed.it is in this context that courts look to an alien underlying criminal conviction to determine whether it falls within one of statutory grounds for removal.for example,an alien will only be subject to removal under ina a a iii if it is determined that the crime for which he was convicted is indeed an aggravated felony as that term is defined in the ina.likewise,before an alien can be removed for a crime involving moral turpitude,ina a a i,the government must establish that the alien underlying conviction does indeed constitute a crime involving moral turpitude.it is in this,determining whether an alien underlying conviction qualifies as moral turpitude thereby establishing some cases have held that crimes like those for which caroleo was convicted are crimes involving moral turpitude 
the statutory counterpart requirement under c,on the other hand,presents an entirely different question.in an application for c a discretionary waiver of removal,the alien removability has already been,it has already been determined that the underlying crime for which he has been convicted falls within one of ina grounds for removal.the relevant statutory counterpart inquiry then to the underlying criminal rather to the statutory ground for removal contained in ina and whether it has a counterpart in the statutory ground for exclusion provisions of ina a.under this categorical analysis,we compare the removal and exclusion provisions of the ina to determine whether they are substantially equivalent see ins,cir campos ins,cir.if they are,a statutory counterpart has been established.
this distinction between the preliminary question of removability under ina and the statutory counterpart requirement for relief from removal under ina c leads us to conclude that caroleo has not satisfied the statutory counterpart requirement.because while it is true that the underlying crime of attempted murder can be characterized as a crime involving moral turpitude for the purposes of determining removability,see,yousefi united states ins,cir,the statutory counterpart prerequisite for c relief from removal focuses,quite differently,upon the statutory ground for an aggravated felony crime of violence.komarenko ins,cir.and,there is no authority challenging the bia direct holding in matter of brieva,bia that the aggravated felony crime of violence ground for removal is not a statutory counterpart of ina a crime involving moral turpitude.
in komarenko,the court rejected an analysis very similar to the one proposed by caroleo.komarenko was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in violation of california law and sentenced to four years imprisonment.the ins commenced removal proceedings against him for being an alien convicted of the aggravated felony of a firearms charge,a c.komarenko conceded removability but sought a waiver under c,arguing that his conviction for assault with a deadly weapon had a statutory counterpart in ina a crime involving moral turpitude ground for exclusion.
the court specifically rejected komarenko claim that the court must look to the particular facts of his crime,which,he claimed,could be deemed a crime of moral turpitude.the court held that it is the statutory ground for removal that must have a substantially identical counterpart in the statutory grounds for exclusion in order to qualify for section c the factual basis of the underlying criminal activity is irrelevant.the court explained that this conclusion follows directly from the equal protection concerns that are the basis for the whole idea of a statutory counterpart 
generally,when courts have found an equal protection violation,the excludability and deportation provisions have been substantially identical.that way,the only distinction between the two classes of persons the statute created was that one class of individuals had traveled abroad and returned,and the other had not.it is this arbitrary distinction that violates equal protection.in the instant case,the provisions are entirely dissimilar,and the distinction between the two classes is not arbitrary or unreasonable for this reason,the linchpin of the equal protection analysis in this context is that the two provisions be substantially identical.
komarenko,at.
the court also addressed komarenko argument that,because his conviction for assault with a deadly weapon would also have qualified him for exclusion under ina a crime involving moral turpitude ground,it would violate equal protection to deny him c relief from removal proceedings predicated on the same underlying criminal activity.the court rejected this argument,holding that the underlying criminal activity was not relevant what was important was the statutory ground in the ina under which removal was sought.whether the underlying crime could also have been the basis for a different ground for which does have a statutory counterpart ground for entirely irrelevant.
komarenko claims we must focus on the facts of his individual case and conclude that because he could have been excluded under the moral turpitude provision,he has been denied equal protection.we decline to speculate whether the would have applied this broad excludability provision to an alien in komarenko position.were we to do so,we would extend discretionary review to e
