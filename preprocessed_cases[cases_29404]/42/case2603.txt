mamadou diallo,a native citizen of mauritania,requested that the immigration and naturalization service ins grant him asylum.the agency refused,reasoning that diallo had not been persecuted in mauritania,did not have a fear of future persecution there,and had firmly resettled in senegal prior to his arrival in the united states.because the agency ignored its own regulations regarding the proper factors to consider in a firm resettlement analysis,failed to make a credibility determination,and failed to support its decision on fear of future prosecution with reasonable or substantial evidence,we must remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
diallo was born in mauritania in and lived there for the first years of his life.according to diallo testimony,in he joined the african liberation force of mauritania flam an organization seeking to fight against slavery,torture,and discrimination in mauritania.diallo brother,saidou,was also a member of flam,and because of his leadership role in the organization,in approximately or,he was arrested and imprisoned for six months.through newspaper accounts,diallo learned that saidou had been tortured and eventually killed while in prison.diallo himself was not a leader in the organization he did not pass out political leaflets or brochures and did not speak at political rallies,but he did support the organization monetarily from the proceeds of his work as a merchant and did not hide his support for flam.
in approximately may,uniformed police officers arrived at diallo house at night searching for a member of flam.they handcuffed him,searched his apartment,confiscated all of his documents,and took him to jail without the opportunity to appear before a judge or to be represented by a lawyer.for the six months that he remained in jail,he was forced to perform hard labor,cutting and hauling wood and digging holes.during one incident when he was working too slowly,a guard slashed his arm with a knife.
after six months,diallo captors released him and immediately placed him on a boat to senegal with nothing but his mauritanian national identification card.diallo spent four years in senegal selling small things and living with a former acquaintance from mauritania in a rented apartment.he attended church,but had no familial ties in senegal.although he had neither a work permit nor official permission to remain there,he was not bothered by the senegalese government.diallo left senegal and traveled as a stowaway on a boat to baltimore,maryland where he arrived in june.two months later,he submitted his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and for protection under the united nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat diallo appeared for his scheduled asylum interview,but because his privately hired interpreter never arrived and diallo could not participate in the interview,he was deemed to have failed to appear,he was charged with removal,and his asylum application was referred to an immigration judge pursuant to c.
the written decision by the immigration judge failed to make any credibility determinations,but rather assumed that even if diallo had testified credibly,he would not be entitled to relief from deportation.the immigration judge found that diallo detention and expulsion did not amount to persecution,that he did not meet his burden of demonstrating a fear of future persecution,and that he was ineligible for asylum in any case because he had firmly resettled in senegal prior to arriving in the united states.consequently,the immigration judge also found that diallo had not met the higher burden of proof required for withholding of removal and for protection under cat 
diallo appealed the immigration judge decision to the board of immigration appeals bia,which summarily affirmed the decision of the immigration judge,making it the decision of the agency for purposes of our appellate review.e szczesny ashcroft,cir.that decision held that the final blow to diallo asylum claim was that he had firmly resettled in senegal prior to his arrival in the united states.firm resettlement,however,is an odd tool to use to strike the final blow to an asylum claim,since under the current statutory iteration of the doctrine of firm resettlement,an immigration court must deny asylum to any refugee if the alien was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the united states.b a vi that being said,it seems the logical place to begin rather than end an assessment of whether a refugee is entitled to asylum in this country.if the doctrine of firm resettlement sounds the death knell on the claim,there is simply no need to continue on to determine whether an was the victim of past persecution or has a fear of future persecution.
the question of how to determine whether a refugee has firmly resettled in another country prior to her arrival in the united states appears to be an issue of first impression for this circuit.the only published seventh circuit opinion discussing firm resettlement was decided in,long before the enactment of the current statute and agency rules on the subject.see united states rumsa,cir.although the statute mandating the denial of asylum for refugees who have firmly resettled b a vi does not itself define firm resettlement or offer instruction on how firm resettlement should be determined,the agency regulations set forth in straightforward language how an immigration judge should proceed in making that determination.the regulations provide that 
a n alien is considered to be firmly resettled if,prior to arrival in the united states,he or she entered into another country with,or while in that country received,an offer of permanent resident status,or some other form of permanent resettlement unless he or she establishes 
a that his or her entry into that country was a necessary consequence of his or her flight from persecution,that he or she remained in that country only as long as was necessary to arrange onward travel,and that he or she did not establish significant ties in that country or 
b that the conditions of his or her residence in that country were so substantially and consciously restricted by the authority of the country of refuge that he or she was not in fact resettled.in making his or her determination,the asylum officer or immigration judge shall consider the conditions under which other residents of the country live the type of housing,whether permanent or temporary,made available to the refugee the types and extent of employment available to the refugee and the extent to which the refugee received permission to hold property and to enjoy other rights and privileges,such as travel documentation that includes a right of entry or reentry,education,public relief,or naturalization,ordinarily available to others resident in the country.
after the government meets its initial burden of demonstrating firm resettlement,the may rebut the presumption by presenting evidence to the contrary.mussie ins,cir cheo ins,cir salazar ashcroft,cir.for the refugee who has failed to rebut the presumption of firm resettlement,all hope is not lost.she may also demonstrate that she falls within one of the two exceptions to firm resettlement articulated in section a and b of the regulation.a,b.
the primary and initial consideration,therefore,is a simple or not the intermediary country has made some sort of offer of permanent resettlement.the regulations do allow the immigration judge to consider factors such as the length of time spent in the country,housing,and the type and extent of the refugee employment,among others,but only after making a preliminary finding of a genuine offer vel non of permanent resettlement,and only then when the applicant seeks to demonstrate that she falls into one of the two exceptions.see rife ashcroft,cir abdille,at.
as we noted earlier,see footnote,supra,this was not always the case.prior to,firm resettlement was just one of the factors to be considered in the agency exercise of discretion in granting asylum.see rosenberg yee chien woo,d abdille,at.under a discretionary scheme,where firm resettlement is but one factor to consider in granting or denying an asylum application,an adjudicator could consider factors such as the length of stay,ability to work,familial ties,economic conditions in the third country,and the like as other factors that militate for or against a grant of asylum.in,however,the ins amended its regulations to make firm resettlement a mandatory bar to asylum.later,congress codified the mandatory prohibition on grants of asylum to firmly resettled refugees when it passed the illegal immigration reform and illegal immigrant act of.b a vi.these new regulations reoriented the central inquiry of firm resettlement to focus the adjudicator on the actual existence vel non of an offer of permanent resettlement.robert sloane,an offer of firm resettlement,geo.int l.such a focus is consistent with the goals of asylum law.as the third circuit points out,a bsent some government dispensation,an immigrant who surreptitiously enters a nation without its authorization can not obtain official resident status no matter his length of stay,his intent,or the extent of the familial and economic conditions he develops.citizenship or permanent residency can not be gained by adverse possession.abdille,at.
despite the metamorphosis in the focus of firm resettlement inquiries,some circuits continue to hang on to the totality of the circumstances test,looking at the applicant length of stay and social and economic ties in the third country either instead of or on par with governmental offers of permanent resettlement.see,mussie,at,cheo,at.the third and eighth circuits obedience to the language and purpose of the regulation seems the more rational path,and for this reason we agree that the primary and most important inquiry in any analysis of firm resettlement is whether or not the stopover country has made some type of offer of permanent resettlement.abdille,at rife,at.
we recognize,as did the third circuit,that circumstances may arise in which the ins may not be able to secure direct evidence of a formal government offer of some type of permanent resettlement,and thus may be sic not be able to make the prima facie showing of firm resettlement under in that manner.abdille,at.in that case,the third circuit noted in dicta,the immigration judge or bia may find it necessary to rely on factors,such as the length of an alien stay in a third country,the alien intent to remain in the country,and the extent of the social and economic ties developed by the alien,as circumstantial evidence of a offer.id.at.the third circuit sees these elements as surrogates for direct evidence of a formal offer only if they rise to a sufficient level of clarity and force,which we need not delineate here.id.
the immigration judge in diallo case,however,did not consider whether there was an offer at all.the immigration judge determination that diallo had permanently resettled in senegal was based entirely on his finding that prior to his arrival in the united states,diallo resided in neighboring senegal for four years.indeed,the respondent worked as a merchant and lived with a friend and a family member.in short,the immigration judge relied on three factors in determining that diallo had firmly resettled his stay,his work as a merchant,and the fact that he shared an apartment with a friend and family member.nothing suggests that the immigration judge was using these factors as indirect evidence of a formal offer.rather,it seems clear that the immigration judge simply ignored the agency own regulations requiring the immigration judge to consider the existence vel non of an offer of permanent resettlement,and completely ignored diallo testimony that he had no such formal offer or permission to live or work in senegal.at.
the government argues that residency documents are not required in order for the government to establish firm resettlement,and cites cheo for the proposition that the passage of time alone is enough to establish some other type of permanent resettlement.id.at.but cheo is not the case to turn to in order to alleviate our concern that the immigration judge failed to consider any evidence or lack thereof of an offer vel non of permanent resettlement.in fact,in cheo,the ninth circuit considered the length of the stay only after concluding that there was no direct evidence one way or another as to whether the applicants had the right to return to the third country.id.at.in this way,its analysis was not much different from the third circuit in abdille when it announced that based elements may be used as surrogates for direct evidence only when there is no evidence of some formal offer of permanent resettlement.abdille,at.neither the ninth circuit approach in cheo nor the third circuit approach in abdille allows an immigration judge to ignore completely the regulation requirement to consider the existence of a formal offer or the lack thereof.the applicants in the cheo case did not present any evidence of a lack of a formal offer.in this case,diallo has presented evidence to the contrary.he presented undisputed testimony that he had no legal right to live or work in senegal the immigration judge erred by failing to consider this evidence at all.
a finding of firm resettlement is a factual determination that must be upheld if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d krouchevski ashcroft,cir.we reverse only if the evidence is such that a reasonable would be compelled to reach an opposite conclusion.krouchevski,at.this substantial evidence review is highly deferential and does not allow this court to overturn an agency determination simply because we would have decided the case differently.capric,at.nevertheless,the immigration judge below failed to consider the single factor that agency regulations require him to consider.had he done so he would be,as we are,compelled to find that diallo had not firmly resettled in senegal.
even if the immigration judge were applying the now outdated totality of the circumstances analysis,his finding of firm resettlement still would not be supported by substantial evidence and the reasonable would be compelled to make a finding to the contrary.most significantly,the immigration judge erred by ignoring diallo testimony that he had no documents permitting him to live or work in senegal.an immigration judge may not simply ignore record evidence that favors the applicant case.see vujisic ins,cir immigration judge and bia erred by ignoring evidence of feared persecution and current conditions in applicant native country.diallo testimony,if credible and the immigration judge never found that it was not was sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a.see footnote,supra.furthermore,in assessing diallo social and familial ties,the immigration judge found it significant that diallo lived with a friend and family member while in senegal.in the first instance,the immigration judge factual determination was simply incorrect.while in senegal,diallo lived with a man he had met in mauritania.the record firmly establishes that the men were not related.at moreover,we fail to see how living with a mauritanian acquaintance in senegal offers any evidence whatsoever of firm resettlement.
consequently,we are left with a stay and work as a seller of small things the type of itinerant work that many refugees pick up in hopes of making ends meet until they reach their final destination.four years does indeed constitute a lengthy stay,but not so lengthy that it,in and of itself,could support a finding of firm resettlement.the cases from our sister those employing a totality of the circumstances never held that a stay of this length in and of itself compels a finding of firm resettlement.the closest case comes from the ninth circuit decision in cheo ins,discussed earlier,which held that a peaceful,undisturbed stay of three years in a third country was enough to establish that the ground of firm resettlement in the third country might apply thus shifting the burden to the applicants to prove that they were not firmly resettled.id.at.the applicants in that case did not present any evidence to the contrary.significantly,the ninth circuit considered the length of the stay only after concluding that there was no direct evidence one way or another as to whether the applicants had the right to return to the third country.id.in this case,diallo has presented evidence to the contrary.he presented undisputed testimony that he had no legal right to live or work in senegal.
the other circuit court cases cited by the government in its brief the immigration judge cited no cases other than the decision of the bia in matter of soleimani,wl bia are no more helpful in supporting the immigration judge conclusion that diallo had firmly resettled in senegal,as all contained compelling evidence of firm resettlement other than the mere passage of time.see mussie,at petitioner lived in germany for four years german government gave petitioner asylum,travel documents,government assistance for transportation,food,rent and education petitioner held a job,paid taxes and rented her own apartment vang ins,cir appellate court offered no details as to the factors the bia applied in determining that petitioner was resettled,but in addition to living in france from the age of four to sixteen,applicant arrived in france as part of an official united nations refugee program and also received french travel documents yang ins,cir for purposes of the appeal,petitioners conceded that they were firmly resettled in france and argued only that the regulation on firm resettlement was beyond the authority of the ins consequently the yang court had no opportunity to comment on the factors that constituted the yang firm resettlement in france.farbakhsh ins,cir petitioner lived in spain for four years,intended to stay there as evidenced by his application for asylum,and had strong familial ties there abdalla ins,cir petitioner lived in and possessed a residence for the united arab emirates see also rife,at,finding firm resettlement where israeli government offered petitioners permanent resettlement,issued certificates evidencing citizenship,and issued passports,none of which had ever been revoked salazar ashcroft,cir finding firm resettlement where petitioner lived in venezuela for fourteen months,worked and rented an apartment,and received a venezuelan passport with a resident stamp.in short,we can not find a single published circuit court opinion that relied on as little as this immigration judge relied on to determine that an applicant for asylum had firmly resettled in a third country.we are compelled,therefore,to reverse the agency determination on firm resettlement.
because we find that diallo was not firmly resettled in senegal,we can now turn to his claim that he is entitled to a grant of asylum.to qualify for refugee status in this country,a petitioner has the burden of demonstrating that she either has endured past persecution or has a fear of future persecution based on one of the statutorily protected categories.see b olowo ashcroft,cir.an applicant who successfully establishes past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future presumption that the agency can rebut by demonstrating a change in circumstances or a reasonable ability on the applicant part to relocate within the applicant country.b capric,at.in the alternative,the applicant can establish a fear of future persecution if the fear is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable in light of the credible evidence.capric,at.
although the statute does not define persecution,this circuit has described it as punishment or the infliction of harm for political,religious,or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.desouza ins,cir.it must be more than mere harassment,and can include,detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,torture,behavior that threatens the same,and behavior such as torture and economic deprivation if the resulting conditions are sufficiently severe.capric,at internal citations omitted.
were we reviewing diallo claim de novo,we might be inclined to find that,after facing six months unlawful imprisonment combined with hard labor,physical torture recall that diallo arm was slashed when he failed to work as hard as was required,and expulsion from the country,diallo was the victim of past persecution in mauritania.after all,the immigration judge compared diallo case to three cases where this court had declined to find past persecution,but none of the factual scenarios in those cases came even close to the lengthy detention and physical hardship found in diallo case.in borca ins,cir,the petitioner was subject to an illegal search,was interrogated twice,and received threatening phone calls,but she never was imprisoned,forced to undergo hard labor,or physically tortured.this court upheld the immigration judge finding that borca was harassed and intimidated,but not persecuted.id.at.similarly,barbara skalak was jailed twice for interrogation,but each incarceration lasted for only three that this court concluded were mild persecution falling short of the statutory criteria for persecution that triggers a grant of asylum.skalak ins,cir.and in the third case,cuevas ins,cir,the petitioners were unable to make any connection between the threats made against them and the death of their nephew and the stabbing of their son and the armed wing of the communist party of the philippines npa.although they were involved in a bitter land dispute with squatters whom they believed to be acting on behalf of the npa,there was no evidence that the squatters were acting on behalf of a governmental power,or even if they were,that the squatting amounted to persecution.id.at.
other cases from this circuit support the view that diallo treatment did amount to past persecution.in asani ins,cir,we found a single detention in harsh conditions where the police beat the petitioner and knocked out his teeth sufficient to establish past persecution.and in vaduva ins,cir we were convinced that the police had persecuted vaduva when,during a single beating,they punched him in the face and broke his finger.historically,short detentions or detentions without physical abuse seem to have been less apt to reach the persecution threshold required by this court.see dandan ashcroft,cir detention with beatings and food deprivation does not compel a finding of past persecution zalega ins,cir applicant was interrogated on several occasions,arrested,detained once for hours,and had home searched and property confiscated,but was never beaten,tortured,or forced to perform hard labor 
our review,however,is not de novo.credibility determinations,findings of past persecution,and findings of a fear of future persecution are all factual determinations owed our strong deference.medhin ashcroft,cir.because we review the bia factual determinations under this highly deferential standard,we may not reverse a finding of no past persecution simply because we believe it was wrongly decided.rather,we must be convinced that the evidence compels a decision contrary to the board,at.dandan,at.it is a high standard to meet,and ordinarily we would be compelled to defer to the immigration judge finding here.but the limits of our deferential standard of review are tested when we are asked to defer to findings of fact that the immigration judge has not made.in this case the immigration judge failed to make any credibility findings at all.instead,the decision states,even assuming that the respondent claims are true,and then continues on to conclude that diallo has not established that he suffered any past persecution.at.in this case,however,the immigration judge decision is so infected with doubts about diallo credibility that it is difficult to determine whether the immigration judge really did assume the truth of his claims.
there are many examples of the immigration judge contradictory assessments regarding diallo credibility.for example,in the text the immigration judge noted that diallo testified that his brother was arrested,tortured,and killed for being a leader of flam,but then he stated in a footnote,i t befuddles the court
