opinion of the court 
before us is a petition for review filed by fatmata kaita,a native and citizen of sierra leone,of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection on the basis of the adverse credibility finding made by the immigration judge ij.kaita claims that she was persecuted and tortured by the rebels who came to power in sierra leone in the.we must decide whether the ij finding is supported by substantial evidence,as well as whether that finding was affected by the ij frequent interruptions during the removal hearing and the apparent translation problems during kaita testimony.
factual background 
kaita,who is years old,was born and raised in bo town,sierra leone and lived there until.she attended a muslim school in sierra leone for ten years approximately equivalent to a ninth grade education.she was married and has four children.
kaita husband disappeared in,at a time when there were many attacks in bo town by rebel forces belonging to the revolutionary united front ruf kaita stated that her husband had gone to the mosque to pray very early in the morning on the day he disappeared,and that the rebels broke into her home at five that morning when she was alone with the children.the rebels asked where her husband was,arrested,tortured and beat her and the children,and then set fire to their house.at.
kaita stated that the rebels had killed her husband because he and she supported ahmad tejan kabbah,the president of sierra leone.the rebels stated that they knew that kaita and her husband supported the sierra leone people party slpp,the official governing party of sierra leone opposed by the rebels.kaita testified that she had been a member of the slpp for about one year prior to the rebel attack and that it was not a secret that she and her husband supported that party.
kaita further testified that as a result of the attack she moved to freetown into the home of her husband brother.on january,while she was in freetown,rebel forces captured her when she went out to get food for her children.the rebels detained her for nineteen days at a military barracks,where she was forced to cook and wash clothing for the rebels.she was also beaten,raped and tortured repeatedly throughout her detention by many different men.there were about twenty other women who were captured,and the rebels killed at least one of them.the rebels also threatened to kill kaita 
ultimately,troops from other african countries rescued kaita and took her to the hospital where she spent seven days receiving treatment for the injuries she sustained from the gang rapes and beatings.although she could not remember the exact dates when she was in the hospital,kaita did testify that by january,she was at the hospital and out of pain.when kaita was released from the hospital,she discovered that her husband brother and her four children were missing.she learned that her children had been taken in by various neighbors.she testified that she remained in freetown at the home of her husband family for five years because she felt it had become safe due to the government assurances that it had driven out the rebels.she left sierra leone in with her children and went to guinea to live with her husband friend.
kaita testimony that she obtained a passport in freetown,sierra leone,in december is corroborated by her production of a passport dated december.at another point during her testimony,kaita reiterated that she left sierra leone the month,the.at.kaita stayed in guinea not quite three months before coming to the united states because the government of guinea beat and arrested refugees from sierra leone.her children remain in conakry,the capital of guinea.
there is some lack of clarity in the transcript regarding the dates when kaita left sierra leone for guinea and when she left guinea for the united states.at one point,the transcript reads that kaita left sierra leone the two month,at,and she left guinea the month the.at.at that point,however,kaita counsel stated,i could understand what the interpreter just said can you just repeat that at.the ij then answered,h e just said s he left guinea the month the,at,to which kaita counsel responded,oh,i keep hearing something at.the ij then sought clarification from kaita,asking,a nd you left sierra leone december of.is that right at.kaita replied in the affirmative and also stated that she then left guinea in.later,the ij asked kaita,earlier you said that you had left sierra leone on march,to go to guinea.how is it then that you got this passport issued to you in sierra leone december,at.we have canvassed the record and find no instance in which kaita testified that she left sierra leone on march,the ij question,therefore,appears to have misstated kaita testimony 
kaita testified that she arrived in the united states on march,via air france airlines.although she had a sierra leonian passport in her own name,for unexplained reasons she borrowed a passport from her husband friend to leave guinea.
ij conduct and translation issues 
in her brief,kaita argues that the ij made it impossible for her to testify about her life in sierra leone and then based her negative credibility finding in part on lack of detail.our examination of the transcript supports this contention.the ij interjected during kaita testimony no less than times.some of the interjections can be fairly characterized as exasperated expressions to kaita sometimes interrupting her testimony and to the translator,some were admonishments to counsel to hurry up,and others were attempts to direct the questioning of kaita.although some interjections were reasonable attempts to clarify certain facts,other interjections appear to have been disruptive.what follows are some examples of those interjections.
during a preliminary proceeding held on july,when asked how old she was,kaita responded through the translator,i years old.at.the ij asked,you sure and kaita responded,i but some over there.at.the ij asked,what to which kaita replied,i but a little bit,some time over.at.the ij then exclaimed,sometimes you over,that interesting.okay.let move on here.it just amazing.it amazing for a wednesday morning what one hears.at.counsel and the ij then agreed that kaita was in fact years old,but would turn in a few months,thereby supporting her assertion that she was some time over.kaita never said that she was sometimes over.
during the principal evidentiary hearing,when kaita explained that she could no longer remember the exact date in on which her husband disappeared because it had been a traumatic event,the ij interrupted,asking,excuse me,you expect me to believe that your husband goes missing and you do remember the day he goes missing at.then when counsel asked kaita what happened to her that day as distinct from her husband,the ij said,what day,i do know what day.all i know is the year.at.later,when kaita was explaining what happened to her during the bo town incident,the ij interrupted to say,ma,what happened,just tell me what happened.did anything happen at.in another instance,after kaita counsel asked her about the governing structure in sierra leone,the ij said,counsel,what kind of question is that at.
when counsel was asking kaita about her experience in the military camp in which she was gang raped,the ij interjected,can you just stop her please.do let her continue going on.at.when kaita attempted to explain how another woman at the military camp had been killed by the rebels in the incident,and stated,they used to torture us and beat us and the way they raped that lady,she bleeded,there was a lot of blood coming from her until she,she died,at,the ij immediately interjected,in perhaps the most disturbing example of the ij conduct at the hearing,okay,so she bled to death.let move on.at.
in addition,the transcript reveals that the ij hurried kaita and her counsel through the proceedings.she stated soon after the hearing began,counsel,please,i have a case at.i need to hear this today.at.when kaita was explaining her hospital treatment following the gang rape,the ij stated,okay,let move on.at.later in the same discussion,the ij told kaita counsel,proceed counsel,please,i like to wrap this up now.at.during the part of the testimony in which kaita talked about the dates when she left sierra leone for guinea and guinea for the united states,the ij asked,counsel,anything further at.and then a very short time later,okay,anything else,counsel at.at one point,kaita counsel asked permission to engage in a line of questions regarding kaita passport,and the ij said,counsel,it is and we done nothing here,come on,let finish this up.at.counsel asked permission to ask j ust a couple more questions.at.to which the ij responded,no,not a couple more questions.wrap it up that it.at.
the ij also interrupted,directed kaita testimony,and on occasion apparently created confusion.for example,when kaita was trying to explain the january incident,the ij told her she did not want to hear about whether the children were hungry she just wanted to hear what happened when kaita counsel asked why the rebels attacked her,the ij cut off counsel question and said she wanted to know where kaita was when she was beaten.there are numerous examples when the ij directed the questioning of kaita,usurping counsel role.
after counsel advised the ij at a preliminary hearing that kaita best language was mandingo,the ij procured a mandingo translator who remained for each of the subsequent proceedings.it appears that there was significant difficulty with the translation,as both the ij and the translator had numerous problems understanding each other,and there are sections of the transcript that are effectively unintelligible.during kaita testimony,the ij interjected,for the record,the respondent was correcting the interpreter translation in english,so she obviously understands english sic.at.
there were instances where the ij either explicitly stated that she could not understand the interpreter or the testimony came out indiscernible.see,at.most of those instances occurred during key testimony,including,for example,kaita discussion of her dates of entry,see at,which was one of the principal bases for the ij finding that kaita was incredible.
at one point,the ij said,counsel,excuse me,i would like the respondent right now to get up and trade seats with the interpreter instead of her leaning over your notes and reading her statement i satisfied that she speaks english and understands it,change seats with the interpreter well excuse me,i,i,at this point in time having said she does speak english but having her correct the english translation of the interpreter,now at least twice,i am really not willing to give that statement the benefit of the indiscernible.at.the fact that kaita corrected the translator does not mean that she understands english well,much less to communicate fully during a legal proceeding it could mean that she understood some english,and in some instances as well as or better than the interpreter.a short time later,the ij said to the interpreter,what are you doing,just translate,okay i do want you making any kind of movements here your job is only to translate you do have to try and enact things out.you not in the theater.at.at another point,the ij told the translator,what are you translating,i do understand you what is it you talking about at.with respect to the injuries kaita sustained at the military barracks,the ij had to ask the translator three times to clarify what he was saying.
ij decision 
after the hearing,the ij issued her oral decision,in which she concluded that kaita entry date and location were unknown.according to the record,kaita filed an application for asylum on october,but the record fails to show when she entered the united states.thus,the ij decided that kaita had not shown that she had filed the application for asylum within one year of her date of entry.nonetheless,the ij reviewed kaita entire application,including the request for asylum.the ij concluded that kaita had not testified in a believable,consistent nor persuasive fashion and as such has not met her burden of proof.at.specifically,the ij found kaita testimony to be extremely vague and lacking in specificity.at.
the ij pointed to the huge time gaps in kaita to remember precise dates,at,and contradictions in kaita testimony.with respect to timing,the ij said that kaita could not remember precise dates for important events,such as her husband disappearance.the ij asserted that this was significant because the disappearance of her husband seemed to be a memorable event.the fact that kaita could not remember the date certainly raises questions regarding this respondent claim,according to the ij.at.the ij also thought that the fact that kaita could not remember the precise date of her hospitalization after being gang raped for nineteen days in present ed additional questions regarding the respondent credibility.at.
the ij also stated that kaita testimony was at odds with her written submissions.the only example the ij provided was that kaita said she was persecuted due to her ethnicity in her form,but her testimony did not mention ethnic persecution.
with respect to the ij asserted contradictions,the ij cited conflicting testimony about where and when kaita obtained her passport.kaita passport was issued on december.the ij stated that kaita had initially testified that she departed sierra leone for guinea on march,but that contradicted the fact that the passport was obtained in sierra leone in december.
finally,the ij concluded that this respondent has not been totally persuasive and consistent and it appears that much of this claim that been presented is not really believable.at.the ij stated that it was more likely that kaita left sierra leone because of the suffering and the financial hardship and the difficulties in the living conditions more than on any possible grounds of persecution.at.because the ij concluded that kaita had not met her burden of proof on the asylum claim,she necessarily decided that kaita had not met her burden of proof on the withholding of removal claim and the cat claim.the ij stated that kaita had not,in light of the entire record,presented a consistent,believable,and sufficiently detailed claim to support a grant of political asylum at.
bia decision 
the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision in a written decision that included several additions.it stated that kaita failed to meet the filing deadline for filing a petition for asylum because there had been multiple discrepancies with respect to the date of kaita arrival in the united states.the bia also stated that the ij adverse credibility finding was sufficiently supported by the record because of the lack of details in kaita testimony and her failure to remember precise dates.the bia did not find that the ij comments and interruptions or kaita lack of education sufficiently explained the discrepancies in the record.
kaita timely filed her petition for review.
when the bia decision substantially relies upon the decision of the ij,this court has jurisdiction to consider the ij decision,as well as the bia decision.xie ashcroft,cir.because the bia adopted the ij adverse credibility determination and added to that conclusion,we consider both the ij decision and that of the bia.
this court reviews adverse credibility determinations under the substantial evidence standard.id.at.under that standard,the bia adverse credibility determination must be upheld on review unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.gao ashcroft,cir quoting b b.because kaita petition was filed before may,the effective date of the real id act,the applicable law was that minor inconsistencies did not support an adverse credibility finding.id.it was clear then that discrepancies in a petitioner testimony must involve the heart of the asylum claim in order to support an adverse credibility finding.id.citation and internal quotations omitted we have held that a dverse credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record,are reversible.id.citation omitted.
we turn now to examine kaita claims.
as a threshold matter,an alien seeking asylum must prove by clear and convincing evidence that she filed her application for asylum within one year of her arrival in the united states.a b.a court may consider an untimely asylum application only if the alien can demonstrate changed circumstances that affect her eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances why she did not file the application within one year.id.a d.however,n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under a.id.a.
both the ij and the bia made the determination under a that kaita failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that she had filed her asylum application within one year of her date of entry.in light of that finding,we have no jurisdiction to review kaita claim for asylum.see a.
withholding of removal 
in order to qualify for withholding of removal a petitioner must establish a clear probability,that is,that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened if returned to her country due to her race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.zubeda ashcroft,cir citations and internal quotations omitted.if an applicant meets that standard,the attorney general must grant withholding of removal.b a.an applicant can meet the standard by proving past persecution,which creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.b.that presumption can be rebutted if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in the country of origin or if the applicant could safely move to another part of the country.id.
the ij rejected kaita withholding claim because the ij concluded that she had not testified in a believable,consistent nor persuasive fashion and as such has not met her burden of proof.app.at.as we noted above,the ij attributed her adverse credibility finding to kaita inconsistency and vagueness with respect to timing and to contradictions in her overall testimony.
first,the ij said that there were significant time gaps that raise many questions regarding the claim itself.at.that conclusion is not adequately supported by the evidence.after searching the record,we are unable to pinpoint any significant time gaps.the record evidence supports the following kaita and her family were attacked in bo town in.she moved to freetown at that time,was attacked in,and left for guinea in.that is a total of five years in freetown.from guinea,kaita came to the united states.there are no time gaps in the testimony,certainly no significant ones.notwithstanding the ij suggestion of confusion regarding the five years kaita spent in freetown,the testimony reveals that the five years kaita spent living with her husband family in freetown included the time before and after the attack.
the ij also stated that kaita was not able to provide dates when significant events allegedly occurred,at,citing as examples the disappearance of kaita husband and kaita hospitalization following being gang raped in a military barracks.although kaita could not remember the month and day that her husband disappeared,she clearly remembered that the year was.she said she could not remember the exact date because it was so traumatic.we conclude that the exact date of kaita husband disappearance does not go to the heart of her claims,see gao,at,which is her capture,detention,and mistreatment by the rebels.in addition,there is a great deal of confusion in the record in connection with the timing issue.the ij interrupted to question kaita the translator was having trouble translating correctly and either the translator or kaita apparently could not understand the ij question,as demonstrated by the question to the ij,what do you mean following the ij question regarding the exact date when the husband disappeared.at.
with respect to the date of hospitalization,the ij conclusion that kaita testimony present ed additional questions regarding the respondent credibility,at,is surprising.the ij stated,when kaita testified about the rape and being hospitalized,she indicated that she could not recall the dates of her hospitalization or when these events in question had precisely happened other than that they had happened some time in because allegedly she was in such pain that she was unable to recall the date.at.the ij then stated,s ubsequently when queried further,the respondent then testified that she believed it was january.at.
but the ij characterization of that testimony is not accurate.what actually occurred was that the ij interrupted kaita counsel to take over the questioning of kaita with respect to the incident.then the ij asked kaita,okay,ma,and then what,what,when was it that you were actually in the hospital at.kaita answered,i ca recall because i was in pain.at.the ij asked,well,can you recall after you were out of pain when that was at.at that point,kaita stated,when i was at the hospital actually it was the first month the.at.the ij then said,proceed counsel,please,i like to wrap this up now.at.
kaita never said that she could not recall any date at which she was in the hospital rather,she could not remember when it was that she was in the hospital,when she entered the hospital.but when asked if she remembered a date while in the hospital after the pain subsided,kaita readily provided a date of january.she never said she believed it was the,as the ij characterized kaita testimony rather she clearly stated that when she was out of pain,she was at the hospital on january.in this respect,the ij conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence because it relied upon a characterization of the record evidence.moreover,the exact date of kaita hospitalization following her experience of being brutally does not go to the heart of kaita claim.it is the fact of having been that does.once again,the ij explanation is not a sufficient basis for making an adverse credibility finding.
in further support of her conclusion that the timing issues supported an adverse credibility finding,the ij stated that the testimony provided by this respondent is at odds with her written submissions and also at odds with her own testimony before the court.at.later in her decision,the ij stated that kaita i nitially testified that she departed sierra leone on march,and traveled to conakry,guinea,but subsequently testified that she had obtained a passport on december.at.the ij stated that because kaita had also testified that she actually left sierra leone on march,it would have been impossible for her to have gotten a passport in sierra leone in december inasmuch as kaita never went back to sierra leone once she left.at.
a close reading of the testimony shows that kaita testified that she arrived in the united states in march,and that she had been in guinea for three months prior to leaving for the united states.that would have dated kaita departure from sierra leone to guinea in december.when asked by the ij if she left sierra leone for guinea in december,kaita said yes.that testimony is also consistent with the ij later questioning regarding the date when kaita obtained the passport,to which kaita answered she obtained it in sierra leone in december,and then left sierra leone very soon after that.thus,most of kaita testimony regarding the dates was consistent.the fact that at one point during the complicated recitation of dates kaita stated that she left sierra leone in march is a minor inconsistency that does not go to the heart of her claims,especially in light of the ij continued interruption of the flow of kaita testimony and the obvious problems with the translation referred to above.
there are two other instances where the testimony appears to be inconsistent,although they appear to have arisen due to problems with the translation.for example,after already answering that she departed guinea for the united states in march after being there for three months,kaita testified that she left sierra leone in the two month.at.then,when asked when she left guinea,she said the month the.but at that point both the ij and kaita counsel began questioning the interpreter,and then the ij said,he just said she left guinea the month the.at.the ij then asked the translator if that was correct,leaving
