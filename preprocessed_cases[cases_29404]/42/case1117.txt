roger gousse petitions for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia ordering gousse removed to haiti on the ground that his connecticut alford plea to the offense classified as sale of under.a amounted to a conviction for illicit trafficking in a controlled substance under a b.gousse argues that the record does not identify which he sold and that.a may have proscribed certain substances that were not controlled substances under federal law.the immigration judge ij terminated the removal proceedings on that ground,but the bia reversed,and ordered gousse removed,on the ground that the specific drug underlying gousse connecticut conviction was heroin which is of course a controlled substance under federal law.
we conclude that gousse conviction under.a necessarily constituted a conviction for illicit trafficking in a controlled substance under a b,which is a removable aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act ina.we therefore dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
factual background 
gousse immigrated from haiti as a lawful permanent resident in at age.on october,in the superior court of the state of connecticut in norwalk,gousse pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to one count of violating.a.the record is cursory in important respects because the plea agreement allowed gousse to enter an alford plea.see north carolina alford,d an individual accused of crime may voluntarily,knowingly,and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.
at the plea hearing on october,the prosecutor outlined the drug transaction 
the state will indicate the following.on april the of a member of the special services conducted an undercover narcotics operation in roodner court.the defendant was in there,he was observed with another individual transacting narcotics.the undercover went up to this other individual.told him that he needed a bag,which is a street term for heroin.this individual then went to another individual who is known as the cisco kid.cisco kid was later determined to be this defendant here who was identified by the police officers.so it went from mims to cisco kid to the undercover.
consistent with alford,the plea was accepted even though gousse denied the facts stated by the prosecutor.sentencing was set for november,but gousse failed to appear.gousse ultimately materialized in court and was additionally charged for the failure to appear on may,at which point a public defender was appointed.gousse was sentenced for both crimes on august,and received three to six years imprisonment for the section a conviction.the record of conviction lists the specific violation of section a as sale of.the conviction was entered on august.
statutory background 
the ina provides that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.an aggravated felony is defined to include illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in,including a drug trafficking crime.id.a b.the controlled substances act csa,defines controlled substance as a drug or other substance,or immediate precursor,included in schedule i,ii,iii,iv,or v of part b of this subchapter.id.the term aggravated felony applies to the offenses defined as such under federal law,even if the actual conviction is for a violation of state law.see a.
section a,the statute under which gousse was convicted,provides 
any person who manufactures,distributes,sells,prescribes,dispenses,compounds,transports with the intent to sell or dispense,possesses with the intent to sell or dispense,offers,gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana,or a narcotic substance,except as authorized in this chapter,for a first offense,shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned 
a emphases added.
immigration proceedings 
at his removal hearing before the ij,gousse conceded that he had been convicted of selling narcotics in violation of section a,but denied that heroin was the narcotic sold to the undercover officer.when the ij expressed doubt that the prosecutor statement at gousse plea proceeding was a sufficient basis for finding that the substance was heroin,the ins moved for an opportunity to present a police report that would allegedly impeach gousse sworn denial that the substance was heroin.the ij denied the motion,and terminated the proceedings on the ground that the ins failed to meet its burden of showing removability by clear and convincing evidence 
the ins appealed the ij decision to the bia,arguing that gousse state conviction necessarily constituted illicit trafficking in a controlled substance under the ina because the connecticut definition of narcotic substance is no broader than the federal definition of controlled substance in the csa and the evidence presented to the ij indicated that the narcotic substance in question was in fact heroin which is a controlled substance under the csa.on january,the bia reversed the ij,evidently accepting the argument that a conviction under section a necessarily establishes a conviction for illicit trafficking in a controlled substance,and is thus an aggravated felony.
on may,the bia granted a motion for reconsideration,vacated its decision,but again sustained the ins appeal,this time on the ground that the ins had established that the substance underlying gousse conviction was in fact heroin,and ordered gousse removed to haiti.
this petition for review followed.
discussion 
under the ina,this court lacks jurisdiction to review gousse removal order if he is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense that constitutes an aggravated felony.see a c,a a iii jobson ashcroft,cir.however,this court retains jurisdiction to review the underlying jurisdictional fact at,whether gousse has been convicted of an aggravated felony.ming lam sui ins,cir.therefore,if we determine that gousse conviction constitutes an aggravated felony,our jurisdiction immediately vanishes and the petition for review must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.see jobson,at.the conclusion that the conviction is an aggravated felony may rest on a ground other than the ground cited by the bia.see lukowski ins,cir t here is jurisdiction to review a removal order to determine whether the alien has in fact been convicted of a criminal offense or offenses specified in a c.yang ins,cir.
our review of the bia interpretation of the federal and state criminal statutes is de novo,jobson,at dalton ashcroft,cir,and we decide this appeal on the ground that gousse section a conviction for the sale of is necessarily a conviction for illegal trafficking in a controlled substance under a b.
ordinarily,the record of conviction in a drug case supplies ample evidence of the act committed,selling or possessing and of the substance involved.when,as here,an alford plea is entered and the defendant denies the facts recited by the prosecutor,it becomes more complicated to ascertain whether the conviction constitutes an aggravated felony.
the problem is obviated here by our application of the categorical approach,an analysis that asks whether the statutory definition of the offense of conviction is any broader than an offense defined as an aggravated felony under federal law.see jobson,at applying categorical approach to determining whether offense is removable crime of violence under dalton,at same ming lam sui,at,applying categorical approach to whether offense is a removable offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to victims exceeds under a m i michel ins,cir applying categorical approach to whether offense is crime involving moral turpitude under a a ii.unless the offense of conviction is broader,the petitioner has committed an aggravated felony irrespective of the particular circumstances of his crime.see,ming lam sui,at.
the question presented is whether gousse conviction for violating section a is necessarily a conviction for illicit trafficking in a controlled substance under a b,which is a deportable aggravated felony.the record of conviction is sufficiently clear to establish that gousse was convicted pursuant to section a for the sale of.emphasis added.where the record of conviction thus supplies an element of the offense,a court may find that element satisfied absent any reasonable challenge to the validity of the record.see kuhali reno,cir see also hamdan ins,cir the general rule is that,absent specific evidence to the contrary in the record of conviction,the statute must be read at the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under the statute.citing united states ex rel.guarino uhl,cir.the act of selling is unquestionably illicit trafficking when the item sold is a controlled substance.see a b defining illicit trafficking in a controlled substance to include a drug trafficking crime as defined in c c defining drug trafficking crime to include any felony punishable under the csa a proscribing,inter alia,the distribution of a controlled substance united states finley,cir selling drugs is a distribution offense.
as to the substance,the section a conviction was for the sale of,and although a hallucinogenic substance is distinct from a narcotic substance under connecticut law,see.a,gousse does not argue that the connecticut definition of hallucinogenic substance is any broader than the federal definition of that term the question thus becomes whether the connecticut definition of narcotic substance is broader than the federal definition of controlled substance.if not,gousse has been convicted of an aggravated felony,is removable irrespective of the actual substance underlying his conviction,and we must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
gousse argues that the connecticut drug law was broader than federal law in three ways a the wording in the connecticut definition of narcotic substance is more embracing than the federal definition of narcotic drug b connecticut law proscribed,while federal law did not,butorphanol,c as well as a drug called nalmefene.
a.the connecticut 
the connecticut definition of narcotic substance,which lists cocaine,opium,opiates or their derivatives,also embraces substances which are similar thereto in physiological effect and which show a like potential for abuse.a i opium and opiates id.b cocaine.the full definition is set out in the margin 
gousse argues that the federal definition of narcotic drug,is narrower because i the federal definition of cocaine d has no analog to the connecticut prohibition of cocaine derivatives similar in effect and alike in potential for abuse,and ii the federal definition of opiates,has a that embraces only substances that are addictive.the text of the federal definition is set out in the margin 
we do not consider that argument because it is beside the point.gousse is comparing i connecticut definition of narcotic substance,to ii the federal definition of narcotic drug.but the question here is whether gousse was convicted of a state offense that is classified as an aggravated felony under the ina.the aggravated felony at issue here is illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.a b emphasis added.the federal definition of narcotic drug encompasses fewer than all of the substances encompassed by the federal definition of controlled substances.
under federal law,t he term controlled substances means a drug or other substance,or immediate precursor,included in schedule i,ii,iii,iv,or v of part b of this title.gousse argument,premised on the supposedly broader prohibition of connecticut law,fails unless some substance proscribed by the connecticut definition of narcotic substance is missing from the federal schedules and therefore is not a controlled substance.gousse contends that butorphanol and nalmefene are two such substances.
butorphanol 
gousse was arrested for the drug offense on april.at that time,butorphanol was gousse argues a narcotic substance under the in the connecticut statute because it is derived from opiates.a i but it was explicitly excluded from the federal schedules by b.gousse thereby floats the possibility that,for all the record shows,he was arrested for selling a drug proscribed by connecticut law that was nevertheless not then on the federal schedules.
the attorney general points out that butorphanol was expressly added to connecticut schedule on june,well after gousse arrest,that the addition would have been unnecessary if that drug was already proscribed by the,and that the offense of conviction therefore could not have been a sale of butorphanol.this argument ignores gousse contention that butorphanol was proscribed by the,and that the june amendment simply added all forms of butorphanol to the connecticut schedules.we will assume arguendo that gousse is correct that butorphanol was illicit in connecticut even prior to june,and so was illicit when he was arrested and when he pled guilty as well as when his conviction was entered on august.the decisive issue thus becomes the status of butorphanol under controlling federal statutes.
the ina provides that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii emphases added.the definition of an aggravated felony includes i llicit trafficking in a controlled substance,including a drug trafficking crime.id.a b emphasis added.the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law id.a emphases added.notwithstanding any other provision of law including any effective date,the term aggravated felony applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after september.id.
gousse entered his plea on october.the prior week,on october,the drug enforcement agency issued a regulation placing butorphanol in all its forms on the federal schedules,effective october.see schedules of controlled substances placement of butorphanol into schedule iv,codified at f.gousse conviction was entered on august.
assuming that the substance gousse sold on april,was butorphanol,the record thus establishes in the wording of the controlling federal statutes that gousse was convicted on august,in violation of state law.a of trafficking in a controlled substance butorphanol having been listed on the federal schedules as of october,after his admission to the united states in.therefore,even if gousse was arrested for selling butorphanol,he was nevertheless convicted of an aggravated felony under the ina.
gousse contends that we must look only at the schedules of substances proscribed under federal law at the time of the offense conduct but the statutory wording does not support that view notwithstanding any other provision of law including any effective date,the term aggravated felony applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after september.a.in kuhali reno,cir,a habeas petitioner similarly argued that his conviction could not support removal,regardless of amendments to the ina,because federal immigration law in force in did not support removal.id.at.in rejecting this contention,we concluded that the specific language used in a makes explicit that the new definition of aggravated felony should apply retroactively.id.at see also ins cyr,d citing a as an example of congress willingness to indicate unambiguously its intention to apply specific provisions retroactively.all that is required for removal is that an earlier conviction be encompassed by the definition of aggravated felony at the time removal proceedings are initiated.see kuhali,at because the ins initiated removal proceedings against kuhali on january,well after september,his conviction is clearly encompassed by the new provisions.on february,the day the ins initiated removal proceedings against gousse,butorphanol was incontestably on the federal schedules therefore,assuming gousse was convicted for selling that substance,his conviction still qualifies as an aggravated felony.
the parties agree that nalmefene is not a controlled substance under federal law because it is expressly excluded from the federal schedules by
