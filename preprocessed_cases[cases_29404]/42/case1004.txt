jorge mejia challenges the sentence imposed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york keenan,following his plea of guilty to illegal reentry after deportation for an aggravated felony,in violation of a and b.mejia contends that the court erred in declining to reduce his sentence to account for the lesser sentence he presumably would have received in one of the thirteen districts that use a or early disposition program,which allows a defendant charged with illegal reentry to plead to a reduced sentence or to a lesser offense such as entering the united states without inspection.mejia argues that imposition of a sentence longer than would have been imposed if he had been found elsewhere creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity within the meaning of a.
we affirm the sentence.
background 
deportation and 
jorge mejia emigrated legally from mexico to the united states in,together with his mother and siblings.in january,when he was,mejia was indicted in new york on murder and related charges.in april,mejia was acquitted of murder,but was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the second and third degree,and reckless endangerment,and sentenced to between months to eight years in prison.after serving nearly four and a half years,mejia was deported to mexico in may.
following his deportation,mejia wife and their son moved back to mexico.mejia claims to have found a good job there and to have rebuilt his life.in august,mejia illegally entered the united through came to new york.mejia claims that he was looking for his daughter by another woman,whom he tried unsuccessfully to contact from mexico that he came to new york to make sure she was safe and that he had no intention of staying in the united states for more than two or three weeks.
in august,mejia was arrested in manhattan for attempting to steal a bicycle,and was charged with possession of burglar tools,criminal mischief,and attempted petit larceny.mejia claims that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,talking in the street to an acquaintance who without mejia knowledge was in the process of stealing the bicycle.mejia refused to plead to disorderly conduct,and was held in state custody pending trial.
while mejia in state custody,the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice learned of mejia reentry and determined that the reentry was illegal.on september,mejia was indicted in the southern district of new york on one count of illegal reentry,in violation of a and b.pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequedum,mejia was brought into federal custody on october.
on february,mejia pled guilty to the illegal reentry count.in his submissions and at the sentencing hearing on july,mejia conceded that his guidelines sentence was to months,but raised five arguments to support a sentence that his reunite with a lost unusual and sympathetic that the guidelines for illegal reentry impermissibly his criminal history because they relied on the criminal history to enhance both the offense level and the criminal history level that the availability of programs for persons charged with illegal reentry in other judicial districts created unwarranted sentencing disparities in violation of a that the guidelines sentence did not account for time mejia spent in state custody during the pendency of his state case and that after serving his sentence he would spend additional time in immigration custody pending deportation.the district court rejected all of the arguments except the fourth,and imposed a sentence of months imprisonment to take into account the time mejia spent in state custody 
the district court held that there is no unwarranted sentence disparity in mejia case that justifies a sentence 
the programs are,essentially,exercises in prosecutorial discretion.contrary to the defense position,i believe this is authorized under united states stanley,cir section a speaks of the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities.the key word is unwarranted.there is nothing in united states booker,d which alters the principle that prosecutorial discretion is permissible or is to be frowned upon or shunned.
emphasis added.
programs originated in the southern district of california,where the number of illegal cases was overwhelming the capacity to prosecute violators.see united states,cir citing alan bersin,reinventing immigration law enforcement in the southern district of california,fed.sent.the united states attorney in that district created a program that would recommend a sentence for defendants who violated in return for the defendants waiver of various rights,including indictment by a grand jury,trial by jury,presentation of a report,and appellate review of the sentence.the united states attorneys in other districts along the southwest border,facing similar pressures,soon adopted their own programs,offering offenders an array of options,such as plea agreements to reduced sentences by lowering the offense level or to a lesser offense,entering the united states without inspection,in violation of.
in,congress expressly approved such programs in section m b of the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act protect act,which instructed the united states sentencing commission to issue a policy statement authorizing a downward departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general,stat,codified in scattered sections of,and.as directed by congress,the sentencing commission adopted,early disposition programs policy statement,effective on october,which provides that,u pon motion of the government,the court may depart downward not more than levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general of the united states and the united states attorney for the district in which the court resides.
on september,attorney general ashcroft set forth the general criteria that must be satisfied in order to obtain the attorney general authorization for programs 
a the district confronts an exceptionally large number of a specific class of offenses within the district,and failure to handle such cases on an expedited or basis would significantly strain prosecutorial and judicial resources available in the district or the district confronts some other exceptional local circumstance with respect to a specific class of cases that justifies expedited disposition of such cases 
b declination of such cases in favor of state prosecution is either unavailable or clearly unwarranted 
c the specific class of cases consists of ones that are highly repetitive and present substantially similar fact scenarios and 
d the cases do not involve an offense that has been designated by the attorney general as a crime of violence.

based on the premise that a defendant who promptly agrees to participate in such a program has saved the government significant and scarce resources that can be used in prosecuting other defendants and has demonstrated an acceptance of responsibility above and beyond what is already taken into account by the adjustments contained in.
