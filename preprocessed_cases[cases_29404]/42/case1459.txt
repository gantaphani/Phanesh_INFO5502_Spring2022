in this petition for review from a final order of removal entered by the board of immigration appeals bia the petitioner,daniel tavarez argues that the decision of the immigration judge ij was not based on adequate findings of fact and that the bia did not properly evaluate the ij findings against himself and his two minor children.in considering the arguments,we find ourselves faced with a more fundamental and more generally applicable going to the statutory limitation on our review of matters committed to the attorney general discretion.
facts and procedural background 
petitioner is a old native and citizen of the dominican republic,and his two children,danny zefar tavarez,age,and daniela zefar tavarez,age,are also natives and citizens of the dominican republic.it is unclear from the record when and in what fashion tavarez entered the united states,but on september,he married eladia pineiro a citizen of the united states,in camden,new jersey,after dating her for about six or seven months.marriage of an alien to a united states citizen entitles an alien to obtain conditional permanent resident status,immigration and nationality act ina a,a,and tavarez obtained such status on january,pursuant to an application filed by pineiro 
under the ina,the conditions on such status can be removed if the alien spouse and the petitioning spouse if not deceased jointly submit to the attorney general a petition which requests the removal of such conditional basis ina c a,c a pursuant thereto,tavarez and pineiro filed a joint application on december,to have the conditions on tavarez permanent residence status removed,and an immigration officer from the and naturalization service ins scheduled the interview for november,shortly before the interview with the immigration officer,tavarez and pineiro quarreled over which of them was responsible for payment of pineiro share of the income taxes.tavarez left the room to use the men room.pineiro was called into the interview alone and told the immigration officer that although she did not want to harm tavarez,she did live with tavarez and she was a friend.at testimony of witness carmen sanchez.the immigration officer reassured her by stating that she was not harming him.pineiro then signed a sworn statement before the immigration officer,apparently prepared by the officer,stating that she and tavarez never lived together as a married couple and that they did not consummate the marriage.she also stated,i felt pity on him so i married him.i only married her sic so she sic could obtain her sic legal permanent residence.at.
when tavarez came into the interview room,the immigration officer informed him that he was no longer eligible for permanent resident adjustment status because his wife withdrew the petition.tavarez looked at his wife and said,what you trying to do you crazy.why you doing this and all pineiro did was put her head down and did answer anything.at testimony of witness carmen sanchez.in the car ride home,when pineiro realized that tavarez would be deported,she started crying and then hugged him and said,you know,sorry,i did mean to do that.that not what i wanted to do,i just wanted to be out of the problem so i did have to,you know,pay the taxes at testimony of witness carmen sanchez.the ins district director denied tavarez application to remove the condition on his permanent resident status thus his conditional status was deemed to have expired on january.
thereafter,the ins began proceedings to remove tavarez and his children by filing a notice to appear,charging that his status as a conditional permanent resident was terminated pursuant to,and that he obtained his immigrant status by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.the removal proceedings were assigned to an ij.
it was incontestable that pineiro had withdrawn her support,thereby eliminating any possibility of change of tavarez status on the basis of a joint application.tavarez then filed applications for a waiver of the obligation to file a joint application.under the ina,the attorney general may waive the obligation of a joint filing requirement for an alien and his spouse if the removal would result in extreme hardship,the marriage terminated but was entered into in good faith,or the marriage was entered into in good faith but that the citizen spouse either battered or subjected the alien spouse to extreme cruelty.ina c a c,c a c.tavarez based his application on all three statutory exceptions.
sometime thereafter,pineiro divorced tavarez.the ij summarily denied the waivers based on extreme hardship and battered spouse,stating that there was no or almost no evidence for either.the ij then considered the evidence from the hearing before him and devoted a significant amount of his decision to discussing the issue of whether the marriage was entered into in good faith.a waiver under ina c b,c b,permits removal of the conditions on an alien permanent resident status without requiring his spouse to petition jointly for such removal if the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse,but the qualifying marriage has been terminated other than through the death of the spouse.id.
the witnesses before the ij included carmen sanchez,who assisted tavarez and pineiro in the preparation of immigration documents,tax filings,and in translation at the immigration interview.at the december,hearing before the ij,sanchez testified that in tavarez bathroom absence while waiting for the immigration officer hearing,pineiro told her that unless tavarez paid her share of the taxes,she would drop his immigration case.at.sanchez admitted that she never went to the tavarez house,but stated that they were all from the same neighborhood and that she saw them all the time together.at.the ij characterized carmen sanchez as a rather compelling and honest witness in whose testimony he placed a great deal of credence.at.the other witness for tavarez was danny tavarez,tavarez son,who moved in with the couple in august after leaving the dominican republic,and who testified that pineiro prepared his meals,picked out his school clothes,and taught him how to do chores.at.the ij found this testimony to be worthy of some degree of belief.at.
in addition,tavarez testified as did his daughter.the final witness,miguel espinal,a friend who attended the wedding,testified he would see the couple together,took them to the bank and shopping,and cooked with them at their home.the ij also considered pineiro sworn statement in reaching his decision that the marriage was not undertaken in good faith.because the ij concluded that this is a case of a friendship,of a relationship of some sort but not a marriage,he denied the application for a waiver of the joint filing requirement.at.the ij ruled that tavarez is removable under section a d i of the ina,a d i,because his status as a conditional permanent resident was terminated.tavarez appealed to the bia,which affirmed the decision of the ij,concluding,although tavarez submitted evidence and testimony that his marriage was in good faith,in light of his former wife statement,we defer to the immigration judge sic finding in this case.at.tavarez then filed the pending petition for review.
