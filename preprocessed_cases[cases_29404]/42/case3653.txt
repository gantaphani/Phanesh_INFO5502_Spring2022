we must decide whether an tip by an unidentified informant provided reasonable suspicion to support border patrol agents investigatory stop of a vehicle.we hold that such a tip can have significant indicia of reliability,and in light of the totality of the circumstances,there was reasonable suspicion to justify the stop at issue.therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the investigatory stop at issue occurred on otay lakes road,which is an road five miles north of the united border in an area described as notorious for alien smuggling.as united states border patrol agent staunton drove around a sharp bend in the road,he saw a dodge ram pickup truck traveling west in his eastbound lane.the pickup was attempting to pass a westbound ups truck.staunton veered to avoid a collision with the pickup,which passed him and continued west.staunton testified the pickup was traveling faster than normal given the conditions of the road.
when a ups truck passed staunton,its driver gestured to get staunton attention regarding the pickup.staunton testified that his knowledge of the area connection with alien smuggling and the atypically fast speed at which the pickup was traveling,coupled with the ups driver gesture,caused him to suspect that the pickup might be loaded with contraband.he radioed to border patrol agents simon and martinez,who were situated farther west on the same road,to be on the lookout for the pickup that was driving erratically and that almost ran him off the road.within seconds,simon radioed to staunton that he had a visual of the truck.one minute later,the ups driver pulled over at simon location and reported that he had seen the pickup load up with several suspected illegal aliens.simon immediately radioed back to staunton,informing him of the ups driver report.simon did not obtain the ups driver name or license plate number.
staunton then put a call out over the radio to agents in the area,describing the make and model of the pickup and the ups driver report.within minutes of the broadcast,agent padron saw the pickup traveling west on otay lakes road at a high rate of speed,as described by the report.when the pickup stopped at the traffic light,an unmarked car of border patrol agents bic agents was able to pull alongside it,and reported that its occupants looked nervous and shaky.approximately five minutes after padron had first seen the pickup,he and the other agents initiated a stop.they found four illegal aliens in the pickup that was driving.
was charged in a indictment with transportation of illegal aliens and aiding and abetting the commission of that crime in violation of a a ii and v ii.moved to suppress the fact that illegal aliens were found in the pickup by arguing that the agents lacked reasonable suspicion to initiate the stop.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court stated that in the words of agent staunton the area was notorious for alien smuggling and in close proximity to the border.according to the district court,those facts,combined with the pickup near accident with staunton and the ups driver gesturing,put staunton on notice that could be a load driver.taking into account staunton initial suspicions,coupled with the ups driver highly reliable report to border patrol agents that he had seen the pickup driver taking on a load of individuals by the side of the road,the district court held there was more than reasonable suspicion to justify the stop,and denied the motion to suppress.
pursuant to a plea agreement,pled guilty to one count of the indictment,reserving the right to appeal the district court ruling that there was reasonable suspicion for agents to conduct the stop of his vehicle.judgment was entered and this timely appeal followed.
we review de novo whether there is reasonable suspicion to justify a stop,united states,cir,and the district court denial of a motion to suppress,united states bautista,cir.the district court underlying factual findings are reviewed for clear error.united states patayan soriano,cir.
an investigatory stop does not violate the fourth amendment if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot.united states sokolow,quoting terry ohio.to determine whether a stop was supported by reasonable suspicion,we consider whether,in light of the totality of the circumstances,the officer had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.united states,cir quoting united states cortez.
an officer may justify an investigatory stop based solely or substantially on an informant tip,depending on its reliability.at its most reliable,an informant tip alone may sufficiently establish reasonable suspicion for a stop.thus,in adams williams,the supreme court held that where an informant who had provided information in the past and was known to the officer made an tip that an individual seated in a nearby vehicle was carrying narcotics and had a gun at his waist,the tip carried enough indicia of reliability to justify the officer forcible stop of the defendant,id.at.at the other end of the reliability spectrum,the court in florida held that a tip from an anonymous caller telephoning from an unknown location,who reported only that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun,lacked any indicia of reliability and could not provide reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop.
when the tip is provided in a encounter,even when the informant is unidentified,we have deemed it to be closer to the adams end of this reliability spectrum.see united states,cir.in,a border patrol agent was approached by a man wearing overalls,a baseball cap,and driving a mercedes benz.id.at.the man pointed to a nearby pickup truck and said,t he black pickup truck just loaded with weed at the canebreak.id.the agent,without asking the man for his name or other identifying information,stopped the truck and discovered marijuana.id.
we held the tip was sufficiently reliable to justify the stop.id.at.we reasoned that by presenting himself to the agent and doing so while driving a car from which his identity might easily be traced,the informant was in a position to be held accountable for his intervention,and the reliability of the information was thus increased.id.at.
courts have indicated that the nature of a tip gives it substantial indicia of reliability for two reasons.first,as explained above,an informant risks losing anonymity and being held accountable for a false tip.see see also united states romain,cir united states christmas,cir united states salazar,cir.second,when a tip is made,an officer can observe the informant demeanor and determine whether the informant seems credible enough to justify immediate police action without further questioning.see,united states heard,cir united states thompson,united states valentine,cir united states robertson,cir.
here,the ups driver tip featured both of these key indicia of reliability.the driver risked losing his anonymity by speaking with agent simon,who was able to observe his appearance and affiliation with ups,and who could have asked the driver for identification had it seemed necessary.moreover,simon could judge the ups driver demeanor and evaluate his credibility.
other indicia present in this case are also relevant to determining the tip reliability.for example,if the unidentified informant is a member of a small class of likely sources,we have held that the tip does provide the lawful basis for some police action.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in united states,a montana department of transportation mdot employee radioed his dispatcher about an older model black monte carlo whose driver was evidently driving quite erratically,cir.the mdot dispatcher then told the highway patrol dispatcher that one of our guys called in with the tip about the monte carlo.id.a highway patrol officer subsequently stopped the vehicle and discovered over grams of methamphetamine.id.at.we held that the tip was reliable because the informant could be held accountable for fabricating any story if
