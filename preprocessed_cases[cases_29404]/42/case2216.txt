petitioner,mahin ashki,challenges a final order of the board of immigration appeals board or bia denying her motion to reopen deportation proceedings for the purpose of applying for suspension of deportation pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act ina.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the board order.
mahin ashki is a year old native and citizen of iran.she first entered the united states on october,and reentered on august,on a valid student visa.in october,ashki married john evans yurko,a united states citizen.shortly thereafter,yurko filed an immediate relative petition on his wife behalf.on the same day,petitioner filed an application to adjust her status with the immigration and naturalization service.the petition and application were denied when the immigration judge determined that the marriage was a sham.ashki was issued an order to show cause why she should not be deported order to show cause on august.
on or about march,petitioner applied for relief of asylum and withholding of deportation before an immigration judge.on october,the immigration judge found petitioner deportable and denied her applications for asylum and withholding of deportation.in september,mahin ashki filed a motion with the board of immigration appeals board or bia to reopen her deportation proceedings for the purpose of applying for suspension of deportation pursuant to ina.the board found that ashki was not eligible for suspension of deportation because she had not been continuously present in the united states for seven years immediately preceding the date of her application.
specifically,the board held that the stop time provision of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira as amended by the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of nacara prevented ashki from fulfilling the residence requirement because this provision dictates that her progress toward this goal was arrested when she was issued an order to show cause on august.the board concluded that since ashki had only been continuously present in the for a little more than two years when the order to show cause was issued,she had not fulfilled the residence requirement.accordingly,the board denied her motion to reopen and entered a final order of deportation on june.mahin ashki appealed the board final order to this court.

iii.analysis 
legislative background 
prior to,section a of the immigration and nationality act ina gave the attorney general broad discretion to grant suspension of deportation to illegal aliens.see a repealed.however,the attorney general discretion was not complete.in order to be eligible for suspension of deportation under a,an alien was required to prove that he had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application,that during this period he was and is a person of good moral character,and that he is a person whose deportation would,in the opinion of the attorney general,result in extreme hardship id.one of the defects of this regime was that it encouraged illegal aliens to draw out their deportation proceedings so that they could fulfill the residence requirement and apply for suspension of deportation.i.
on september,president clinton signed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira into law,stat.this act was designed to expedite the removal of deportable aliens and to limit their ability to obtain discretionary relief from deportation.i.accordingly,the iirira section a repealed the suspension of deportation authority set out in ina section and replaced it with a more limited form of discretionary relief called cancellation of removal found in ina section.supp.iii.the order to show cause that had previously been used to initiate deportation was replaced with the notice to appear.id.a.
iirira also changed the method for calculating an alien period of continuous physical presence.id.d.section a amended ina section to provide that any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end when the alien is served a notice to appear id.this change was specifically designed to eliminate the problem of aliens delaying their deportation proceedings until they could establish the seven years of continuous presence that was required for suspension of deportation.i.
most of the changes set forth in iirira went into effect on april,and were not retroactive,stat.however,iirira section c,transitional rules with regard to suspension of deportation,took effect immediately upon enactment september,and seemed to be retroactive.stat.at.
unfortunately,the language of this section was not perfectly clear on the issue of whether the new stop time provision should be applied retroactively.section c,which stated that the stop time provision shall apply to notices to appear issued before,on,or after the date of enactment of this act,was especially problematic.id.although this section made it clear that the new stop time provision applied to notices to appear issued before the date of enactment of iirira,it did not indicate whether the stop time provision would apply retroactively to orders to show cause.this omission left the act open to conflicting interpretations.some commentators argued that the stop time provision could not be retroactive since it only applied to notices to appear which did not even exist until iirira was enacted.others alleged that congress had intended for the stop time provision to apply retroactively and that although the transitional rules did not explicitly mention orders to show cause,the transitional rules impliedly included them.in the matter of,the bia took the latter position by interpreting the phrase notices to appear to encompass all charging documents initiating deportation removal proceedings,including orders to show cause.see in re,int.bia.
on november,congress enacted the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara,stat.this act codified the bia decision in by amending the transitional rules in section d of iirira.as amended,iirira section c stipulates that 
paragraphs and of section d of the immigration and nationality act relating to continuous residence or physical presence shall apply to orders to show cause issued before,on,or after the date of enactment of this act.
nacara a,stat.at emphasis added.
nacara removed any ambiguities that may have previously existed in iirira section c,making it clear that the stop time provision set forth in ina section d and applies in the cases of aliens who where issued orders to show cause before,on,or after iirira september,enactment date 
this interpretation of nacara has been endorsed by the united states courts of appeals for the fourth,fifth,eighth,and the eleventh circuits.see appiah ins,cir ins,cir afolayan ins,cir tefel reno,nn,cir.it is also supported by the board of immigration appeals decision in the case of in re,int.bia en banc.
petitioner statutory claims 
as noted above,the board of immigration appeals applied the stop time provision to ashki case.the board concluded that since she had only been in the united states for a little over two years when a order to show cause was issued against her she had not fulfilled the residence requirement of and was not eligible for suspension of deportation.
ashki contends that the stop time provision should not be applied in her case because the literal language of iirira original transitional rules,section c,states that the stop time provision in ina section shall apply to notices to appear.ashki argues that since she was served with a order to show cause and not a notice to appear this stop time provision does not reach her and that she is therefore eligible for the suspension of deportation.
