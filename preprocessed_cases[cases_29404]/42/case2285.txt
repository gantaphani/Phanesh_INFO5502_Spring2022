xiang hui ye was indicted on one count of concealing,harboring,or shielding from detection illegal aliens,and one count of hiring illegal aliens.a jury convicted ye on both counts,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.ye appeals,arguing that the court erred in instructing the jury on the meaning of shielding,a term.relying on a standard adopted by several other circuits,ye claims that the district court definition of shielding was too vague and too broad.ye also contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove he intended to prevent the government from detecting his illegal alien employees.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
xiang hui ye was and manager of buffet city,a restaurant in springfield,illinois.in,government officials began an investigation of buffet city hiring practices after receiving a tip from a former restaurant employee that illegal aliens might be working there.ye eventually was indicted under a a iii and a b i for concealing,harboring,or shielding from detection persons he knew were illegal aliens for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain a felony,and under a a for hiring persons he knew were illegal aliens a misdemeanor.
at trial,the jury was presented with the following evidence.investigators visited buffet city in april and observed numerous chinese and hispanic workers.ye did not have forms for any of the employees an agent advised ye that forms and certain other employment documents were required by law.he eventually submitted forms for some of the chinese workers,but not for any of the hispanic employees.the hispanic workers were paid monthly salaries in cash,without taxes withheld.ye later met with the hispanic employees and informed them that they were fired from their jobs,but that they would be rehired if they could produce immigration documents.ye advised them that they could purchase fake documents in chicago,which he would accept.one hispanic worker was rehired,even though the documents he produced were not in his name.
in august,immigration officials visited buffet city again and observed four hispanic workers.ye said he did not have forms or payroll records for them because they did not have social security numbers.ye also told agents the hispanic workers were living in an apartment that he was leasing.in december,agents arrested five hispanic illegal aliens who were working at buffet city.ye said he did not have forms for those illegal aliens because they did not have any immigration documents.
three chinese illegal aliens who had worked at buffet city testified that they were hired by ye without producing any immigration documents and that he provided housing to them and other illegal aliens.evidence was also presented that ye had signed and submitted reports to the illinois department of employment security that listed only the wages paid to chinese workers who had social security numbers.no hispanic names were on those forms.
ye testified he knew illegal chinese and hispanic aliens worked at the restaurant and that all of the hispanics were illegal aliens.he stated he had helped with the hiring of the illegal aliens.ye admitted entering lease agreements and making rent payments for apartments where illegal aliens lived,and also providing them with transportation to work.ye declared he did not ask illegal aliens to fill out job applications,tax forms,or other employment documents,even though he knew such documents were required by law.ye also acknowledged not keeping time cards for the illegal aliens,even though time cards were maintained for other employees.
after retiring for deliberation,the jury sent a note to the court requesting definitions of the terms concealing and shielding.ye objected to the district court giving any definitions to the jury the government thought definitions were warranted.the district court agreed with the government and gave the jury definitions for the two terms.the jury found ye guilty on both counts of the indictment.ye then moved for a judgment of acquittal or,alternatively,a new trial,which the district court denied.the court sentenced ye to months imprisonment.this appeal followed.
on appeal,ye makes two arguments,both pertaining to his conviction under a a iii.the first is that the supplemental instruction the district court gave the jury on the meaning of shielding was erroneous the second is that the evidence was insufficient to prove he intended to prevent the government from detecting his illegal alien employees.
supplemental jury instruction 
ye claims the district court instruction on the meaning of shielding was erroneous because it was too vague and too broad.the usual standard of review for whether a jury instruction accurately states the law is de novo.united states thornton,cir.but under federal rule of criminal procedure d,when a party disagrees with a jury instruction it must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection failure to object in accordance with this rule precludes appellate review,except as permitted under plain error review.because ye likely did not comply with rule d,our review perhaps should be for plain error only united states wheeler,cir.and under that standard of review,we rarely reverse a conviction because of an improper jury instruction to which no objection was offered.id.
but assuming ye did comply with rule d and preserved the argument he advances on appeal,he can not prevail under de novo review because the instruction was not an erroneous statement of the law.under a a iii,it is unlawful when a person knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to,entered,or remains in the united states in violation of law,conceals,harbors,or shields from detection,or attempts to conceal,harbor,or shield from detection,such alien in any place,including any building or any means of transportation.as our sister circuits have recognized,conceal,harbor,and shield from detection have independent meanings,and thus a conviction can result from committing or attempting to commit any one of the three acts.united states,cir section a a iii by its express terms may be violated in any one of several harboring,or by concealing,or by shielding from detection or by attempting to do any of these.united states cantu,cir shield from detection and conceal are not redundant united states de evans,cir h arbor has a different meaning than conceal.the only term at issue here is shield from detection.
statutory interpretation begins with the plain language of the statute.united states berkos,cir.this court assumes that the purpose of the statute is communicated by the ordinary meaning of the words congress used therefore,absent any clear indication of a contrary purpose,the plain language is conclusive.id.a leading dictionary from tells us that the verb form of shield means to cover with or as with a shield to cover from danger or the like to defend to protect from distress,assault,injury,or the like or to ward off to keep off or out.webster new international dictionary ed.the noun detection means the laying open of what was concealed or hidden,or of that which tends to elude observation discovery.id.at.thus defined,the term shield from detection essentially means to protect from or to ward off discovery.
in light of that understanding,there appears to be no problem with the district court defining shielding for the jury as the use of any means to prevent the detection of illegal aliens in the united states by the government to prevent the detection is certainly a fair and accurate approximation of to protect from or to ward off discovery.ye takes issue with the use of any means language,however,arguing it misstates the law because it is too vague and too broad.to support his position,he points to the fifth circuit opinion in cantu and argues that a a iii only proscribes conduct tending substantially to facilitate an alien remaining in the united states illegally.at quoting united states lopez,cir.
we disagree.the use of any means language is not vague that wording refers to the methods a person may use to protect an alien from discovery,the forms that such
