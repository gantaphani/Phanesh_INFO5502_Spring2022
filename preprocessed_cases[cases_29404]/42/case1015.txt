this petition for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia denying a claim for asylum presents the recurring issue of whether a determination that the asylum applicant lacked credibility is sustainable and,if the bia decision is vacated,the additional issue of whether on remand the matter should be reassigned to a different immigration judge ij because of an appearance of bias.petitioner huang huang petitions for review of an order of the bia affirming the decision of ij jeffrey chase,which denied huang application for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act,et the ina.we conclude that the credibility determination is flawed and that the remarks of ij chase during the questioning of the applicant create an appearance that he can not impartially adjudicate this case.we therefore remand for reassignment to a different ij.
background 
petitioner huang,a chinese native,entered the united states in tampa,florida,on april.immigration officials caught him trying to enter the country using a japanese passport.the immigration and naturalization service ins promptly commenced exclusion proceedings.huang later applied for admission under the visa waiver pilot program.under this system,the alien has an early opportunity to have an asylum claim heard,but is not immediately placed in removal proceedings.
the airport interview.upon arrival at tampa international airport in florida,an ins asylum officer interviewed huang and recorded his answers in a sworn statement.huang stated that the chinese government forced his wife to have an abortion when she was pregnant with their second child.he also stated that the government officials had previously destroyed his house and assessed a fine,and that he feared future arrest.
the credible fear interview.in may,an officer of the ins interviewed huang.huang stated that government officials performed the abortion in september,in the ninth month of his wife pregnancy.he also elaborated on the previous incident when government officials cadres destroyed his house.he stated that the cadres were looking for his wife in order to perform an abortion and that the attack occurred when he confronted them by saying that the chinese government does not recognize human rights and does not recognize humanity.the cadres slapped him in the face and took down his windows and doors.huang also testified that he had a conversation about sterilization with a doctor when his wife had the abortion.the doctor would not sterilize his wife by tubal ligation at that time because she was too weak from the abortion.huang then feared that he would be sterilized instead of his wife,went into hiding,and fled the country.
huang asylum application.huang completed an application for asylum in september,claiming that he faced persecution because of china family planning policy.huang stated that he and his wife secretly had a daughter in,but gave that child up for adoption.huang and his wife openly had a son in.after that birth,the government forced his wife to use an iud.in,the huangs secretly had a private doctor remove the iud,and huang wife became pregnant in january.in july,huang had his confrontation with the village cadres when they came looking for his wife.in september,the cadres discovered huang wife and forcibly aborted her pregnancy.huang stated that this event occurred one month before her due date.huang also explained the inconsistency between this statement and his statement in his credible fear hearing that the abortion occurred in the ninth month of pregnancy by stating that he thought at the time that pregnancy lasted ten months,not nine.finally,huang said that village cadres threatened him and his wife with sterilization,but after his wife apologized for the confrontation,they allowed her to have an iud inserted instead.
appearances before ij chase.huang appeared before ij chase on several occasions before a hearing on the merits of his application was held on september.the pertinent aspects of what transpired on those occasions relating to the appearance of bias on the part of the ij are detailed later in this opinion.see part vi,infra.at the merits hearing,huang testified about his wife forced abortion in september.he said that he was away at the time,but his wife told him that the cadres had taken her to have the abortion and that she had remained in the hospital for a few days because she had lost a lot of blood.he also testified about his confrontation with the village cadres in july.finally,he testified that he feared arrest and physical abuse if he returned to china.
on,the government asked huang about a document confirming that his wife had had an abortion.huang testified that his wife obtained the document from the hospital after the abortion,as a receipt.the government also asked huang to explain why this document listed his wife occupation as farmer,but his household registration listed the household as.huang explained that they had been assigned to a farm,but the chinese government took the farmland to build a road,and his family was to a residential household.
later in the,the government asked huang whether he had given up for adoption his first child,who was a girl.huang confirmed that he and his wife had done so.ij chase interjections at this point in the are detailed in part vi,infra.after brief government,ij chase questioned huang about a document his wife received from the village cadres in june.the document states that huang wife severely violated the family planning policy,and notes that she had an abortion enforced upon her in september and an iud inserted in november.ij chase asked huang to explain why the village cadres would give his wife a document admitting that it forced her to have an abortion.huang stated that the purpose of the document was to show that she had an iud inserted and that there was no need for anything further to be done.
ij decision.the ij issued an oral ruling in july,denying the application for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij found that huang testimony lacked credibility,based on several factors.first,he concluded that the document from the village cadres admitting that they had forced huang wife to undergo abortion was clearly fraudulent.the ij saw no reason why the village cadres would admit to carrying out persecution that the chinese national government regularly denies.second,he concluded that the july confrontation with village authorities was fabricated.he reasoned an uneducated villager,such as the applicant,really would not be making human rights arguments,basing it on forms of government or a government ideology.third,he disbelieved huang testimony that his wife could not be sterilized immediately after she had her abortion.he said that he did not understand why she would have been too weak to undergo tubal ligation.he faulted huang for failure to explain this proposition with medical documentation.fourth,he faulted huang for giving up his first child for adoption because she was a girl.he described this act as a very sexist act,a very,if we are talking about human rights,inhumane act,and his reasons for doing it were highly selfish.he contrasted huang troublesome viewpoint with the idea that in this society that we live in america,parents generally believe in sacrificing for their children.
ij chase concluded that huang testimony was not credible and denied him asylum and withholding of removal.
bia decision.on appeal to the bia,huang argued that the adverse credibility ruling was based on speculation and that the ij was biased against him.the bia issued a opinion dismissing huang appeal.the opinion explicitly accepted only one of the ij four submission of fraudulent noted generally that as the immigration judge found,huang made certain false statements and presented a fraudulent document.
the bia also added three of its own reasons for disbelieving huang testimony.first,it faulted huang for being inconsistent as to the month of the pregnancy in which the abortion occurred.second,the bia concluded that another material inconsistency existed between huang application,which stated that he lived in a area,and a document from a hospital,which indicated that his wife was a farmer.third,the bia wrote that despite the assistance of counsel,the respondent testimony was confusing and nonresponsive.
huang filed a timely petition for review.
discussion 
standard of review 
our standard of the findings are supported by substantial well established.see ins,d ramsameachire ashcroft,cir wu biao chen ins,cir diallo ins,cir.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
this court recently decided that we have jurisdiction to review the denial of an application for asylum,despite the absence of a final order of removal,in a asylum only proceeding such as the pending case.see kanacevic ins,cir.
iii.whether substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding 
a threshold matter on this issue is whether we should review the reasons given by the bia,the ij,or both.huang brief inconsistently asks us to review only the bia opinion and also the ij opinion.the government asks us to review the ij decision.in this case,the bia affirmed the decision of the ij with a short opinion and added some reasons of its own.this court generally reviews only the final order of the bia,but when the bia adopts the ij decision and supplements it,this court reviews the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.yu yin yang gonzales,cir.accordingly,we consider the reasons for the adverse credibility finding given by both the ij and the bia.
a.the ij reasons 
the fraudulent letter.the ij found that huang letter from the village cadres admitting to have forced an abortion on huang wife was fraudulent.this was the only one of ij chase reasons that the bia expressly affirmed.the ij found that this letter was fraudulent because of the implausibility that the local village government would admit to a forced abortion when the chinese national government denies that such practices exist and because huang could not give any possible reason why such a document would be needed by anybody in china.huang argues that this conclusion is based on speculation.the government responds that the ij could rely on the suspicious timing of the creation of the document ten months after the abortion and two months after huang filed for asylum as well as its inherent implausibility.however,in reaching his conclusion,the ij mischaracterized huang testimony.as noted,huang did give an explanation for why such a document would be needed in china,to prove that his wife already had been punished for her violation and nothing more needed to be done.we express no opinion as to whether a reasonable,after properly assessing the evidence and huang explanation,could reasonably find the document to be fraudulent.
the village confrontation.the ij found huang account of the confrontation with village authorities incredible because an uneducated villager would not refer to human rights in confronting local authorities.although the line between reasonable and speculation is imprecise,this finding crosses the line however drawn.the ij speculation appears to have been influenced by his evident bias against huang,explored more fully in part vi,infra.
timing of the iud insertion.the ij thought it improbable that huang wife would be too weak to undergo sterilization immediately following the forced abortion and faulted huang for failing to provide medical documentation on this point.however,huang wife underwent a forced abortion in her final month of pregnancy,and nothing in the record supports the ij inexpert medical opinion that sterilization could have been promptly performed after the abortion.
huang treatment of his daughter.ij chase also found huang incredible based on the fact that huang and his wife gave up their first child for adoption because she was a girl.ij chase described this act as sexist,inhumane,and selfish,and explained how it is antithetical to american society and values.none of the ij commentary bears upon huang truthfulness.
b.the bia reasons 
the bia agreed with the ij that the abortion document was not authentic,and provided three additional reasons for doubting huang credibility.
confusion over the timing of the abortion.the bia thought huang was inconsistent in stating at one point that the abortion occurred in the ninth month of the pregnancy and at another point that it occurred one month before her due date.this discrepancy is too insignificant to warrant an adverse credibility finding,especially in view of huang explanation that he thought pregnancy lasted ten months.the bia also seized on an apparent slip of the tongue when huang stated that the abortion occurred when she is five months months pregnant.since the wife was obviously not five months old and the gender of the fetus had not been identified,the only reasonable interpretation of this passage is that the reference to five months was either a slip of the tongue by huang as he began his answer or a transcription error by the stenographer.the ij,who heard the testimony,did not identify the reference to five months as an inconsistency.
wife occupation listed as farmer.huang stated in his asylum application that he and his wife lived in a area,but a hospital receipt listed his wife occupation as a farmer.huang explained the discrepancy by stating that they had formerly been farmers but that the government took their land for road construction.the bia did not offer a reasoned evaluation of the petitioner explanation,as we require,see cao he lin doj,cir,and the ij,apparently satisfied with the explanation,did not rely on this alleged discrepancy in making his adverse credibility finding.
confusing or nonresponsive testimony.the bia described huang testimony as confusing and nonresponsive,citing most of his direct and by the government.to the contrary,a review of huang testimony reveals that he stood up admirably to the withering interrogation by the ij.the bia conclusory statement does not support an adverse credibility finding,and the government does not argue otherwise.
in sum,of the reasons noted by the ij and the bia for rejecting huang testimony,only dubious authenticity of the letter confirming the support the adverse finding on credibility,and even that finding is tainted by the ij mischaracterization of huang explanation.
iv.appropriate disposition in view of errors 
although we may deny a petition despite errors where we can state with confidence that the ij would adhere to his decision were the petition remanded,xiao ji chen doj,cir,we can not deny relief on this record.here,no portions of the ij findings remain,and we therefore need not decide whether the ij would reach the same conclusion notwithstanding the errors.id.at.as noted above,we do not decide whether a reasonable could conclude that the local officials abortion certificate was not authentic.upon reconsideration,with the numerous erroneous grounds of decision disregarded,a might accept huang argument that local officials would issue an authentic document at odds with the professed national policy,especially in view of huang other supporting documentary evidence,which included birth certificates,a marriage certificate,a document from the hospital,a pregnancy card for huang wife,an id card,a household member booklet,and a letter from his wife.the errors permeating the adverse credibility finding require a remand.
v.the ij apparent bias and hostility toward huang 
apart from the flaws in the adverse credibility finding,this is the rare case where remand is required because of the ij apparent bias and hostility toward huang.the hearings included several instances of questioning by the ij that were at least inappropriate and at worst indicative of bias against chinese witnesses.
ij insistence that huang work.at the initial hearing on september,ij chase asked huang a few preliminary questions about whether he was working,ostensibly to determine a reliable address where huang could be located.after huang stated that he was not working,but owed relatives,which they did not expect him currently to repay,ij chase said 
that is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard.i am not going to take the asylum application now.we will have you come back every month.and eventually,you will have a job s
