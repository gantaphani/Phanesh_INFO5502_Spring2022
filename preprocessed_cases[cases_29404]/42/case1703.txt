fernando frederick wilson appeals his conviction under a and b for unlawful reentry of a deported alien.on appeal,he asserts that the district court erred by failing to grant his motion to dismiss.wilson moved to dismiss on the ground that a defect in his original deportation proceedings,specifically the failure of the board of immigration appeals bia to consider his application for waiver of deportation,rendered the deportation order invalid and thus not a proper basis on which to mount a section prosecution.he also challenges his sentence enhancement under united states sentencing guideline b c,which provides for an enhancement when an alien was previously deported after conviction for an aggravated felony.wilson argues that his state conviction for possession of cocaine does not constitute an aggravated felony because it does not qualify as a drug trafficking crime.we conclude that wilson collateral attack is itself defective and,further,that the sentence enhancement was proper.accordingly,we affirm.
the undisputed facts are as follows.wilson,a native and citizen of panama,entered the united states without immigration inspection in early and promptly joined the united states marine corps.in,his immigration status was adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident.on september,while still serving in the military,wilson was indicted in virginia for possession with intent to distribute cocaine.he pled guilty to the lesser included offense of felony possession of cocaine.two years later,wilson tested positive for drugs and was given a bad conduct discharge from the marine corps.
on november,the immigration and naturalization service ins ordered wilson to show cause why it should not deport him for having been convicted of a drug offense.at a hearing before an immigration judge ij,wilson conceded his deportability but,as a lawful permanent resident,requested that the ij grant him a waiver of deportation pursuant to section c of the immigration and naturalization act ina.see c supp.section c granted the attorney general broad discretion to admit aliens who would otherwise be excludable,and had been interpreted by the bia as authorizing any permanent resident alien with seven consecutive years of lawful domicile,such as wilson,to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation.
although charged prior to their enactment,wilson case came before the ij following enactment of the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,enacted on april,stat,and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,enacted on september,stat,which together comprehensively amended the ina,stat,as amended et.of particular relevance to this appeal,aedpa section d amended ina section c to preclude section c discretionary relief for aliens convicted of certain enumerated criminal offenses,including drug offenses.the attorney general subsequently interpreted the provisions of aedpa and iirira as applying retroactively.see in re soriano,interim decision,wl op.att y june.
however,the matter was still unsettled when the ij adjudicated wilson case.on july,the ij found wilson deportable.as to wilson section c waiver application,the ij chose to apply section c as the law stood when wilson was charged in,and,accordingly,considered the merits of wilson section c application.the ij denied wilson section c application,ruling that the unfavorable equities outweighed the favorable equities,and ordered that wilson be deported to panama.
wilson appealed the section c denial to the bia.the bia sustained the order of deportation,relying on the attorney general opinion that aedpa and iirira applied retroactively to bar section c relief.as a result,the bia did not review the merits of wilson section c application.
wilson was deported on july.he was given written warning that if he returned to the united states without permission he was subject to prosecution for unlawful reentry under.after wilson deportation,the supreme court ruled in ins cyr,d,that aedpa did not apply retroactively to bar the opportunity for section c relief for aliens who pled guilty to an offense which would have left them eligible for section c relief prior to the statute enactment.
sometime in,wilson reentered the united states without permission.he was arrested by the ins on july,and indicted for unlawful reentry in violation of a and b.he moved to dismiss on the ground that his original deportation order was invalid because the bia should have considered his section c application.the district court denied wilson motion to dismiss,reasoning that,even assuming wilson could show a violation of his due process rights,because he would have had at most a chance of receiving c relief from the bia,he could not show actual prejudice.united states wilson,mem.order at,hereinafter the order.wilson was subsequently found guilty under section a and b.at sentencing,the district court calculated wilson base offense level as and,over wilson objection,enhanced his offense level to on the ground that his conviction for felony possession of cocaine amounted to an aggravated felony for purposes of b c.the district court sentenced wilson to months imprisonment,a special assessment of,and a year period of supervised release.wilson appealed.
on appeal,wilson reasserts his argument that his original deportation order is invalid because he was impermissibly denied the opportunity to apply for a section c waiver before the bia.because it is defective,wilson contends,that order can not serve as the basis for a conviction under section.
under d,an alien may collaterally attack the validity of his deportation order when prosecuted for illegal reentry under section a.however,section d contains three conditions that a defendant must satisfy before he will be allowed to mount a collateral attack.the alien must demonstrate that 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d.these requirements are listed in the conjunctive,so a defendant must satisfy all three in order to prevail.see united states,cir.the government concedes that wilson exhausted his administrative remedies,but contends that he can show neither of the other two requirements.
this court reviews wilson challenge to his conviction de novo.see united states,cir.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that wilson collateral attack must fail.
wilson collateral attack fails because he can not show that a defect in the underlying deportation order rendered it fundamentally unfair.see d.in order to establish fundamental unfairness,a defendant must show that his due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.see,united states,cir united states,cir.
while the district court assumed that wilson could show a due process violation,in fact he can not.in order to succeed on a due process claim,wilson must first establish that he had a property or liberty interest at stake.smith ashcroft,cir.in smith ashcroft,the court considered whether there is a due process right to section c relief.like wilson,smith was deported after enactment of aedpa and iirira and before the cyr decision.both the ij and the bia denied smith the opportunity to apply for a section c waiver.id.at.smith attempts to get judicial review of the bia ruling were unavailing,and he was deported.later,he illegally reentered the united states.when the government learned of this,it immediately moved to reinstate the deportation order.smith brought a habeas corpus petition asserting that his fifth amendment right to due process was violated by the deportation proceedings because he was not given court review of the bia ruling that he was not entitled to discretionary relief.id.at.the smith court denied the due process challenge,holding unequivocally that there is no protected liberty or property interest in discretionary c relief.id.at.the court reached this conclusion because section c does not create an entitlement,but is rather completely discretionary in nature.id.at.
wilson claim that his original deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair is effectively the same as that advanced by the habeas petitioner in smith.and,under smith,even if wilson was entitled to have the bia consider his section c application,he can not show that the failure of the bia to do so denied him due process because he had no due process right in the section c relief 
although wilson claim could be denied solely on the basis of his failure to identify a due process violation,wilson has failed to show prejudice,even assuming such a violation.in the district court,counsel for wilson speculated that,if wilson had been able to get bia review of the ij section c ruling,he would have had a chance of having the ij decision overturned.the district court found that a chance was not sufficient to establish prejudice because it did not show that but for the alleged violation of his rights by the bia he would not have been deported.order at.
the district court correctly found that wilson failed to establish prejudice.in order to demonstrate prejudice,a defendant must show a reasonable likelihood that but for the errors complained of,the defendant would not have been deported,at see also united states,cir actual prejudice exists where defects in the deportation proceedings may well have resulted in a deportation that would not otherwise have occurred.
even a cursory review of the equities in wilson case demonstrates that his actual chance of obtaining a reversal at the bia level were significantly lower than the figure suggested by his counsel.w hen an alien has a record of serious criminal activity,he must demonstrate unusual or outstanding equities in order to be eligible for a favorable exercise of discretion under section c.board of immigration appeals,cir.wilson conviction for felony possession of cocaine was certainly a serious criminal act.in addition,he had significant negative equities,including his bad conduct discharge from the marine corps for a positive drug test,and his minimal income which suggest s that he and his family will be continued burdens on the taxpayer in the future if they remain in the united states.quotation from the decision of the ij on the merits of wilson section c application.in short,as the ij recognized,wilson demonstrated none of the unusual or outstanding favorable equities that would make him likely to receive a section c waiver.because he points to no evidence that would indicate otherwise other than his attorney optimistic projection,wilson has failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that but for the alleged error,he would not have been deported 
wilson also challenges the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to b c.the guideline provides for an level enhancement for illegal reentry when the defendant was previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.b c.we review the district court imposition of the sentence enhancement de novo because it entails the interpretation of a statute.see united states campbell,cir.
the issue presented is whether a state conviction for possession of an unknown quantity of cocaine can ultimately qualify as an aggravated felony under section if it is a felony under the applicable state law but is punishable only as a misdemeanor under the controlled substances act csa,et.this is a question of first impression in this circuit.the district court concluded that simple possession of drugs,if a felony under state law,can constitute an aggravated felony.we agree,and thereby join the seven other circuits that have addressed the issue.see united states,cir united states,cir united states simon,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir.
our analysis begins with the guideline itself.the term aggravated felony is not defined in the text of section.however,the application note for that subsection states that aggravated felony has the meaning given that term in a,application note.section a of title provides that t he term aggravated felony means b illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b emphasis added.section c of title,in turn,states that 
the term drug trafficking crime means any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et,the controlled substances import and export act et,or the maritime drug law enforcement act et.
c emphasis added.
the next step of the analysis is to determine what the elements of a drug trafficking crime are under section c.as it is structured,section c is plainly comprised of two separate elements.it speaks first of any felony and then goes on to list three separate statutes under which the felony may be punishable.thus,the two elements of section c are any felony,that is punishable under the csa or one of the other two enumerated statutes.the other circuits have reached the same interpretive conclusion.see,at,at simon,at,at,at,at.
turning to the first court must consider whether wilson state conviction for possession of cocaine amounts to a felony within the meaning of section c.simple possession of an unknown quantity of cocaine is punished by the csa as a misdemeanor.see a providing for a term of imprisonment of not more than year.but the inquiry does not stop there.the csa defines the term felony as any federal or state offense classified by applicable federal or state law as a felony.emphasis added.that definition,which is clear and unambiguous,encompasses wilson virginia conviction because simple possession of a controlled substance is a felony under virginia law.see a.so,while the csa would not punish wilson conduct as a felony,it does define it as a felony given the punishment it receives under virginia law.
the csa definition of felony,while not itself a part of section c,is nevertheless relevant as an interpretive matter.section c does not contain any internal limitation on its broad reference to any felony other than that such felonies be punishable under one of the enumerated statutes.it is therefore reasonable to interpret those words as including within their scope felonies as defined by the very acts that the statute references.for the foregoing reasons it is clear,and we so hold,that a state conviction for possession of cocaine can constitute a felony within the meaning of section c,if the offense is classified as a felony under the law of the relevant state,even though the same offense would only be punishable as a misdemeanor under federal law 
wilson also satisfies the second element of section c.simple possession of an unknown quantity of cocaine is punishable under the csa.see a.thus,because wilson conviction for felony possession of cocaine satisfies both elements of section c and thereby constitutes a drug trafficking crime,he has committed an aggravated felony as that term is defined in application note of section.the district court therefore correctly applied the enhancement.
wilson would have us interpret the statute differently.he contends that when c defines drug trafficking crime as any felony punishable under the csa,it means that the offense must be punishable as a felony by the csa,not simply punishable under the csa.we need look no further than the text of section c to refute wilson argument.the statute does not say that the offense must be punishable as a felony by the csa.rather,the statute merely says that the offense must be a felony,punishable thereunder.see,at.in other words,there is no suggestion from the text of the statute itself that only those offenses that federal law punishes as felonies are eligible.quite the contrary,as noted above,federal law itself defines the crime wilson committed as a felony,even though it would not punish it as such.wilson invites us to,in effect,rewrite the statute,but that we can not do.
wilson also argues that our decision in united states garnett,cir,demands the contrary result.in garnett,we considered whether a sentence enhancement under b for use of a machine gun in connection with a felony offense was warrant
