roberto garcía garcía appeals his conviction for illegal into the united states by a deported alien in violation of.we affirm.
on february,seth plumb plumb,a special agent with the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice,arrested garcía in quincy,massachusetts.as an ice special agent,plumb was responsible for locating people who entered the united states illegally.plumb took garcía to the ice office,where,during the booking process,garcía photograph and fingerprints were taken.
as a result of his encounter with garcía,plumb reviewed the alien registration file of an individual named roberto garcía,assigned alien registration number.that alien registration file contained a number of documents,all with the same alien registration number,revealing that roberto garcía was a native and citizen of colombia who had entered the united states illegally and had been deported in from the united states to his native country.among other things,the file contained a warrant for deportation,dated december,which included a photograph of roberto garcía along with a print of his right index finger.trained in fingerprint comparison,plumb compared the fingerprints obtained from garcía during the booking process with the fingerprint on the warrant of deportation.plumb concluded that the fingerprints belonged to the same person.plumb also recognized the man in the photograph as the man he arrested in quincy,massachusetts.
garcía was indicted on march,in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on one count of illegal by a deported alien in violation of.he was convicted on november,after a two day trial during which the government called three witnesses plumb,erik carpenter carpenter a forensic examiner for the latent print unit of the fbi laboratory,and joanne sassone sassone the records and information services officer for the united states citizenship and immigration service of the department of homeland security.on march,garcía was sentenced to months in the custody of the bureau of prisons,with judgment entered the following day.
in challenging his conviction,garcía first argues that the district court erred in admitting certain documents and testimony at trial.he then argues that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to convict him.we are not convinced by either argument.
evidentiary rulings 
in general,we review a district court decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.united states flemmi,cir.where no objection was made to the admission of evidence at trial,we review evidentiary issues for plain error.id.to establish plain error,a defendant must demonstrate that an error occurred which was obvious,which affected his substantial rights,and which seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states,cir.
garcía affidavit 
roberto garcía alien registration file included an affidavit,dated october,containing the following statement,handwritten in english 
my true and complete name is roberto garcía.i was born on may,in colombia and i am a citizen of colombia.i entered the from mexico in illegally.i did not present myself for inspection because i did not have a visa.
the handwritten statement was signed roberto the affidavit indicated that,while an interpreter was not used,the affiant appeared before a officer of what was then the united states immigration and naturalization service ins,that the affiant was advised of his miranda rights in spanish,and that the affiant willingly made the above sworn statement.following the signed handwritten statement was a typewritten statement indicating that the foregoing statement had been read to the affiant,that the answers made therein were true and correct,and that the affidavit was a full,true,and correct record of the affiant interrogation by the ins officer.the typewritten statement was signed robert 
before trial began,garcía moved in limine to exclude the affidavit,arguing that the affidavit was untrustworthy because it was prepared in english and allegedly signed by garcía,who speaks only spanish.the district court rejected garcía argument,explaining that while the affidavit was written in english,it was interpreted into spanish by the ins officer the affidavit indicated that garcía was advised of his rights and garcía signature appeared on the affidavit.the district court noted not only that the signature on the affidavit appeared to be the same as the signature on a form signed by garcía in open court that very day,but also that garcía did not challenge the signature and did not proffer that the affidavit had not been interpreted for him in spanish.
at trial,the affidavit was introduced through sassone,who testified that roberto garcía alien registration file was maintained in the regular course of business.sassone identified the various documents contained in the alien registration file,including the affidavit,but she admitted that she had no personal knowledge about the events that triggered the preparation of those documents.garcía objected to admission of the affidavit on hearsay and grounds.
the district court overruled garcía hearsay objection,finding that the affidavit was an admission of a party opponent.the district court again noted that garcía had adopted the statements contained in the affidavit as his own and had offered nothing to challenge the representation that the affidavit was explained in spanish.
the district court also overruled garcía objection to admission of the affidavit on authentication grounds.according to garcía,because sassone had no personal knowledge about garcía deportation and was not present when the affidavit was created,she could not establish that the document was,in fact,signed by garcía.the district court was unpersuaded,having itself seen the obvious similarities in the signature placed on the form signed by garcía in open court and the multiple signatures found on various documents in roberto garcía alien registration file.
garcía now contends that the district court committed reversible error by admitting the affidavit signed by roberto we find no merit to such contention.indeed,garcía has pointed to nothing in the record that casts doubt upon the district court findings that the statements contained within the affidavit were translated into spanish for garcía benefit,garcía heard,understood,and acquiesced in those statements,and garcía twice signed the affidavit,thereby signaling his adoption of the affidavit as his own.see mcqueeney wilmington trust,cir holding that a seaman signature on sea service records prepared by others was an unequivocal adoption of the contents therein.given these findings,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the affidavit as a admission of alienage by a party opponent.
garcía authentication argument is equally unavailing.under federal rule of evidence a,t he requirement of authentication as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.if the trial court determines that there is sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable person to believe the evidence is what it purports to be,the evidence may be admitted subject to the factfinder assessing what weight will be given to the evidence.united states,cir.there is no single way,moreover,to authenticate evidence.as this court has recognized on more than one occasion 
t he direct testimony of a custodian or a percipient witness is not a sine qua non to the authentication of a writing.thus,a document appearance,contents,substance,internal patterns,or other distinctive characteristics,taken in conjunction with circumstances,can,in cumulation,even without direct testimony,provide sufficient indicia of reliability to permit a finding that it is authentic.
united states holmquist,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d united states paulino,cir.
here,given the absence of any evidence to refute what the affidavit,on its face,revealed,we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in admitting the affidavit.the content of the affidavit,the circumstances surrounding its creation,and its location in an alien registration file containing not only garcía photograph but also several examples of his signature a signature that appeared to be the same as the signature placed on the form signed by garcía in the presence of the district court all support the district court decision to admit the affidavit as an authentic document.
fingerprint card 
during trial,garcía objected to the admission of government exhibit,a fingerprint card that was signed roberto on the front and stamped usins,pittsburgh,pa on the back.although it was included in roberto garcía alien registration file,the card was otherwise lacking a date,an alien registration number,and such identifying information as a date of birth,social security number,height,weight,and fbi number.garcía objected that the card was untrustworthy because its only authentication was the purported signature of roberto 
the district court overruled garcía objection and admitted the fingerprint card,again noting that the signature on the card appeared to be the same as the signature on the affidavit.indeed,the similarity in signatures was not the only factor supporting the district court ruling.the fingerprint card was contained in an alien registration file that included a photograph of garcía.in addition,the stamp appearing on the back of the card,usins,pittsburgh,pa,was consistent with other documents in the file indicating that the roberto garcía whose photograph was in the file had been in ins custody in pittsburgh,pennsylvania,after he was encountered,but before he was deported,in.there was thus sufficient evidence before the district court to warrant a reasonable person in believing that government exhibit was what it purported to be namely,a card containing the fingerprints of garcía.
warrant of deportation 
the warrant of deportation,commanding any ins officer to take custody of roberto garcía and to remove him from the united states,was introduced through sassone.she testified that a warrant of deportation,when complete with an alien photograph and fingerprint,reveals that an ins official witnessed the alien departure from the united states on a given date.as explained by sassone,the warrant of deportation contained in roberto garcía alien registration file,complete with photograph and fingerprint,revealed that roberto garcía was actually placed on a plane in newark,new jersey,on december,for deportation out of the united states.sassone further explained that,had roberto garcía been granted permission to the united states subsequently,such permission would be reflected not only in his alien registration file but also in the ins computer indices.sassone testified that she found no evidence,either in the alien registration file or the agency computer indices,that permission to had ever been granted to roberto garcía.
relying on crawford washington,d,garcía contends on appeal that the district court violated his confrontation rights by admitting the warrant of deportation when the officer who signed the warrant was not made available for.because garcía did not object to the admission of the warrant of deportation at trial,we review for plain error.
in crawford,at,the supreme court held that the confrontation clause prohibits the admission of statements that are testimonial in nature unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant concerning the statements.garcía argues that the warrant of deportation admitted in this case falls within the core class of testimonial statements described by the supreme court in crawford.
at least three circuit courts have rejected the very argument being made here by garcía.in united states,cir,the fifth circuit held that warrants of deportation do not constitute testimonial hearsay under crawford.the ninth and eleventh circuits have likewise held that defendants have no right to confront and the agents who routinely record warrants of deportation because warrants of deportation are and,therefore,not subject to the confrontation clause.see united states,cir,cert.denied,d united states cantellano,cir,cert.denied,d see also united states,cir stating generally that documents in a defendant immigration file are analogous to business records united states quezada,cir holding that a warrant of deportation contained in an alien ins file was reliable and admissible because the official preparing the warrant had no motivation to do anything other than mechanically register an unambiguous factual matter.
because we find no reason to disagree with the fifth,ninth,and eleventh circuits,we conclude that garcía has established no error at all,much less plain error,with regard to the admission of the warrant of deportation.
plumb identification of garcía 
at trial,agent plumb testified,without objection,that he recognized the person whose picture appeared on the warrant of deportation as the same person he encountered in under the name roberto garcía.plumb also testified that he recognized this person as the to was in the courtroom during jury selection earlier that morning.garcía now contends that the district court committed plain error by admitting plumb opinion testimony regarding the identity of the person in the photograph on the warrant of deportation.according to garcía,plumb testimony was improper because it was based on plumb scant exposure to garcía.
although plumb encountered garcía only once,it was not a fleeting encounter.in fact,plumb encountered garcía in quincy,massachusetts,transported garcía from quincy to boston,booked garcía into the ice system,filled in garcía fingerprint card,and served garcía with several documents.there is nothing in the record to suggest that plumb was unable to fully observe garcía during the arrest and booking,that plumb did not remember garcía,or that plumb had any difficulty in identifying garcía,either in person or by photograph.under the circumstances,we find no plain error in the district court decision to admit plumb identification testimony.
plumb expert testimony on fingerprint comparison 
garcía contends that the district court abused its discretion in permitting agent plumb to garcía an expert with respect to fingerprint comparison.garcía maintains that plumb purported expertise was inadequate in that it rested on a mere two days of training.we disagree.
in essence,plumb testified that his training in fingerprint comparison began with a course taught by a representative of the massachusetts bureau of criminal investigations.plumb further explained that he received a certification in fingerprint comparison after he completed the course,that he conducted more than fingerprint comparisons over the course of the next two years,that his comparisons were sometimes verified by another ins officer or by the federal bureau of investigation,that the results of his comparisons had never differed from those of the person verifying his comparisons,and that he had testified as a fingerprint expert in federal court on several occasions.
this court may reverse the district court decision regarding expert testimony only if the ruling was so wide of the mark as to constitute an abuse of discretion.macaulay anas,cir see also united states valle,cir explaining that the trial court has discretion to admit or reject expert testimony and its determination is reviewable only for an abuse of that discretion.here,there was no abuse of discretion.to be sure,some experts are more qualified than others,and his capacity as a law enforcement not have had the same expertise as someone whose sole occupation is to compare latent prints.plumb training and experience were sufficient,however,to permit the district court,in its discretion,to admit plumb testimony.it was up to the jury to weigh that testimony,given what the jurors heard on direct and about plumb training and experience.
