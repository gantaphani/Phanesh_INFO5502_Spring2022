carlos antonio lezama garcia lezama,a native and citizen of nicaragua,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal of an immigration judge ij order of removal.the ij determined that,under k,lezama had abandoned his pending application for adjustment of status under section of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief nacara as of the moment he drove from the united states into mexico even if his unplanned departure was not desired and he immediately turned around and attempted to return.as a result,the ij ordered lezama to be removed as an inadmissible arriving alien.
we conclude that deeming lezama nacara application abandoned was contrary to the regulation,and ordering removal conflicted with nacara itself.we therefore grant the petition and remand for further proceedings 
background 
lezama entered the united states without inspection from nicaragua.he has remained in this country continuously since at least april other than the march incident in question here where he drove into mexico he was subject to an order of removal,having had a prior asylum application denied in absentia in.in march of however,he applied for relief under nacara a provision excusing both his prior entry without inspection and the pending order of removal to adjust his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
nacara is powerful legislation for an alien like lezama who has no criminal record.enacted in in response to the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.iirira,among other measures,nacara created a new adjustment of status process for qualified nationals of nicaragua and cuba.masnauskas gonzales,cir.
nacara mandated that the attorney general legalize the status of nicaraguan and cuban nationals unlawfully present in the united states if they had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period beginning no later than december,through the date of the application for relief applied for adjustment of status before april,were otherwise eligible to receive an immigrant visa and were otherwise admissible to the united states for permanent residence.
frech attorney,cir that is,if a nacara applicant is eligible,the status of the alien shall be adjusted by the attorney general to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.nacara a emphasis added.further,while an application is pending,a nacara applicant is entitled to a stay of removal,and a grant of work authorization.id.c.
lezama appears to have met the eligibility requirements for a relief.although not entirely clear,his application was apparently filed before april.he was physically present in the united states before december,and such presence continued uninterrupted until the date he applied.see id.b he appears to have been otherwise admissible as he had no criminal history.the legacy immigration and naturalization service ins had completed preliminary processing of his application,but lezama was awaiting an interview in.meanwhile,lezama had nacara work authorization,and the prior removal order was stayed.
on march,lezama was driving a company truck from long beach,california,to a company office in san diego he could not locate his destination,and found himself in traffic on the i freeway going toward the mexico border near san ysidro,california.as he neared the border,he was unable to locate an exit and tried to move out of traffic,but a police officer motioned for him to keep going.he drove into mexico,immediately turned around to come back to the united states,but was turned away.specifically,lezama describes the circumstances of his unplanned departure from the united states,in part,as follows 
i was not familiar with the area of san diego,having been there only once before in my life.i arrived in san diego at about a.that morning.i was on interstate highway south however,i could not locate the appropriate offramp to the company office.i continued driving south on and before i knew it i was in the area of san ysidro,california near the united border.as i got close to the border i was looking for a way to turn the truck around in order to head back north.i worked my way out of the traffic toward the side of freeway and slowed down looking for a place to stop however,there was a police officer in the area who yelled in my direction saying,let go,let go,while motioning with his hand for me to continue south.i figured that there must be a place further south on the american side of the border where i could make a uturn sic or exit in order to head back north on.so i proceeded slowly south on looking for a or an exit however,before i knew it i was in the flow of traffic being funneled through the exit to mexico,unable to stop.the next thing i knew i had unintentionally crossed the united border into mexico.
when he turned around,lezama was refused admission at the san ysidro port of entry because he lacked a valid entry document.desperate,he tried again four days later at the otay mesa port of entry,with someone else identification,and was detained.
lezama was subsequently charged in a notice to appear with being an arriving alien subject to removal under a a i i because he lacked valid entry documents when applying for admission.lezama filed a motion to terminate removal proceedings,contending he was not an arriving alien.he argued that,because he did not intend to depart the united states,he was not making an entry into the country when he returned.the ij acknowledged lezama inadvertent departure but,given the pending removal order against him,the ij denied the motion to terminate.the ij reasoned 
i f the only problem we had here was the fact that lezama left the united states inadvertently,that would be something obviously that has to be considered but the problem was there was an in absentia deportation order pending at the time that he inadvertently went across the border.and so he selfdeported himself.
a different ij later also concluded that lezama had abandoned his pending nacara application as of the moment of his departure.the ij relied on k part of nacara implementing regulations which provides in part 
unless the applicant files an advance parole request prior to departing from the united states,and the service approves such request,his or her application for adjustment of status under section of public law is deemed to be abandoned as of the moment of his or her departure.
the ij reasoned that t he regulation does not speak in terms of a n inadvertent or involuntary departure it simply declares that any alien who departs the united states without advanced parole as lezama did abandons his application for nacara adjustment.the ij was unwilling to graft onto the regulation language a voluntary departure proviso.accordingly,the ij ordered lezama removed after finding him inadmissible under a a i i.
the bia affirmed and adopted the ij decision in an unpublished,per curiam order.as for nacara,the bia reasoning in full was as follows 
we adopt and affirm the decision of the immigration judge with the following additions.see matter of burbano,i n,bia parenthetical omitted.we agree that lezama departure from the united states,while his application for adjustment of status was pending,effected the abandonment of his application for adjustment of status pursuant to nacara.see section of the act,at note see also k.thus,lezama application for adjustment of status,pursuant to the nacara,was properly denied.
lezama then filed this timely petition for review.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.standards of review 
a.we review both the ij and bia decisions 
where the bia adopts and affirms the ij decision by citing matter of burbano,it is adopting the ij decision in its entirety.see abebe gonzales,cir en banc.and where the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and law,the court review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the bia cited matter of burbano and stated that it made the following additions.it is not clear whether the bia additions refer to nacara or only to asylum,but as to nacara it appears the bia provided its own review of the evidence and the law and so we review both the ij and the bia decision.joseph holder,cir.
b.we give skidmore deference to nonprecedential bia decisions interpreting statutory provisions 
we review de novo the bia determination of questions of law,except to the extent that deference is owed to its interpretation of the governing statutes and regulations.garciaquintero gonzales,cir.we apply chevron deference to the board interpretations of ambiguous immigration statutes,if the board decision is a published decision.guevara holder,cir.where as here a bia decision interpreting a statute is unpublished and issued by a single member of the bia,it does not carry the force of law,and is accorded only skidmore swift,deference proportional to its thoroughness,reasoning,consistency,and ability to persuade.mejia hernandez holder,cir citing garcia quintero,at.
under skidmore,we defer to the bia determination only to the extent that it has power to persuade.saavedra figueroa holder,cir see also edu holder,cir reasoning that t he weight accorded to an administrative judgment in a particular case will depend upon among other factors the thoroughness evident in its consideration quoting united states mead,u,some editorial marks omitted.
c.we give substantial deference to an agency reasonable interpretations of its ambiguous regulations 
in contrast,an agency interpretation of its regulations is given substantial deference,which differs slightly from the traditional chevron deference given to agency interpretations of statutes.see,lal ins,cir because this case involves the interpretation by the bia of its own regulation and not the language of a statute we look to the line of cases including shalala guernsey memorial hospital,thomas jefferson university shalala,and bowles seminole rock sand,and not the line of cases involving interpretations by agencies of congressional legislation,including chevron natural resources defense council.
when the meaning of regulatory language is ambiguous,the agency interpretation of the regulation controls so long as it is reasonable,that is,so long as the interpretation sensibly conforms to the purpose and wording of the regulations.lal,at quoting martin occupational safety health review comm n.the court defers unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.thomas jefferson,at quoting gardebring jenkins.stated another way,agency interpretations of its ambiguous regulations are controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or there is other reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.auer robbins,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.such agency interpretations can be controlling even if advanced for the first time in a legal brief.talk.bell,citing chase bank usa,mccoy.
iii.discussion 
inadmissibility and nacara 
lezama contends that his departure on march,was unintentional,involuntary,or inadvertent.he did not plan to leave the united states,had no purpose to enter mexico,and did not want to or intend to abandon his pending nacara application.and indeed the government does not dispute the circumstances of lezama departure.rather,the question is whether his intent makes any difference.the government position as the ij and bia concluded is that lezama subjective intent is irrelevant.
lezama raises his unintentional argument in two contexts in challenging the determination that he was an inadmissible arriving alien and therefore removable,and in challenging the conclusion that he abandoned his pending nacara application for adjustment of status.he argues that because he did not intend to depart,he did not abandon his application when he drove into mexico and was not seeking entry when he turned around to come back.see generally rosenberg fleuti,reasoning that innocent,casual,and brief departures by a resident alien are unintended and do not interrupt residence so as to subject an alien to potential consequences of an entry on return.
lezama argument,however,relies on concepts of entry and voluntariness that were superceded by iirira,effective april.see,camins gonzales,cir detailing the history and application of the fleuti doctrine,and explaining how iirira abolished the doctrine,at least in part.nevertheless,the concepts are still relevant as some aspects have survived,and are important in understanding the meaning of the current legal structure.thus,before analyzing the effect,if any,of lezama intent under existing law,we briefly review the prior regime.
iirira changed the concept of entry to admission 
prior to passage of iirira,aliens coming to the united states seeking entry were subject to exclusion proceedings,whereas aliens already present in the united states were subject to deportation proceedings.see hing sum holder,cir.those physically present in the country including those having entered illegally without inspection had advantages over those seeking entry.see,landon plasencia,a deportation hearing has a number of substantive rights not available to the alien who is denied admission in an exclusion proceeding.this so called entry doctrine resulted in an anomaly.hing sum,at.n who had entered without inspection could take advantage of the greater procedural and substantive rights afforded in deportation proceedings,while who presented themselves at a port of entry for inspection were subjected to more summary exclusion proceedings.id.
the immigration and nationality act ina had defined entry as follows 
the term entry means any coming of an alien into the united states,from a foreign port or place or from an outlying possession,whether voluntarily or otherwise,except that an alien having a lawful permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as making an entry into the united states for the purposes of the immigration laws if the alien proves to the satisfaction of the attorney general that his departure to a foreign port or place or to an outlying possession was not intended or reasonably to be expected by him or his presence in a foreign port or place or in an outlying possession was not voluntary.
a repealed emphasis added.in interpreting whether a departure was intended and voluntary,fleuti held that only meaningfully interruptive departures from the united states subject a resident alien to the ina entry requirements.at.accordingly,lawful resident aliens who made an innocent,casual,and brief trip outside the united states such as what lezama appears to have made did not intend to depart,were not seeking entry into the united states,and thus were generally not subject to exclusion proceedings.
although a exception for unintended,involuntary innocent,casual,and brief departures was limited to aliens having a lawful permanent residence in the united states,we recognized that the exception could apply in other situations,where congress so provided.see aguilera medina ins,cir holding that the fleuti doctrine extends to lawful temporary residents in the special agricultural workers program on the same terms as to lawful permanent residents mendoza ins,cir barring a congressional mandate,such as b and a b,the fleuti doctrine applies only to lawful permanent resident aliens.
effective april,however,iirira replaced entry with a new concept admission.section a now uses the term admission to include a lawful entry as follows 
a the terms admission and admitted mean,with respect to an alien,the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.
c an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the united states for purposes of the immigration laws unless the alien 
i has abandoned or relinquished that status,
ii has been absent from the united states for a continuous period in excess of days,
iii has engaged in illegal activity after having departed the united states,
iv has departed from the united states while under legal process seeking removal of the alien from the united states,including removal proceedings under this chapter and extradition proceedings,
v has committed an offense identified in section a of this title,unless since such offense the alien has been granted relief under section h or a of this title,or 
vi is attempting to enter at a time or place other than as designated by immigration officers or has not been admitted to the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.
congress eliminated the key terms entry and intended from a and replaced the former statute with a comprehensive scheme for determining the classification of returning aliens.camins,at quoting tineo ashcroft,cir.eliminating entry and intended which formed the central basis for the reasoning in fleuti also effectively abrogated the fleuti doctrine at least in the admissibility context.id.at citing matter of collado munoz,bia en banc.the new a is a complete makeover of a specifically intended to supplant the subjective intent inquiry that was a feature of the old law.id.at quoting tineo,at.iirira also replaced deportation and exclusion proceedings with more general removal proceedings.hing sum,at.in short,admission now determines whether a is subject to grounds of deportability or inadmissibility within the context of a removal proceeding.id.
notably,iirira replaced fleuti subjective intent standard for lawful permanent residents with an objective day period of allowed absence from the united states,regardless of intent.see a c ii.the final version of a pays homage to fleuti by presumptively treating all trips abroad lasting days or fewer as inconsequential to permanent resident status.tineo,at.it fully recognizes the increase in travel and the notion that innocent,casual,and brief trips abroad should not interrupt an alien permanent residency.id.although generally abrogated,an aspect of fleuti is preserved.id.
congress amended section a of the ina simply to eliminate that aspect of the entry doctrine that permitted aliens who had entered without inspection to have greater procedural and substantive rights in deportation proceedings than those who had presented themselves for inspection at a port of entry and had been placed in exclusion proceedings.in re quilantan,bia citations omitted.this intent is evident in the meaning of the term lawful entry in a a defining admission and admitted to mean the lawful entry of the alien into the united states.lawful entry refers to an entry involving inspection and admission by an immigration officer,as opposed to those unlawful entries involving actual and intentional evasion of inspection at the nearest inspection point.hing sum,at quoting matter of pierre.
iirira,then,was directed in part at aliens like lezama who had entered the united states without inspection.after iirira,if such aliens depart and attempt to reenter,they will be arriving aliens and will be inadmissible.
here enters the importance of nacara for certain aliens,nacara essentially gave back some of what iirira took away.
applicants for adjustment of status under nacara 
congress enacted nacara in to ameliorate some of the harsher effects of iirira for nationals of certain countries primarily nicaragua and cuba.masnauskas,at.
nacara was intended to favor aliens who had taken unusual risks in escaping from oppressive governments or whose countries had been ravaged by war.the enactment of nacara was a rational diplomatic decision to encourage such aliens to remain in the united states.nicaraguan aliens were a particular concern of congress because of united states involvement in the civil war in nicaragua,the large number of nicaraguan in the,and a history of special programs for nicaraguan aliens under the carter and reagan administrations.
id.at citations omitted.as explained by one of its sponsors,
nacara incorporates an agreement between house and senate negotiators to correct provisions in last year immigration law iirira.these provisions would have had the effect of changing the rules in the middle of the game for thousands of central americans and others who came to the united states because their lives and families had been torn apart by war and oppression and are seeking permanent residency here.
nicaraguans who were in the united states prior to january,will be permitted to adjust to permanent residence and get green cards if they have maintained a continuous presence here.the same right will be extended to their nicaraguan spouses and children.
cong.rec.daily ed,statement of abraham,available at wl senators explained that 
the purpose of this act is to ensure that nationals of certain specified countries are accorded a fair and equitable opportunity to demonstrate that,under the legal standards established by this act,they should be permitted to remain,and pursue permanent resident status,in the united states.
in recognition of the hardship that those eligible for relief suffered in fleeing their homelands the congress directs the department of justice and the immigration and naturalization service to adjudicate applications for relief under this act expeditiously and humanely.
cong.rec.daily ed,explanatory memorandum regarding nacara submitted by senators mack,graham,abraham,kennedy,and durbin,available at wl.
nacara grants similarly situated immigrants from cuba and nicaragua the opportunity to become lawful permanent residents independent of the attorney general favorable discretion.eli coffino,long road to residency the legal history of salvadoran guatemalan immigration to the united states with a focus on nacara,cardozo int l comp,emphasis added.section of nacara is as close to a free pass for american residence as the ins grants.id.at citing patrick caldwell,nacara minotaur or midas,smu.
with this intent,congress promulgated nacara.as summarized earlier,a provides that aliens who applied before april,had maintained a continuous physical presence in the united states before applying,and were otherwise admissible,shall have their status adjusted to a lawful permanent resident.section a specifically excuses some statutory grounds of inadmissibility,stating that in determining admissibility the grounds for inadmissibility specified in a,a,a,and b shall not apply.one of these excused grounds is a a including aliens like lezama who had entered without inspection.in effect,then,nacara reinstated an aspect of the entry doctrine for eligible aliens.
nacara also partially codified another aspect of the fleuti doctrine.just as iirira in a c ii pays homage to fleuti by presumptively treating all trips abroad lasting days or fewer as inconsequential to permanent resident status,tineo,at,nacara also pays homage to fleuti by allowing an alien up to days outside the country prior to applying,while still having maintained the necessary continuous physical presence to qualify to seek relief.in this regard,b provides 
aliens eligible for adjustment of status.
in general.the benefits provided by subsection a of this note shall apply to any alien who is a national of nicaragua or cuba and who has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period,beginning not later than december,and ending not earlier than the date the application for adjustment under such subsection is filed,except an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence by reason of an absence,or absences,from the united states for any periods in the aggregate not exceeding days.
emphasis added.
and,as stated above,nacara c authorizes a stay of any pending removal order 
in general.the attorney general shall provide by regulation for an alien subject to a final order of deportation or removal to seek a stay of such order based on the filing of an application under subsection a of this note.
during certain proceedings.notwithstanding any provision of the immigration and nationality act et,the attorney general shall not order any alien to be removed from the united states,if the alien is in exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings under any provision of such act and has applied for adjustment of status under subsection a of this note,except where the attorney general has rendered a final administrative determination to deny the application.
that is,if an application is pending,the attorney shall not order any alien to be removed.nacara c.
with these principles established,we now examine whether lezama abandoned his nacara application for adjustment of status when he drove into mexico.
abandonment and k 
the ij reading is inconsistent with the regulation plain language and context 
the ij concluded that lezama abandoned his application as of the moment he departed the united states without seeking prior permission in the form of advance parole.the applicable regulation,k,provides in full 
k parole authorization for purposes of travel 
travel from and return to the united states while the application for adjustment of status is pending.if an applicant for benefits under section of.desires to travel outside,and return to,the united states while the application for adjustment of status is pending,he or she must file a request for advance parole authorization on an application for travel document form i,with fee as set forth in b of this chapter and in accordance with the instructions on the form.if the alien is either in deportation or removal proceedings,or subject to a final order of deportation or removal,the form i must be submitted to the assistant commissioner for international affairs otherwise the form i must be submitted to the director of the texas service center,who shall have jurisdiction over such applications.unless the applicant files an advance parole request prior to departing from the united states,and the service approves such request,his or her application for adjustment of status under section of public law is deemed to be abandoned as of the moment of his or her departure.parole may only be authorized pursuant to the authority contained in,and the standards prescribed in,section d of the act d regarding parole into the united states for humanitarian reasons.
id.emphases added.
in deeming lezama application abandoned,the ij relied specifically on the emphasized third sentence of the regulation unless the applicant files an advance parole request prior to departing from the united states his or her application is deemed to be abandoned as of the moment of his or her departure.the bia per curiam order simply agreed with the ij on this point,with no further analysis.
this reading,however,ignores the first sentence of the regulation,and as a result fails to read the entire regulation in context section k begins with a clear limitation i f a nacara applicant desires to travel outside,and return to,the united states emphasis added.read in context,the rest of the regulation is likewise limited to and applies only if an applicant fails to obtain advance parole and that applicant had desired to travel outside and return to the united states.the regulation requires prior approval if an applicant plans to travel outside the united states but one can not gain prior approval for an accident.
the regulation as a whole simply does not address the situation where a nacara applicant never desired to,never planned to or intended to or had a purpose to travel outside the united states.as a result,the consequence of failing to obtain advance parole abandonment does not apply to an undesired or inadvertent departure.effectively,abandonment occurs only for a desired departure absent advance parole.
in their decisions,neither the ij nor the bia mentions the conditional limiting language.the ij relied exclusively on the third sentence of the regulation without considering the overriding limitation.but the regulation must be read as a whole.by ignoring the desired requirement,the ij necessarily misinterpreted the meaning of the regulation third sentence.singh holder,cir en banc reasoning that the third clause of the statute at issue was linked by its language and context directly to the first clause.thus,the bia and ij interpretation of k was unreasonable and does not sensibly conform to the purpose and wording of the regulation.lal,at.it is unreasonable to deem a nacara application abandoned for failing to do something obtain advance parole that an applicant could not have done because the departure was unplanned.our reading that abandonment for lack of advance parole does not apply if travel was not desired is compelled by the regulation plain language.id.
although the bia may have provided its own review of the regulation,joseph,at,we give its decision no deference under auer.its per curiam order was decided under e by a.such a decision is not precedential.see garcia quintero,at a case must be decided by a panel if it presents t he need to establish a precedent construing the meaning of laws,regulations,or procedures.citing e ii.garcia quintero analyzed what deference we give to such a bia decision interpreting a statutory provision,and concluded such decisions are accorded only skidmore deference in proportion to their power to persuade.id.at.for a similar reason,the bia decision here is entitled to no deference under auer as an agency interpretation of a regulation.the nature of this,bia order one that does not explain its reasoning does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.at.see joseph holder,cir applying auer,reasoning in part that an interpretation in a,bia decision was inconsistent with the plain language of a regulation 
we also owe the government interpretation no deference under chase bank usa.at indicating that a court defers to an agency interpretation of its own regulation,even if only advanced in a legal brief,unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation quoting auer,at.the government,like the bia and ij below,did not address the limiting language desired in k.and its argument like the ij decision that the third sentence in the regulation plainly deems any departure without advance parole to be an abandonment improperly isolates the sentence untethered from its context.it is therefore plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at.
our reading is consistent with other provisions 
our reading limiting abandonment to desired departures is bolstered by,and completely consistent with,other aspects of the statute and its regulations.
when promulgating nacara regulations,specifically addressed the possibility of travel outside the united states while an application was pending.in so doing,did not state that any unapproved absence would automatically result in abandonment.the interim rules contain the following commentary 
can an applicant travel outside the united states while the application is pending 
nothing in nacara authorizes the service to allow an applicant to the united states without proper documents.if an applicant plans to leave the united states to go to any other country,including canada or mexico,before a decision is made on his or her nacara adjustment application,the applicant should contact the service to request advance authorization for parole.if an applicant leaves the united states without such advance authorization,action on his or her nacara adjustment application may be terminated and the application may be denied.an applicant may also experience difficulty when returning to the united states if he or she does not have such advance authorization.furthermore,any absence from the united states without an advance parole authorization issued prior to departure counts toward the day aggregate time period that the applicant is allowed to be outside the united states.
may,emphases added,available at wl.the commentary speaks in terms of a planned departure and only states that an application may be terminated not will be terminated if an applicant does not obtain advanced parole.more importantly,an application survives a departure,although the time counts towards the day limit any absence from the united states without an advance parole authorization issued prior to departure counts toward the day aggregate time period that the applicant is allowed to be outside the united states.if an unauthorized departure was intended to result in an automatic abandonment of a nacara application,then such a departure could not count towards the day limit.there is no per se abandonment in the regulation.
moreover,nacara itself contemplates departures,and allows up to days outside the united states prior to applying without interrupting the continuous physical presence in the country necessary to qualify for nacara relief.see nacara b.thus,although there is no basis for resurrecting fleuti innocent,casual,and brief exception,our reading is nevertheless consistent with congress recognition that some departures from the country should have no immigration consequences.
and indeed,b corresponding regulation a does not even limit the statutory days of excused absences to the period before applying.section a states that a national of nicaragua or cuba is eligible to apply for adjustment of status under nacara if the alien 
has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period beginning not later than december,and ending not earlier than the date the application for adjustment is granted,excluding a ny periods of absence from the united states not exceeding days in the aggregate.
emphasis added.section a thus recognizes that an alien should also not interrupt a continuous physical presence in the united states after applying,and while the application is pending.it includes within the day statutory period any absences up until the application is actually adjudicated.according to its,this regulation clarifies that all absences between the last,date on which the applicant commenced physical presence and the date on which the application is approved count toward the day maximum,emphasis added.the regulation thus contemplates departures while an application is pending that do not cause abandonment of the application.
last,our reading of k is also consistent with congress express intent to encourage eligible aliens to remain in the united states,because of a special diplomatic concern for nicaraguans who arrived before december.masnauskas,at.our reading supports nacara purpose that nicaraguans who were in the united states prior to january,will be permitted to adjust to permanent residence and get green cards if they have maintained a continuous presence here.cong.rec.at.our reading helps to ensure that nationals of covered countries are accorded a fair and equitable opportunity to demonstrate that,under the legal standards established by nacara,they should be permitted to remain,and pursue permanent resident status,in the united states.cong.rec.at.
other abandonment situations are distinguishable 
the government,however,points to analogous situations in immigration law where pending applications for relief are abandoned upon departure from the united states,regardless of intent.see aguilera ruiz ashcroft,cir upholding,which deems a departure from the united states of a person subject to deportation proceedings while an appeal challenging that deportation is pending to constitute an automatic withdrawal of the appeal,and rejecting a exception for brief,casual,and innocent departures long gonzales,cir same.but see madrigal holder,cir holding that forcible removal does not render an appeal automatically withdrawn under.
but these situations are distinguishable they did not apply a regulation like k,which limits abandonment to travel that is desired.see aguilera ruiz,at concluding that u nder,any voluntary departure from the united states following entry of an order of deportation will be deemed to withdraw a pending appeal.see also d deeming a pending motion to reopen withdrawn upon any departure and a ii the departure from the united states of an applicant who is under exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings shall be deemed an abandonment of the adjustment of status application.emphasis added.
could have chosen not to use the conditional limiting phrase if an applicant desires to travel in k.the fact that they did must be given some meaning.kucana.at w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting nken holder,rodriguez barajas,at vacating bia decision that found a voluntary departure effected a withdrawal of a pending habeas petition,reasoning in part that the presence of limiting language in stood in contrast to broad language any departure in d.
it is undisputed that lezama departure was not desired 
the government contends that the ij did not decide whether an unintentional departure actually took place.it argues that,if we somehow read into the regulation that an unintentional or mistaken departure does not constitute abandonment then we must remand pursuant to ins ventura.
in proceedings before the ij,however,the government did not dispute lezama factual testimony as set forth in his translated declaration regarding how he inadvertently drove into mexico.his testimony establishes that he attempted to avoid crossing the border,but was directed by a police officer to continue south,only to be caught in the flow of traffic and funneled into mexico and to be then excluded when he attempted to reenter.the government accepted those facts before the ij,and instead argued that lezama intent was irrelevant to the abandonment of his nacara application.
it is well established that if a party fails to raise an objection to an issue before judgment,he or she waives the right to challenge the issue on appeal.slaven am.trading transp.co,cir.because the government failed to challenge the factual circumstances of lezama departure,remand is not warranted.see,mashiri ashcroft,cir concluding that remand was unnecessary where government failed to submit evidence challenging factual question baballah ashcroft,cir declining to remand where ins failed to present evidence of changed country conditions and did not argue the point before the ij or the bia.it is therefore undisputed that lezama did not desire to travel outside the united states.given our analysis of the plain meaning of the regulation,we hold that lezama did not abandon his nacara application to adjust status the application remains pending.
inconsistency with nacara lezama can not be removed 
having established that lezama nacara application was not abandoned,it follows that the ij should not have ordered him removed.nacara c unambiguously provides that 
n otwithstanding any provision of the immigration and nationality act,the attorney general shall not order any alien to be removed from the united states,if the alien is in exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings under any provision of such act and has applied for adjustment of status under subsection a of this note,except where the attorney general has rendered a final administrative determination to deny the application.
and,as noted above,recognized that under c,an applicant who is in removal proceedings may not be ordered removed unless and until the application for adjustment is denied.at.the alien does not need to file any request,motion,or other form beyond the application for adjustment itself in order to benefit from this automatic provision.id.
in short,the attorney general shall not order any alien to be removed until he has decided the application.by ordering lezama removed under a a i i and given that his nacara application is still pending the ij violated nacara.the ij order of removal is therefore manifestly contrary to the statute.mead,at citing chevron,at.
even if lezama was an inadmissible arriving alien,he was nevertheless eligible to seek adjustment of status under nacara 
the ij determined that when lezama left the united states on march,he had executed his outstanding removal order he self deported and was therefore an inadmissible arriving alien subject to removal when he attempted to reenter the country.we now address what effect our conclusion that lezama has not abandoned his nacara application has on that determination.
lezama exact status presents a chicken or egg conundrum.even if he did not abandon his nacara application,he did exit the country.that is,the question still remains whether lezama.ultimately,however,we need not resolve lezama exact status whether an arriving alien or not because even if he was an arriving alien and was inadmissible,he remains eligible to adjust his status under nacara 
admissibility is determined under.section a,defining classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admission,states that e xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter,aliens who are inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the united states.but a includes several grounds of inadmissibility that nacara a b specifically excuses including aliens who were present without admission or parole,that had previously entered without inspection,as set forth in a a,or who lacked valid travel documents when applying for admission,as set forth in a a i.
the opening clause except as otherwise provided is a savings clause,recognizing that congress reserved the right to specifically allow admission of otherwise inadmissible aliens.nacara is such legislation.see renteria ledesma holder,cir citing nacara as a specific example of where congress has otherwise provided to extend eligibility for adjustment of status to inadmissible aliens,as recognized in in re briones,bia padilla caldera holder,cir same accord garfias rodriguez holder,cir following briones,and recognizing that congress may extend eligibility for adjustment of status to inadmissible aliens if done so unambiguously.
that is,even where an alien is deemed to be an arriving alien and inadmissible,the alien may still be eligible to adjust status.see bona gonzales,cir invalidating a regulation that rendered an arriving alien placed in removal proceedings ineligible for adjustment of status,where congress had specifically allowed the aliens to adjust status if they met other qualifications succar ashcroft,cir same.that an alien has departed is not necessarily fatal to the consideration of a pending application to adjust status.see marin rodriguez holder,cir holding that an alien departure,which constituted a withdrawal of a motion,does not deprive the bia of jurisdiction to reconsider that decision reconsideration does not depend on an alien presence in the country coyt holder,cir holding the same,reasoning that in passing iirira,congress anticipated that petitioners would be able to pursue relief after departing from the united states.indeed,the supreme court has stated that a liens who are removed may continue to pursue their petitions for review,and those who prevail can be afforded effective relief by facilitation of their return,along with restoration of the immigration status they had upon removal.nken.at.
accordingly,even assuming lezama was an arriving alien who was inadmissible under either a a or a a i,he remains eligible to apply for adjustment of status under nacara.
iv.conclusion 
this case is a prime example that t he maze of immigration statutes and amendments is notoriously complicated and has been described as second only to the internal revenue code in complexity.singh gonzales,cir citation omitted.nonetheless,we assume that congress is familiar with the intricacies of the overlapping laws and that it meant what it said,when it promulgated nacara.
because lezama departure was not desired,his nacara application was not abandoned under k.his application remains pending.under nacara c,while his application remains pending,he is not removable.and even if his departure rendered him an arriving alien,he remains eligible for adjustment of status.accordingly,we grant the petition and remand to allow the government to rule on the pending application to adjust status under nacara.
petition granted.
i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion for the following four reasons,which i discuss in greater detail below 
the majority opinion relies on an argument and analysis that has never been advanced by the petitioner.
the majority opinion gives absolutely no deference to the agency interpretation of its regulation.
the majority opinion relies on prefatory language in the regulation and ignores the substance of the regulation.
the majority opinion usurps the agency authority by granting the petition without giving the agency the opportunity to apply the majority novel interpretation of the regulation.
our precedent has consistently reinforced the premise that we do not address issues that are not raised in a petitioner opening brief.see fence creek cattle usfs,cir see also onda locke,cir.in his brief to this court,the petitioner argued in two and pages that he did not leave the country intentionally or voluntarily.petitioner opening brief.he essentially sought to equate the circumstances of his departure to a forced departure.see id.never once did the petitioner cite to the prefatory language of the regulation that has been seized upon by the majority to make an argument that the petitioner never made.see id.the majority stark departure from our precedent seriously calls into question the legitimacy of the majority holding.
the majority departure from our precedent is compounded by the fact that the opinion gives absolutely no deference to the agency interpretation of its regulation.the majority opinion dutifully acknowledges our obligation to defer to the agency interpretation of its regulation,including those interpretations articulated in litigation briefs.see majority opinion.the majority opinion even concedes that deference is required unless an alternative reading is compelled.id.at citation omitted emphasis added.yet,the majority opinion says one thing and does another.
as the majority opinion details,the immigration judge ij relied upon the language of k,which provides in pertinent part that u nless the applicant files an advance parole request prior to departing from the united states,and the service approves such request,his or her application for adjustment of status is deemed to be abandoned as of the moment of his or her departure the majority opinion also recognizes that the board of immigration appeals adopted the ij reliance on the regulation.see majority opinion.this same analysis is reflected in the brief filed on behalf of the agency.see brief for respondent.
the ij,bia and department of justice all relied on the seismic shift reflected in congress enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira.prior to the enactment of iirira,continued eligibility for adjustment of status often depended on whether the alien intentionally departed the united states.see a repealed excluding from the definition of entry a return to the united states if the prior departure was not intended or voluntary.this statutory provision spawned a litany of cases addressing whether a particular departure was intended or voluntary.see,rosenberg fleuti,describing the judicial evolution of the definition of entry.however,following the enactment of iirira and the repeal of a,intent of the departing alien became irrelevant.see,camins gonazles,cir recognizing that the changes in iirira were consistent with a complete makeover of specifically intended to supplant the subjective intent inquiry that was a feature of the old law quoting tineo ashcroft,cir.
in camins,we also deferred to an en banc decision of the bia that specifically interpreted iirira as abrogating the intent inquiry that was central to the determination of entry.see id.at deferring to the bia interpretation of iirira as explicated in matter of collado munoz,i n,bia en banc.
the majority completely ignores the prior deference we have given to the bia holding that the intent of the departing alien is not relevant.instead,the majority opinion seizes upon prefatory language in iirira that has never been interpreted by the bia in conjunction with a petitioner admissibility.see majority opinion,emphasizing the first sentence of k and focusing on whether the petitioner desired to depart the united states.the majority focus returns to the intent analysis that was eliminated by iirira,although purporting to base its analysis on the context of the statutory
