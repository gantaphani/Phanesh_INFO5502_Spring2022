francisco alvarez appeals his conviction of being a deported alien found in the united states in violation of.alvarez contends that his prosecution violated the speedy trial act sta because the permitted period was exceeded.
the material facts are largely undisputed.alvarez was arrested on may.on may,he was charged in a complaint with a violation of.the parties immediately began to discuss a disposition,apparently intending to proceed under the district procedure.alvarez waived his right to indictment,the government filed an information,and alvarez entered a plea of not guilty.alvarez filed a written notification of his intent to plead guilty,and the court scheduled a change of plea hearing.sometime between june and june alvarez decided not to change his plea to guilty.in response,on june,the government filed an indictment obtained from the grand jury charging alvarez with violations of,in a separate proceeding with a separate case number.the change of plea hearing was vacated on july,and the information in the previous case remained pending.alvarez was arraigned on the indictment on july,and at that time,the information was dismissed without prejudice at the government request.
on august,alvarez gave a second notice of intent to change his plea,and a hearing was scheduled for the following day,august.at the hearing alvarez again changed his mind and informed the court that he did not want to plead guilty.a status conference was set for august,to determine whether alvarez wished to file motions.at that hearing the district court,relying on the july,arraignment to trigger the sta clock,specified september,days after july as the last day for trial under the sta.alvarez did not object to this date.on september,alvarez began to file his pretrial motions.the parties agree that all time between september,and when alvarez was tried on january,was properly excluded.

discussion 
the government argues that the sta clock began to run on july,when alvarez was arraigned on the indictment.if so,days accrued on september,and trial was timely.in contrast,alvarez argues that the sta clock began to run on june.by this automatically excluding the date of the indictment,arraignment,and the two days devoted to alvarez second notice of his intent to plead a period of days accrued on september,and the sta was violated.
the speedy trial act,c,provides,in relevant part 
in any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered,the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date and making public of the information or indictment,or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending,whichever date last occurs.
in this case,alvarez made his first appearance on the complaint on may,and the information was filed on june.under the plain language of the sta,june,is the trigger date.see haiges,at.the government contends,however,that the indictment,not the information,is the relevant charging document.it further argues that the indictment did not become the pending charge for sta purposes until july,when the information,which had been the relevant charging document up to that point,was dismissed.see c.
but here there is only one charge alvarez was charged in a complaint with a violation of,he waived his right to an indictment and pleaded not guilty to an information charging the same violation of.when alvarez declined to change his plea to guilty,the government obtained an indictment charging him with the same violation of.the government does not contend that alvarez made multiple illegal entries into this country that were separately charged,nor did it add new claims or join new defendants.
nor do we see any reason to assign any significance to the fact that the earlier information and the subsequent indictment were assigned different case numbers.to credit the government argument would be to elevate form over substance and violate the clear intent of congress.were we to uphold the government theory,the government in every case could extend the sta time limits by indicting,dismissing,and reindicting under new case numbers.thus,june,the date the information was filed,is the trigger date for the sta.
the formal dismissal of the information and subsequent filing of an indictment on the same charge do not suggest otherwise.the sta treats informations and indictments as equivalents.see,b information or indictment id.c same id.d indictment or information.thus,the subsequent indictment was akin to a superseding indictment or a,depending on whether the indictment was filed before or after the information was dismissed.this distinction is meaningless here,however,because either a or superseding indictment would inherit the previous sta clock.see united states duque,cir after government dismisses initial indictment does not restart sta clock united states karsseboom,cir superseding indictment charging same offenses does not restart sta clock.accordingly,the filing of the indictment on the same charge did not start a new clock for the purposes of the sta.
for practical purposes,however,we can consider june,to be the trigger date,as alvarez concedes that any time devoted to the proceedings before june is properly excluded.although,in general,time devoted to plea negotiations is not automatically excluded,see united states,cir other circuits have found the situation to be different where the defendant notifies the court that negotiations have resulted in an agreement and,as a result,the court sets a change of plea hearing.see united states rector,cir see also united states,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states barnes,cir jenkins,at.in that situation,the time until the hearing is held to be excluded either under h g because it is delay resulting from consideration by the court of a proposed plea agreement or under h d as a pretrial motion.we therefore treat june as the effective start date.see united states medina,f d,cir discussing exclusion of time where a pretrial motion requires a hearing.
the government reasons,in the alternative,that even if june triggered the sta clock,all of the time devoted to the information before its dismissal on july constituted other proceedings concerning the defendant and was properly excluded for purposes of the sta.see h.the government relies on united states,cir,and united states,cir,arguing that these cases are factually indistinguishable from the instant case.in both cases,the defendant initially was charged in a complaint with a violation of.within the days allowed for the filing of an indictment,each of the defendants waived indictment and agreed to proceed by information,and,in exchange,prosecutors agreed to pursue less serious charges under.the defendants indicated they would plead not guilty while the parties completed plea negotiations under a procedure.each defendant subsequently changed his mind and declined to plead guilty.in each case,the government then substituted an indictment charging the defendants with violations of.however,in each case the government did not obtain the indictment within the time period allotted by the sta.b.nevertheless,we determined that a significant portion of the intervening time was excludable as delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant under h.see,at,at.in light of the different sets of charges under different sections,all time was excludable after the defendants waived indictment so long as the information was pending.the government urges us to adopt this same reasoning in the present case.
we decline to do so.in and,the defendants were initially charged by information with a violation of,a different charge than,although the two sections are related.in each case,once the defendant informed the court he did not want to plead guilty to the information,the government abandoned the charge alleged in the information although th
