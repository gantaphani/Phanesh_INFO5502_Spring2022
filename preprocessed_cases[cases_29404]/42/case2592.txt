khalid,a native of pakistan,applied to the former immigration and naturalization service ins for an adjustment of status based on his marriage to a naturalized united states citizen.without fully adjudicating application,the ins reinstated a prior deportation order and directed that be removed.timely appealed this final order of removal.we now reverse and remand for further proceedings.
backgrounda.facts 
first attempted to enter the united states in march he used a false passport bearing the name rahimatullah qamarden.was placed in exclusion proceedings and was ordered excluded pursuant to,as an alien who had attempted to enter the united states by fraud.he was removed from the united states on may.according to the law in effect at the time,was not permitted to reenter the united states for a period of one year.
reentered the united states on june,as a visitor he used the alias jaffar rajan.the following year,married tabassum.at some point prior to institution of the present removal proceedings,became a naturalized united states citizen.
on february,after congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira but before iirira april,effective date,filed an application for adjustment of status with the chicago office of the ins.included in his submissions were a form application for adjustment of status,a form petition for alien relative signed by,and also a form petition for waiver of inadmissibility.it was necessary for to file this last form because his prior fraudulent conduct rendered him ineligible for adjustment of status absent a waiver.see a c i a.
the ins district director denied waiver petition on the ground that had failed to establish that extreme hardship would be imposed on a qualifying relative.appealed this decision to the administrative appeals office aao of the ins.
the aao rejected appeal,ordered the district director decision withdrawn and remanded the case to the district director for further proceedings.the aao noted that iirira had increased the waiting period for applying for from one year to five years.because reentered the united states less than five years after his initial exclusion,he was required to seek permission to reenter from the attorney general.furthermore,although his failure to seek permission was waivable,had not sought such a waiver form,and this waiver must be adjudicated prior to any consideration of form.
in compliance with this directive,filed an waiver in february.one year later,the district director denied form waiver application on the ground that had shown a blatant disregard for the immigration laws and had attempted to defraud the united states government.
the day following the district director denial of waiver,the ins issued,pursuant to a a form notice of intent to reinstate a prior order of deportation,specifically the order that resulted in may,departure from the united states.the form advised of his right to make a written or oral statement,which refused.also refused to sign the form.the ins then reinstated the prior order.this petition for review followed.
discussion 
sole argument on appeal is that iirira reinstatement provision,a,which became effective on april,may not be applied retroactively to aliens who reentered the united states and applied for discretionary relief prior to iirira effective date.the retroactivity of a statutory provision is a question of law that we review de novo.see arevalo ashcroft,cir.
landgraf analysis 
to determine whether a particular provision of a retroactive,we must follow the guidelines set forth by the supreme court in landgraf usi film products,d.landgraf established a inquiry to determine whether a statute is retroactive.first,the court must discern whether congress has spoken to whether the statute should have retroactive effect in answering this question,courts should employ the customary rules of statutory construction,assaying the language of the statute itself and then considering its structure and purpose.arevalo,at citing lindh murphy,d.if the statute is silent regarding whether a specific provision is retroactive,the court next must consider whether retroactive application of the statute would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,would increase a party liability for past conduct,or would impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.landgraf,at.
landgraf first inquiry 
with respect to a,maintains that congress did not intend for the provision to apply to conduct that occurred prior to the passage or effective date of iirira.his argument tracks closely the reasoning of the ninth and sixth circuits in ins,cir,and bejjani ins,cir,respectively.consequently,we look first to these cases to inform our discussion.
in,the ninth circuit identified three in the statutory evidenced congress clear intent that a should not be applied retroactively to aliens whose reentry occurred prior to its enactment,at.first,the ninth circuit noted,w hen congress in rewrote the provision and codified it at ina a,rather than modifying the retroactivity language to specify the effective date of iirira,or even simply leaving the retroactivity language as it was it did the opposite.it eliminated the retroactivity language completely.id the ninth circuit believed that the decision to remove the retroactivity language from this part of the statute provide d strong support for the conclusion that congress did not intend that the revised provision be applied to reentries occurring before the date of the statute enactment.id.the ninth circuit second reason for concluding that a should not be applied retroactively was that,in several other sections of iirira,congress explicitly indicated that those sections would apply to conduct that congress failed to do so with respect to a supports the view,by negative implication,that a does not retroactively apply to aliens who reentered after iirira was enacted.id.finally,the ninth circuit noted that congressional silence is instructive.id.at.because congress is deemed to enact legislation with landgraf default rule in mind,silence provides useful evidence as to intent for the first step of landgraf inquiry.id.according to the ninth circuit,these statutory congress clear intent that a should not be applied retroactively 
in reaching the same conclusion,the sixth circuit not only relied upon some of the reasons articulated above,it also was influenced by the fact that,in enacting iirira,congress considered and rejected new language which would have applied the new reinstatement provision to illegal reentries which occurred before the date of enactment.bejjani,at.it concluded 
congress is presumed to be familiar with the judicial presumption against retroactive application,and thus congress must explicitly provide for such.in the case of the ina reinstatement provision,congress eliminated retroactive language from the prior version,rejected a proposed version of the reinstatement provision which included retroactive language,and expressly provided the temporal scope for several provisions within title iii.viewed in light of the presumption against retroactivity,congress clearly did not intend for a to be applied to reentries which occurred prior to its effective date.
however,with the exception of the ninth and sixth circuits,every other circuit that has considered the retroactivity of a has held that there is no clear indication of congress intent regarding the provision retroactive effect.see sarmiento cisneros united states attorney general,cir arevalo,ashcroft,cir ashcroft,cir ashcroft,cir crocetti,cir.indeed,evaluating the same statutory arguments presented to,and accepted by,the sixth and ninth circuits,the third circuit has concluded that w hat is clear is that congress intent with regard to the temporal reach of section a of iirira is not clear,at emphasis in original.for instance,with respect to the lack of retroactivity language in a compared to its predecessor,f repealed,the eleventh circuit has held that,although this absence lends some weight to the argument that a should not be applied retroactively,the silence with which the retroactivity language was replaced does not come close to being a clear statement of congressional intent.sarmiento cisneros,at see also,at holding that the omission of retroactivity language does not constitute an express mandate regarding the statute temporal reach.
other circuits similarly have rejected the negative implication argument accepted by the ninth circuit.according to the third circuit,t he negative implication argument fails because iirira also contains sections in which congress specified that the section did not apply to conduct,at see also arevalo,at the problem is that many other sections of the iirira unequivocally state that they will apply only prospectively thus,the negative implication argument could just as easily run the other direction.
finally,other courts have not found compelling the argument that,because congress enacts legislation with the landgraf rule in mind,where it is silent it can be presumed that it did not intend for it to be applied retrospectively,at.the third circuit explained that t his argument fails as well because it could just as easily be argued that congress remained silent in the expectation that courts would proceed to the second step of the landgraf analysis,determine whether the provision would have a retroactive effect and,if it did,only then decline to apply it retrospectively.see also sarmiento cisneros,at quoting same.
there is no question that some statutory evidence points to the conclusion reached by the ninth and sixth circuits that congress may not have desired a to be applied retroactively.however,we do not believe that this evidence is sufficient to meet the first prong of the landgraf test.the supreme court has explained that t he standard for finding such unambiguous direction is a demanding one.c ases where this court has found truly retroactive effect adequately authorized by statute have involved statutory language that was so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.ins cyr,d quoting lindh,at.there is no clear indication in the statutory language that reveals whether congress intended to apply retroactively,much less evidence so clear as to lead to only one conclusion with respect to congressional intent as to the retroactivity of a.
as the majority of the circuits have noted,there are valid arguments on both sides of the retroactivity issue.we believe that the majority of circuits have taken the approach most consistent with the supreme court view.we therefore hold that congress did not evidence a clear intent with respect to whether a should be applied retroactively to those who had reentered the country and had applied for discretionary relief prior to iirira effective date.we therefore must proceed to the second step of the landgraf analysis.
landgraf second inquiry 
in the second step of the landgraf analysis,this court must 
assess whether the operation of section a in the instant case would impose new burdens or attach new legal consequences to the petitioner illegal reentry her pending application for adjustment of status.this assessment depends on whether execution of the reinstatement order takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability to the petitioner actions in a way that offends the fundamental principles of fair notice and reasonable expectation.
arevalo,at quoting landgraf,at.
the supreme court recently had occasion to apply the second part of the landgraf test to a provision of iirira in ins cyr,d.at issue in cyr was the retroactivity of iirira bar to discretionary relief for those who had been convicted of certain crimes.the prior statute did not impose a bar based on the type of crime alone,but also on the length of sentence it barred discretionary relief only to individuals who had committed an aggravated felony and served a term of at least five years.prior to the enactment of iirira,cyr had pleaded guilty to a crime.later,when deportation proceedings were instituted against cyr,the attorney general claimed that discretionary relief was not available to the petitioner because he had been convicted of a crime for which iirira barred discretionary relief.the supreme court held that this provision of iirira could not be applied retroactively to the petitioner 
iirira elimination of any possibility of c relief for people who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for such relief clearly attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.landgraf,at.plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government given the frequency with which c relief was granted in the years leading up to aedpa and iirira,preserving the possibility of such relief would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer instead of proceed to trial.
id.at.citations and footnotes omitted.furthermore,the court noted that 
the fact that c relief is discretionary does not affect the propriety of our conclusion.there is a clear difference,for the purposes of retroactivity analysis,between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation.prior to aedpa and iirira,aliens like cyr had a significant likelihood of receiving c relief.because respondent,and other aliens like him,almost certainly relied upon that likelihood in deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial,the elimination of any possibility of c relief by iirira has an obvious and serious retroactive effect.
id.at.emphasis added citations and footnotes omitted.
courts of appeals considering whether a has an impermissible retroactive effect have looked to cyr for guidance.their analyses are instructive.
in,the petitioner reentered the country illegally and married a united states citizen in february.in november,after iirira passage september,and effective date april,he applied for an adjustment of status based on his marriage to a united states citizen.the fourth circuit,relying on cyr,rejected the petitioner claim that iirira bar to discretionary relief should not be applied to him because he reentered the country and married his wife prior to iirira enactment 
ultimately,case differs critically from cyr has shown neither a reasonable likelihood of success under law nor a detrimental reliance on law sole reliance argument is that he and his wife relied to their detriment on petitioner ability to adjust status in the united states when they were married,and may have chosen not to get married but proceed on a fiancee visa or may not have married at all.brief of petitioner at.this does not constitute detrimental reliance for purposes of assessing the retroactive effect of a.in contrast to the aliens in cyr and tasios reno,cir,posits no way in which his marriage in reliance on preexisting law weakened his immigration status under the new law or hurt his chances of remaining in this country accordingly,even if he could demonstrate a significant likelihood of receiving the relief he sought under the old law,he offers no detrimental reliance of the sort which played such a critical role in the cyr and tasios holdings.
at emphasis in original.despite the difference between and cyr,the fourth circuit ultimately did not rest its decision on lack of reliance.it explained 
that did not detrimentally rely on prior law may not,however,foreclose a claim that a nonetheless operates retroactively.see hughes aircraft united states,d holding that the amended false claims act operated retroactively without discussing whether any party detrimentally relied on previous law.but we need not decide that question because there is a far simpler reason compelling our conclusion that the application of a is not impermissibly retroactive in this case not until well after a took effect did apply to adjust his status or did his wife file for a visa petition on his behalf.in order to obtain an adjustment of status,an application must have been filed and an immigrant visa must be immediately available to the applicant,a supp.v did not attempt to meet either of these requirements until after the effective date of a.
accordingly,failure to apply to adjust his resident status before the new law took effect fatally undermines his contention that a application to him attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.
id.at emphasis in original citations omitted 
the eighth circuit addressed a very similar factual situation in.in that case,an alien reentered the country illegally in.in november,after iirira passage,he married a united states citizen.nearly five years long after iirira effective date,the petitioner applied for an adjustment of status.in determining whether a could be applied retroactively to the petitioner,the eighth circuit disagreed with the fourth circuit analysis 
in crocetti,the fourth circuit concluded that a had no impermissible retroactive effect because the illegal reentrant could have applied for adjustment of status before iirira enactment,and therefore a did not attach new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.we disagree.hughes aircraft held that the elimination of a substantive defense,without more,attaches new legal consequences to events completed prior to enactment that would give rise to liability under the new statute.that is precisely the effect of changing the law to provide that an illegal reentrant in a reinstatement proceeding under a may not apply for any relief under this chapter.under prior law,had a reasonable expectation he could either file for a discretionary adjustment of status,or wait and seek the adjustment as a defense to a later deportation proceeding.he chose to wait,and a as applied by the ins has now deprived him of that defense.to this extent,we conclude the statute had an impermissible retroactive effect on his reinstatement and removal proceeding.
at.thus,the eighth circuit concluded that,because had reentered the united states and married a united states citizen prior to iirira effective date,was eligible,as of that date,for an adjustment of status.consequently,a could not operate retroactively to deprive him of the right to apply for that discretionary relief.
the fifth circuit was the next to consider the retroactive effect of a however,it did so under factual circumstances different from those set forth above.see.in,the petitioner,a citizen of mexico,had entered the united states illegally in and was deported that same year.he illegally reentered the united states in.in,the ins apprehended him and served him with a notice of intent to reinstate the prior deportation order.at the time that was served with the reinstatement notice,he apparently had not submitted an application for adjustment of status consequently,if a were applied retroactively to the petitioner,it would not affect any pending applications for relief instead,it would affect only the way in which his deportation was adjudicated,namely without a hearing before an immigration judge ij.see supra notes and.the fifth circuit determined that the mere loss of the procedural guarantee of a hearing before an ij did not upset an alien rights in such a way as to prevent a from being applied retroactively 
in this case,was denied a hearing before an immigration judge,to which he was entitled under law.instead,an immigration officer made all of the predicate findings necessary to reinstate his prior deportation order.unlike the alien who entered a plea agreement in cyr,however,had no reasonable expectation of having a hearing before an immigration judge rather than an ins official when he illegally reentered the united states in.as judge fernandez states in his thoughtful dissent in ins,a does not deal with any vested rights or settled expectations arising out of the alien wrongdoing.nor does it impose any new duties or new liabilities.we conclude,therefore,that a does not have an impermissible retroactive effect as applied to.accordingly,we hold that the ins properly applied a to.
id.at footnotes omitted thus,according to the fifth circuit,the fact that a deprived a petitioner of a removal hearing before an ij did not disturb the type of settled expectations that rendered a impermissibly retroactive 
finally,the first circuit,in a case very similar to that of,determined that a could not be applied retroactively to the petitioner.in arevalo,the petitioner illegally reentered the united states in.in august,the petitioner father,a legal permanent resident,filed a visa petition on her behalf,which was approved.subsequently,in march of,arevalo applied for an adjustment of status.six years later,the ins notified arevalo that it would not entertain her application.the ins subsequently invoked a to resurrect her prior deportation order and detained arevalo pending removal.the first circuit concluded that applying a to arevalo would have an impermissible retroactive effect.it explained 
the ins objects that,unlike the petitioner in cyr,the petitioner here can show neither a cognizable reliance interest in this right nor a settled expectation based on it we think that the ins circumscribes the enceinture of relevant interests too grudgingly.
first,the array of pertinent interests listed in landgraf,hughes aircraft,and other influential precedents is not exhaustive but merely illustration by synecdoche.such listings simply describe several sufficient,as opposed to necessary,conditions for finding retroactivity.cyr,at.second,the presumption against statutory retroactivity is not restricted to cases involving vested rights.third,and most important,the petitioner in this case applied for adjustment of status before april,fact that distinguishes her in a material way from the mine run of persons who appeal from the reinstatement of previous removal orders.see,at noting that no application for status adjustment had been made before iirira effective date despite more than adequate time to do so in the latter genus of cases,it is not possible to complain that section a appends new legal consequences to an event the filing of an application for discretionary relief occurring before its effective date.see,at.this is a salient distinction because applications for discretionary relief,once made,often become a source of expectation and even reliance.
the petitioner already had filed for relief when congress amended the statute.discarding her application now would deprive her both of a right that she once had and of the reasonable expectation that she would have the opportunity to convince the attorney general to grant her relief.as the supreme court recently stated,t here is a clear difference,for the purposes of retroactivity analysis,between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation.cyr,at.
id.at emphasis in original citations omitted.thus,because arevalo applied for discretionary relief prior to iirira effective date,she had a legitimate expectation that her application would be considered by the attorney general.applying a to arevalo would upset that legitimate expectation consequently,applying a to the petitioner would have an impermissible retroactive effect.
application 
although the factual circumstances of each of these cases differ from one another and from that of,the courts approaches to the retroactivity question is similar.the courts have looked to whether a disturbs the petitioner substantive rights or expectations.when retroactive application has affected only the way in which a petitioner deportation is adjudicated,because,for instance,the petitioner failed to apply for discretionary relief prior to iirira effective date no settled expectations were disturbed,and,therefore no impermissible retroactive effect occurred.see lattab ashcroft,cir,at.however,when retroactive application not only affected the way in which the petitioner deportation was adjudicated,but also affected the substantive relief that was available to the petitioner,a could not be applied retroactively.
here,both reentered the united states and applied for adjustment of status prior to iirira effective date.at the time that he made his application,therefore,had the right to have his adjustment of status adjudicated,including the waivers of inadmissibility necessary to his application.although he had no guarantee of a favor
