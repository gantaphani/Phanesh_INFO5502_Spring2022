boyanivskyy raises several issues in his petition for review we need address only one.he argues that the immigration judge denied him a fair hearing by excluding key evidence supporting his persecution claim.we agree that boyanivskyy immigration hearing was statutorily insufficient because the immigration judge excluded critical material evidence bearing directly on his claim of persecution.we therefore grant his petition for review,vacate the bia decision,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
boyanivskyy first attempted to cross from mexico into the united states on february.united states border agents were not fooled by the austrian passport he showed them and they sent him back to mexico.on february,boyanivskyy tried to cross the border again,this time showing up with no documentation at all and telling border agents he lost his papers in mexico.border agents interviewed boyanivskyy at some length and generated several documents relating to boyanivskyy second attempted entry.these documents contain internal inconsistencies and errors that weaken their reliability,but two of them indicate boyanivskyy falsely claimed to be a united states citizen during his attempted entry on february.boyanivskyy denies that he ever claimed united states citizenship.
a border agent specifically asked boyanivskyy if he had any fear or concern about being returned to ukraine.he answered yes.i fear to go back because i can not feed my family i can not earn enough money to feed my family.when the agent followed up by asking whether he had any concerns o ther than economic concerns,boyanivskyy simply repeated his financial worries yes.my salary in ukraine was fifteen dollars per month.i could not support my family with the amount of money that i made.during the entire february interview,boyanivskyy never mentioned anything about being persecuted on account of his marriage to a jewish woman.
the government initiated removal proceedings against boyanivskyy that culminated in an immigration hearing that began on october,and continued on january and.at the hearing boyanivskyy conceded he was removable because he lacked the required entry documents.the immigration judge also found boyanivskyy was removable for falsely claiming united states citizenship during his second attempt to enter the country.the remainder of the hearing focused on boyanivskyy effort to persuade the immigration judge to grant him asylum,withholding of removal,or relief under the cat because he had been persecuted in ukraine on account of his marriage to a jewish woman and would face further persecution if returned.
boyanivskyy planned to show a likelihood of persecution through his own testimony about past persecution he had suffered,including several violent beatings the testimony of jeffrey burds,an expert on ukrainian country conditions and the testimony of two of his former neighbors in ukraine,igor zarichnyak and vasyl yakovishak.boyanivskyy provided advance notice of the substance of these witnesses prospective testimony by submitting a prehearing affidavit from burds and unsworn written statements from zarichnyak and yakovishak.burds affidavit discussed ukrainian in detail and concluded that boyanivskyy account of the persecution he faced for marrying a jewish woman directly conform s to patterns of dramatically escalating and violence throughout ukraine since november,when ukraine declared independence from the former soviet union.based on his numerous visits to boyanivskyy hometown of,burds found boyanivskyy version of events probable and persuasive.he also noted the systematic failure of the ukrainian government to prosecute crimes committed against ethnic russians and jews.
lay witnesses zarichnyak and yakovishak would have testified to the ill treatment boyanivskyy and his wife,ivanna,endured in.zarichnyak statement gave a general description of the harassment and discrimination boyanivskyy suffered from the time he married ivanna it also said ivanna had endured discrimination all her life.yakovishak statement likewise described the verbal abuse,threats,and insults boyanivskyy and his wife experienced in.he also indicated in his statement that while driving home on the evening of september,he witnessed six men beating boyanivskyy in the vicinity of the station.the context suggests he meant the police station.according to his written statement,yakovishak recognized at least one of the attackers as an police officer,though the man wore civilian clothing.yakovishak says he found boyanivskyy lying unconscious on the ground and called an ambulance to take him to the hospital.
boyanivskyy testified at his hearing that he experienced persecution in beginning at the time of his marriage to ivanna in september.he is orthodox christian ivanna is jewish.the worst of what boyanivskyy described were three severe beatings he suffered in september,and may and december.in september,boyanivskyy reported to police that his car had been stolen.on september,about ten days after he reported the stolen car,the police asked boyanivskyy to come to the station to receive a report indicating the case would be closed because they deemed it a act.
boyanivskyy said he reported as requested,and shortly after he left the police station,six men in civilian clothing assaulted him.the attackers made it clear they knew he had reported his car stolen and that he was targeted for attack because he was married to a jewish woman.they repeatedly called boyanivskyy and his wife kikes while they punched and kicked him.the beating left him with a concussion,a dislocated jaw,bruised ribs,and eyes that were swollen shut.boyanivskyy recalled that his friend yakovishak called an ambulance that took him to a hospital where he remained for fifteen days.for a week and a half,boyanivskyy had trouble walking.he could not say for certain whether his attackers were police officers,but he suspected they were at least connected with the police because they knew his car had been stolen and the attack occurred shortly after he had been called to the police station.
the second beating came on may,as boyanivskyy walked home from work.three men attacked him and told him he could not have kids with a kike.ivanna was five months pregnant at the time.this assault was so violent that boyanivskyy was hospitalized for over a month with injuries ranging from a brain hematoma to a dislocated collar bone.
ivanna gave birth to the boyanivskyys first child,a son,in september,and they began receiving telephone death threats from unidentified callers soon after.the callers made it clear they disapproved of the mixed marriage and were particularly incensed about the couple having children.boyanivskyy had not reported either the september or the may beating to feared notifying the police would only exacerbate his in november he submitted a written request asking the police to investigate the death threats.boyanivskyy explained that despite his concern that the police might retaliate against him for reporting the threats,he feared greatly for his son safety and did not know what else to do,so he filed the request with the police.the police opened a criminal investigation,but there is no evidence that any suspects were arrested or prosecuted.
