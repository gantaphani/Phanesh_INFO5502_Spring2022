the central question in this case is whether we have jurisdiction to review the denial of the petitioner untimely motion to reopen his removal proceedings.
the board of immigration appeals bia denied the motion to reopen after determining that the petitioner mccarthy larngar,who is an aggravated felon,failed to demonstrate changed country circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing,and failed to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the relief he was under the convention against torture.the government contends that the bia determination on the changed circumstances issue is factual in nature and that we lack jurisdiction to review such determinations in cases involving aggravated felons.see a c,d limiting our jurisdiction in such cases to review of constitutional claims or questions of law.
after careful consideration,we remand to the bia for further consideration.
background 
mccarthy larngar is a native and citizen of liberia.he entered the united states in at the age of seven and has remained here since.in,larngar was convicted in rhode island state court of carrying a handgun without a license and assaulting a person with a dangerous weapon,the latter qualifying as an aggravated felony as defined by a f.the victim of the assault,ashford peal,is also a liberian citizen.
for his crimes,larngar was sentenced in to twenty years imprisonment,twelve of which were to be served.removal proceedings were initiated in,charging larngar with removability on the basis of his aggravated felony conviction.a a iii.larngar conceded removability and sought relief from removal under the convention against torture cat.in support of his cat application,larngar testified that a number of his relatives had been either persecuted or killed in liberia and that his grandfather had been granted asylum in the united states.the ij determined that larngar failed to carry his burden under the cat.in december,the bia affirmed the ij decision and dismissed larngar appeal.
over four years later,in january,larngar filed a motion to reopen with the bia.because the motion to reopen was c such motions must be filed within ninety days of the issuance of the final administrative decision in the relied on the exception to the timeliness requirement provided by c ii.this exception serves to excuse a late filing if the applicant is able to establish changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered,if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.
the changed circumstance larngar identified in his motion was the appointment of ashford peal,the victim of his assault,to a position of authority in the liberian government.specifically,in,over two years after the bia final administrative decision in larngar case,peal had been appointed the deputy director of the special security service sss in large,heavily armed executive protective force.in support of his motion,larngar submitted evidence that peal had repeatedly threatened larngar with severe harm or death both prior to and after his rise to power larngar contended that peal ascension to a position of government authority was a changed circumstance that materially affected his cat claim because peal now had the capacity and resources to follow through on his threats.
the bia denied larngar motion,concluding that the changed circumstances exception was inapplicable.although acknowledging that larngar motion to reopen was based on previously unavailable evidence,the bia determined that larngar had identified only a change in personal circumstances rather than a change in country circumstances.the bia reasoned that t he respondent fear of torture or other harm arose as a result of his personal circumstances in the united states.namely,the victim of the respondent felonious assault wants revenge a change in the respondent personal circumstances does not entitle him to invoke the exception set forth in federal regulations at c ii.
b.the second motion to reopen 
in june,larngar filed a second motion to focus of this appeal.because this motion was similarly untimely,as well as being successive,the burden remained on larngar to establish the applicability of an exception.again relying on the changed country circumstances exception,larngar introduced the same evidence,reiterating the alleged threat that peal posed to him.but larngar also identified an additional change in reinstatement to his position as deputy director of the sss 
the bia again denied larngar motion to reopen.although acknowledging that larngar evidence established that peal had been reinstated to his government position,the bia again determined that larngar failed to establish a change in country circumstances arising in liberia.in so determining,the bia relied on its previous decision denying larngar first motion to reopen,reasoning that larngar had merely identified a change in personal circumstances and that such a change was insufficient to qualify him under the changed country circumstances exception.
after determining that the exception was inapplicable,the bia also identified an additional reason for denying larngar motion moreover,the respondent filing is insufficient to support reopening on the likelihood of it being found more likely than not that the respondent would be tortured at the hands of a government official if returned to liberia.this timely petition for review followed.
ii.discussion 
we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen under a deferential abuse of discretion standard,fustaguio do nascimento mukasey,cir,and ordinarily we will uphold the denial unless the complaining party can show that the bia committed an error of law or exercised its judgment in an arbitrary,capricious,or irrational way,raza gonzales,cir.
an applicant ability to file a motion to reopen is ordinarily limited both numerically and temporally.fustaguio do nascimento,at.an applicant may typically file only one motion to reopen a removal proceeding and must file that motion within ninety days of the issuance of the final administrative decision in the case.id.at.nevertheless,there are exceptions to these bars.see c.for example,the bia may excuse a successive or late motion to reopen if a petitioner can establish that changed circumstances have arisen in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered.id.at c ii.the evidence of changed circumstances must be material to the underlying substantive relief that the petitioner is seeking and must have been unavailable during the prior proceedings.raza,at.
even if a motion satisfies these procedural requirements,or otherwise qualifies under an applicable exception,the bia may yet deny a motion to reopen if it determines that the movant has not established a prima facie case of eligibility for the substantive relief sought.ins abudu,d recognizing three independent grounds for denying a motion to reopen,including the movant failure to establish a prima facie case for the substantive relief sought see also shardar att y of the united states,cir observing that the requirement that a movant establish a prima facie case for the substantive relief sought is a substantive hurdle.
changed circumstances 
the first,and main,question is whether we have jurisdiction to review the bia denial of larngar motion to reopen.the government sole argument is that we lack jurisdiction in this case because the bia denial of larngar motion to reopen rested on a purely factual determination,specifically,that he failed to establish that changed circumstances arising in liberia excused the untimely and successive filing of his motion to reopen.
we generally lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable because he committed a covered criminal offense.id.at a c.among the covered criminal offenses are aggravated felonies,id.at a a iii.larngar concedes that he was convicted of an aggravated felony.
although our review is limited,we nevertheless retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims or questions of law.conteh gonzales,cir noting that the real id act of,a d,softens the jurisdiction stripping provision of a c by allowing review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as stated,this limited jurisdictional grant does not permit us to review claims premised on alleged factual errors.see also mehilli gonzales,cir under the terms of a d limited jurisdictional grant,discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals citation omitted.thus,in a case involving a final order of removal of an alien who has committed a covered criminal offense,the initial inquiry is whether we are reviewing a claim that is premised on a constitutional or legal determination by the bia,or one that is premised on a factual determination.
in arguing that the bia conclusion that larngar failed to establish a change in country circumstances was a factual determination,the government relies primarily on mehilli.in that case,when discussing the real id act limited jurisdiction grant,we noted that the bia findings concerning changed circumstances are usually factual determinations.at 
larngar opposes the government characterization of the bia determination.citing conteh,larngar argues that to be factual in nature,the bia determination about changed circumstances must involve factual findings as to credibility,evidentiary weight,or satisfaction of a correctly framed burden of proof.see conteh,at.according to the petitioner,the bia determination in this case did not involve any such factual findings.
the bia concluded that larngar failed to establish changed country circumstances and thus did not qualify under the exception for untimely motions to reopen.see c ii.although the bia did not question the validity of larngar peal had risen to a position of power in liberia government and threatened to harm or kill larngar if he returned to board nevertheless categorized this showing as merely evidence of changed personal circumstances.a change in personal circumstances,the bia reasoned,is insufficient to establish changed country circumstances.see yuen jin mukasey,cir c hanged personal circumstances are insufficient to excuse an alien from the procedural requirements of a motion to reopen.
it appears as though the bia effectively concluded that larngar failed to satisfy a correctly framed burden of proof.it is that an applicant bears the burden of establishing changed country circumstances for purposes of c ii.raza,at.and here,the bia explicitly found that larngar proffer was insufficient to establish changed circumstances arising in liberia.see conteh,at.in this respect,this case is similar to conteh,in which we rejected the petitioner argument that we had jurisdiction to review the bia finding that he failed to satisfy the criteria for withholding of removal.see also hanan mukasey,cir hanan due process argument primarily consists of his claim that the bia incorrectly found that he did not show changed circumstances to permit the bia to consider his untimely motion to reopen.we reject hanan attempt to characterize a factual question as a constitutional question.
we note that some courts have made explicit that appellate review of a bia finding that a party has failed to establish changed country circumstances is for substantial evidence.see,jian hui shao mukasey,cir substantial record evidence clearly supports the bia finding that the petitioner failed to demonstrate a material change of circumstances arising in china.see also saintha mukasey,cir w e can look to the standard of review we would apply if we were to have jurisdiction to inform whether a given bia determination is factual or legal in nature.and,as we have observed,the real id act legislative history,in distinguishing factual questions from legal ones,categorizes as factual those questions that courts would review under the substantial evidence standard.fn,supra.finally,as the government points out,in mehilli we explained that the bia findings concerning changed circumstances are usually factual determinations.at.
appearances,however,may be deceiving.based upon our review of the bia rationale for its decision,we are concerned that the board may have conflated its finding that larngar fear of torture was with its conclusion that peal ascension to a position of power in liberia government was a change in larngar personal circumstances.
under the case law,a change typically will be categorized as a change in personal circumstances,as opposed to a change in country circumstances,if the change is.wei guang wang,cir concluding that the bia correctly held that the birth of the petitioner two children in the united states constituted changed personal circumstances rather than changed country circumstances because changes can not suffice to show changed country conditions see also ying liu att y of the united states,cir observing that an alien can control a change in personal circumstances and giving marriage and the birth of children as examples of such changes de hong zheng mukasey,cir it is that a change in personal circumstances,such as zheng newly commenced practice of falun gong,does not excuse the time limit for filing a motion to reopen.haddad gonzales,cir haddad divorce was a purely personal change in circumstances that does not constitute changed conditions or circumstances in jordan.bin zhao gonzales,cir 
that a change in personal circumstances should not qualify as a change in country circumstances makes the rule were otherwise,applicants could move to reopen by changing circumstances within their control.see wei guang wang,at i t would be ironic,indeed,if petitioners like wang were permitted to have a second and third bite at the apple simply because they managed to marry and have children.
but it does not appear to us that anything about the change that larngar ascension to power in.the evidence that larngar has submitted in support of his motion to reopen,makes plain that he played no role in peal official ascension in liberia.
the bia decision does not suggest otherwise,at least with respect to peal officeholding.rather,the bia characterizes peal ascension as a change in larngar personal circumstances because larngar was at least partially responsible for the alleged threat that peal posed to him.quoting its previous decision denying larngar first motion to reopen,the bia reasoned,t he respondent fear of torture or other harm arose as a result of his personal circumstances in the united states.namely,the victim of the respondent felonious assault wants revenge a change in the respondent personal circumstances does not entitle him to invoke the exception set forth in federal regulations at c ii.
but the change that larngar has identified in support of his late motion to reopen is peal rise to a position of authority in liberia government.to be sure,any motive peal may have to harm larngar was created by larngar himself.but it is not accurate to characterize this as a change at all,much less a change in personal circumstances.from the moment larngar assaulted peal,peal may have had an interest in seeking revenge.nothing has changed about that.what has changed is peal ability to dispense this revenge through his official capacity,something larngar had and has no control over.see shardar,at determining that petitioner established a change in country circumstances where he introduced evidence that a regime change in the country of nationality materially affected his asylum claim 
nor does it appear that the bia categorization of the change larngar identifies as a change in personal circumstances furthers the policy interest behind the personal circumstances applicants from orchestrating changes that serve their.given the alleged threats peal had made against larngar life prior to peal ascension to a position of government authority in liberia,peal rise was directly contrary to the petitioner 
because of the bia apparent conflation of separate inquiries,we are concerned that the board may not have applied a properly framed burden of proof,see conte
