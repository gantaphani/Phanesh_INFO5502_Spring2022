richard gonzales,louis gomez and carlos reyna appeal their convictions and sentences for deprivation of civil rights in violation of.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
were charged in a five count indictment with the willful deprivation,on or about march,of the civil rights of serafin carrera while in their custody,resulting in bodily injury to him,contrary to.the indictment alleged that each defendant was a deportation officer with the immigration and naturalization service ins and was acting under color of law.carlos reyna was charged in count one with striking and using unreasonable force against carrera and in count four with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.richard gonzales was charged in count two with use of unreasonable force against carrera by pepper spraying him and in count three with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.louis gomez was charged in count five with deliberate indifference to carrera serious medical needs.each defendant pled not guilty.jury trial commenced may,and the jury returned its verdict june,finding reyna not guilty on count one and guilty on count four,gonzales guilty on counts two and three and gomez guilty on count five.the district court sentenced gonzales to concurrent terms of months imprisonment and three years supervised release on each of counts two and three gomez was sentenced to months imprisonment and three years supervised release and,reyna was sentenced to months imprisonment and three years supervised release.on appeal defendants assert divers challenges to their convictions and sentences.
viewing the evidence in the light most reasonably favorable to the government,the following factual context is reflected 
the defendants,gonzales,gomez,and reyna worked as deportation officers for the san antonio division of the ins.they were members of the elite san antonio fugitive unit,a group that specialized in tracking down and deporting illegal aliens with criminal records.early in the morning of march,their unit,together with ins agents from houston,prepared to raid a house in bryan,texas.they were advised to be alert.the night before,agents had encountered an armed near the house.
at am,the raid began.the san antonio unit rushed in the front door while the houston officers maintained a perimeter around the house.minutes later,one of the house occupants,serafin carrera,lay paralyzed on the kitchen floor.
the testimony is unclear about which officers took down carrera,though gonzales,gomez,and reyna were all involved.the prosecution did not charge the defendants with excessive force in taking carrera down or with causing the broken neck which he suffered in that process.instead,the defendants were convicted for their behavior thereafter 
all three defendants had close contact with carrera while he lay handcuffed on the floor.carrera begged for help,screaming they broke me tell them to kill me tell them to take me to a hospital.in response,gomez taunted,from here you going to go to jail and you never going to get out,you son of a fucking mother.officer gonzales called him cabron and invited his fellow officers to wipe their feet on him.the three defendants stood in the kitchen,with carrera on the floor crying for help,trying to figure out how to get their paralyzed detainee into an ins van.officer gonzales,the san antonio team leader,ordered a detention officer to pull the van closer to the house,saying i do want anybody to see what going on.next,gonzales,gomez,and two other officers dragged carrera from the house,across the backyard,and into the van.carrera complained of pain,asking to be shot and put out of his misery,while officer gomez pulled him through the van door and onto the front seat.gomez struggled to position carrera limp body on the seat,finally leaving him slumped on his side and handcuffed.as the van departed for the brazos county jail,officer reyna asked the driver to give carrera a screen unofficial maneuver in which the driver slams on the brake causing a handcuffed passenger to lurch forward and hit his face against the screen.
the nearby brazos county jail was not the final destination for carrera or any of the other detainees.the ins officers merely used its parking lot as a makeshift processing area for the illegal aliens.after processing,the aliens were to be sent by bus to new braunfels,and then removed to mexico.
after all the aliens were loaded into two vans,the officers returned to their cars and followed the vans to the brazos county jail for processing.at the jail,all three defendants dragged carrera off the van,hitting his head against the door on the way out.they dragged him across the parking lot while taunting him and playing with his limp body.gonzales ordered the bus driver to open the luggage compartment,and threatened,jokingly,to make carrera ride below.ins officers testified that gonzales said,let mace the fucker,see if he budges.
the three defendants dragged carrera onto the bus.because the bus had tinted windows,no one outside of it saw what happened next,but after a few minutes all three defendants ran off the bus choking and laughing.with a smirk,gonzales claimed that he had an accidental discharge of pepper spray.a nurse was on duty at the brazos county jail,and a hospital just four miles away,but the defendants left carrera by himself on the floor of the bus,handcuffed,eyes swollen shut,and foaming at the mouth.at around am,three hours after carrera neck was broken,the bus left for new braunfels.carrera rode on the floor of the bus for three more hours until he reached the comal county jail.upon his arrival,the intake nurse refused to take custody of carrera without a medical evaluation.he was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital and then airlifted to a trauma center in san antonio.eleven months later,carrera died.
the next day,the began.gonzales called everyone into his office and assured them,we going to get through this.when gonzales found out that a bus driver had already written a memo about the incident,he called the bus driver into his office and said,who the fuck told you to write a memo nobody told you to write any memos i the one that going to take care of the memos.gonzales demanded that the bus driver change his account to say that carrera had assaulted them.the driver refused.
discussion 
sufficiency of counts three and four of the indictment 
gonzales contends that the district court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss count three of the indictment,concerning his deliberate indifference to carrera serious medical needs,for failure to state an offense.reyna makes the same contention respecting count four,the comparable count naming him.
we review the sufficiency of an indictment de novo.united states fitzgerald,cir.
rule c provides that an indictment must be a plain,concise,and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged fed.c.an indictment sufficiency is determined by an examination of its specific language,taking account of the indictment as a whole in the context of its statutory background.united states haas,cir,cert.denied,d.the test for sufficiency is not whether the indictment could have been better drafted,but whether it conforms to minimal constitutional standards.haas,at.these minimum constitutional standards are met where the indictment alleges every element of the crime charged and in such a way as to enable the accused to prepare his defense and to allow the accused to invoke the double jeopardy clause in any subsequent proceeding.united states bieganowski,cir quoting united states webb,cir.
the indictment alleges that defendants were at all relevant times ins officers and the challenged counts counts three and four charge that the particular defendant 
while acting under color of law,did act with deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of serafin carrera by denying him medical care and treatment,resulting in bodily injury to serafin carrera,and did thereby willfully deprive serafin carrera of the right secured and protected by the constitution and laws of the united states not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law,which includes the right to be free from harm while in official custody.in violation of title,united states code,section.
the defendants argue that the statutory element willfully,the mental state expressly required by section was not properly charged in the indictment because it was confusingly equated with deliberate indifference,the mental state associated with the underlying deprivation 
the indictment,in detailing the statutory elements of the crime charged,alleged two potentially different mental states willfully and deliberate indifference.further,the thereby language in the indictment can arguably be read as wrongfully equating these two mental states.however,deliberate indifference and willfulness are not necessarily inconsistent with each other.and,the validity of an indictment is determined by reading it as a whole and by practical,not technical considerations.united states markham,cir,cert.denied,d.this indictment,as a whole,meets the minimum constitutional standards set out above.it includes every statutory element of a section violation it provides enough factual detail to enable the accused to prepare his defense and it is specific enough to allow the accused to invoke double jeopardy in any subsequent proceedings.accordingly,we reject these challenges to the indictment.
ii.jury charge 
gonzales raises two objections to the jury charge.he contends,first,that the charge improperly equates willfulness with mere knowledge,and,second,that because the charge does not include a good faith instruction requested by gonzales,it omits an essential element of the offense.we reject these contentions.
although gonzales did object to the entire proposed instruction,he made no intelligible objection to any particular language as equating willfulness with knowledge or as allowing conviction on nothing more than deliberate indifference.consequently,those complaints are reviewed for plain error only.united states daniels,cir.
the district court instruction on willfulness is accurate.throughout the jury charge,the court explains the concept of willfulness using language borrowed directly from the fifth circuit pattern jury instructions and from prior section cases.fifth circuit criminal jury instructions united states sipe,cir united states garza,cir 
furthermore,this court has already rejected the argument that an otherwise adequate willfulness instruction is fatally incomplete without further,affirmative instruction on good faith.see united states davis,cir.
iii.sufficiency of the evidence 
standard of review 
each of the defendants challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction.each made an appropriate motion for judgment of acquittal.accordingly,we will hold the evidence sufficient if,but only if,a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence establishes the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.united states brugman,cir.we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in support of the jury verdict.id.if the evidence tends to give nearly equal circumstantial support to either guilt or innocence then reversal is required.united states moreno,cir.
count two,excessive force 
gonzales was convicted on count two of the indictment,which charged that he 
while acting under the color of law,did assault serafin carrera by spraying him with oleoresin capsicum pepper spray,resulting in bodily injury to serafin carrera and did thereby willfully deprive him of the rights protected by the constitution to be secure in his person and to be free from the use of unreasonable force by one acting under color of law.
contrary to gonzales contention,we hold that there is sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that gonzales willfully sprayed carrera.gonzales theory at trial was that the pepper spray accidentally discharged in carrera face while gonzales was carrying him onto the bus through a narrow safety cage doorway.
because the bus had tinted windows,no one outside of it witnessed the discharge.however,frank gonzalez,an ins detention officer from the san antonio office,testified that while gonzales was carrying carrera to the bus,he said let mace the fucker and see if he budges.two other san antonio detention officers,gilbert rodriguez and rene cruz,remembered a similar statement.rene cruz testified that when gonzalez,reyna,and gomez exited the bus,gonzales was coughing,smirking sarcastically,and claiming that there had been an accidental discharge.at the time,neither gilbert rodriguez nor rene cruz believed him.they both suspected that the story was a.
gonzales presented evidence that these testifying officers had given inconsistent accounts of the carrera incident.from initial statements given to agency investigators to later testimony before the grand jury,their stories had evolved.the testifying officers admitted that they had lied to investigators.they explained that they had stonewalled investigators,motivated by fear of reprisal and a misplaced sense of honor,in order to protect their colleagues.at trial,the officers insisted,they were telling the truth.we do not second guess the jury credibility determination here.
the only substantive countervailing evidence presented by gonzales was that accidental discharges had previously occurred with some pepper spray holders and that,on the day of the carrera incident,gonzales had pepper spray on his shirt.there was no testimony that the discharge was accidental.
we conclude that a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the discharge was intentional.
gonzales also asserts that the government failed to prove,as required by the second clause of section,that this deprivation of carrera rights actually resulted in bodily injury.
there are,in fact,two relevant bodily injury requirements.first,an claim,like the one here,requires a showing of some bodily injury to establish a constitutional violation.harper harris county,texas,cir.second,once an underlying constitutional violation is established and the prosecution invokes the second clause of section,it must prove resulting bodily injury in order to sustain punishment of more than one year.gonzales challenges only the government evidence with respect to this second bodily injury requirement however,the definition of bodily injury from cases is still relevant here because this court has borrowed that definition for use in a section prosecution also predicated on excessive force.brugman,at.
in constitutional excessive force cases we have applied a some injury which is more than de minimis injury standard.williams bramer,cir.the injury necessary to satisfy this requirement,and thus to establish an claim,is related to the amount of force that is constitutionally permissible in the context in which the injury occurs.ikerd blair.cir.for example,in williams bramer,supra,this court faced the question whether the injury alleged,dizziness and shortness of breath,was sufficient to satisfy the some injury requirement.we held that the injury was insufficient for the first choking incident,which occurred during a physical search,but was sufficient for the second choking incident,which occurred after the victim threatened to report the officer.for the second choking,dizziness and shortness of breath satisfied the some injury requirement because the officer was motivated entirely by malice.williams bramer,at.in contrast,the first incident occurred during a search,where physical confrontation inevitably results.id.
there is sufficient evidence here to support a rational jury finding of bodily injury.carrera mouth was foaming,he complained of stinging pain,and his eyes were swollen shut for at least three hours.the government introduced evidence that pepper spray causes intense pain.the force that caused this pain,the pepper spray,was applied in a context not too different from the second choking incident in bramer.carrera was no longer a threat to gonzales.he was paralyzed,handcuffed,and lying on the floor of the bus.accordingly,we hold that a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence establishes,beyond a reasonable doubt,gonzales conviction.champion outlook nashville,cir i t is clearly established that the officers use of pepper spray against champion after he was handcuffed and hobbled was excessive.
nor do we find any merit in gonzales contention,made only in passing and partially on evidence not introduced before the jury but only at sentencing,that the evidence is insufficient because,even if it shows he intentionally pepper sprayed carrera,it is not adequate to show that he knew the effects of the pepper spraying would be sufficiently severe to constitute bodily injury.we conclude,however,that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer any requisite knowledge and intent on gonzales part 
counts three,four and five,deliberate indifference 
gonzales,reyna,and gomez each dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions for the willful deprivation of carrera right to be free from deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs counts three,four,and five.
under the due process clause,pretrial detainees enjoy a constitutional right not to have their serious medical needs met with deliberate indifference on the part of confining officials.see thompson upshur county,cir defining the right under the fourteenth amendment due process clause.deliberate indifference,as defined in due process cases,requires both that the government official have subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to a pretrial detainee and that the government official respond with deliberate indifference to that risk.hare city of corinth,cir en banc.finally,if this due process right is willfully violated,and if bodily injury results,then the offender is guilty of a felony under section.
the officers had actual awareness.there is sufficient evidence for a jury to have found that officers gonzales,reyna,and gomez were actually aware that carrera had serious medical needs which posed a substantial risk of serious harm to him.under the evidence,the jury could have so concluded from the very fact that this was so obvious.farmer brennan,d.
all three defendants had close contact with carrera while he lay handcuffed on the floor after his injury.carrera made his injury known to the defendants,screaming they broke me tell them to take me to a hospital and the like.in response to his frequent pleas,the officers taunted him,calling him cabron and inviting people to wipe their feet on him.
at trial,the defense argued that gonzales,reyna,and gomez believed carrera was drunk and faking injury.witnesses testified that it is common for detainees to feign injury in hope of avoiding immediate deportation that other officers at the scene also believed carrera was faking injury and that it is extremely difficult for laymen to recognized the symptoms of quadriplegia.
but,two of the officers,reyna and gomez,were trained in trauma management and taught both how to identify the symptoms of spinal injury and how to treat those symptoms.moreover,although some testifying officers did concede that they thought carrera was faking injury,those officers reminded the jury that the defendants were in close contact with carrera and everyone else at the scene just believed what the defendants told them about carrera condition.
after the takedown,the three defendants had extended contact with carrera they dragged his limp body from the house to the van they dragged him off the van and onto the bus and they witnessed his reaction to being pepper sprayed.the jury could have easily inferred from both this close physical contact and carrera evident distress and frequent cries for help that the defendants knew he was seriously injured.
substantial risk of serious harm.there is sufficient evidence for the jury to have found that carrera faced a substantial risk of serious harm.the government need not prove that carrera actually suffered serious harm.it is enough,for these purposes,that carrera was exposed to a substantial risk of serious harm even if that harm never materialized.see,gates cook,cir holding that a eighth amendment plaintiff did not have to prove that he was actually injured by exposure to raw sewage,only that the exposure posed a serious health risk.
a defense witness,hirshberg,testified that immediately upon being taken down,carrera spinal facets locked and his spine was stable.because of this stability,he explained,there was no risk associated with dragging carrera from the kitchen,to the van,to the bus.
the government expert disagreed.gitterle testified that carrera might have benefited had he reached the hospital sooner and that,by moving carrera without stabilizing him,the officers exposed him to a risk of harm.furthermore,because excruciating pain also qualifies as a serious harm,the jury could have inferred that the defendant failure to seek medical care for carrera further exposed him to a substantial risk of increased severe pain.see harris hegmann,cir.moreover,after being pepper sprayed,carrera was left alone on the bus floor,handcuffed,eyes swollen shut and foaming at the mouth,despite ins training that,due to the risk of potentially fatal asphyxiation,those pepper sprayed should be continually monitored and placed upright,never in a prone position,particularly if handcuffed.
the officers responded with deliberate indifference to the risk.there is sufficient evidence to permit a finding of deliberate indifference.deliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet.domino texas of crim.justice,cir.the government must show that the officials refused to treat him,ignored his complaints,intentionally treated him incorrectly,or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.id.at.
only reyna disputes the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to deliberate indifference.we reject his contention that under the evidence it could not be found that he had any ability or opportunity to respond to carrera serious medical needs or to do anything looking to their alleviation.
bodily injury.there is sufficient evidence to permit a finding of bodily injury.a finding of bodily injury is not required to establish deliberate indifference,the constitutional violation underlying counts three,four and five.however,as noted above,for a section conviction to constitute a felony,bodily injury must result from the underlying violation with respect to count,the underlying violation was employment of excessive force and we followed brugman and applied to section bodily injury requirement the some injury test used in the excessive force cases.as explained in brugman,what satisfies the some injury requirement varies according to the amount of force that was constitutionally permissible under the particular circumstances.see brugman,at.we decline to extend brugman approach to section cases in which employment of excessive force is not any part of the underlying constitutional violation.brugman is simply not meaningful in such a context.in a section prosecution based on deliberate indifference to serious medical needs,use of force is no part of the underlying constitutional violation,and we accordingly do not apply brugman definition of bodily injury.
we instead follow the first and eleventh circuits in applying to bodily injury as used in section the definition of bodily injury provided in four other sections of title namely,a a cut,abrasion,bruise,burn,or disfigurement b physical pain c illness d impairment of a function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty or e any other injury to the body,no matter how temporary.f h a d.see united states bailey,cir united states myers,cir.
applying this statutory definition of bodily injury,we hold that there was sufficient evidence to prove either physical pain or impairment of function.the defendants argue that their failure to provide medical care for carrera did not result in bodily injury because carrera injury was painless,instantaneous,and irreversible.the government,however,presented contrary evidence.several witnesses,including several ins officers,testified that carrera was moaning and complaining of severe pain.and,gitterle testified that carrera might have benefitted from treatment had he reached the hospital sooner.
we hold that the evidence is sufficient to support all three convictions.
iv.confrontation clause 
gonzales argues that the government violated his rights under the confrontation clause,as recently defined in crawford washington,d,when it introduced evidence of statements carrera made while in ins custody.
new constitutional rules are applied retroactively to all cases pending on direct appeal.griffith kentucky,d.however,this does not affect the rule that,absent plain error,legal issues will not be addressed for the first time on appeal.johnson unites states,d applying the standard to an issue created by an intervening decision united states,cir.gonzales made no objection at trial to the complained of evidence,so our review is only for plain error 
in crawford,the court held that the confrontation clause prohibits testimonial statements made by a person who does not appear at trial received against the accused to establish the truth of the matter asserted unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross examine him.crawford.at.at trial,one of carrera roommates testified that while carrera was lying on the kitchen floor he screamed,oh,they broke me.gonzales argues that because carrera was in custody at the time,this statement none other being specified by gonzales in this connection is inadmissible under crawford.
the statement was admissible to prove that the officers had notice of carrera injury.the substance of the statement,that carrera was broken,was never disputed.furthermore,it is far from clear that this statement or others by carrera while at the scene even qualifies as testimonial under crawford.although the definition of a testimonial statement was left open by crawford,language in the opinion appears to suggest that a testimonial statement is one made during a governmental interrogation or something similar thereto,not merely screaming out in pain to those in the vicinity.crawford.at noting definition of testimony as a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact and observing that a n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony.finding no plain error,we reject gonzales confrontation clause challenge.
constructive amendment of the indictment 
gomez contends that count five of the indictment was constructively amended because he was indicted only for denying medical care but the jury charge and prosecution theory of the case allowed conviction for delaying or denying medical care.because nothing here turns on the distinction between delay and denial,and because the same set of facts is necessary to prove either,we reject this contention.
gomez failed to object on this ground below.the defense did object to the deliberate indifference jury instruction in its entirety,but such general objections are insufficient to preserve constructive amendment error.united states millet,cir.accordingly,we review gomez constructive amendment issue for plain error.united states daniels,cir.
the fifth amendment allows criminal prosecutions only on the basis of an indictment and only a grand jury may amend an indictment.stirone united states,d.an amendment can occur constructively when an action of either the judge or prosecutor allows the jury to convict the defendant upon a factual basis that effectively modifies an essential element of the offense charged.united states holley,cir united states salinas,cir.a jury can not be permitted to convict on an alternative basis permitted by the statute but not charged in the indictment.daniels,at.but an instruction which does not broaden the possible bases of conviction beyond what is embraced in the indictment does not constitute a constructive amendment.united states miller,d.
the delay of medical care and the denial of medical care are not alternative bases because the same facts can be used to convict under either.see united states chambers,cir.for the purposes of a claim,a deliberate delay in providing medical care is no different than a deliberate denial of the same care for the same time,and,in this context,no federal court has ever distinguished the two.an individual can fairly be said to have been denied medical care for a period of several hours even though he receives such care at the end of that period conversely,it can with equal propriety be said that his receipt of the medical care was delayed for that period.gomez contention is essentially a verbal quibble 
because there was no error,much less plain error,we reject gomez contention that his indictment was constructively amended.
vi.deportation of witnesses 
gonzales contends the government deportation of witnesses,and the government subsequent failure to produce these deported witnesses,violated his rights of compulsory process 
because gonzales did not raise below his compulsory process objection to the government deportation of witnesses his complaint is reviewed for plain error.united states partida,cir.
it was not plain error to try gonzales after the government deported two witnesses with material testimony.the sixth amendment guarantees a criminal defendant compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.const.amend.vi.the supreme court has held that when the government deports an illegal alien,before defense counsel has an opportunity to interview the alien,the constitutional right of compulsory process is implicated.united states,d.the court acknowledges,however,that there is tension between this sixth amendment right and the executive branch responsibility to faithfully execute the immigration laws that require prompt deportation of illegal aliens.the mere fact that the government deports illegal alien witnesses,thereby making them unavailable to the defense,is not sufficient,standing alone,to show a violation of the compulsory process clause.id.at.in,the court struck a balance,holding that the executive branch was justified in the prompt deportation of illegal alien witnesses once the executive branch made a determination that the witnesses possessed no evidence favorable to the defendant in a criminal prosecution.id.
this circuit has not yet fully defined the contours of a claim under.other circuits have implemented the holding in different ways.so far,drawing on explicit language from,all of the circuits require at least a plausible showing that the testimony of the deported witness would have been material and favorable to the defense,in ways not merely cumulative to the testimony of available witnesses.at.this first prong is universal the defendant must show prejudice to his case.
the seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits recognize a second prong the defendant must establish that the government acted in bad faith.united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir.these circuits draw upon the following language from i mmigration policy adopted by congress justifies the prompt deportation of witnesses upon the executive determination that they possess no evidence favorable to the defendant in a criminal prosecution.at emphasis added.there may be some disagreement on what it takes to show bad faith.in the ninth circuit,a defendant must show either that the government departed from normal deportation procedures or that it deported the witness to gain an unfair tactical advantage,at.in the seventh circuit,a defendant must show official animus or a conscious effort to suppress exculpatory evidence,at.the focus is on the government knowledge when it arranged for the departure of the witnesses,not on any of its subsequent conduct.id.
this court has adopted the first prong,requiring a showing of prejudice.united states soape,cir denial of requested subpoena did not violate defendant compulsory process rights because the defendant had not demonstrated the necessity of the witnesses testimony.in united states,cir,this court discussed the first prong,acknowledged the existence of the second prong,and held there was no violation,noting that neither prejudice nor lack of good faith was shown,but not expressly stating that the failure to show lack of good faith was of itself fatal to the claim.
here,unlike our prior cases,the first prong is likely satisfied.gonzales has made a plausible showing that the missing testimony,evaluated in the context of the entire record,would be material and favorable to the defense,and not cumulative,at.two of the deported witness believed carrera was faking injury.because deliberate indifference requires that gonzales know that carrera was actually injured,this testimony may have been both favorable and noncumulative.
gonzales does not,however,satisfy the second prong since the witnesses were deported in good faith.two facts about gonzales case distinguish it from the vast majority of those that give rise to claims.first,gonzales arrest occurred after the illegal aliens were deported.second,gonzales actually participated in deporting his own witnesses.gonzales does not dispute that the deportations were done in good faith.he concedes that the government only became aware of exculpatory testimony after they deported the witnesses.
because gonzales can not satisfy the second prong,he is not entitled to relief under the plain error standard.whether this court ever adopts the second prong,requiring a showing of bad faith by government officials,remains an open question that we do not decide today.if there is error,it is not plain.see united states olano,d.
gonzales also contends that the government failure to produce alien witnesses violated his compulsory process rights.at an april,hearing,gonzales complained to the court of his difficulties locating witnesses in mexico.the court responded,the first thing you got to do is sit down and make sure the government has already provided the information if at the end of that exercise you still have issues,you can come back gonzales never again raised the matter with the district court.the court above noted ruling at the hearing was not sufficiently definitive to preserve this claim,so plain error review is applicable.gonzales compulsory process rights were not plainly violated by the government failure to produce deported witnesses.compulsory process gives criminal defendants the right to the government assistance in compelling the attendance of favorable witnesses at trial pennsylvania ritchie,d.here,the witnesses were in mexico,beyond the subpoena power of the federal district court.nevertheless,the united states attorney produced information about every witness who was deported,located twelve of the twenty witnesses in mexico,arranged for them to stay in the united states temporarily,and made them available to the defense for interviews three months before trial.under the circumstances,the government made fully reasonable efforts.there is no plain error.
vii.brady evidence 
gonzales contends the government withheld the following exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d that the pepper spray canister did not have a safety that gonzales holster did not have a trigger guard,that a government witness,gondinez,had made a prior inconsistent statement and that certain deported alien witnesses had testimony favorable to gonzales.gonzales did not raise any of these objections at any time below.if review is even possible,it is for plain error.no such error is demonstrated.
none of the exculpatory evidence cited by gonzales was actually withheld from him.gonzales had knowledge of the first two items,the safety characteristics of his pepper spray canister and his holster.the other two items were provided to the defense in a tape recording.
regardless,appellate review is impossible here.such brady challenges present judgments that can not be adequately first made on appellate review.that is why brady challenges must be brought to the district court attention,winnowed by the trial judge,and made part of the record through a motion for new trial.see united states chorney,cir.see also united states jones,cir.
we decline to reverse on the basis of gonzales brady claim.
viii.prosecutorial misconduct 
gonzales contends that his due process rights were violated by the prosecutor false statements made during rebuttal closing.gonzales objected to these statements for the first time in his motion for new trial.
gonzales argues two instances of prosecutorial misconduct.first,he asserts that the prosecutor argued that accidental discharge of the pepper spray was impossible by virtue of a safety,even though the prosecutor knew,or should have known,this to be false.second,he argues that the prosecutor created a false impression of a conspiracy.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment forbids the government from knowingly using,or failing to correct,false testimony.giglio united states,d.to prove a due process violation,gonzales must establish that there was false testimony,that the government knew the testimony was false,that the testimony was material.united states mason,cir.this rule also applies to false statements made during the prosecutors rebuttal closing.united states williams,cir.
however,the prosecutor rebuttal closing contained no false statements.the prosecutor argued that unless that safety tab was previously pulled,which there no evidence before you,this thing can not accidentally discharge.evidence of the existence of a safety tab was elicited at trial both through testimony and with the introduction of ins training materials.post trial defendant submitted affidavits stating that the safety tabs are on only during shipping and are removed before the pepper spray is issued to ins officers.nevertheless,the prosecutor rebuttal statement is still canister can not discharge unless the tab is removed.
to the extent that gonzales complaint is that the prosecutor misleadingly suggested that gonzales canister had a safety tab on it during the march,incident,the complaint was not properly preserved by objection at trial and is hence reviewed only for plain error we observe that gonzales does not allege that the prosecutor actually knew that the tabs were routinely removed before the canisters were issued to agents.further,no witness testified at trial that the discharge was accidental or that the witness believed it was gonzales fellow ins agents testified that they saw the officers bring carrera on the bus and that they did not see an accidental discharge when he was carried through the safety cage,and that they saw the officers exit the bus choking and laughing.
gonzales also argues that the prosecutor improperly hinted at a conspiracy.during trial,the government impeached a defense witness with evidence that the witness,later in the day on march,after he knew of the events in question,had signed a form falsely accusing carrera of assaulting gonzales earlier that day.the form,entitled report of assault on service employee s,listed richard gonzales as the officer assaulted and louis gomez as a witness and described the weapon used by suspect as bullet key chain in hand.later,in its closing argument,the government reminded jurors of this impeachment evidence and criticized the officer eagerness to have assault charges brought against the quadriplegic victim.no objection was made at trial.
gonzales argues that the prosecutor knew that this ins form was for internal ins use only and that this form is ever forwarded to the department of justice.the details of ins procedure are irrelevant to the validity of the prosecutor point.the witness submitted a form that ins agents use to report an assault eventually another form is to be used to report the assault to the department of justice and no such form was completed.it not prosecutorial misconduct to argue that steps were initiated to bring charges against carrera.
gonzales has demonstrated no plain error warranting reversal in the prosecutor closing argument.
ix.ineffective assistance of counsel 
for the first time on appeal,gonzales argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object when the prosecutor claimed that the pepper spray could accidentally discharge unless the safety tab was removed.as a general rule,this court will not address,on direct appeal,sixth amendment claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that were not presented to the district court.united states valuck,cir.there is no good reason to deviate from that general rule here.we accordingly deny relief on this claim,but without prejudice to such rights as gonzales may have in respect thereto in a proper motion under.
x.the order of closing arguments 
gonzales contends that the district court erred in how it ordered closing arguments.
closing arguments began thursday afternoon.there was discussion with the court as to whether to attempt to complete the arguments that afternoon.the preference of all concerned seemed to be not to do so.the defense attorneys asked that after the government initial closing argument each defendant counsel be allowed to make a part of his closing argument that afternoon and the balance of it friday morning.the government strenuously objected,insisting that at the least each defendant argument should be completed before the argument of the next defendant began.defense counsel did not want to proceed in that fashion,nor did the defense want to postpone any defense arguments until friday morning.the court eventually acceded to the defense request but,as compensation to the government,allowed it a mini rebuttal the first thing friday morning,to be followed by the second segment of the argument of counsel for each of the defendants,after all of which would come the government rebuttal.defense counsel objection was overruled.the closing arguments thus proceeded as follows on thursday afternoon,the government presented its opening closing argument for some minutes this was followed by some minutes of argument by the attorney for reyna,then by some twenty minutes of argument by an attorney for gomez,and finally by some thirty minutes of argument by the attorney for gonzales.the court then,at about,recessed until friday.proceedings began about friday morning with approximately minutes of mini rebuttal by another government attorney,followed by some minutes further argument by reyna counsel,then another some forty minutes argument in consecutive and twelve minute separate segments by gomez two counsel,then some thirty minutes argument by gonzales counsel,and finally followed by some minutes of rebuttal argument by a third government attorney 
other than conclusorily stating that allowing the government to go first and last and also to argue in the middle of defense counsel closing arguments gives it unfair advantage,appellants point to no particular specific unfairness or prejudice to them in the ordering of the arguments,nor do they cite any authority in support of their contention.their objection below was even more perfunctory it must be recalled that the defendants wanted to split each defendant argument into two separate sections instead of having the complete argument of each defendant uninterrupted by that of any other party.appellants make and made below no complaint either as to the amount of time allowed or that the procedure,insofar as it deviated from the normal practice by giving the government a mini rebuttal,allowed the government to raise new arguments to which the defense did not have an opportunity to reply or that the government opening was inadequate or incomplete.
as a general rule we review comparable trial management decisions for abuse of discretion.see united states leal,cir time allowed for closing arguments.however,rule.which appellants do not even cite provides 
closing arguments proceed in the following order 
a the government argues 
b the defense argues and 
c the government rebuts.
the advisory committee notes reflect that the main purpose of the rule is to ensure that the defendant knows the arguments actually made by the prosecution in behalf of conviction before the defendant is faced with the decision whether to reply and what to reply.this core interest under rule was not invaded here,and,while the simple order of rule should normally be followed,we are unable to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in this respect or that the appellants were prejudiced or treated unfairly by the order of argument.see,united states cardascia,cir united states gleason,cir.
we overrule the complaint concerning the order of closing arguments.
xi.hearsay 
gonzales contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting certain out of court statements.neither the objectionable statements nor the speaker is identified.such underdeveloped arguments in the appellant brief are waived on appeal.united states avants,cir.
xii.predetermined guilt 
gonzales contends that the district court predetermined his guilt and made a decision regarding admissibility of evidence accordingly.gonzales argument is based entirely on one statement by the court which gonzales plainly misunderstands the court was not excluding the proffered hearsay because it believed the statement was false rather,the court was asserting,correctly,that the statement was being offered for the truth of the matter asserted.
xiii.booker 
relying on united states booker,d,gonzales and reyna both challenge their sentence enhancements.gonzales also contends the district court erred by not considering all factors listed under a.
because neither defendant raised these arguments below,review is for plain error only.united states mares,cir.
this court has held that if the effect of the error is uncertain so that we do not know which,if either,side it helped the defendant loses.mares,at.the record must indicate that,had the court applied an advisory sentencing scheme rather than a mandatory one,it would have reached a different result more favorable to the defense.id.
neither gonzales nor reyna meets this burden.the district court sentenced gonzales to the maximum imprisonment allowed by the guidelines.and,although reyna was sentenced at the bottom of his guideline range,this fact alone is insufficient to show that the court,under an advisory scheme,likely would have reached a different result and nothing else points to that conclusion.united states,cir.
booker held that the district court,treating the guidelines as advisory,should consider the factors listed in a.gonzales contends that the district court would have granted his motion for downward departure had it considered the factors listed in section a.we reject this contention.the district court did invoke section a when it explained that as to each of the defendants,the sentences imposed are consistent with the guideline sentencing objectives of punishment,incapacitation and deterrence.
xiv.sentencing two or more participants 
this court reviews the district court findings of fact regarding sentencing factors for clear error.united states mergerson,cir.a factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.united states holmes,cir.we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states clayton,cir.for sentences imposed and challenged,these standards of review are unchanged.united states villegas,cir.
the sentencing guidelines provide for a level of twelve if the defendant offense involved two or more participants.see a.finding multiple participants,the district court correctly applied this base offense level to each defendant.a.gonzales and reyna challenge this finding,arguing that the crime of willful deliberate indifference to medical needs is a crime of omission,so it can not involve multiple participants the defendants were not charged with conspiracy so they must have acted alone and each defendant was acting independently.the first two are questions of guideline interpretation,which we review de novo.the last is a factual determination that we review for clear error.united states ho,cir.
it is not determinative that the defendants were convicted of a crime of omission.the commentary to section defines participant,in reference to section,as a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense,but need not have been convicted.comment comment.by the plain text of the guideline,all three defendants,gonzales,reyna,and gomez,qualify as participants since they are all criminally responsible for the same offense.
a defendant need not be charged with conspiracy to qualify for a enhancement.as long as the defendants participated knowingly in some part of the criminal enterprise,they need not even be convicted of the offense.united states glinsey,cir,comment.we have upheld findings of multiple participants without an underlying conspiracy charge.see,united states messervey,cir.
finally,the district court did not clearly err in finding that the defendants acted together.the defendants were together in the kitchen when carrera was complaining of injury,together at the brazos county jail when they dragged carrera to the bus,and together on the bus when they pepper sprayed him.
we affirm the sentencing court finding of two or more participants.
xv.sentencing organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor 
a factual finding that a defendant was an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor under sentencing guideline c is reviewed for clear error.united states turner,cir.
it was not clear error for the district court to impose a sentence adjustment because gonzales was an organizer,leader,manager or supervisor of at least one of the other participants in the criminal activity.c.gonzales was the team leader of the san antonio unit,and according to everyone who testified at trial,the team leader of the operation that led to carrera arrest.throughout the day,gonzales issued orders to both reyna and gomez.for example,gonzales rejected the driver suggestion that carrera get medical attention before being moved he ordered carrera moved from the house to the van he ordered carrera moved from the van to the bus and he communicated with grace winfrey,his ins supervisor in san antonio about carrera condition.
gonzales relies on united states degovanni,cir,in which the third circuit held that a supervising officer must participate in the criminal activity,not merely assume a de jure role in the police hierarchy.degovanni does apply here because gonzales both led and participated in the criminal activity.accordingly,we affirm the sentencing court finding that gonzales was a leader.
xvi.sentencing vulnerable victim 
the finding of vulnerability is a fact question that is reviewed for clear error.united states brugman,cir.
the district court finding that carrera was a vulnerable victim is plausible.the sentencing guidelines provide for a adjustment if the defendant should have known that the victim was vulnerable.see b.this vulnerability must be an unusual vulnerability which is present in only some victims of that type of crime.united states moree,cir.see also united states,cir approving of the ninth circuit definition of vulnerable victim as one who is less able to resist than the typical victim of the offense.gomez argues that this adjustment is inapplicable because it is only intended to punish targeting a vulnerable victim.he argues that carrera was not vulnerable to begin with instead,he was made vulnerable by the offense.
the guidelines were amended in to clarify that there is no targeting requirement.united states burgos,cir.this court has not required a specific targeting of a vulnerable victim beyond the requirement that the defendant knew or should have known of the vulnerability.id.moreover,carrera was vulnerable.he was quadriplegic,an unusual vulnerability among section victims because carrera was paralyzed he was limited in the ability to seek help from other officers and was particularly at the mercy of the defendants.accordingly,we affirm the sentencing court finding that carrera was a vulnerable victim.
xvii.sentencing restraint of victim 
the finding of restraint is a fact question that is reviewed for clear error.united states brugman,cir.the sentencing guidelines provide for a two level adjustment if the victim was physically restrained in the course of the offense.see.gonzales contends that the district court double counted by adjusting his sentence based both upon carrera restraint and his vulnerability.that carrera was handcuffed is irrelevant,he argues,because carrera could move anyway.
the district court finding that both and vulnerability adjustments were applicable is plausible in light of the record as a whole.there is evidence that carrera,though paralyzed from the chest down,had some capacity for movement.it is plausible that because he was handcuffed behind his back,even this limited range of motion was taken away so,for example,his ability to wipe the pepper spray from his eyes was limited even further by handcuffs.we affirm the sentencing court finding that carrera was restrained.
xviii.obstruction of justice 
the district court factual finding that gonzales obstructed justice is reviewed for clear error.united states holmes,cir.a factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole and t his is particularly true where a sentencing court imposition of an obstruction of justice enhancement is based,at least in part,upon an evaluation of a witness credibility.id.
the district court imposed a enhancement for obstruction of justice based on gonzales false testimony at the sentencing hearing and on his false statements to investigators,claiming accidental discharge of his pepper spray.the guidelines permit an enhancement for obstruction of justice if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.obstruction of justice includes committing perjury and providing materially false information to a judge.id.at b f.thus,perjury at a sentencing hearing is a sufficient basis for an obstruction of justice enhancement.united states goldfaden,cir.obstruction of justice also includes giving a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed the official investigation,cmt.g.
gonzales does even challenge the obstruction of justice finding based on perjury at the sentencing hearing.this finding,which is not clearly erroneous,alone would be sufficient for a section enhancement.we affirm the sentencing court finding of obstruction.
xix.amendment of the psr 
gonzales challenges the district court denial of his motion to amend and clarify the judgment and presentence report to more clearly reflect that the court did not find for sentencing purposes that gonzales was guilty of aggravated assault or of use of a dangerous weapon and to require an amendment to the psr expressly so stating.
gonzales,who was sentenced on february,filed his notice of appeal on february.on february,gonzales filed his above described motion to clarify and to amend the psr.the district court denied the motion in a march,order.gonzales february notice of appeal obviously mentions neither the february motion nor the court ruling thereon,and gonzales has neither filed a new notice of appeal nor amended the february notice of appeal.consequently this matter is not properly before us.see fed.c b.contrary to gonzales contention,fed.b b c are inapplicable because,even when liberally construed,gonzales february motion is not one of the three types of motions listed in rule b a 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is 
none of the defendants testified before the jury.
at the beginning of trial,immediately prior to opening statements by counsel,the court instructed the jury in part as follows the united states position in this case is that when the defendants encountered serafin carrera they used a certain amount of force resulting in an injury to carrera neck.the united states does not allege in the indictment that the amount of force used in the initial encounter with carrera in which he was taken down to the floor was criminally excessive.the united states alleges in count of the indictment that after that initial encounter,defendant carols reyna willfully used excessive force against serafin carrera by striking him about the body causing bodily injury.i told you that the government does not allege in the indictment that the amount of force used in the initial encounter with carrera,in which he wa
