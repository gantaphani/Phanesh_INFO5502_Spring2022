gustavo pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the united states after having been deported,in violation of.appeals his sentence,including a crime of violence enhancement,on the following grounds the provisions in b are unconstitutional,the district court erroneously sentenced him under the mandatory sentencing guidelines regime found unconstitutional in united states booker and the district court erroneously concluded that burglary conviction under.penal code constitutes burglary of a dwelling,a specifically enumerated crime of violence under section of the united states sentencing guidelines.for the reasons that follow,we vacate sentence and remand for resentencing in light of booker.
concedes that his constitutional challenge to b is foreclosed by united and raises the issue here solely to preserve it for supreme court review.but correctly asserts that the district court erred in sentencing him under the sentencing guidelines regime preserved this error in the district court,and the government has not met its arduous burden of establishing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt therefore,we vacate sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.
in the interest of judicial efficiency and to provide guidance on remand we now consider whether prior burglary conviction is a crime of violence under section of the guidelines the application notes to section state that an offense is a crime of violence if it has the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another as an element of the offense,or it qualifies as one of several specifically enumerated offenses the government contends only that burglary conviction constitutes a specifically enumerated offense,namely burglary of a dwelling therefore,we do not consider whether physical force is an element of the offense.
we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo in determining whether a prior offense is equivalent to an enumerated offense that is not defined in the guidelines,like burglary of a dwelling,we have said that we must define the enumerated offense according to its generic,contemporary meaning and should rely on a uniform definition,regardless of the labels employed by the various states criminal codes.we have also said that we must apply a common sense approach in determining whether a prior conviction constitutes an enumerated offense as that offense is understood in its ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning.if the statute of conviction is overly broad,we may also examine certain adjudicative records to determine whether the prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense these records are generally limited to the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of the plea colloquy,and any explicit factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.
the government concedes that the california burglary statute under which was convicted includes offenses other than those that categorically qualify as burglary of a dwelling because the statute encompasses both dwellings and.but the government contends that the criminal complaint to which pleaded guilty establishes that he was in fact convicted of burglary of a dwelling.although neither the judgment of conviction nor the charging document is part of the record,concedes that he pleaded guilty to a criminal complaint charging him with a violation of california penal code section,a felony,in that on or about june,in the county of riverside,state of california,he did wilfully and unlawfully enter a certain building,to wit,an inhabited dwelling house,with intent to commit theft and a felony.
section of the california penal code provides 
every person who enters any house,room,apartment,tenement,shop,warehouse,store,mill,barn,stable,outhouse or other building,tent,vessel,as defined in section of the harbors and navigation code,floating home,as defined in subdivision d of section of the health and safety code,railroad car,locked or sealed cargo container,whether or not mounted on a vehicle,trailer coach,as defined in section of the vehicle code,any house car,as defined in section of the vehicle code,inhabited camper,as defined in section of the vehicle code,vehicle as defined by the vehicle code,when the doors are locked,aircraft as defined by section of the public utilities code,or mine or any underground portion thereof,with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.as used in this chapter,inhabited means currently being used for dwelling purposes,whether occupied or not.a house,trailer,vessel designed for habitation,or portion of a building is currently being used for dwelling purposes if,at the time of the burglary,it was not occupied solely because a natural or other disaster caused the occupants to leave the premises 
section of the california penal code further provides that 
a every burglary of an inhabited dwelling house,vessel,as defined in the harbors and navigation code,which is inhabited and designed for habitation,floating home,as defined in subdivision d of section of the health and safety code,or trailer coach,as defined by the vehicle code,or the inhabited portion of any other building,is burglary of the first degree.
b all other kinds of burglary are of the second degree 
does not dispute that he pleaded guilty to burglary of a building,to wit,an inhabited dwelling house,and he does not argue that the district court improperly considered the criminal complaint in determining whether his burglary conviction constituted a crime of violence.but he argues that even the crime charged in the criminal complaint is too broad to qualify as burglary of a dwelling because california courts construe the terms building and inhabited dwelling house to include structures such as and vessels used for human and such structures do not fall within the scope of generic burglary as defined by the supreme court in taylor united states 
in taylor the supreme court construed the term burglary as used in e,which is a sentencing enhancement enacted as part of the career criminals amendment act of.the supreme court concluded that the definition of burglary should not be derived from the,which limited the offense to breaking and entering the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony,because the contemporary understanding of burglary has diverged a long way from its roots.instead,congress intended a broader definition of the term.the court also concluded that application of the enhancement should not depend on whether a crime is specifically denominated burglary under state law because of the variations,and overbreadth,in the scope of many state burglary statutes instead,the court said,congress meant by burglary the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states,but it must have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various states criminal codes.the court thus determined that the generic,contemporary meaning of burglary contains at least the following elements an unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or other structure,with intent to commit a crime.
as examples of state statutes that are overly broad,and thus not categorically subject to a section e enhancement,the supreme court mentioned statutes that include places other than buildings,such as automobiles,vending machines,booths,tents,boats,vessels,and railroad cars the court also noted the overbreadth of california burglary statute,which includes such acts as shoplifting and theft of goods from a locked but unoccupied automobile.but the court said that a conviction under an overly broad statute could nonetheless result in an enhancement if the charging documents and certain other conclusive adjudicative records establish that the defendant was convicted of generic burglary 
it is from the supreme court discussion of overly broad burglary statutes that derives his argument that burglary of a dwelling is but a narrow subset of burglary that can not extend to places or structures excluded from the definition
