karayana hadayat,an indonesian national,arrived in the united states in on a visitor visa.soon thereafter,his brother,a citizen,filed a visa petition on hadayat behalf.although the petition was approved,no visa was immediately available.once his visitor visa expired,the only legal option available to hadayat was to return to indonesia and await action on his brother petition.hadayat chose another path he decided to stay in the united states unlawfully and wait until a permanent resident visa became available,hoping in the meantime not to attract the attention of immigration authorities.this waiting game came to an abrupt end in when hadayat registered with the department of homeland security dhs pursuant to the national security registration system nseers and was immediately placed into removal proceedings.although he initially agreed to a voluntary departure order,just before his deadline to depart hadayat filed a motion to reopen with the immigration judge ij,arguing that he was entitled to remain in the united states based on his petition.the ij denied hadayat motion to reopen and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed.hadayat filed a motion for reconsideration with the bia,which was also unsuccessful.
hadayat now contends that the bia erred in denying his motion for reconsideration.he also raises the new argument that he was unconstitutionally targeted for registration and removal based on his ethnicity and religion.because we conclude that hadayat approved visa petition does not,as a matter of law,allow him to remain in the united states,and because we lack jurisdiction over hadayat challenge to the attorney general decision to commence proceedings against him,we affirm the bia decision.
hadayat arrived in the united states on january.hadayat brother,derry bankston,filed an petition for alien relative on hadayat behalf on june.on july,hadayat visitor visa expired.in late,bankston received notice from the then immigration and naturalization service that hadayat petition had been approved.the notice stated,however,that hadayat was not eligible to file an adjustment of status application presumably because no visa was currently available.
in august,the department of justice published the final rule enacting the nseers program,explaining that r ecent terrorist incidents have underscored the need to broaden the special registration requirements for nonimmigrant aliens from certain designated countries whose presence in the united states requires closer monitoring,to require that they provide specific information at regular intervals to ensure their compliance with the terms of their visas and admission,and to ensure that they depart the united states at the end of their authorized stay.registration and monitoring of certain nonimmigrants.a later notice specifically required nonimmigrant male nationals and citizens of indonesia to register with the dhs by march,registration of certain nonimmigrant aliens from designated countries,a deadline that was later extended to april.registration of certain nonimmigrant aliens from designated countries.hadayat registered on april,and was issued a notice to appear nta the same day,charging that he had overstayed his visitor visa.
on september,hadayat appeared before an ij.he admitted that he was out of status and asked for and received a voluntary departure order.this order required hadayat to leave the united states by december.shortly after the hearing,bankston filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to enjoin the dhs from removing his brother,contending that hadayat was entitled to remain in the united states based on the approved visa petition and challenging the constitutionality of nseers.in late,the district court dismissed the case,concluding that bankston lacked standing to bring these claims on behalf of his brother.
four days before his required departure date,hadayat filed a motion to reopen with the ij,citing his approved visa petition and the pending federal lawsuit as grounds for a new hearing.he also filed a request for an extension of his voluntary departure date with the district director of the chicago office of the dhs.the record does not reveal the district director response to this request.december came and went,and hadayat did not leave the united states.eventually,on february,the ij denied hadayat motion to reopen,explaining that 
the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under section i.the date for visa petitions filed by usc brothers is february.since the petition filed by the respondent brother was filed on january,he is at least seven years away from visa availability.
under matter of shaar,i n bia,when an alien requests and receives voluntary departure,he must depart within the allotted time,otherwise he is barred from adjustment of status.in this case,the respondent was given the appropriate warnings at his hearing on september,and yet has remained in the after voluntary departure expired.
hadayat appealed.the bia affirmed on the first ground only,explaining that t he fact that he is a beneficiary of an approved visa petition,without evidence that he has a current priority date,is insufficient to support a motion to reopen.hadayat did not file a petition for review from this order.
instead,he filed a motion for reconsideration with the bia,contending that our decision in subhan ashcroft,cir,dictated a result in his favor.the bia disagreed,distinguishing subhan as a case concerning the denial of a continuance motion where the immigration judge failed to give a reasoned explanation of the denial.in hadayat case,the bia explained,the ij gave a reasoned explanation why he denied the respondent motion to reopen.the bia also reiterated that hadayat was ineligible to adjust his status because no visa was immediately available and added that his failure to comply with the voluntary departure order created a further bar.hadayat petitioned for review of this order.
we have jurisdiction over hadayat petition for review of the bia denial of his motion for reconsideration pursuant to b.we review the bia denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion.gonzales,cir.
section i of the immigration and nationality act permits certain persons who entered the united states without inspection or otherwise violated their immigration therefore would otherwise be ineligible to apply for adjustment of status from within the united seek adjustment nonetheless if a petition was filed on their behalf prior to april,and they pay a penalty.i.if an alien satisfies these criteria,the attorney general may adjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if a the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence and b an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.i.although beneficiaries of petitions properly filed and approved under i were grandfathered if their visas were not immediately available,a n alien nonimmigrant status is not affected by the fact that he or she is a grandfathered alien.l.what is grandfathered,in other words,is the basic eligibility for adjustment in all other respects the individual remains a nonimmigrant that is,a person with no legal right to remain in the united states unless and until an immigrant visa becomes available.
hadayat argues that this interpretation,which means that he is still subject to removal despite the approval of his brother petition,defeats the very purpose and intent of i.an approved visa petition under i,however,is not a visa,but,rather,is merely a preliminary step in the visa application process.it does not guarantee that a visa will be issued,nor does it grant the alien any right to remain in the united states.labojewski gonzales,cir quotation marks omitted.in other words,as a grandfathered alien,hadayat was eligible to adjust his status at some future date when a visa became available,but he was not sheltered from being removed from the united states in the meantime.
admittedly,it might seem as if the government is being allowed to re
