when this petitioner case was before us over six years ago we remanded,holding that the board of immigration appeals bia and immigration judge ij had erred as a matter of law in ruling that the petitioner was not eligible for asylum consideration.see vukmirovic ashcroft,cir vukmirovic i.unfortunately after remand petitioner newly retained counsel was not immediately able to contact the petitioner to file a notice of appearance the immigration court gave notice of the new hearing to his old counsel who did nothing,and vukmirovic was ordered deported in absentia.the bia denied reopening even after vukmirovic new counsel was able to appear and explain the situation.we now hold that this case presents exceptional circumstances within the meaning of the controlling statute,f,and remand for the asylum hearing we held petitioner was entitled to in.
background 
this case goes back to when pedrag vukmirovic,a bosnian serb,fled the violence in the former yugoslavia to come to the united states.he applied for asylum soon after he arrived,and then in married a united states citizen.at two subsequent deportation hearings vukmirovic sought continuances to allow the immigration and naturalization service ins to process his application for adjustment of status from his marriage,but the ij denied those requests and proceeded to order him deported.the record does not indicate whether he is still married.
vukmirovic has never had a ruling on the merits of his asylum application.at his asylum hearing the ij effectively took over the proceedings,often interrupting him to ask questions.see vukmirovic i,at the ij commenced the hearing by conducting the examination of vukmirovic himself it was only after the ij concluded his questioning that he allowed vukmirovic counsel to begin presenting his case.even after vukmirovic began presenting his case,the ij frequently interrupted to ask a series of questions.in the testimony key to our ruling,vukmirovic testified that in,he had joined an group,affiliated with the serbian orthodox religion,whose job it was to defend his town against the attacks of bosnian croats.bosnian croats attacked vukmirovic town on several occasions,and vukmirovic attempted to repel these attacks using only knives and sticks.
on the basis of this testimony,the ij determined that vukmirovic was a persecutor and statutorily barred from asylum,see a,never reaching the merits of his asylum claim.the bia issued a summary affirmance.
attorney steve paek had represented vukmirovic before the bia,but when vukmirovic sought review of the ij decision in this court he retained attorney david gardner to represent him.in a published opinion,we held that the persecutor bar did not apply because vukmirovic was acting in self defense.see vukmirovic i,at.we granted the petition for review and remanded the case to the bia for further proceedings.see id.at.
on remand,however,due to an unfortunate and unusual confluence of events,the subsequent proceedings ordered by this court never occurred.the mandate in vukmirovic i issued on june,and the bia remanded the case to the immigration court on september.although gardner was vukmirovic counsel,because paek had represented vukmirovic before the bia,the bia provided notice of the remand only to paek.see,f the bia did not provide personal notice to vukmirovic.
after retaining gardner,vukmirovic left his listed permanent residence.according to his declaration,he did not relocate to a new address,but traveled and stayed for short periods of time with friends and different roommates,and as a result gardner was unable to contact him.this prevented gardner from filing a notice of appearance before the immigration court,because the notice of appearance form explicitly requires the alien consent to the entry of a representative appearance before the immigration court.see executive office for immigration review,form when an appearance is made by a person acting in a representative capacity,personal appearance or signature shall constitute a representation that is authorized to represent individuals.
when the immigration court sent notice of the asylum hearing to paek,setting a date of hearing of december,it did not send notice to vukmirovic home address.paek did not inform the immigration court that he was no longer representing vukmirovic,and does not appear to have made any effort to contact his former client to alert him to the new proceedings.as gardner had not yet filed a notice of appearance,gardner did not know of the december hearing.
when neither vukmirovic nor anyone representing him appeared for the december hearing,the ij set a new hearing date of january,and mailed notice,again to paek,and also to vukmirovic home address.vukmirovic,still away,did not receive the notice and was under the mistaken impression that gardner would receive any correspondence related to his case.paek received notice of the january hearing but again neither withdrew nor made any effort to contact vukmirovic.gardner,still unable to file a notice of appearance,again did not receive any notice.when no one appeared at the january hearing,the ij ordered vukmirovic removed in absentia.contrary to the dissent assertions,vukmirovic did not disappear.he was arrested at work within a few weeks and placed into detention.
vukmirovic immediately contacted gardner after the arrest.when gardner learned what had transpired,he quickly filed a motion to reopen on february,and promptly filed a notice of appearance,showing vukmirovic consent,on february.
the ij denied the motion to reopen and ruled that the notice to vukmirovic home address satisfied due process.the ij also held that,even though paek had not represented vukmirovic in his successful petition in this court,there was no error in notifying paek as vukmirovic counsel because gardner had not filed a notice of appearance.on appeal,the bia affirmed the ij due process ruling and additionally found that vukmirovic had not demonstrated that the absence from his hearing was due to exceptional circumstances within the meaning of the applicable statute.f singh ins,cir.the bia cited our decision in ins,cir per curiam,and ruled that,as a matter of law,exceptional circumstances could not exist because vukmirovic was seeking discretionary relief in the form of asylum.
discussion 
vukmirovic argues that the immigration court provided constitutionally inadequate notice of the hearings,and that the exceptional circumstances of his case warrant granting the motion to reopen.we agree with vukmirovic that this case presents exceptional circumstances under the relevant statute and therefore do not reach the due process question.see lee walters,f d,cir stating that courts should avoid reaching constitutional issues unless it is necessary to do so.
vukmirovic is entitled to recision of his in absentia deportation order if he demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.c a.the controlling statute defined exceptional circumstances as circumstances such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien,but not including less compelling circumstances beyond the control of the alien.f recodified at e defining exceptional circumstances as exceptional circumstances such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien,serious illness of the alien,or serious illness or death of the spouse,child,or parent of the alien,but not including less compelling circumstances beyond the control of the alien we have said that the determination of whether exceptional circumstances exist is based on the particularized facts presented in each case,see singh ins,cir citation omitted,and have never pointed to a single circumstance as either qualifying or disqualifying a situation from consideration as exceptional.
singh is our leading case interpreting the term exceptional circumstances.the petitioner in singh had obtained several continuances of his deportation hearing to obtain adjustment of status due to his marriage to a united states citizen.id.at.after becoming facially eligible for adjustment,he drove with his family to a deportation hearing
