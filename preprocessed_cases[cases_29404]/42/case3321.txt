sometimes,as delmore schwartz and tolian soran have observed,time is the fire in which we burn.the elim church of god wanted to employ romeo fulga,who was present in the united states on a student visa,as a youth pastor.however,in dreams begin responsibilities and,in order to work at the church,fulga was required to obtain an immigrant visa.as a first step,the church applied for and received a labor certification from the department of labor that was valid indefinitely when issued.unfortunately,the church did not immediately proceed with the subsequent steps for fulga to obtain an employment visa.in the interim,the department of labor issued new regulations providing that a labor certification expired after days unless a visa application was filed or,in the case of labor certification holders like the church,days after the regulation became final.the church did not act until well after that period.when it did finally act,the church discovered that its certification had expired.
the church contends that it was entitled to personal notice and that the regulation had an impermissible retroactive effect.however,we agree with the district court that publication of the proposed and final rules in the federal register afforded adequate notice of the revision,and that the regulation was not impermissibly retroactive.
our unfortunate prospective pastor,romeo fulga,is a native and citizen of romania who came to the united states in on a student visa.after transferring schools several times,fulga eventually settled in bellevue,washington.in,fulga began attending elim church of god in bellevue and started volunteering at the church with the hope of eventually becoming a pastor.soon after,church officials started the process of employing fulga as a youth pastor.
the first step in the process to obtain an immigrant visa is to apply for a labor certification from the united states department of labor.the department must certify that there are not sufficient american workers to perform the work and that employing an alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of american workers.a a i.the church submitted an application for a labor certification on fulga behalf.the department approved the application,and the church received the labor certification dated july.
once a labor certification is approved,the employer must file an immigrant petition for alien worker,known as a form i,so that united states citizenship and immigration services uscis can classify the worker in the appropriate preference category fulga and church officials filled out a form i and provided supporting documentation to their attorney.however,their attorney never filed the i petition.fulga and the church then hired a new attorney,who also never acted on their petition.finally,in late,fulga and the church hired their current attorney,who informed them that the odds were against them and the situation grim because uscis would probably deny the church i petition due to an intervening change in the regulations.
when the department approved the church labor certification in,the applicable regulation provided,except as provided in paragraph d of this section,a labor certification is valid indefinitely.a thus,until,a granted labor certification existed in a state unaffected by time.
but what is given by the government can sometimes be taken away and,in,the status of labor certifications unbounded by time was disrupted.prompted by circumstances fed by improper use of labor certifications,the department published a notice of proposed rulemaking detailing a potential change to the regulation designed in part to address an emerging black market for approved labor certifications.labor certification for the permanent employment of aliens in the united states,proposed,codified as amended at pt.the notice stated that because the department has traditionally allowed employers to substitute an alien named on a pending or approved labor certification with another prospective alien employee,and because labor certifications are valid indefinitely,labor certifications had become a commodity which can be sold by unscrupulous employers,attorneys,and agents to those seeking a green card.id.at.the proposed rule would prohibit substitution and provide that a certification would expire if not filed with an i petition within days of the department approval of the certification.id.at.labor certifications that were already approved would expire if not filed in support of a petition within days of the effective date of the final rule.id.
on may,the department published its final rule.see labor certification for the permanent employment of aliens in the united states.may,codified at pt.the final rule amended to provide that a labor certification expires if not filed within days of the approval,rather than the days in the proposed rule.at.the department stated that limiting the period of validity of a certification more closely adheres to the statutory text requiring the determination about the availability of and effects on american workers to be made at the time of the application for admission than would an indefinite period of validity.id.at.labor certifications approved before july,the effective date of the rule would expire if not filed in support of a form i petition with the department of homeland security within calendar days of july.id.at b.thus,as of july,time began running out on the church labor certification,with the application process left unfinished.
a year and a half after the regulation effective date,on january,the church filed an i petition on fulga behalf,which uscis rejected.fulga and the church then sued the department and uscis,alleging that enforcing the day deadline without providing actual notice constituted an impermissible retroactive rule.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for the government defendants.the court held that the regulation text did not preclude the government from setting an expiration date.furthermore,it held that publication of the proposed and final rules in the federal register afforded the plaintiffs legally sufficient notice.
whether a regulation may be applied retroactively is a question of law that we review de novo.sinotes cruz gonzales,cir.we begin with the fundamental principle that r etroactivity is not favored in the law.bowen georgetown.therefore,administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.id.we use a process to determine whether a statute or rule should apply retroactively.first,we ask whether there is a clear indication from congress that a law should apply retroactively.hernandez de anderson gonzales,cir.when,as here,an administrative rule is at issue,the inquiry is whether congress has expressly conferred power on the agency to promulgate rules with retroactive effect and,if so,whether the agency clearly intended for the rule to have retroactive effect.durable dep t of labor,cir see also bowen,u.at holding that the medicare act did not grant agency the authority to promulgate retroactive cost limits mejia gonzales,cir holding that regulation did not clearly state that it applied retroactively.
if congress has not granted the authority to promulgate retroactive rules,we then assess whether application of the regulation would have a retroactive effect.mejia,at.if so,we do not apply the regulation to the plaintiffs because we presume that,absent a clear expression of congressional intent,congress intended the regulation to apply only prospectively.see camins gonzales,cir.
in our case,the government properly concedes that congress did not expressly grant the department of labor authority to promulgate retroactive rules of this sort.therefore,we proceed to the second step of the analysis whether the regulation has a retroactive effect and the church labor certification can be restored to its prior state.
a rule that takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,must be deemed retrospectiv
