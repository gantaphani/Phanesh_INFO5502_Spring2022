background 
vali boci was born on august,in lazarat in the southern part of albania.on march,he married dhurata.historically,vali family associated with the democratic party,and,in,during the communist regime,vali uncle ali fled albania for the united states.upon the ali flight,the communist government targeted the boci family.from to,the government detained vali father,nesim boci,and prevented his cousins from attending school.in,the communist regime fell,and the elections brought the democratic party into power.two of vali uncles,bujar and zagoll mele,worked as police officers while the democratic party was in control.in,vali,who previously was involved in the communist party,joined the democratic party.on january,vali became a member of the democratic party.
in late and early,albania was in chaos following the collapse of the pyramid schemes amid the chaos,the socialist party gained power and subsequently targeted vali family as democratic party supporters.the socialist party promptly fired vali two uncles,who had been police officers for more than five years.then,on february,someone placed an explosive near dhurata house,destroying the right side of it.vali believes the purpose of this explosion was to kill his wife family,but,fortunately,the blast only injured dhurata family members.although dhurata father reported the explosion to the police,they never charged or arrested anyone for the offense.the police came to the scene of the accident,but they did not take any photographs or ask any questions.later that same year,on september,someone burned down dhurata father warehouse.
in october,during local elections,vali acted as an observer at a polling station,where he witnessed and took notes of numerous irregularities.when the police learned of his activities,they took him outside,asked to see his notes,and threatened to detain him if he made the notes public.despite the officers threats,vali later gave his notes to the proper authorities.although observers from other political parties also took notes during the election,the police did not detain or question them.
in early,vali decided to flee albania after an unknown person murdered his cousin,who was also a democratic party member.on march,fearing for their lives,vali and dhurata used italian passports to travel to the united states.vali testified that he believed he would be placed in jail or killed if he returned to albania.presently,with the exception of his sister living in italy and his uncle living in the united states,vali family,including his parents,siblings,aunts,and uncles,live in albania.dhurata parents also remain in albania.
dhurata boci corroborated her husband testimony,with some additional information.dhurata stated that she was twenty years old and was not a member of any albanian political party,although her husband and father were both members of the democratic party.her father participated in democratic meetings and rallies,but dhurata did not attend any of those meetings.she did,however,discuss the meetings with her father.according to dhurata,the socialist party feared that her father would disclose former acts of the communist party to the democratic party.she also believed that socialists perpetrated the explosion at her home on february,because of her father democratic party membership.although she was present on the night in question,she did not see who placed the explosives near the house.
dhurata testified that beginning in,individuals threatened and harassed her on the way to school they told dhurata that if her father did not change his way and join the socialist party,she would be killed.she received these threats until she left albania.dhurata stated that she feared returning to albania because she believed members of the socialist party would kill her.
throughout the hearing,the ij repeatedly questioned the bocis.at several different times,the ij expressed impatience and asked the bocis attorney to move things along.he cut off a line of questioning about the boci family political history,noting that its relevance and probative value were weak and that time was limited.at least two different times,the ij criticized the boci attorney for challenging the translation of questions,stating,the attorney for the respondent is not interpreting.he can not have two roles.he ca act as interpreter and as advocate.transcript of immigration hearing at,boci gonzales,nos.and,hereinafter tr.the ij also expressed impatience with vali boci when he offered extra information,did not give a direct answer to a question on cross examination,or began speaking before the government lawyer finished a question 
at one point in the hearing,the bocis attorney remarked,with all due respect,your honor,the the sic attitude that coming across at this point is very confrontational.tr.at.after disagreeing with the attorney assessment,the ij added,counsel,counsel,counsel,listen to me.we only have so much time.it now approximately.all right.we started the case at.all right all right.we only have so much time.id.
the bocis petition this court for review,claiming that the ij and bia erred in finding that they were ineligible for relief and alleging that they were denied due process of law.
ii.discussion 
where,as here,the bia summarily adopts the ij decision,this court reviews the ij factual findings and reasoning as though they were the board.mousa ins,cir.we must uphold the bia denial of relief so long as it is supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d internal quotation and citation omitted.reversal is appropriate only if the record compels granting the applicant asylum.id.asylum is available to persons who have suffered past persecution or have a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a feto gonzales,cir.here,the bocis point to their membership in and association with the democratic party as well as their membership in the social groups comprised of their respective families.
an applicant who successfully proves past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future persecution,but the government can rebut that presumption by showing a change in conditions in an applicant homeland.see,gjerazi gonzales,cir.alternatively,an applicant demonstrates a fear of future persecution if his or her fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable in light of credible evidence.id.
we have defined persecution as punishment or the infliction of harm for political,religious,or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.dandan ashcroft,cir citations and quotations omitted.although the term includes actions less severe than threats to life or freedom,actions must rise above the level of mere harassment to constitute persecution.id.in fact,we have noted that in order to be an act of persecution,the behavior in question must threaten death,imprisonment,or the infliction of substantial harm or suffering.sharif ins,cir.
past persecution or fear of future persecution 
petitioners seeking to establish past persecution must satisfy a heavy evidentiary burden.indeed,our standard on review is difficult to meet without powerful and moving evidence.dandan,at.a survey of analogous cases demonstrates that the bocis have not met this exacting standard because their evidence does not compel a finding of past persecution.
in cecaj gonzales,we vacated the removal order of an albanian democrat,noting numerous
