iqbal hussain,a native and citizen of pakistan,seeks review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture cat and rejecting his request for voluntary departure.the record supports the bia conclusions.we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of requests for voluntary departure.we deny hussain petition for review in part,and dismiss it in part.
hussain entered the united states without inspection on june.on october,the department of homeland security issued a notice to appear,charging hussain as a removable alien because of his presence in the united states without admission or parole.on may,hussain conceded removability and filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal based on political persecution,and protection under the cat.in the alternative,hussain requested voluntary departure.hearings before an immigration judge ij occurred on march,by which point hussain had abandoned his application for asylum.
hussain testified that he previously faced persecution for his political beliefs while he served as a secretary general of the pakistan muslim league in his village in the swat region of pakistan.he claimed that during a dispute over hussain handling of a drainage project,which he admitted was a personal matter,the father of a political rival threw a shoe at him and broke his hand.the police arrested this man but later released him.later,in early,the individual,armed with a gun,was looking for but did not find hussain,and hussain left the village for karachi.hussain also claimed that after he left the village,he heard from his family that the police repeatedly had come looking for him.hussain added that he feared returning to pakistan because the same political rival remained in the village,he felt the police would not protect him,and he was concerned about his ability to support his family financially.in his application,though not at the hearing,hussain also claimed that he feared the government would torture him based on the government alleged practice of torturing and killing the political opposition.
in an oral decision on march,the ij held that hussain had failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.the ij determined that hussain could not show past persecution on political grounds because he never established what political views he held.nor did hussain claims to have had his hand broken and to have been sought by a man with a gun qualify as persecution.the ij further concluded that hussain had presented no evidence showing an objective fear of future persecution on political grounds.his testimony regarding his fears of returning to pakistan centered on his future economic welfare.the ij similarly rejected hussain claim of future persecution based on his assertion that the police were looking for him,since hussain hypothesized that the police merely may have been investigating allegations that hussain made personal use of bank loans.
the ij also expressed serious reservations about hussain credibility.the ij cited hussain misleading testimony regarding the dates of his children births,the notarization of his marriage certificate,his payment for a work permit,and his application for adjustment of status based on a fraudulent marriage.
the ij also found that hussain cat protection claim failed because t here is no evidence whatsoever in the record that the court could find that hussain would be tortured by officials of the government upon his return to pakistan.finally,the ij denied the request for voluntary departure on the grounds that hussain had illegally purchased work authorization,had failed to file tax returns,had applied for adjustment of status based on a marriage,and had not shown that he could post the voluntary departure bond.
the bia affirmed the ij decision in an opinion issued on august.it agreed that the experiences described by respondent do not amount to past persecution and that the record did not support a finding that hussain had an objective fear of future persecution.the bia further agreed with the ij finding that nothing in the record suggested hussain was at risk of being tortured if he returned to pakistan and that he thus failed to show eligibility for cat relief.the bia then affirmed the ij discretionary denial of voluntary departure for substantially the same reasons as the ij.finally,the bia rejected hussain motion to remand on the basis of alleged changes in country conditions in pakistan,which hussain had filed during the pendency of the appeal.
this petition for review followed.
we review the agency factual determinations by applying the deferential substantial evidence standard.touch holder,cir.so long as reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole supports these determinations,we must accept them.shahari gonz√°les,cir quoting ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.under this test,we reverse only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.budiono mukasey,cir quoting b b.we review both the ij and bia opinions when,as here,the bia affirmed the ij ruling but also analyzed various bases for the ij conclusions.limani mukasey,cir.
withholding of removal 
applicants for withholding of removal bear the burden of showing that their life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b.applicants can satisfy this burden by showing that they were subject to past persecution,which carries the rebuttable presumption that the applicant will be subject to future persecution.b.alternately,applicants can demonstrate that they will more likely than not face future persecution.b.
here,substantial evidence supports the determination that hussain neither faced past persecution nor a likelihood of future persecution.hussain argues that because his broken hand constituted tangible physical harm,the bia and the ij erred in concluding that he had not suffered past persecution.but the law of this circuit is clear that not every instance of physical harm rises to the level of persecution,for t o qualify as persecution,a person experience must rise above unpleasantness,harassment,and even basic suffering.jorgji mukasey,cir quoting nelson ins,cir.because we have found an absence of persecution even in cases where the physical harm was more severe and more clearly politically motivated,we can not conclude that the bia and the ij erred in dismissing hussain allegations of past persecution.see,journal keisler,cir no persecution where members of rival political party looked for applicant at his home and later hit applicant on the head and shoulders bocova gonzales,cir no persecution where members of police beat applicant in two separate incidents and threatened him with death.
moreover,hussain experiences comprise two separate events that stemmed from a private dispute with a single individual over a drainage project.on the basis of the record,hussain was not subjected to systematic maltreatment rising to the level of persecution,as opposed to a series of isolated incidents.topalli gonzales,cir see also gonzales,cir.we can not find that the evidence compels a conclusion that hussain suffered past persecution.
substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that hussain did not show a fear of future persecution.hussain does not challenge the ij and the bia conclusion that he presented insufficient evidence of his fears of future persecution.in his brief before this court,he instead contends for the first time that the taliban recent targeting of pakistanis in the swat region independently establishes hussain fear of future persecution.because we can not entertain new arguments or new factual predicates for old arguments on appeal,we will not evaluate this claim.see cochran quest software,cir.
cat protection 
the record amply supports the conclusion that hussain presented no evidence regarding the likelihood of his being tortured upon his return to pakistan.applicants are entitled to cat protection only if
