ernesto barajas,a united states citizen,appeals the federal district court denial of his motion to suppress.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the federal district court denial of barajas motion.
factual and procedural background 
in the early morning of april,barajas and nine illegal aliens were traveling north on farm to market road fm in a large burgundy colored sedan sedan.upon reaching state road sr,barajas turned left and began traveling west.
at the same time,united states border patrol agents hector salazar and jesus ramos collectively agents were on a roving patrol traveling east on sr west of fm.the agents were in a marked vehicle,with their headlights on,observing traffic.at the time,agent hector salazar salazar was a veteran with the united states border patrol,and agent jesus ramos had been with the united states border patrol for months.the agents were aware that this was a common route and area for alien smuggling and approximately miles north of our border with mexico.moreover,salazar had apprehended illegal aliens in the area and conducted investigatory stops of low riding vehicles from which he had apprehended illegal aliens.
at approximately,after not seeing any vehicles for a few minutes,the agents noticed a set of headlights coming toward them in the eastern horizon.the agents pulled their vehicle over onto the south side of sr and positioned it so that their vehicle faced a northeasterly direction.they were on an unimproved shoulder about ten feet from sr eastbound lane.with their headlights on,the agents waited until the vehicle passed.as the vehicle passed,the agents observed the sedan,traveling at a normal speed,riding low in the back with heavily tinted windows that prohibited them from viewing the inside.
the agents decided to follow the sedan.they turned their vehicle around and headed west on sr.the sedan drastically slowed and began to weave from side to side within its lane.the agents attempted to ascertain the number of occupants in the sedan,but were unsuccessful because of the heavily tinted windows.the agents decided to make an investigatory stop they turned their emergency patrol lights on.the sedan immediately pulled off the road.as it came to a sudden stop,the sedan doors flew open.barajas,the driver,and nine illegal aliens jumped out and attempted to flee.the agents stopped their vehicle on the sedan passenger side they apprehended barajas and the nine illegal aliens.
the agents took barajas and the nine illegal aliens into custody.they read them their miranda rights.barajas signed an form acknowledging that the agents had read him his rights and that he waived those rights.barajas then admitted that he was transporting illegal aliens and that he knew his conduct was illegal.
in the indictment,the grand jury charged barajas with two counts of violating a a ii and a v ii.barajas filed a motion to suppress all of the evidence from the investigatory stop and all statements made thereafter on the basis that the agents suspicion that the sedan occupants were involved in illegal activity was not reasonable,and thus,violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.on june,the federal district court heard the motion.the trial court denied the motion based on the totality of the circumstances known to the agents when they made the investigatory stop and the agents experience in evaluating such circumstances.pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a,barajas voluntarily entered a conditional plea of guilty subject to his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.on october,the trial court accepted barajas guilty plea and entered its judgment.later that same day barajas filed his notice of appeal.
discussion 
the appellant,barajas,argues that the investigatory stop violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures because the agents suspicion that the sedan occupants were involved in illegal activity was not reasonable.we disagree.we hold that the agents did not violate barajas fourth amendment rights when they conducted the investigatory stop because the agents suspicion that the occupants were involved in illegal activity was reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances known to the agents when they stopped the sedan and their experience in evaluating such circumstances.accordingly,the federal district court did not err when it denied barajas motion to suppress.
standard of review 
we review a federal district court findings of fact on a motion to suppress for clear error.see united states ceniceros,cir.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the trial court.see united states,cir.a federal district court findings of fact are not clearly erroneous unless we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.see id.a federal district court conclusion that reasonable suspicion of illegal activity existed is a legal conclusion subject to de novo review see id.at.
the federal district court did not err when it denied barajas motion to suppress 
generally,on a motion to suppress,the defendant has the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the evidence in question was obtained in violation of her constitutional rights.see united states roch,cir united states de la fuente,cir,cert denied,d.there are situations,however,where the burden shifts to the government.see id.when the government searches or seizes a defendant without a warrant,the government bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the search or seizure was constitutional see id.therefore,in the instant case,since the agents conducted an investigatory stop without a warrant,the government bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the investigatory stop was constitutional.
the fourth amendment provides that t he right of the people to be free in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated bond united states,d quoting const.amend.iv.a united states border patrol agent temporary detention of an occupant of a vehicle for investigatory purposes while on roving patrol is constitutional if,at a minimum,the agent reasonably suspects that an occupant of the vehicle is involved in illegal activity.see united states,d,at united states,cir ceniceros,at.an unparticularized suspicion or hunch will not suffice,but proof that an occupant of the vehicle is involved in illegal activity by a preponderance of the evidence is not required.see united states sokolow,d ceniceros,at united states gonzalez,cir.rather,the agent suspicion is reasonable if it is based on specific and articulable facts and the rational inferences that can be drawn therefrom.see,at,at,at ceniceros,at.
a court may take into account any number of facts when determining whether an agent suspicion was reasonable.see id.these facts may include,but are not limited to an agent experience in detecting illegal activity proximity of the area where the investigatory stop occurred to an international border the area known characteristics for illegal activity information about recent illegal activity in the area the area usual traffic patterns erratic driving or obvious attempts to evade agents the type of vehicle and other characteristics of the vehicle known to the agents to be frequently used in illegal activity including whether the vehicle is riding low or its suspension is modified the number,appearance,and behavior of the occupants of the vehicle.see id.no single fact is determinative.see id.a court must examine each case based on the totality of the circumstances known to the agent when she made the investigatory stop and her experience in evaluating such circumstances.see id.the fourth amendment does not require an agent to eliminate all reasonable possibilities of legal activity before conducting an investigatory stop,nor must every fact weigh in favor of illegal activity for an agent to reasonably suspect that an occupant of the vehicle is involved in an illegal activity.see,at.
the agents were aware of and identified s
