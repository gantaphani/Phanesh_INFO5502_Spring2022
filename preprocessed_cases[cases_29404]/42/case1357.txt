opinion of the court 
this matter comes before us on salvador appeal from a judgment of conviction for transportation of an illegal alien,a a ii and a b ii,which was entered in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania on december,at the conclusion of a bench trial challenges the district court pretrial order,entered november,denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained from a traffic stop conducted by pennsylvania state trooper bradley wagner.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court did not err in denying motion to suppress,and hence we will affirm the judgment of conviction.
background 
the following narrative relies on the district court findings of fact,which are largely based on undisputed testimony given by pennsylvania state trooper bradley wagner.at the time of the events at issue,trooper wagner was an veteran of the pennsylvania state police.during this period of service,trooper wagner wrote hundreds of traffic citations and warnings.appendix app.at.also,as part of his patrol duties,trooper wagner participated in a department of homeland security overtime program named stop,which requires officers zealously to enforce traffic laws.app.at.
on may,trooper wagner was working a stop overtime shift.at,he was tasked to perform traffic control at a traffic incident that occurred on interstate near mercer,pennsylvania.while performing these duties,trooper wagner observed driving a red pickup truck.app.at.during the approach of the truck,trooper wagner noticed what appeared to be a necklace or pendant hanging from the rear view mirror.app.at.he perceived this item to be low hanging,but not quite touching the dashboard.app.at.finally,trooper wagner believed that the item had the potential to obscure the driver vision because the item was not stationary.app.at 
trooper wagner testified that he believed the object hanging from the rearview mirror to be a violation of pennsylvania consolidated statutes c.he further testified that it was his understanding that anything hanging from a rearview mirror is a violation of c app.at.section c provides 
other person shall drive any motor vehicle with any object or material hung from the inside rearview mirror or otherwise hung,placed or attached in such a position as to materially obstruct,obscure or impair the driver vision through the front windshield or any manner as to constitute a safety hazard.
trooper wagner understanding of this pennsylvania statute was flawed.an object hanging from the inside rearview mirror does not contravene c unless it is positioned in such a way as to materially obstruct,obscure or impair the driver vision through the front windshield.see also com.felty.
based on his flawed understanding of c,trooper wagner conducted a traffic stop of the pickup truck.once salvador truck was stopped,trooper wagner obtained identification document a mexican driver license as well as identification documents mexican election cards from other occupants of the truck.trooper wagner then advised that he had been stopped because of the discovered to be a from the rearview mirror.at this point,the passenger volunteered that he was a puerto rican native,but that the rest of the truck occupants were illegal aliens.trooper wagner had the truck wait for approximately ninety minutes so that he could finish his traffic control duties.he then had the truck follow him to the mercer state police stopping en route at mcdonald so that the occupants of the truck could get something to eat.once the group arrived at the police barracks,all of the illegal aliens were taken into custody and transferred to the pittsburgh office of the immigration and customs enforcement division.app.at.though a notice of warning for the rearview mirror obstruction vehicle code violation was issued by trooper wagner approximately two hours after the initial traffic stop,trooper wagner testified that once he discovered that the occupants of the truck were illegal aliens,that discovery trumped everything else.app.at.
the district court found guilty of knowingly transporting an illegal alien pursuant to a a ii and a b ii.now argues for reversal of the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of trooper wagner traffic stop.argued before the district court that the traffic stop was pretextual and was without probable cause since the religious pendant which hung from the defendant rearview mirror was,in fact,no obstruction to the defendant visibility and safe driving.though finding that trooper wagner is mistaken in his belief that anything hanging from a rearview mirror is a violation of the pennsylvania vehicle code,the district court reasoned that the defendant is charged in the instant indictment with the crime of transportation of an illegal alien in violation of a a ii and a b ii so when trooper wagner saw the necklace or pendant hanging from the rearview mirror,he had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a violation of the pennsylvania vehicle code had occurred.app.at.
ii.analysis 
we review for clear error a district court factual findings in a suppression hearing.united states kiam,cir citation omitted.we conduct a plenary review of legal rulings and mixed questions of law and fact.id.
at the outset,we must address the question whether reasonable suspicion or the higher standard of probable cause is required to support an investigatory traffic stop under the fourth amendment.the fourth amendment protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.a traffic stop is a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment,even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.delaware prouse,d see also united states arvizu,d united states wilson,cir.because an ordinary traffic stop is analogous to an investigative detention,it has been historically reviewed under the investigatory detention framework first articulated in terry ohio,d.see,united states elias,cir describing traffic stop s.
under terry and subsequent cases,an officer may,consistent with the fourth amendment,conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.united states valentine,cir quoting illinois wardlow,d see also united states sokolow,d united states cortez,d.reasonable,articulable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of the evidence,wardlow,at,and only a minimal level of objective justification is necessary for a terry stop.sokolow,at.
the terry standard was for many years accepted as the standard governing run of the mill traffic stops.see,united states velasquez,cir upholding traffic stop based on the officer reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant had broken the law by speeding.but,in,dictum of the supreme court in whren united states,d,raised some doubt.as a general matter,said the court,the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.id.at.was the court,shifting gears,now requiring probable cause as the predicate for a traffic stop the consensus is to the contrary.as judge william fletcher has recently observed,the second,sixth,eighth,ninth,tenth and eleventh circuits have all construed whren to require only that the police have reasonable suspicion to believe that a traffic law has been broken.united states willis,cir,dissenting see holeman city of new london,cir united states hill,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states ozbirn,cir united states chanthasouxat,cir.the ninth circuit,in,closely examined this question before concluding that reasonable suspicion is all that is required to support a belief that a traffic provision has been breached,at.the court first noted that p rior to whren,it was settled law that reasonable suspicion is enough to support an investigative traffic stop.id.at citing berkemer mccarty,d.second,the court stressed that the whren passa
