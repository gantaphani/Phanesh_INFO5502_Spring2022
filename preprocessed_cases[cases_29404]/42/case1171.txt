under the ina,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is removable from the united states.a a iii.being convicted of an aggravated felony also makes an alien ineligible for certain forms of discretionary relief from removal.see id.b a ii,b i a,b c.
congress has defined an aggravated felony to include,in pertinent part,illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b.in turn,a drug trafficking crime is defined as any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et.c.a felony punishable under the controlled substances act can include not only federal offenses,but also state offenses.see moncrieffe holder.and a state offense constitutes a felony punishable under the controlled substances act only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.lopez gonzales.
to determine whether a state offense proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under the controlled substances act,we generally employ a categorical approach to the underlying statute of conviction.see moncrieffe,at.under the categorical approach,we focus solely on whether the elements of the crime of conviction sufficiently match the elements of the generic federal offense,while ignoring the particular facts of the case.mathis united states.we look not to the facts of the particular prior case,but instead to whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.moncrieffe,at internal quotation marks omitted.because we examine what the state conviction necessarily involved,not the facts underlying the case,we must presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized,and then determine whether even those acts are encompassed by the generic federal offense.id.internal quotation marks and formatting omitted.and our focus on the minimum conduct criminalized by the state statute is not an invitation to apply legal imagination to the state offense there must be a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.moncrieffe,at quoting gonzales.
but some cases involve convictions under state statutes that list elements in the alternative,and thereby define multiple crimes,mathis,at,or that contain several different crimes,each described separately,moncrieffe,at.the supreme court refers to these statutes as divisible statutes.mathis,at.to these statutes,we apply the modified categorical approach.see mellouli lynch,see also rojas att y of the,cir.en banc noting the modified categorical approach applies w hen a statute of conviction lists elements in the alternative,some of which fit the federal definition and some of which do not.we apply the modified categorical approach to divisible statutes in order to determine what crime,with what elements,a defendant was convicted of.mathis,at see also moncrieffe,at holding the modified categorical approach is applied to divisible statutes in order to determine which particular offense the noncitizen was convicted of evanson att y of the,cir.holding courts should use the modified categorical approach to determine which of the alternative elements was the actual basis for the underlying conviction.
under the modified categorical approach,a court may determine which particular offense the noncitizen was convicted of by examining the charging document and jury instructions,or in the case of a guilty plea,the plea agreement,plea colloquy,or some comparable judicial record of the factual basis for the plea.moncrieffe,at internal quotation marks omitted see also shepard united states,generally limit ing a court to examining the statutory definition,charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.but o ff limits to the adjudicator is any inquiry into the particular facts of the case.mellouli,at.
singh is a citizen of india who was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.he ran two convenience stores in clearfield county,pennsylvania.in november,pennsylvania state police troopers searched his stores for illegal substances.as a result of these searches,almost one year later,the clearfield county district attorney filed two separate criminal informations against singh,charging him with violating a,which outlaws the manufacture,delivery,or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver,a controlled substance or knowingly creating,delivering,or possessing with intent to deliver,a counterfeit controlled substance,conspiring to violate a,in violation of pennsylvania conspiracy statute.a,and violating a,which outlaws k nowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled or counterfeit substance.to the informations did not specify the substance in question.
on may,singh pleaded guilty to one count of violating a and one count of conspiring to violate a.both singh and the district attorney signed a negotiated plea agreement and guilty plea colloquy describing these counts as involving a pa counterf e it substance non fed.singh also signed a separate form document titled guilty plea colloquy.to.paragraph of the guilty plea colloquy reads do you agree that the facts set forth in the criminal complaint and affidavit of probable cause filed against you are an accurate statement of your role in regard to the charges to which you are pleading guilty.singh circled yes.id.
the transcript of singh oral plea colloquy indicates he pled guilty to possession with intent to deliver a counterfeit substance under pennsylvania law but not under federal law and criminal conspiracy to commit possession with the intent to deliver,a counterfeit substance,which is designated a counterfeit substance,under pennsylvania law but not under federal law.the transcript of the oral plea colloquy,like the informations,did not specify the substance in question.singh was sentenced to an indefinite term of imprisonment not to exceed one year less one day.
on april,the department of homeland security dhs began removal proceedings against singh under the ina.dhs charged singh as removable under four sets of statutory provisions a a iii,for being convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in a b the possession offense a b i,for being convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title a a i,for being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude cimt and a a iii again,for being convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in a u the conspiracy offense.
on june,an immigration judge ij held singh was removable under sections a a iii and a b i.to find singh removable under section a b i,the ij applied the modified categorical approach to determine whether the offense for which singh was convicted relates to a controlled substance as defined in.looking to the criminal complaint against singh,the ij identified the substance singh was convicted of possessing as,a cannabimimetic agent.the ij noted is listed as a schedule i controlled substance under the controlled substances act and accordingly found singh was removable.id.the ij also applied the modified categorical approach to hold singh was removable under section a a iii for being convicted of an aggravated felony.five days later,the ij found singh removable under section a a i as well.
singh filed a motion to reopen and reconsider with the ij.in support of his motion,singh filed a joint stipulation and clarification between singh attorney and william shaw,the clearfield county district attorney,indicating that the guilty plea colloquy form is a standard form used by the clearfield county court of common pleas in the entry of a plea paragraph of the form refers generally to the underlying factual allegations against the defendant and do es not constitute an admission of any specific facts except those to which defendant is actually pleading guilty i n this case defendant singh plead ed only to the delivery of an unidentified counterfeit substance under pennsylvania law and it is the understanding of both the defendant and the commonwealth that the unidentified substance was neither a counterfeit n or a controlled substance under federal law.the ij did not rule on this motion.
singh then appealed to the bia,which construed his unadjudicated motion to reopen as a motion to remand,granted it,and remanded the matter for an ij to consider the joint stipulation and clarification in the first instance.to.on remand,a different ij found singh removable as charged.singh again appealed to the bia.
on appeal,the bia considered only whether singh was removable under a a iii for being convicted of an aggravated felony for the possession offense.it did not consider whether the conspiracy offense was also an aggravated felony.because the bia held singh was removable for being convicted of an aggravated felony,it f ou nd it unnecessary to decide whether singh was also removable under sections a a i and b i.
the bia said it would apply the categorical approach described in moncrieffe.it noted moncrieffe qualification that there must be a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.quoting moncrieffe,at internal quotation marks omitted.the bia stated singh was convicted of knowingly possessing with intent to deliver a counterfeit controlled substance as well as conspiracy to do so.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the bia described its initial task under the categorical approach as deciding whether possession of a mislabeled controlled substance with intent to transfer it to another person in violation of a is necessarily conduct punishable as a federal felony.it held singh conviction record gave the immigration judge good reason to believe that the substance at issue in his case was a federally controlled substance at the time of his conviction.the bia looked to what it called singh plea agreement and said it contained an affirmative stipulation that the facts set forth in the criminal complaint and affidavit of probable cause filed against singh were an accurate statement of his role in regard to the charges to which he was pleading guilty.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the bia further stated that t he attached criminal complaint and affidavit of probable cause both identif ied the offending substance at issue in the respondent case as,a synthetic cannabinoid that was added to the federal controlled substance schedules by name on july.id.internal citation omitted.
finding no reported decision of a pennsylvania court in which a defendant was convicted for conduct involving a substance that was not included in the federal controlled substance schedules,and that singh own case did not involve that kind of substance,the bia held there wa s no realistic probability that pennsylvania actually prosecutes people under a for misconduct involving substances that are not federally controlled.accordingly,the bia concluded dhs carried its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that singh offense of conviction was an aggravated felony,and dismissed singh appeal.singh petitioned us for review.
the ij had jurisdiction under.the bia had jurisdiction under b and.we have jurisdiction under a.although no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,id.a c,we have jurisdiction to determine whether the necessary facts are present in a particular case,including whether the alien has been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses,borrome att y of the,cir.
when the bia issues its own decision on the merits,rather than a summary affirmance,we review its decision,not that of the ij.att y,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.we may consider the opinion of the ij only insofar as the bia deferred to it.id.internal quotation marks omitted.whether an alien offense is an aggravated felony is reviewed de novo as it implicates a purely legal question that governs the appellate court jurisdiction.restrepo att y of the,cir.
the bia applied the categorical approach,rather than the modified categorical approach,to determine whether singh was convicted of an aggravated felony.see w e find it unnecessary to conduct a modified categorical inquiry in this matter.although singh never squarely contends in his opening brief that this was error,he suggests that in cases involving section a,the categorical and approach must be employed to identify the type of substance involved.br.appellant.we treat this as a request to apply the modified categorical approach.the government also says the modified categorical approach is proper,requesting that we remand to allow the board to apply the modified categorical analysis in the first instance.resp t answering br.
we agree with both singh and the government that the bia should have applied the modified categorical approach.in a recent immigration case,we held section a is divisible with regard to both the conduct and the controlled substances to which it applies.bedolla avila att y,wl,at cir.june.accordingly,reliance on the modified categorical approach is proper,and the bia erred in concluding that it was unnecessary to conduct a modified categorical inquiry in this matter.
the government contends we should remand this matter to the bia to conduct the modified categorical analysis in the first instance.it contends singh challenge to the immigration judge analysis under the modified categorical approach is not properly before the court because t he board did not uphold the immigration judge analysis,and the court reviews the board decision and only the aspects of the immigration judge decision that the board considered.resp t answering br.but the bia attempted to answer the same question with which we are faced whether singh conviction under section a is an aggravated felony.and whether that is so is reviewed de novo as it implicates a purely legal question.restrepo,at.accordingly,we will address whether singh conviction is an aggravated felony under the modified categorical approach 
under the modified categorical approach,an adjudicator must determine which particular offense the noncitizen was convicted of.moncrieffe,at.the bia addressed only singh conviction under section a.that section outlaws the manufacture,delivery,or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver,a controlled substance or knowingly creating,delivering,or possessing with intent to deliver,a counterfeit controlled substance.a.as the bia noted,pennsylvania law defines a counterfeit controlled substance to mean a controlled substance 
which,or the container or labeling of which,without authorization,bears the trademark,trade name,or other identifying mark,imprint,number,or device,or any likeness thereof,of a manufacturer,distributor,or dispenser other than the person or persons who in fact manufactured,distributed,or dispensed such substance and which thereby is falsely purported or represented to be the product of,or to have been distributed by,such other manufacturer,distributor,or dispenser.
b.pennsylvania law defines a controlled substance,in turn,as a drug,substance,or immediate precursor included in schedules i through v of the pennsylvania drug and alcohol abuse control act pdaaca.b.those schedules are codified at.
