background 
viktor gjyzi is a native of albania.he seeks asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of alleged persecution for his political opinions and activities.gjyzi was an active and outspoken member of the democratic party in albania and alleges that he was persecuted by the state he claims are protective of the socialist party and hostile to opposition his political activities.
in the affidavit supporting his application for asylum and testimony before the immigration judge ij,gjyzi explained that his family had long been a politically active and persecuted one.his father was killed in by communist bands as political revenge for his democratic political opinions.gjyzi himself joined the democratic party in august and was active in election campaigns and demonstrations until his departure from albania in the autumn of.in,and,he served either as a member of the electoral commission or the chairman of the electoral commission.he was also an observer of other elections.he participated in demonstrations in the city of fier between and and claims to have been beaten for that activity by the police.
gjyzi claims that he was repeatedly subject to police abuse and intimidation for his political activities.following a democratic party rally in march,he was arrested,beaten,and detained by the police for three days.upon being released,the police threatened him not to participate in other rallies or support for democracy.in june of,gjyzi served as chairman of the election commission,but he expressed opposition to the terror and threats instigated by the socialist party and which,he felt,pervaded the election.while preparing a report on the election,on june,gjyzi was stopped by the police and told that he would be imprisoned.the police took his report,read it,and beat him.he was struck on the head with a knife and bayoneted in the hip.the police then tore up the report and left him in the middle of the street,where his friends found him,ultimately taking him to the hospital,where he remained for three days.still,gjyzi continued his political activity and on either november or december,he spoke at a demonstration about the problems with the,organized terror,drugs,and contraband.three thousand people attended.however,toward the end of the rally,the police intervened and dispersed the participants.upon his departure from the rally,gjyzi was stopped by three secret police officers on the street and threatened.he was told to stop his political activity,or they would disappear me meaning imprison or kill him.the police then beat him.
in october,he was the democratic party observer for elections at a voting center.however,he strongly denounced and publicly condemned the allegedly illegal acts of the socialist party in connection with these elections,and as a result of that,began receiving anonymous letters and telephone calls.on october,individuals shot into his home window with guns.he was later phoned by these individuals,who told him that this was his last warning.gjyzi reported this incident to the police in fier,but alleges that they responded you deserve that as a democratic who supports berisha.the democratic party of fier protested gjyzi treatment by the police and demanded that those responsible for the shooting and threats be brought to justice.however,seeing that no action was being taken and fearing that the state mafia or police would come after him,to kill him,gjyzi left albania for the united states in october or november of.
administrative proceedings 
on december,a notice to appear was issued and charged gjyzi with removability pursuant to a a i,because he entered the united states illegally.having conceded removability,gjyzi filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal on october.after an evidentiary hearing on april,the ij issued a decision.first,the ij denied gjyzi asylum application as untimely based on the vagaries sic on the date of his entry into the united states.the ij seems to have been referring to the lack of clarity surrounding the date of gjyzi arrival in the united states.the government charging instrument,gjyzi written asylum application,and the accompanying affidavit all provide november,as the date of gjyzi illegal entry.however,at his hearing before the ij,gjyzi testified that he entered the united states on december.based on these despite the fact that either entry date was still safely within the time limit preceding gjyzi asylum ij found gjyzi not credible and stated that,as a result,she could not find that gjyzi had shown by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his asylum application within one year of the date of his arrival in the united states,as required by a b.
the ij also denied gjyzi withholding of removal on the ground that his testimony concerning his past persecutions was not credible.the ij adverse credibility finding was based on her perceived discrepancies between gjyzi asylum application and his testimony,and her conclusion that state department country reports on albania and other documents summarizing the political situation in albania did not support gjyzi claims of persecution.
gjyzi timely appealed to the bia,challenging the ij adverse credibility findings and her denial of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal.a single board member,acting pursuant to e,issued a terse opinion,which repudiated the ij adverse credibility finding,but,without additional explanation,upheld the ij conclusions that gjyzi asylum application was untimely and that he was ineligible for withholding of removal pursuant to the convention against torture.the bia order stated,in full 
we affirm the decision of the immigration judge in part.see matter of burbano,i n,bia noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an immigration judge,in whole or in part,is simply a statement that the board conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the immigration judge articulated in his or her decision.we have reviewed the record,and are unable to agree with the immigration judge that material reasons existed to find that the respondent was incredible in these proceedings.that aspect of the respondent appeal is sustained.however,we find that the immigration judge correctly concluded that the respondent had failed to apply for asylum within the period required under the law.that aspect of the immigration judge decision is affirmed.further,we agree with the immigration judge that the respondent failed to satisfy his burden of proof for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture.we affirm that aspect of the immigration judge decision as well.accordingly,the appeal is dismissed.
gjyzi timely appealed the adverse decision of the bia.
ii.analysis 
a.the timeliness of gjyzi asylum application 
our concern here is as follows.the ij deemed gjyzi asylum application untimely on the sole ground that he made conflicting representations concerning his date of entry into the united states and was,therefore,not credible.as we noted above,gjyzi asylum application listed november,as his date of entry but in his testimony before the ij,he claimed to have entered the united states on december.
on appeal,the bia broadly repudiated the ij adverse credibility findings.yet,without any additional explanation,the bia affirmed the ij conclusion that gjyzi failed to show by clear and convincing evid
