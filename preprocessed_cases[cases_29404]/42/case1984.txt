kenneth efe is a nigerian citizen who attempted entry into the united states in january.his testimony regarding the circumstances that brought him to the changed each time he presented his case,including to this court.the main thrust of efe story is that he was involved in a political demonstration in edo,nigeria,in which he killed a police officer.efe ran from the police for a number of months before boarding a ship that brought him to the.he was stopped upon entry,beginning the process of immigration hearings that has culminated in this appeal.
for the following reasons,we affirm the board of immigration appeals denial of all relief and its frivolous application ruling.
facts and proceedings 
efe has testified that in june he took part in a demonstration in edo protesting the military government refusal to install abiola,who was legally elected to the presidency in.according to efe,police indiscriminately beat participants in the demonstration,including himself.efe story has varied as to just how the beating took place,what injuries he suffered,whether he was on the ground at any point,how many officers took part or witnessed the event.in one version of the story,he was on the ground while an officer was beating him and he grabbed a glass bottle,with which he hit the officer in the stomach.in the story he has used most often and gave in the first hearing before an immigration judge,efe escaped to a house along the street where the demonstration was taking place and grabbed a knife.he returned to the street with the knife,fatally stabbed a police officer in the abdomen,and fled.efe has altered his story as to whether the officer he stabbed was the one who beat him,as well as to whether he saw the officer intestines fall out or only later learned that the officer died from the wound.efe has stated that he had no control over his actions,that the devil took him over he has also stated that he knew exactly what he was doing.it is unclear how efe escaped the demonstration.
efe claims to have fled to kastina and then to lagos,though how long and with whom he stayed in each place are uncertain.in december,he boarded a ship at port island that brought him to the as a stowaway on or about january.
proceedings 
efe was stopped coming into the.the service asylum officer who gave efe a credible fear interview found that he had a credible fear of persecution if returned to nigeria.a hearing before the immigration court on the credible fear finding occurred on december.the immigration judge ij found that efe was generally credible regarding his version of the demonstration,stabbing of the officer,and flight.however,based on dental records and observations of efe during the hearing,the ij explicitly questioned efe claim that he was thirteen when he arrived in the.the ij attributed efe vagueness about his age and birth date to attempts to mislead the court.the court ruled that the police beating efe suffered constituted severe harm and that the police were probably searching for efe and would detain,convict,and torture him if he returned to nigeria.nonetheless,the ij determined that efe applications for political asylum and withholding of removal were statutorily barred under section b a i of the immigration and nationality act the act,because the harm efe feared was due to a serious nonpolitical crime,specifically,the killing of a police officer.at that time,the ij did not have authority to grant relief under article of the united nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.res,annex,gaor supp,at,doc.convention against torture or cat.
on august,the board of immigration appeals board or bia remanded efe case to the immigration court for proceedings on the convention against torture claim pursuant to regulations that became effective on march,after efe initial hearing,section b of the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of,division g.on january,the immigration court denied withholding of removal under cat due to the section b iii bar but granted deferral of removal under cat.the immigration court adopted the findings of fact and credibility from the first hearing.
the board again remanded to the immigration court in june,on a motion by the immigration and naturalization service to reopen and remand.the board ruled that previously unavailable material evidence called into question the credibility of efe story.the new evidence was the result of an investigation by a embassy investigator,communicated via a state department telegram.the investigator failed to find information on efe or his family in state,local,or police records in owena village,benin,nigeria a primary school matching the one efe claimed to have attended and police records indicating a murder of a police officer in edo in june.further,the former and only chairman of the sdp political party had not heard of efe or his family,belying efe testimony that his father was an officer in the sdp.
a new hearing on the merits was held on august.on august,the ij denied efe applications for political asylum and withholding of removal under section b of the act and article of cat.the ij found efe not credible,stating that efe had changed his testimony concerning,among others aspects of the case,his name,age place of birth,schooling,places of residence,family members,their names whether he has a brother,whether he has an uncle in the,the extent and reason for his involvement in the demonstration,whether and,if so,how he stabbed an officer,with whom and where he stayed while fleeing the police,and his knowledge concerning the sdp party 
the ij ruled that the inconsistencies,contradictions,and improbabilities combined with the lack of corroborating evidence demanded that efe come forward with more than background material and affidavits.the ruling stated that efe had neither presented a plausible,coherent account of the basis for a fear of persecution,nor established that he was a victim of persecution.the ij added a frivolous application for asylum ruling,finding that efe had knowingly and intentionally made false statements on his asylum application and during his testimony with the purpose of obtaining asylum.the frivolous application for asylum ruling makes efe permanently ineligible for benefits under the act.ina d.
on march,the board denied efe appeal from the denial of all relief and the frivolous application ruling.the board recognized that the state department telegram was of limited probative value both in its finding regarding owena village and its vague comments about the sdp.noting that the ij never mentioned that efe did not represent that his school was in owena village nor that the relevant events occurred there,the board held that the negative credibility ruling did not rely heavily on the telegram but rather mainly on inconsistencies between the appellant applications,hearings,statements,and exhibits.efe has never explained these inconsistencies.
appeal to this court followed.
