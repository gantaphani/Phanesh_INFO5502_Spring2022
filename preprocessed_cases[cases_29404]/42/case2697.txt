jose sandoval,petitioner,entered the united states as a permanent resident on july.in december he was charged by information filed in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,with possession of more than thirty but less than grams of cannabis.see.ch,d,now codified as.comp.stat.ann.west supp following his entry of a plea of guilty to the violation of d,sandoval was sentenced to a period of two years probation.
on the basis of his drug conviction,the immigration and naturalization service the ins began deportation proceedings against sandoval in april.in response to the threat of deportation,sandoval promptly filed a postconviction motion,pursuant to the illinois hearing act the act.ch,para.et,now codified as.comp.stat.ann.west supp.the act provides a remedy to state criminal defendants claiming substantial violations of their federal or state constitutional rights by allowing collateral attack on a judgment of conviction.see people towns.in his motion,sandoval alleged that he had entered a guilty plea on advice of counsel,and that counsel had advised him not to worry about his status as a resident alien.he further asserted that he never would have entered the plea if he had known that it would subject him to deportation.it is counsel responsibility,and not the court,to advise an accused of a collateral consequence of a plea of guilty the consequence of deportation has been held to be collateral.people correa.under illinois law,if a defendant enters a plea of guilty in reasonable reliance upon the erroneous advice of counsel that the defendant plea would have no collateral deportation consequence,reliance on this misleading advice can render the defendant plea involuntary.see people correa,see also people luna,d,holding that petition,which alleged that counsel failed to advise alien that a felony conviction could result in deportation,was sufficient to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.
the illinois state court judge responded to sandoval motion on november,by entering a modified order of months of first offender probation,pursuant to chapter,section of the illinois revised statutes.ch,now codified as.comp.stat.ann.west supp.a court may only impose probation under section if the individual is a first time offender who has pleaded guilty to or has been found guilty of the misdemeanor offenses of possession of marijuana under section a,possession of not more than grams of marijuana section b,possession of more than grams but less than ten grams of marijuana or section c,possession of more than ten grams but not more than thirty grams of marijuana.the section probation given to sandoval is not available to defendants convicted under d the felony offense of possession of greater than thirty but less than grams of offense for which sandoval was originally convicted.
after the november order sentencing him to section probation,sandoval deportation proceeding resumed.the immigration judge acknowledged that sandoval would not be deportable if his conviction was for possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana,but he found that sandoval bore the burden of proving this factual circumstance.therefore,the judge was of the opinion that,because sandoval had provided no reason to believe that the charging information referenced in the original statement of conviction was not accurate,sandoval had been convicted of possession of more than thirty grams.the immigration judge also found that sandoval sentence to first offender probation was not the state counterpart of the federal first offender act,and declined sandoval relief under that statute.see.further,he expressed his view that the illinois state court judge had modified sandoval sentence solely to avoid the consequences of the immigration law,and that,even if the modification was the state counterpart of the federal first offender act,it was not effective for purposes of federal immigration law.
on appeal to the board of immigration appeals the board,sandoval challenged each of these conclusions.first,he argued that first offender probation under section is not a conviction for immigration purposes.second,sandoval asserted that first offender probation is comparable to a disposition under the federal first offender act.third,he contended that the modification order of the illinois court was not ineffective,under board precedent.finally,he argued that the illinois court had vacated his earlier conviction under d,and entered a new conviction under a,b,or c thus,since he had to have been convicted of possessing thirty grams or less of marijuana,he was not deportable as charged in the order to show cause.see a b i originally enacted as immigration and nationality act ina,ch,a b i,stat.current version at a b i the board dismissed sandoval appeal through a per curiam opinion issued in july,rejecting his first two arguments.it determined that the enactment of a federal statute defining conviction for immigration purposes precluded the availability of federal first offender treatment see a a.the opinion did not address sandoval assertion that he was not deportable because he was convicted of possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana.
in this appeal,sandoval alleges that the ins did not carry its burden of proving deportability,and that he does not have a conviction that renders him deportable under section a b i of the ina.see a b i current version at a b i.
jurisdiction 
under the transitional rules of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,when a final order of deportation is entered there shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is deportable by reason of having committed a controlled substance offense covered in the immigration and nationality act.iirira,c g,stat,set out at,historical and statutory notes.notwithstanding this restriction,courts do have jurisdiction to review whether the alien was convicted of a criminal offense that justifies deportation.see wedderburn ins,cir,petition for cert.filed,see also jideonwo ins,cir xiong ins,cir.this limited review enables judicial correction of bizarre miscarriages of justice.laguerre reno,cir.therefore,we must determine whether sandoval was convicted of a controlled substance offense that would justify deportation under the ina.
deportability under section 
the immigration law in effect at the time the ins instituted deportation proceedings stated any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of a state relating to a controlled substance,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,is deportable.a b i current version at a b i.the term conviction means,with respect to an alien,a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court a a.if adjudication of guilt has been withheld,then an alien is considered convicted where i a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt,and ii the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the alien liberty to be imposed.a a i,ii.
sandoval original conviction for possession of more than thirty grams would have rendered him deportable under section a b i of the ina.his modified sentence,however,would only be appropriate if the judge had vacated the original conviction and entered a new conviction for possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana.lack of a court order vacating the original conviction has left the parties disputing the effect of the modified sentence.sandoval argues that it was a legal modification under illinois law,and that the modification has to mean that he was convicted of possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana,which is not a conviction for immigration purposes.the ins argues that the conviction under d remains a conviction for immigration purposes and that there is substantial evidence to support the finding that sandoval was convicted of possession of more than thirty grams.the insufficiency of the state court record is,of course,the heart of the problem.
