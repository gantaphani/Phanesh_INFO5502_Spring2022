the question presented is whether the department of homeland security has met its burden of proving that the petitioner is removable from the united states as an alien convicted of a law relating to a controlled substance.a second question is whether the petitioner has met his burden of proving he is eligible for relief from removal.because there is no record documentation supporting the order of removal,or the ruling that the petitioner was barred from relief,we find for the petitioner in answer to both questions.yet only the first answer is necessary to grant his petition for review and reverse the removal order.likewise,we need not address the petitioner due process claims.
cheuk fung,a native and citizen of hong kong now the people republic of china has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since,when he came to this country with his parents as a.in july,the department of homeland security issued yong a notice to appear that charged him as removable from the united states because he was an alien who had been convicted of both a controlled substance offense under a b i and an aggravated felony under a a iii the notice specified only one prior offense,a september,conviction for the sale or transportation of controlled substance,in violation of section a of the california health and safety code.the government argued that the section conviction constituted both a controlled substance offense and an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act ina.the notice did not specify what kind of controlled substance gave rise to the section conviction or whether the offense involved a sale.
yong appeared at an initial hearing pro se but indicated that he wished to hire a lawyer.the immigration judge continued the hearing four times to allow yong to find an attorney,but on october,three months after the initial hearing,yong elected to proceed without counsel.the immigration judge then indicated that he would take a pleading from yong and determine what issues would be raised in the case.
after preliminary questions confirming yong name and citizenship status,the immigration judge questioned yong about the charges in the government notice to appear to determine whether yong was removable based on those charges.in particular,the immigration judge asked whether yong had been convicted of the section charge mentioned in the notice and confined for two years.yong confirmed that he had been.the immigration judge then asked to look at the government conviction document.before reviewing that document,however,the immigration judge asked yong whether he had any fear of being returned to china or any reason to believe he would be subjected to torture there if he were removed from the united states.yong answered no to both questions.
the immigration judge then indicated on the record that the government attorney has handed me a conviction record.without further identifying the document or confirming that it related to the section conviction charged in the notice to appear,the immigration judge described the government document as follows 
i just verifying that we have a good document here.it shows you had two convictions,a count and count.count would appear to me read it for a second here.it basically a conspiracy charge,that you and others conspired to commit the crime in sic sale or transportation of a controlled substance.and then it sets forth the overt acts that led to that.count is written in that you conspired to commit other crimes with others.the question we have to look at is whether this count falls into that category.basically,what this charges you with is sale or transportation.but the actual overt acts that you were charged with show that you must negotiated sic it and actually handed over mdma tablets,the parties that you actually handed a hundred tablets of the mdma to that person in the other car.
yong conceded the accuracy of this description,as recited by the immigration judge,but argued that that was not a sale.i was selling it.the immigration judge agreed there was no evidence in the document of a sale,and on that basis found that the conviction did not support the government charge that yong was removable for having committed an aggravated felony.the immigration judge sustained the government other basis for removal,however,that yong had been convicted of a controlled substance offense under section a b i of the ina.the government then accepted the court ruling that the section conviction was not an aggravated felony and did not raise any other convictions that might qualify.the government attorney did not move the unidentified document into the record,nor was any more said about it at the hearing.
the immigration judge then asked whether yong had any other convictions.yong said that he did.the immigration judge asked him to elaborate,and yong explained that he had another ecsta s y conviction for possession for sales but they gave me than a year.the immigration judge then explained why he was asking yong about other convictions i f you actually have a possession for sale charge,even if they gave you straight probation on it,that will be an aggravated felony.it would bar you from certain types of relief.the immigration judge continued,
you may not be deportable for it right now because they have charged it,but it would bar you from cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents,and it would bar you from asylum.and it might even bar you from a type of torture convention protection.but you have indicated any threat in those areas.do you understand 
yong said he did.the immigration judge then asked the government attorney whether he had a rap sheet on yong,and when the attorney confirmed that he did,the immigration judge enlisted yong help finding the possession for sales conviction on the rap sheet.when the government attorney found the conviction,he said,this is plainly different from the orange county conviction,which was really the subject of our charge.the attorney went on to describe the conviction included in the rap sheet.
apparently,on july of,the defendant pled guilty to count of the charges against him at that time,which was a felony charge of possession of a controlled substance for sale under section of the california health and safety code.and he was convicted of that.
after confirming with yong that this was the additional conviction that yong had mentioned,the immigration judge concluded,that is an aggravated felony trafficking offense.so even though i have sustained the charge of deportability based on the conviction being an aggravated felony,that conviction would bar you from those forms of relief i told you about.the government attorney did not move the rap sheet into the record,nor was any more said about it at the hearing.
the immigration judge concluded the hearing by explaining that based on what we discussed,i will find that you are subject to removal today on the controlled substance ground.and based upon the discussions we had,your july,conviction for possession for sale,coupled with what you told me,you do qualify for any relief.
the immigration judge written order,entered the same day,stated that u pon the basis of respondent admissions,i have determined that the respondent is subject to removal on the charge s in the notice to appear.the order made no mention at all of the section conviction,however,which yong had helped identify in the rap sheet.nor did the order explain that the immigration judge had found yong ineligible for relief from removal based on his conclusion that the section conviction was an aggravated felony.instead,the order stated only that respondent has made no application for relief from removal.
yong appealed the immigration judge decision to the board,which affirmed the immigration judge order of removal without an opinion.yong then appealed to this court,arguing that there was insufficient documentation in the administrative record to sustain an order of removal or to find that he was ineligible for relief from removal.we agree.we therefore grant the petition for review and reverse the removal order.
