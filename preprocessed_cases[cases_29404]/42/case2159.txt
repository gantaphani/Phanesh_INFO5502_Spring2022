background 
singh is a sikh who formerly lived in bhila,a village in the punjab province of india.singh father served as head sarpanch of bhila for fifteen years and owned a acre dairy farm and some smaller holdings in other cities.singh claims that he was a university,and later professional,wrestling champion.
in the,tensions developed in punjab between the government and sikh separatists who sought to establish the independent state of khalistan.while it appears that singh and his father may have supported the khalistan independence movement generally,singh testimony suggests that they were not members or willing supporters of the khalistan liberation front klf,a sikh separatist group that used violent methods in advancing its cause.according to singh,the klf had many supporters in bhila,and the klf would frequently come to his family home,demanding money,food,and shelter.
in,approximately two weeks after indira ghandi was assassinated by sikh extremists,the police arrested singh,apparently believing that he was a klf supporter.singh claims that he was imprisoned for eighteen days,during which he was interrogated,stripped,and beaten.according to singh,he was thrown to the ground on his stomach,police jumped on his back,and his hands were tied behind him and pulled up in the air.in addition,two men apparently grabbed singh legs and pulled them apart,and another man beat his head,feet,and other parts of his body with a stick.singh claims that he suffered from internal bleeding,blood in his urine,varicose veins,and blood clots in his legs as a result of these beatings.during the last four days of his imprisonment,singh allegedly was placed in a van and driven around bhila so that he could point out two klf leaders,kaldeep singh keepa and haripal singh pal tandra,to the police.singh says that he was released after his father paid a bribe to the police and that he was told that he must continue reporting klf activities to the police.
singh claims that he was arrested for a second time in march.according to singh,the police came to his home in the early morning hours,took him from his bedroom,and drove him to the police station in handcuffs.the police commander interrogated him as to the whereabouts and activities of keepa and the klf.when singh denied having knowledge of such matters,the police allegedly slapped and punched him.singh also asserts that the police commander threatened to bind his legs together with a rope and tie him to a car.
singh third arrest came in july.singh claims that police informants falsely accused him of raising money for the klf.according to singh,the police informants smuggled drugs for the police,and he was arrested so that the police and their informants could cover up how they were obtaining their income.singh claims he was beaten across his back with a large belt,which caused bleeding and bruising.after his father paid a bribe,singh was released.
in october,singh was again arrested by the police and held for four days.singh claims the police accused him of supporting the klf and conspiring to overthrow the government.during his imprisonment,singh apparently was interrogated,his legs were pulled apart and tied down,and he was beaten with a wooden baton on his legs and back.singh claims that,when he was released,the police threatened him that he would never walk again if he did not cooperate with them.
after being released from police custody,singh sought employment as an electrician,having retired from wrestling apparently because of injuries to his legs singh,however,was denied employment,allegedly because the senior police detective in punjab informed the electrical board that singh was a terrorist.singh then spent the next four years working on his father land.during this time,singh was required to report to the senior police detective and inform him of any unusual activities occurring in bhila.
according to singh,his difficulties with the punjabi police continued throughout the early.singh claims that,in may,following the assassination of a former prime minister son,he was taken into custody along with several other young men from punjabi villages and was interrogated for six hours.during the elections,singh home was searched by police looking for klf materials and weapons.and in early,singh allegedly was summoned by the senior police detective and ordered to cooperate in the police efforts against terrorists.according to singh,he was threatened at gunpoint during his meeting with the senior police detective and was told that if he did not cooperate,he would be killed.for the next several months,singh was forced to drive around punjabi villages pointing out klf members and supporters.
in june,keepa,one of the klf leaders,was killed.according to singh,he was not directly involved in keepa death,but he had informed the police that keepa had left the bhila area.singh alleges that he became a klf target because of his role as a police informant and that the klf kidnapped his wife for several hours as a warning to singh.the following month,the klf allegedly came to singh home and threatened to kill his family if singh did not cooperate by bombing the senior police detective.singh told the klf that he would place the bomb,but instead fled with his family to his wife village of sangrur,approximately two hundred miles away.singh remained in his wife village for one month,but then returned to bhila,staying with his father and his cousins.singh claims that he was able to avoid being killed because his father paid the klf money and convinced them that singh was feeding false information to the police.singh also claims that his father moved him to ludihana,another punjabi town.
in may,pal tandra,a klf leader,was arrested and killed by police in jalinder,a village approximately miles from bhila.singh claims that his family was then threatened by the klf because the klf blamed singh for pal tandra death,and singh father was told that singh would be killed.singh then sent his wife and children to live with his wife cousin in ludihana.singh fled to delhi,where an agent,hired by his father at a cost of approximately,helped singh obtain a visa by posing as his business partner.singh then flew to the united states,arriving in late july.singh was admitted into the united states as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure,with his authorization to remain in the country set to expire in january.
in september,the immigration and naturalization service ins served singh with a notice to appear,charging him with removal.singh admitted to the allegations,and the ij designated india as his country for removal.singh filed for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture,and on october,the ij heard singh claims.after hearing singh testify through the aid of a punjabi interpreter,the ij found singh allegations incredible based on various inconsistencies in his testimony and denied relief on all claims.singh appealed to the bia,and the bia affirmed the ij decision in a order,apparently adopting the reasoning previously set forth by the ij.the bia also noted that singh was not denied a fair hearing based on the ij refusal to let karen parker,an expert witness,testify that singh could not obtain relief based on a fear of torture because of the ij adverse credibility finding and that additional evidence submitted by singh could not be considered because singh did not file a motion to reopen and because the evidence would not alter the outcome of his case.singh now petitions this court for review of the denial of his asylum,withholding of removal,and convention against torture claims.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
title furnishes this court jurisdiction to review the bia decision affirming the ij denial of asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.see yu ashcroft,cir ali reno,cir.we review administrative findings of fact,such as whether an alien qualifies as a refugee,under the substantial evidence standard,keeping in mind that such findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.yu,at quoting b b see also ali,at.because the bia adopted the ij reasoning with respect to singh claims for asylum and withholding of removal,we review those aspects of the ij decision directly.see abay ashcroft,cir.
asylum and withholding of removal under the ina 
singh first asserts that the ij erred in denying his claims for asylum and withholding of removal under the ina based on a finding that singh testimony lacked credibility.because we can not say that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude that singh allegations of past persecution were credible and entitled him to refugee status,we deny the petition for review of the ij denial of singh claims for asylum and withholding of removal.
grounds for obtaining asylum and withholding of removal 
the attorney general,in his or her discretion,may grant asylum to a refugee,a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.pilica ashcroft,cir quoting a a.persecution requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,unaccompanied by any physical punishment,infliction of harm,or significant deprivation of liberty.mikhailevitch ins,cir.a showing of fear of future persecution requires a demonstration by the alien 
that he has a fear of persecution in his home country on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he were to return to that country and that he is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of such fear.
pilica,at.applicants who establish that they have suffered past persecution are presumed to have a fear of future persecution,but this presumption may be rebutted by the government if it shows by a preponderance of the evidence that conditions in the country have changed so fundamentally that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution.see ouda ins,cir.
whereas granting asylum to a refugee is a matter of discretion exercised by the attorney general,w ithholding of removal is mandatory if an alien establishes that his life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.pilica,at quoting b.an alien seeking withholding of removal must demonstrate that there is a clear probability that he will be subject to persecution if forced to return to the country of removal.id.because an alien must meet a higher burden in establishing a right to withholding of removal than in demonstrating asylum eligibility,an alien who fails to qualify for asylum necessarily does not qualify for withholding of removal.see id.at.
validity of ij adverse credibility determination 
in the case at bar,the ij decision to deny asylum and withholding of removal under the ina rested largely on the ij finding that singh testimony lacked credibility.when an ij determines that an alien testimony lacks credibility,the ij must include in his or her decision specific reasons explaining why the ij reached such a conclusion.sylla ins,cir.moreover,the ij adverse credibility finding must be based on issues that go to the heart of the applicant claim.they can not be based on an irrelevant inconsistency.if discrepancies can not be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution,they have no bearing on credibility.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.singh contends that the ij erred in deeming inconsistent various statements made by singh in his asylum application and during the administrative hearing,and that,as a result,the ij adverse credibility determination can not stand.although this is a close case and several of the grounds upon which the ij relied are somewhat questionable,we conclude that the evidentiary record does not compel a finding that singh testimony was credible with respect to his claims for asylum and withholding of removal.see pilica,at explaining that an ij adverse credibility findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary quoting b b.
the ij adverse credibility determination in this case relies primarily on two key inconsistencies in singh asylum application and his oral testimony before the ij.first,the ij relied on an apparent inconsistency in singh testimony with respect to singh involvement in the death of pal tandra,a klf leader.specifically,the ij observed that,in his asylum application,singh stated that he had given information to the police regarding pal tandra whereabouts and that t his information led to his capture,arrest,and death at the hands of the police.joint appendix at ij decision at quoting statement of singh at.when first asked about pal tandra death at the hearing,however,singh stated that he was not at all involved.at hr g tr.at.although singh statement that he was not at all involved arguably could have been interpreted to mean only that singh did not participate in the actual police action in which pal tandra was killed,the ij understanding of singh testimony to be that he did not participate more generally in pal tandra death does not seem unreasonable,and thus supports the ij adverse credibility finding.
the second major inconsistency undergirding the ij adverse credibility finding pertains to singh involvement in the klf plan to bomb the senior police detective in punjab.in his asylum application,singh stated that he was instructed by the klf to place a bomb on the home of the superintendent of police,shoab kumar,the senior police detective.at statement of singh at.during the hearing,however,singh indicated that he was supposed to place the bomb in the officer room at the police station.at hr g tr.at where were you told to plant that bomb a.when they take me to police station,you can put it there.q.so they wanted you to put it in the police station,correct yes,in the officer.i beg your pardon yes,in the officer room.q.at the police station yes.although singh attempted to reconcile these apparently inconsistent statements regarding the placement of the bomb by explaining that the targeted police official lived next door to the police station the ij found such an explanation to be lacking.because the ij was not unreasonable in finding that singh failed to explain adequately the apparent inconsistencies in his testimony regarding an event central to his claim of past persecution,we can not say that,based on the record before us,any reasonable adjudicator would be required to find singh credible.
although we conclude that the two aforementioned inconsistencies in singh testimony furnish the substantial evidence necessary to sustain the ij adverse credibility determination with respect to singh claims for asylum and withholding of removal under the ina,we also note that many of the other grounds cited by the ij are quite weak and do little to bolster the ij adverse credibility determination.first,the ij found that singh failed to explain why his father,the largest landowner in bhila,was unable to secure passage for singh wife and children to come to the united states.at ij decision at.this justification for deeming singh incredible is unsupported by the
