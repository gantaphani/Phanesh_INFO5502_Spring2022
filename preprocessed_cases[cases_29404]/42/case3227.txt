petitioner jose guadalupe torres valdivias petitions for review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision upholding a final order of removal against him.in deciding this case,we consider the scope of the attorney general decision in matter of jean,att y,which established a heightened standard that aliens convicted of violent or dangerous crimes must satisfy to be granted discretionary relief from removal.
torres valdivias was placed in removal proceedings,where he applied for and was denied adjustment of status under i.the bia held that torres valdivias sexual battery conviction was a violent or dangerous crime and,on that basis,applied the matter of jean standard to guide the exercise of its discretion.in making the violent or dangerous crime determination,the bia considered the facts underlying torres valdivias sexual battery offense as testified to by torres valdivias at his removal hearing and as stated in police reports from the time of the offense.applying the matter of jean standard,the bia denied torres valdivias adjustment of status application,as a matter of discretion.
we uphold the bia decision not to apply the categorical approach in the context of its discretionary decisions,such as the one at issue here.we also conclude that,where the correct legal standard is applied,the ultimate determination of whether a crime was violent or dangerous under matter of jean is discretionary and therefore unreviewable under a b.finally,we uphold the bia extension of the matter of jean standard to adjustment of status applications under.accordingly,we dismiss in part and deny in part torres valdivias petition for review.
background 
petitioner jose guadalupe torres valdivias,a native and citizen of mexico,has resided in the united states since coming in illegally in.he married a citizen,through whom he was granted conditional permanent resident status in.that status was revoked in,however,as a result of a conviction for sexual battery in violation of california penal code a.upon revocation of his status,torres valdivias was charged with being an alien illegally present in the united states and therefore removable under a a i.
in removal proceedings in front of an immigration judge ij,torres valdivias applied for adjustment of status under i.in adjudicating this application,the ij considered the facts underlying torres valdivias sexual battery conviction,including the facts as stated in his testimony at the removal hearing and as described in the police reports from the time of the offense.the facts found by the ij are not in dispute 
torres valdivias first said that when he was or,and the victim,his stepsister,was or,he touched her on her breasts and vagina over her clothing once.he repeated this activity one more time,about a year later.he insisted he did nothing else.later,after being confronted with the police reports in the case,he admitted that he touched her vagina while the victim was not wearing clothes.he subsequently admitted to forcing his finger into her vagina,and also getting on top of her and simulating sexual intercourse.torres valdivias denied putting his penis into his stepsister vagina and denied engaging in oral sex with her.
the ij concluded that torres valdivias crime of sexual battery was quite clearly violent or dangerous and applied the heightened standard for granting discretionary relief from removal to violent or dangerous criminals established in matter of jean.under this heightened standard,the ij concluded,as a matter of discretion,that torres valdivias adjustment of status application should be denied and therefore ordered him removed.
torres valdivias appealed to the bia.on appeal,a panel of the bia agreed with the ij application of the heightened matter of jean standard to an adjustment of status application but remanded for the ij to further analyze whether torres valdivias offense was a violent or dangerous crime warranting application of that standard.
on remand,the ij incorporated his prior decision by reference and provided more detailed facts and further legal analysis the ij again concluded that torres valdivias crime of sexual battery constituted a violent or dangerous crime and denied,as a matter of discretion,his application for adjustment of status.the ij again ordered torres valdivias removed and certified the case back to the bia.the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision under matter of burbano,bia.
torres valdivias timely petitioned this court for review of the final order of removal entered against him.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the immigration and nationality act ina bars this court from exercising jurisdiction over various discretionary decisions of the immigration authorities,including any judgment regarding the granting of relief under.a b i.the bia ultimate discretionary decision to deny torres valdivias adjustment of status under i is therefore unreviewable.pursuant to a d,however,this court retains jurisdiction over constitutional questions and questions of law.we review questions of law de novo.annachamy holder,cir.
iii.discussion 
torres valdivias petition for review raises various issues framed as questions of law,namely whether the bia erred in not applying the categorical approach in determining whether torres valdivias crime was violent or dangerous for purposes of applying matter of jean whether the bia committed an error of law when it determined that torres valdivias crime was violent or dangerous and whether matter of jean is applicable in the context of an adjustment of status application under i with respect to the first and third issues,we agree with torres valdivias that they present questions of law but disagree with him on the merits.with respect to the second issue,however,we conclude that it presents a challenge to a discretionary decision of the bia and that we therefore lack jurisdiction to review it.
applicability of the categorical approach 
the heightened standard of matter of jean applies by its own terms only to aliens convicted of violent or dangerous crimes.at see also matter of k a,bia.torres valdivias argues that the bia erred by failing to apply the categorical approach in determining whether his conviction for sexual battery triggered the heightened matter of jean standard.
we disagree.adjustment of status under is a discretionary form of relief.see,i t he attorney general may adjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence emphasis added.in the context of the bia discretionary decisions,we have noted that it is proper for the bia to look to probative evidence outside the record of conviction in inquiring as to the circumstances surrounding the commission of a crime in order to determine whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted.tokatly ashcroft,cir second alteration in original quoting matter of mendez moralez,bia.indeed,in matter of jean itself,the attorney general looked at the facts underlying jean conviction,including those found in a medical examiner report and therefore outside the records of conviction to conclude that she was a violent or dangerous individual who should not be granted the form of discretionary relief she had applied for.see at.
it is not surprising that both our precedent and the attorney general decision in matter of jean counsel against the application of the categorical approach in this context.the categorical approach,as laid out in taylor united states,requires a court to look only at the statutory definition of a prior offense of conviction and ignore any facts not found in judicially noticeable records of conviction.this approach applies where congress intended that a certain statutory provision be triggered by crimes having certain specified elements id.at.in the immigration context,this approach therefore generally applies in determining whether an alien is removable in the first instance or whether he is statutorily barred from various forms of relief.see,tokatly,at noting that the categorical approach applies in order to determine whether an alien prior conviction constitutes a basis for removal under the ina castrijon garcia holder,cir a
