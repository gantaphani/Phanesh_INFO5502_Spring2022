tumaini temu is a tanzanian national who suffers from severe bipolar disorder.in his home country,temu was tortured by nurses and prison guards because of his illness.after entering the united states,he applied for asylum,arguing that he was persecuted because of his membership in a particular social group.the board of immigration appeals bia denied his application,finding that temu was not a member of a social group under the immigration and nationality act ina,and even if he was,temu did not show that he was persecuted because of membership in this group.because we agree with temu that the bia opinion rests on factual and legal errors,we grant temu petition for review,vacate the bia order,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts presented below are based on temu testimony,as well as testimony from two expert witnesses who discussed temu diagnosis and the conditions that individuals with mental illness face in tanzania.the ij credited the testimony of all three witnesses,and neither the bia nor the government dispute any of the facts presented.
temu troubles began during his final year at the university of dar es salaam,when his mother died in a car accident.this spurred a mental breakdown that forced temu to leave school,and he experienced a series of similar episodes that were later diagnosed as manifestations of bipolar disorder.during his manic episodes,temu believes he has superhuman powers.he is visibly erratic and often walks into busy intersections to direct traffic because he thinks he has the ability to prevent car accidents.this behavior caught the attention of tanzanian officials who took him to muhimbili hospital in dar es salaam,tanzania,in.
temu admission to muhimbili hospital kicked off years in asylums and prisons during which temu suffered violent physical abuse.at his asylum hearing,an expert witness testified that tanzanians consider mental illness to be shameful.in tanzanian culture,severe mental illness with visibly erratic behavior is seen as a manifestation of demonic possession.tanzanians even have a label for the group,referring to those with visibly severe mental illness as mwenda wazimu,which means.the expert witness testified that even medical professionals in tanzania believe that severe mental illness accompanied by erratic behavior is caused by demonic possession.laymen and doctors alike believe that demonic possession is contagious.for this reason,even though friends and family visited temu during his first hospitalization,they deserted him within months.
the nurses at muhimbili hospital treated temu with violence and abuse.nurses tied temu hands and feet for five to seven hours a day,four days per week.when temu condition worsened,his treatment became more inhumane,as he was bound and beaten with leather straps for eight hours per day,five or six days per week.hospital stints turned into prison stints,and the abuse continued.prison guards beat temu with a club about his elbows and feet four days per week.the beatings were so severe that he could not walk.
the record is unequivocal about what motivated the nurses and guards behavior.throughout all his hospitalizations,the nurses referred to temu as mwenda wazimu.the record also shows that while binding temu and beating him with leather straps,the nurses said on multiple occasions,this is how we treat people who are mentally ill like you.in prison,the guards also referred to temu as mwenda wazimu.all prisoners were beaten,but temu received worse beatings.however,other prisoners who also suffered from severe mental illness were beaten as much as temu.
upon coming to the united states,temu applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.b a,b a.temu argued that under a,he faced severe persecution because of his membership in the social group of individuals with bipolar disorder who exhibit erratic behavior.the immigration judge ij denied temu asylum and withholding claims.in a finding adopted by the bia,the ij concluded that temu proposed group lacks the elements of immutability,particularity and social visibility necessary to qualify as a particular social group under the ina.in addition,both the ij and bia concluded that even accepting temu proposed group,he did not show that he was persecuted because of his membership in this group.however,the ij granted temu cat relief.in doing so,the ij and bia found that temu was tortured by nurses and prison guards because he was mentally ill.
temu filed a timely appeal of the bia decision,arguing that it committed error in denying him asylum and withholding of removal.we have jurisdiction to hear his case under.
individuals qualify for asylum if they were persecuted on account of membership in a particular social group.a a this appeal raises two questions.first,we must analyze whether temu proposed group of individuals with bipolar disorder who exhibit erratic behavior qualifies as a particular social group.second,we ask whether temu was persecuted because of membership in his proposed group.under chevron,we give deference to the bia interpretation of the phrase particular social group.see cervantes holder,cir citing chevron,nrdc.however,in reviewing whether a group meets the bia definition of particular social group,we overturn a denial of asylum if it is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d see zelaya holder,cir crespin valladares holder,cir.we uphold factual findings unless no rational factfinder could agree with the bia position.crespin valladares,at.
we first consider the bia conclusion that temu was not persecuted because of membership in his proposed group.because this is a factual finding,our task is not to decide how we would rule in the first instance.rather,we must uphold the bia finding unless no rational factfinder could reach the same conclusion.see crespin valladares,at.in spite of this stringent standard of review,we are compelled to vacate because the bia finding on nexus contains two logical contradictions that no rational factfinder could hold.
first,it is impossible to square the bia conclusion with the undisputed facts of the case.the bia credited temu testimony in its entirety,and he testified not only that nurses beat and bound him,but also that they explicitly told him that t his is how we treat people who are mentally ill like you.temu testified that in prison,the guards beat all prisoners,but temu was singled out for worse beatings,and other prisoners with mental illness were beaten as much as temu.throughout his time in prisons and hospitals,the nurses and guards referred to him as mwenda wazimu.we fail to see how a rational factfinder could simultaneously credit these facts and also conclude that temu was not persecuted because of his mental illness and its manifestations.it is difficult to imagine evidence that is more persuasive and unequivocal than a persecutor directly telling a victim,t his is how we treat mentally ill people like you.
second,the bia nexus finding and cat finding are at logical loggerheads.the bia adopted the ij finding that there is no nexus between the respondent mistreatment and his defined particular social group,which is defined in part by bipolar disorder.that is,even accepting temu proposed group,the bia concluded that his beatings were due to his erratic behavior,not his bipolar disorder per se.mere pages later,however,the ij granted cat relief,finding that temu was singled out for more frequent beatings because he was mentally ill.we struggle to see how a rational factfinder could conclude both that temu was not persecuted because of his membership in the group of individuals with bipolar disorder who exhibit erratic behavior,and also that he was singled out for beatings because of his mental illness.it might be possible to reconcile these conflicting findings,but it would demand logical acrobatics,and the bia makes no attempt to explain how it can believe that temu was not persecuted because of his bipolar disorder but was tortured because he was mentally ill.
we are mindful that reviewing courts should not substitute their own judgment for the bia in areas where the bia is entrusted with the power to adjudicate claims in the first instance.see zuh,at.this is not a case of a mere difference in judgment.when the very core of an opinion is internally contradictory and advances diametrically opposed conclusions within paragraphs,this is the very essence of irrationality.because the bia nexus finding collapses under the weight of its logical defects,we are compelled to vacate the bia finding.
we next consider the bia conclusion that temu proposed group does not qualify as a particular social group under a a.through its case law,the bia has formulated a test for what constitutes a particular social group.see in re s e g,i n bia july.first,individuals in the group must share a common,immutable characteristic that members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change.id.at internal citation and quotation omitted.in addition,the group must have social visibility,which means the group should generally be recognizable by others in the community.id.at.finally,the group must be defined with particularity,which means the group must have concrete,identifiable boundaries that allow an observer to distinguish members of a group from.id.at.
we must uphold the bia conclusion that temu group does not qualify as a particular social group unless it is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.zelaya,at.because the bia opinion rests on legal error,we must reverse.it is unclear from the bia opinion whether it misapplied its own standard or applied a new standard without explanation,but in either case,the bia legal analysis is manifestly contrary to the law.further,the bia opinion rests on factual error.
we first consider the bia social visibility analysis.social visibility does not mean ocular visibility a group can qualify as a social group even if one can not identify members of the group by sight.see,henriquez rivas holder,cir rivera barrientos holder,cir.rather,social visibility speaks to whether a group is in fact recognized as a group.see in re c a,bia defining social visibility as whether a group is understood by others to constitute a social group.for example,in the united states,vietnam veterans,cancer survivors,blind people,cajuns,practitioners of falun gong and hippies would likely be identified as social groups,whereas children and haters of broccoli would not.henriquez rivas,at kozinski,dissenting.thus,many groups have qualified as socially visible under bia case law,even though their members are not visibly identifiable.see in re c a,at citing groups defined by kinship ties,prior employment,and genital mutilation.
temu group appears to have a strong case for social visibility,but the bia never applied a permissible legal standard.the bia found that while tanzanian society unquestionably targets individuals who exhibit erratic behavior for serious forms of mistreatment,this mistreatment is not limited to those who have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.for example,the ij noted that a visibly intoxicated person might exhibit erratic behavior and get targeted for mistreatment.id.on its face,it might appear that the ij opinion conflates the nexus requirement with social visibility,but in fact,the ij argument is much more subtle.the ij argument is that a lack of nexus is evidence of a lack of social visibility.thus,if persecutors torture a wide swath of victims indiscriminately,this not only suggests a lack of nexus,but it also suggests that the persecutors did not even consider any one victim particular social group.this,in turn,suggests a lack of social visibility.in sum,because the persecutors used erratic behavior as an overbroad proxy for identifying victims,the persecutors did not view temu proposed group as a group in the first place.
this conclusion does not show that temu group lacks social visibility it shows that temu group lacks visibility.the record is clear that tanzanians view those with severe,chronic mental illness who exhibit erratic behavior as a group,since these individuals are singled out for abuse in hospitals and prisons and are specifically labeled mwenda wazimu.the nurses in this case explicitly said that this is how we treat people who are mentally ill like you.emphasis added.the fact that tanzanians are overbroad in assigning this label to individuals does not show that social visibility is lacking.though the persecution can be poorly aimed in theory,tanzanians still appear to view the mwenda wazimu as a group,and that is all that social visibility requires.see henriquez rivas,f d at.
another formulation of the social visibility test lends further support to this point.circuit courts and the bia have argued that a group is socially visible if it can show that it is singled out for worse treatment than other groups.for example,the bia rejected a group of informants as lacking social visibility because informants are not in a substantially different situation from anyone who has crossed the persecutors or who is perceived to be a threat to the persecutors interests.in re c a,at see also in re a m e j g u,bia ramos lopez holder,cir.in this case,temu meets that test easily.the undisputed facts show that even though all prisoners were abused,temu was singled out for worse abuse,with the exception of other prisoners with mental illness,who received the same increased abuse as temu.
this formulation of social visibility also illustrates the bia legal misstep.evidence that persecutors target an entire population indiscriminately can be evidence of no social visibility.id.in that situation,the fact that members of a particular social group get caught in the same net is irrelevant.the bia extended this reasoning to conclude that any time a persecutor net is too large,social visibility must be lacking.the folly of this legal conclusion can be demonstrated with a hypothetical.imagine that an government decides to massacre any jewish citizens.now,imagine that in putting its policy into practice,the government collects a list of surnames of individuals who are known to be jewish and then kills anyone with the same surname.jews and gentiles alike might be murdered,but this does not change the fact that jews have social visibility as a group.meanwhile,under the bia reasoning,the fact that persecutors might lump members with group members is,by itself,enough evidence to find a lack of social visibility.
similarly,an analogy to a group that qualifies as a particular social group is helpful in illustrating why the bia analysis in this case is impermissible.there is no doubt under bia or federal case law that kinship ties can serve as the basis for a particular social group.the bia has identified kinship ties as a paradigmatic example of a particular social group.see crespin valladares,at citing in re c a,at in re h,bia.this court and every circuit court to have considered the question have reached the same conclusion.crespin valladares,at collecting case law.yet,under the bia reasoning in this case,if persecutors were using a distinctive family trait like curly red hair to identify and persecute individuals,then family ties would not qualify as a particular social group,since persecution would not be limited to those who are in the group.these examples illustrate why the bia application of its social visibility test is legally erroneous in this case.requiring what amounts to visibility,rather than social visibility,would lead to absurd conclusions that flout the case law of this court,other circuit courts,and the bia itself.
there is no mechanical way to separate haters of broccoli from vietnam veterans,henriquez rivas,at,but one highly relevant factor is if the applicant group is singled out for greater persecution than the population as a whole.in re c a,at.similarly,evidence that a proposed group has a specific label in a society is highly relevant.a group can not be defined solely by the fact of its persecution,gatimi holder,cir,so evidence that members of a society have a label for a proposed group helps suggest that the group has a common thread outside of its victimhood,assuming of course that the label is not something like persecution victims.in sum,we vacate the bia social visibility finding because it rests on legal error.
the bia also commits legal error in concluding that temu group lacks particularity.specifically,the bia erred because it broke down temu proposed group into pieces and rejected each piece,rather than analyzing his group as a whole.once again,the bia applied an impermissible legal standard because it rejected groups that temu never proposed.
a social group must have identifiable boundaries to meet the bia particularity element.for example,the group affluent guatemalans fails because the group changes dramatically based on who defines it.see in re a m e,at.affluent might include the wealthiest of guatemalans,or it might include the wealthiest.therefore,this group lacks boundaries that are fixed enough to qualify as a particular social group.
in this case,the bia found no particularity because bipolar disorder is too broad and erratic behavior is too fuzzy.first,bipolar disorder covers a wide range of severity.at its least severe,the disorder can be so mild as to be outwardly undetectable.therefore,the disorder covers too broad a spectrum of behavior to have identifiable boundaries.the other component of temu proposed group is erratic behavior,but this,too,lacks particularity.the definition of erratic behavior changes based on who defines it,and it is difficult to put precise,identifiable boundaries on what constitutes erratic behavior.because each part of temu proposed group lacks particularity,the bia concluded that the group as a whole fails.
the bia opinion commits legal error by splitting temu group in two and rejecting each part,rather than considering it as a whole.see crespin valladares,at.the bia is correct that the label of mental illness can cover a broad range of severity.on its own,it is possible though we do not decide that the group of individuals with bipolar disorder lacks particularity because of its breadth,but that is not temu proposed group.rather,temu limits his group to those individuals with bipolar disorder who exhibit outwardly erratic behavior.it may well be that mental illness lacks particular boundaries,since the label covers a huge swath of illness that ranges from to innocuous.temu group does not suffer from the same shortcoming,because it is limited to a specific mental illness so severe that individuals are visibly,identifiably disturbed.
similarly,the bia rejects erratic behavior as lacking particularity.erratic behavior is difficult to define and subjective.we doubt that individuals who exhibit erratic behavior would qualify as a particular social group,but again,temu proposed no such group.rather,temu group is limited to individuals who exhibit erratic behavior and suffer from bipolar disorder.unlike erratic behavior,the term bipolar disorder has,identifiable characteristics.see generally american psychiatric association,diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,world health organization,international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems v.the bia faulted temu group because it lacks an adequate benchmark,but that is precisely what the dsm v supplies with regard to the other component of temu group.thus,erratic behavior has unclear boundaries that the other component of temu group supplies.in turn,bipolar disorder covers a broad spectrum of behavior that is sharply limited by the requirement of erratic behavior.
in essence,the bia committed legal error because it missed the forest for the trees.while each component of temu group might not satisfy the particularity requirement individually,the bia must consider temu definition as a whole.see crespin valladares,at the bia legal error flowed from the fact that,as the government concedes,the bia removal order rejected a group different from that which the applicants proposed.for example,we have recently found that the group consisting of family members of those who actively oppose gangs in el salvador by agreeing to be prosecutorial witnesses qualifies as a particular social group.id.at.each component of the group in crespin valladares might not have particular boundaries.prosecutorial witnesses might reach too broad a swath of individuals those who actively oppose gangs might be too fuzzy a label for a group.our case law is clear,however,that the group as a whole qualifies.in this case,the bia took issue with the component parts of temu group,but it never reached the stage of assessing the particularity of temu group as a whole.instead,it considered and rejected two different groups that were based on pieces of temu group.
thus,the bia particularity analysis was based on legal error.the ina requires that an individual be persecuted because of membership in a particular social group.a.nothing in the statute requires that if a group is defined by a collection of traits,that each individual trait must meet all the criteria for a particular social group.time and again,case law from this court,other circuits,and the bia has accepted social groups that,as part of their definitions,contain components that might not meet the bia legal standards.see crespin valladares,at accepting the group of family members of those who actively oppose gangs in el salvador by agreeing to be prosecutorial witnesses tapiero de orejuela gonzales,cir accepting the group of educated,landowning class of cattle farmers in re c a,at citing favorably the group of young women of a particular tribe who were opposed to female genital mutilation as a particular social group citing in re kasinga,bia.notably,the bia itself has accepted individuals with bipolar disorder as a particular social group in the past,albeit in cases that,like this one,were unpublished.in re daniel francisco lopez sanchez,immig.rptr.lexis bia in re a,bia may,slip op.in fact,after oral arguments in this case,the bia issued a decision accepting the particular social group of individuals in ghana with severe mental illness,specifically bipolar disorder,who are indigent and lack family support.in re,bia,slip op.these cases illustrate that in making asylum determinations,the bia must consider an individual proposed group as a whole.once again,it is unclear whether the bia misapplied its own legal standard or advanced a new legal standard that involves piecemeal analysis.either way,the bia opinion is manifestly contrary to the law.crespin valladares,at.
particular social groups must also be characterized by immutability,and temu proposed group easily satisfies this final element.the bia conclusion to the contrary rests on factual error.the bia opinion finds that there is no cure for bipolar disorder,so there is no doubt that bipolar disorder is immutable.however,the bia found no immutability because temu erratic behavior can be controlled with medication.id.however,in the same opinion,the bia also adopts the finding that there is no consistent access to the medications the respondent needs in tanzania,and that because his family has abandoned temu,he will not be able to obtain what medications are available.once again,the bia opinion advances two factual findings that are impossible to reconcile without violating fundamental rules of logic.according to the bia,temu disorder will never be cured and will only worsen.he can only control his behavior with medication,but he will not have access to this medication in tanzania.the inescapable conclusion from this finding is that if he is returned to tanzania,temu will not be able to control his behavior.in sum,temu membership in his proposed group is not something he has the power to change.
the bia position has been explicitly rejected by the seventh circuit and by the bia itself.in kholyavskiy mukasey,the seventh circuit considered an asylum claim based in part on the applicant mental illness,cir.the bia found no immutability because even if the disease is incurable,the individual behavior could be controlled through that the applicant would not have access to if returned to his home country.the seventh circuit concluded that the bia immutability argument,which is identical to the one presented here,had no factual basis.id.at.further,the bia itself has found that severe mental illness is immutable in two unpublished opinions,explicitly ruling that bipolar disorder is a chronic psychiatric condition subject to treatment but not cure,and thus it is an immutable characteristic.in re a,bia may,slip op.in re,bia,slip op.finding immutability because bipolar illness is permanent regardless of medication.these cases reach the same conclusion that is compelled by the facts of this case when an individual suffers from an incurable mental illness,it is of no relevance that somewhere in the world,there exists medication that can help him control the illness.if he can not access the medication,his behavior is as effectively immutable as if the medication did not exist.further,the underlying bipolar disorder will never change.while it can be managed,this does not mean that it can be cured.these facts compel the finding that temu group membership is immutable.
for the foregoing reasons,we grant the petition for review,vacate the bia order affirming the ij decision,and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.
petition for review granted,order vacated,and case remanded.
because i find the majority opinion errs in holding that the board of immigration appeals board impermissibly interpreted the immigration and nationality act ina in reviewing temu application for asylum and withholding of removal under the ina,i respectfully dissent.specifically,i conclude that the board did not err as a matter of law in its determination that temu proposed social group lacked the necessary characteristic of particularity.
as the majority describes,the facts are not in dispute and the immigration judge ij found the evidence temu presented including his own testimony about his treatment in tanzania to be credible.the record demonstrates that,beginning in or,temu began displaying erratic behavior and was both hospitalized and jailed following episodes where he would walk onto a road and attempt to direct traffic.during his hospitalizations and imprisonment,he was tied up and beaten.the nurses and doctors indicated that they believed temu was mentally ill and referred to him by the term mwenda wazimu,which roughly means or deranged,upon temu release,his family increasingly rejected him as their efforts to rid him of his evil spirit failed.
while lawfully in the united states on a temporary visa,temu was taken to the hospital after police observed him standing in the middle of a street attempting to direct traffic.over time and after observation,medical professionals diagnosed temu with bipolar disorder.temu visitor visa expired in,but he nevertheless remained in the united states unlawfully.although he can be employed and function independently while on medication,temu has suffered relapses when he does not take his medications.on two occasions during such relapses,temu was detained in psychiatric facilities after police observed him in the middle of a street attempting to control traffic.
in,the department of homeland security filed a notice to appear against temu charging him with eligibility for removal based on overstaying his visitor visa without authorization.he asserted eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under the ina based on his membership in a particular social group,which he identified as schizophrenic and bipolar individuals in tanzania who exhibit outwardly erratic behavior.
the ij concluded that temu satisfied the requirements for filing a late application for relief,and also determined that he satisfied the criteria for relief under the convention against torture.as to temu other claims,the ij concluded that temu was ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the ina because he failed to demonstrate that the harm he suffered was inflicted on account of his membership in a cognizable particular social group as required by law.she held that temu proposed group lacked the three characteristics for a particular social group that the agency has determined the ina requires particularity,immutability,and social visibility.alternatively,the ij concluded that temu failed to demonstrate a nexus between his past persecution and his membership in the proposed social group.the board adopted the ij findings and conclusions,and dismissed temu appeal,agreeing that temu proposed group did not satisfy the requirements for a particular social group.
the court must uphold the denial of temu application for asylum unless the denial is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d.whether a proposed group constitutes a particular social group under the ina is a question of law that the court reviews de novo.lin mukasey,cir.in so doing,however,the court accords deference to the board reasonable interpretation of the ina.id.at.where,as here,the board adopts the ij decision and includes its own reasons for affirming,the court reviews both decisions.marynenka holder,cir.
to establish eligibility for the discretionary relief of asylum,temu had the burden of showing that he has a fear of persecution on account of membership in a particular social group naizgi gonzales,cir citing a a a.temu faces a higher burden of proof to establish eligibility for withholding of removal he must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened because of his membership in a particular social group gomis holder,cir citing b a b see also camara ashcroft,cir.
the ina does not define particular social group.the ij and board rely on prior board opinions that interpreted this phrase to mean a group that share s a common,immutable characteristic other than the fact that they are targeted for persecution,that has particular and boundaries,and that possess es a recognized level of social visibility.
temu challenges the ij and board application of the analysis of his proposed group and its conclusion that it was not a cognizable particular social group under the ina.as noted,the ij and board concluded that temu proposed group of bipolar individuals in tanzania who exhibit outwardly erratic behavior lacked all three characteristics necessary for an alien to prove his or her particular social group status immutability,particularity,and social visibility.i conclude that the board decision can be upheld with respect to the particularity requirement,and it is therefore unnecessary to proceed further to deny temu petition for review.see zelaya holder,cir affirming the board decision to deny asylum based on conclusion that the proposed group lacks particularity without discussing the remaining characteristics 
as its title suggests,a particular social group must have particular and boundaries,id.at,such that it is not too amorphous to create a benchmark for determining group membership,matter of s e g.the majority concludes that the ij and board determination that temu proposed group lacks particularity is based on an error of law.op.at.specifically,the majority opines that the ij and board commit ted legal error by splitting temu group in two and rejecting each part,rather than considering it as a whole.op.at.i disagree.
at the outset,it is fundamentally important to review the ij and board actual holdings.the ij concluded that temu proposed social group lacked particularity because the term erratic behavior is too amorphous to provide an adequate benchmark for determining group membership.it explained that e rratic behavior could range from eccentric remarks to violent outbursts.whether one perceives a particular behavior to be erratic is a question of perspective,and as a result the respondent particular social group lacks particularity.id.the board,in turn,agreed with the ij conclusion that erratic behavior is too indeterminate to meet the requirement of particularity as the mentally ill comprise a wide variety of different individuals covering a broad range of functionality.and in rejecting temu argument that he satisfied the particularity requirement with evidence that individuals with bipolar disorder suffer from a discrete set of symptoms that include s erratic behavior,the board also noted that erratic behavior is an amorphous characteristic,which does not provid
