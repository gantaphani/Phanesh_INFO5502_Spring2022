opinion of the court 
li wu lin,once a student in the people republic of china,participated prominently in four protests in the weeks and days before the massacre at tiananmen square.fearing persecution in the wake of the government crackdown,lin fled his country and eventually arrived in the united states where he sought both political asylum under a of the immigration and nationality act,a,and withholding of deportation under h of the act,h.the immigration judge and the board of immigration appeals have denied him relief under both provisions,clearing the way for his deportation.lin now brings this petition for review.
in the spring of lin was old and a student at a middle school in the fujian province.sympathetic to the student movement then gaining momentum,lin joined in marches that protested the government corruption,undemocratic rule,and disregard for human rights.
the first demonstration that lin joined occurred on may,and involved about students who gathered in front of a county government building.because lin is unusually tall and,as he puts it,very active,he was placed at the front of the march and given a protest sign to hold and a headband to wear that demanded freedom for china.he explained that a few of his teachers helped organize the demonstration and participated in the march,but others were afraid of getting involved.
on may lin again joined the head of the assembled crowd,held a sign,and marched to the county government building.this time when they arrived at the building,the police and army blocked the entrance.lin and the others tried to push through the barricade to occupy the building,but the officers and soldiers pushed the students back,beating them with electric batons.lin said he shielded himself with his arms as he retreated.a few days later lin headed another parade on may,and he went to a fourth on june when he traveled with others to a large demonstration in front of the city government building in fuzhou,a large city in the province.
two days after this last demonstration,the protest movement in china ended with the tiananmen square massacre in beijing on june.according to every major american newspaper,chinese soldiers accompanied by tanks drove the student protesters from tiananmen square,fired on them with automatic weapons,and crushed others to death under the tanks.newspapers reported that at least people were killed.see,daniel southerland,death in tiananmen witnesses describe the devastating assault,washington post,june,at.
although he did not live in beijing and had not participated in any protests there,lin was worried about the sharp change in the government response to the protests.after an uncle informed him that the police were seeking one of his relatives for her participation in protests,he feared that they would soon come after him too,so he traveled to an aunt home in another town about twenty minutes away by bus.
six days after the massacre in beijing,on june,two police officers and a brigade leader in fact came to lin home.because he was not there,they spoke to his mother lin father is deceased and gave her a subpoena demanding that lin appear immediately for interrogation at the security section,public security bureau.in his written personal statement lin said that the officers told my mother i was involved in the democracy movement and they demanded to know my location.when she did tell,they demanded she find me they said i would be arrested and punished strictly if i was caught,including imprisonment.app.at.
although political refugees are rarely able,amid the confusion of flight,to amass physical evidence verifying the validity of their asylum claims,see senathirajah ins,cir,in this case lin mother managed to mail him the subpoena she received.a copy of the subpoena,with a translation,has been included in the record,and all of the information on it is consistent with lin story.the immigration judge did request that the government check the age or authenticity of the document,but the government failed to take any action.
despite the police delivery of the subpoena,lin never reported for interrogation.instead he moved from his aunt house to a much more distant location three hours away,where he stayed for roughly years while his family gathered the money to pay a smuggler to take him out of the country.during his wait,lin said he worked briefly in a bakery for a few months,but then quit because he was afraid he would attract the government attention.
officials returned to lin home five more times to look for him.the first time they returned,on june,lin said that the officers took his mother to the changle county security bureau,detained her for half a day,and threatened her when she would not reveal her son location.lin said they asked her many times about me and threatened to jail her.app.at.the officers returned in early july of,at the end of,on may,and in january of.lin explained,they always asked for my location,said i had participated in the student movement,and continued to say i would be in serious trouble if caught.app.at.
lin learned that one of his classmates,lin bin,whom he knew well,was arrested and sentenced to one year of detention and forced labor.in march of three other classmates were arrested,beaten,and sentenced to between one and years of detention and forced labor.lin testified that these classmates all had participated in the same events that i did,and all were sentenced for their student movement activities.app.at.
once the smugglers supplied him with a fake passport from singapore,lin left china on january,and traveled by airplane first to sen jen phonetic spelling and then hong kong where he stayed for about a week.after a brief stopover in singapore,he moved again to somewhere in former czechoslovakia,where he lived with another person from china for about eight months.from there he took a train to a country whose identity he never learned and boarded a plane for the united states,arriving on october.
lin appeared before an immigration judge for two evidentiary on may,and the second on september.the judge rendered a brief oral opinion at the second hearing denying lin the relief he sought.about years delay the government lawyer attributed to the agency board rejected lin appeal.collectively,the total time that this case has been pending now spans years.this delay is unconscionable.as other courts have remarked,many problems are created when asylum cases are so protracted.salameda ins,cir.
in its opinion,the board found lin testimony credible and consistent,but the board nevertheless concluded that lin did not have a fear of persecution in china.the board reasoned,as did the immigration judge,that since lin admitted in his testimony that he joined the other demonstrators in attempting to occupy a county government building during the second demonstration,the subpoena merely showed that the chinese government was interested in enforcing a neutral law of general applicability,namely the law against trespass.
we have jurisdiction under a of the immigration and nationality act,a,as amended by of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.because this case does not turn on any novel legal interpretation by the board and instead involves the board and application of established legal standards,we will reverse the board decision to deny asylum and withholding of deportation only if a reasonable would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.chang ins,cir citing ins,d.
lin has sought two different types of asylum and withholding of deportation.to qualify for political asylum,the first type of relief,an alien must be a refugee within the meaning of a.under that provision a refugee includes those who are unable or unwilling to return to their country of nationality because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group or political opinion.chang,at quoting a a.in this case lin seeks to establish that he has a fear of persecution because of his political opinions.breaking this standard into parts,we can say that lin must show that the government pursued him because of his political opinions,the action that the government would take against him is sufficiently serious to constitute persecution,and he has a fear that the persecution will in fact occur.see,chang,at.
for the government action to constitute persecution,it must amount to more than generally harsh conditions shared by many other persons,but does include threats to life,confinement,torture,and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a real threat to life or freedom.chang,at citations omitted.the requirement that his fear be includes both a subjective and objective component.no one has ever questioned that lin holds a genuine subjective fear of persecution,so our focus is on the objective,was his subjective fear of persecution supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility.chang,at citing ins,d.this standard does not require a showing that persecution is more likely than not.fear can be even when there is less than chance of the occurrence taking place.chang,at quoting,at.at,d.
if an alien satisfies these standards for political asylum,then the attorney general has discretion to decide whether to grant asylum or not,at.at.by contrast,if an alien qualifies for withholding of deportation,the second type of relief at issue in this appeal,then the attorney general is prohibited from deporting the alien to the country where the persecution will occur.at.at.
to qualify for mandatory relief under withholding of deportation,lin must show a clear probability that upon his return to china his life or freedom would be threatened because of his political opinions.chang,at.put differently,the standard is that he must show that it is more likely than not that he will face persecution if he is deported,at.at.
in chang we held that an alien can be entitled to both asylum and withholding of deportation based on a fear of prosecution under a law of general applicability.t he memory of hitler atrocities and of the legal system he corrupted to serve his purposes are still too fresh for us to suppose that physical persecution may not bear the nihil obstat of a recognized judicial system.chang,at quoting sovich esperdy,cir.we concluded that if the prosecution is motivated by one of the enumerated factors,such as political opinion,and if the punishment under the law is sufficiently serious to constitute persecution,then the prosecution under the law of general applicability can justify asylum or withholding of deportation.chang,at.
we conclude that lin has satisfied both the standards for political asylum and those for withholding of deportation.the board reasoned in our case that while lin is conclusion in keeping with our decisions in senathirajah and balasubramanrim ins,cir he does not face persecution.instead,the board speculated,his testimony only established that the chinese police sought him for trespass.but the board view of events is wholly unsupported by the record.nowhere is there any evidence that the chinese police sought lin because of his trespass as opposed to his political expression.indeed,for all the evidence revealed,the government was not even aware that lin committed trespass as part of his participation in marches.lin specifically asserted that when the police first came to his house,they said that they sought him because he was involved in the democracy movement.the police said nothing about trespass.lin also specifically stated that his classmates were beaten,incarcerated,and subjected to forced labor for their student movement activities.
more fundamentally,lin subpoena was issued six days after the chinese government used tanks and machine guns to kill at least hundred and possibly more nonviolent protesters.it is difficult to believe that in the wake of political repression on that scale that the government was acting as a disinterested enforcer of neutral laws when it demanded that lin appear for interrogation.we do not understand why the government would send two police officers and a brigade leader if it did not believe more was at stake than a old trespass.nor does it make sense that if simple trespass was at issue,the police would return five more times over the course of the next year and a half.that is a long time to pursue a student trespass.nor would it make sense that they would take lin mother to the security bureau and interrogate her for half a day about his whereabouts.nor is it very plausible that the government would subject lin classmates to the punishment they received if trespassing was foremost on the government mind.
the idea that the subpoena was not aimed at lin political expression also flies in the face of what journalists reported shortly after the massacre in tiananmen square.on june,day before the police brought the subpoena to lin wall street journal reported that the chinese government launch ed a campaign of arrests against student and other demonstrators.the article said that premier li peng appeared on television for the first time since the massacre and was shown congratulating troops on behalf of the government and the communist party.the article continued,government television announcements demanded that student demonstration leaders and free organizers turn themselves in or face arrest.james sterba,campaign is begun to arrest protesters as signs grow that hardliners prevail,wall street journal,june.see also nicholas kristof,china premier reappears army seems to tighten grip,new york times,june,nicholas kristof,crackdown in china a student leader turns himself in,june,the chinese government today reported a new series of arrests around the nation of those involved in the democracy movement.even a passing familiarity with china history in the twentieth century would remind the boar d that the chinese government has frequently used force and coercion to suppress political dissent.the cultural revolution occurred as recently as to lin own life.severe political repression is not a remote part of china history.
indeed,assistant secretary harold koh recent testimony in march of before a house subcommittee indicated,in the weeks leading up to both june,the anniversary of the tiananmen massacre,and october,the anniversary of the founding of the people republic,the government moved against political dissidents across the country,detaining and formally arresting scores of activists nationwide and thwarting any attempts to use the anniversaries as opportunities for protest.testimony before the subcommittee on international operations and human rights,house of representatives,washington,march.in the brief lin submitted in to the board,he points out that the state department country report stated that of the protesters detained for participating in the protests were still imprisoned at that time,and the number of people incarcerated could be in the thousands.app.at.other reports put the numbers even higher.id.
when the government lawyer skeptically questioned lin about why he remembered the exact day he left,testified 
i escaped out of my country.i was so scared of the arrest by the chinese public security bureau officers,so i could still remember it.
i was so scared.
on appeal the government defends the board decision by invoking a letter that the state department submitted to the immigration judge.but the thrust of that letter was to reject lin the board expressly did not do.because the board never cited the state department letter in its opinion and could not have relied on it with much logical consistency,we question to what extent the board decision can be upheld based on what that letter said.perhaps the government theory is that the board implicitly rejected lin credibility to the extent that it conflicted with what was said in the letter.but the board of course never identified any part of lin testimony that it rejected as not credible,and so we have no way to evaluate the validity of its reasons for purportedly rejecting part of his story.despite these defects in relying on the state department letter,however,we will address the contents of that letter because we find its reasoning as unconvincing as the board.
one reason that the state depart
