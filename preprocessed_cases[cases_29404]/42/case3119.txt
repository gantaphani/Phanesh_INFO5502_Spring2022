granting in part and denying in part a petition for review of the board of immigration appeals decision affirming the denial of withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture,the panel afforded chevron deference to the board articulation in matter of w g r,bia and matter of m e v g,bia of its particularity and social distinction requirements for demonstrating membership in a particular social group for purposes of withholding relief,but held that the board applied an impermissible standard of review in assessing the request for cat relief.
the panel held that the board construction of the particularity requirement,which focuses on whether the group is discrete or is,instead,amorphous,is reasonable and consistent with its own precedent,which has long required that a particular social group have clear boundaries and that its characteristics have commonly accepted definitions.
the panel held that the board articulation of its social distinction requirement,which requires evidence showing that society in general perceives,considers,or recognizes persons sharing the particular characteristic to be a group,is also reasonable.
applying that framework,the panel held that the board reasonably determined that petitioner proposed particular social group of former members of mara gang lacks particularity and social distinction,and that his proposed social group of deportees from the united states to el salvador lacks particularity.
the panel remanded the cat claim to allow the agency to reconsider the application for cat relief recognizing that killings can constitute torture,and to undertake the requisite fact finding in accordance with the agency regulations.
callahan,circuit judge 
wilfredo garay reyes,a native and citizen of el salvador,petitions for review of a precedential board of immigration appeals bia opinion in matter of w g r,bia,wherein the bia dismissed garay appeal from an immigration judge ij denial of garay applications for withholding of removal and relief from removal under article of the convention against torture cat relief garay claims he is entitled to withholding of removal because,if removed to el salvador,he will more likely than not face persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group consisting of former members of the mara gang in el salvador who have renounced their gang membership and,alternatively,a group consisting of deportees from the united states to el salvador.garay also maintains that he is entitled to cat relief because he faces a clear probability of torture from the mara gang,salvadoran death squads,and salvadoran government actors.
we have jurisdiction under.we deny garay petition in connection with his claims for withholding of removal.we conclude that the bia articulation of its particularity and social distinction requirements for demonstrating membership in a particular social group are entitled to chevron deference.see chevron,natural resources defense council.we also conclude that the bia reasonably determined that garay proposed particular social groups of former members of mara and deportees from the united states to el salvador are not cognizable.however,because the ij committed legal error and the bia employed an impermissible standard of review in assessing garay request for cat relief,we grant garay petition with respect to the denial of his cat claim.
in,at the age of seventeen,garay joined the mara gang in el salvador.upon joining mara,garay participated in three to five robberies of wealthy ranchers.four months after garay joined the gang,a new and more violent leader,named francisco,took over,and the gang committed a string of armed bank robberies under his leadership.garay,armed with a gun,served as a driver for two or three heists.
disenchanted with francisco leadership style and not wishing to be further involved in bank robberies,garay decided to leave the gang after being a member for less than a year.garay went into hiding,moving to another town.garay feared retribution or reprisals from francisco,who had previously announced that anyone trying to leave could be punished with beatings or death.
after garay fled,francisco found garay and shot him in the leg.some months later,garay was confronted in a billiard hall by assailants.he defended himself with his own machete and a handgun.in late,garay had his gang tattoo removed.shortly thereafter,garay left el salvador and made his way to the united states.
garay entered the united states without inspection in may,at age eighteen.now years old,garay has a wife and two daughters.there is no indication that garay has been involved with gangs since entering the united states.
on march,immigration and customs enforcement ice issued a notice to appear,alleging that garay was unlawfully present and should be removed.garay conceded removability as charged.garay,represented by counsel,testified before the ij on january.
following the hearing,the ij issued an oral decision,in which he found garay credible.the ij pretermitted garay application for asylum because it had not been filed within a year of his entry into the united states.
addressing garay withholding claim,the ij concluded that,although garay had been subjected to persecution in el salvador,he had not established that he was persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group consisting of former members of mara in el salvador who have renounced their gang membership.the ij noted garay month active membership in mara and reasoned that a lthough the respondent has clearly indicated that he wishes to renounce his gang membership,he can not disassociate himself from the volitional activities with which he was involved as a member of the mara gang.the ij also noted that garay had submitted background materials which indicate that el salvadoran gangs may have multiple motivations and modus operandi in their particular groups.
denying garay withholding claim,the ij cited arteaga mukasey,cir,and matter of e a g,bia,as authority for the proposition that membership in a violent criminal gang can not serve as the basis for a particular social group.the ij did not address whether garay had demonstrated a nexus to his purported membership in a social group.the ij also did not address garay alternative proposed social group of deportees from the united states to el salvador.
addressing garay claim for cat relief,the ij noted that garay had testified that he feared arrest by the police and that he could be subject to reprisals from his former fellow gang members if removed to el salvador.the ij concluded that garay had not shown a likelihood that he would be arrested because garay had failed to demonstrate that the police have been searching for him or that he had been charged with any crimes in el salvador.regarding reprisals from the gang,the ij stated that garay had suggested in his written application for relief that if he is located by his former gang that he could be subject to various brutal forms of treatment,including having a tire placed on him being filled with gasoline.however,the ij observed that garay had not mentioned his fear of that specific threat during his hearing,but had indicated that he believes that he would be killed by his former gang members.the ij then stated that the materials garay had submitted contain little if any information concerning the treatment of former gang members such as himself upon their return to el salvador beyond being killed.the ij concluded that garay had failed to demonstrate by any standard that he would be subjected to torture.
the ij ordered garay removed to el salvador.garay timely appealed to the bia.
on february,the bia panel dismissed garay appeal in a precedential decision,matter of w g r,bia.in matter of w g r,and in a companion precedential decision issued the same day,matter of m e v g,bia,the bia clarified the requirements that an applicant for asylum or withholding of removal must satisfy in order to demonstrate membership in a particular social group.the applicant must establish that the group is composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic,defined with particularity,and socially distinct within the society in question.m e v g,at see also w g r,at.
in matter of w g r,the bia reviewed its historical efforts to construe the statutory term particular social group as it applies in asylum and withholding cases.at.the bia explained that its articulation of the particularity and social visibility requirements was not a departure from or abrogation of its construction of a particular social group in matter of acosta,bia id.at citing holder,cir.en banc.instead,the bia explained,the requirements clarified the definition of the term particular social group to give it more concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.id.at quoting ins.in matter of w g r,the bia adhered to its previous holdings that both particularity and social visibility are critical elements in determining the cognizability of a particular social group,but the social visibility criterion as social distinction.id.
the bia observed that the term particularity is included in the plain language of the statute.id.at.the bia explained that t he particularity requirement also derives from the concept of immutability clarifying the point,at least implicit in earlier case law,that not every immutable characteristic is sufficiently precise to define a particular social group.id.the bia explained that the focus of the particularity requirement is whether the group is discrete or is,instead,amorphous.id.at.
the bia clarified that the term social distinction was intended to replace the term social visibility.social distinction more accurately describes the function of the requirement and reflects that it is not intended to require literal,ocular,or visibility.id.at.beyond that,the bia clarified 
to have the social distinction necessary to establish a particular social group,there must be evidence showing that society in general perceives,considers,or recognizes persons sharing the particular characteristic to be a group.although the society in question need not be able to easily identify who is a member of the group,it must be commonly recognized that the shared characteristic is one that defines the group.
id.at emphasis added.
the bia explained that its decision not to focus the social distinction inquiry solely on the persecutor perspective was based,in part,on the fact that the inquiry into whether a group is a particular social group is distinct from the inquiry into the nexus requirement,which considers whether a person is persecuted on account of membership in a particular social group id.at.
turning to garay withholding claim,the bia agreed with the ij that garay proposed group of former members of the mara gang in el salvador who have renounced their gang membership was not cognizable.id.at.the bia reasoned that t he group as defined lacks particularity because it is too diffuse,as well as being too broad and subjective.id.the bia commented that,a s described,the group could include persons of any age,sex,or background.it is not limited to those who have had a meaningful involvement with the gang and would thus consider themselves and be considered by others as former gang members.id.
addressing the social distinction requirement,the bia stated that t he record contains scant evidence that salvadoran society considers former gang members who have renounced their gang membership as a distinct social group.id.at.the bia concluded that garay had not provided evidence demonstrating that his proposed particular social group is perceived,considered,or recognized in salvadoran society as a distinct group.id.
having determined that garay had not demonstrated membership in a cognizable group,the bia did not need to address the nexus requirement.however,it held in the alternative that garay had not demonstrated the required nexus between the harm he fears and his status as a former gang member.id.at.the bia noted that while persecution can be a factor in determining whether a group is recognized as a distinct group within the relevant society,the persecutor views play a greater role in determining whether persecution is inflicted on account of the victim membership in a particular social group.id.the bia then determined that garay had not shown that any acts of retribution or punishment by gang members would be motivated by his status as a former gang member,rather than by the gang members desire to enforce their code of conduct.id.at.
the bia also rejected garay proposed social group of deportees from the united states to el salvador.the bia found that the proposed group is too broad and diverse a group to satisfy the particularity requirement for a particular social group under the act.id.at citing holder,cir.per curiam.the bia explained 
the respondent purported social group could include men,women,and children of all ages.their removal from the united states could be based on numerous different factors.the length of time they were in the united states,the recency of their removal,and societal views on how long a person is considered a deportee after repatriation could vary immensely.
finally,the bia reviewed the ij denial of cat relief for clear error,and affirmed.id.at.it reviewed evidence in support of garay claims that he feared torture at the hands of rival gangs,the police,or clandestine death squads,id.at,but concluded that the immigration judge predictive findings with respect to the respondent torture claim we re not clearly erroneous id.at.
in a footnote to its cat analysis,the bia addressed garay challenge to the ij statement that the background materials garay had submitted contained little information about the treatment former gang members face beyond being killed.id.at.the bia disagreed with garay characterization of the ij decision as holding that garay faces a danger of being killed but that death is not torture.id.the bia read the ij statement not as an assertion that killings are not torture but,rather,as h o ld ing that the evidence was not sufficient to show a clear probability that the respondent would be tortured.id.
garay timely petitioned for review of the final order of removal entered by the bia.
the primary issue in this case is whether we should accord deference to the bia particularity and social distinction requirements for establishing the existence of a particular social group,as articulated in the precedential opinion in garay case,matter of w g r.
the bia construction of ambiguous statutory terms in precedential decisions is entitled to deference under chevron,at.henriquez rivas,at.we must accept the bia construction if it is reasonable,even if the agency reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,brand x.consistency with the agency past practice or precedent is not required for an agency interpretation to be due chevron deference a new or varying agency interpretation is permitted,if it is adequately explained.id.at.
garay contends that the bia particularity and social distinction requirements are unreasonable,unreasoned,and impermissibly prevent individuals from seeking asylum.we disagree and conclude that bia present articulation of the particularity and social distinction requirements is consistent with the statute,reflects the agency ongoing efforts to construe the ambiguous statutory phrase particular social group,is reasonable,and is entitled to chevron deference.
the phrase membership in a particular social group is not defined in the statute and has spawned extensive debate and litigation matter of w g r and matter of m e v g are the latest in a long line of bia decisions refining the contours of this ambiguous statutory provision.
the bia first interpreted persecution on account of membership in a particular social group in matter of acosta,applying the doctrine of ejusdem generis to conclude that the phrase means persecution that is directed toward an individual who is a member of a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic.at,overruled on other grounds in matter of mogharrabi,bia.
in the ensuing years,acosta immutable characteristic test led to confusion and a lack of consistency as adjudicators struggled with various possible social groups,some of which appeared to be created exclusively for asylum purposes.matter of m e v g,at.in response to calls for greater clarity,and in order to address the evolving nature of the claims presented by asylum applicants,the bia refined the acosta standard by stating that an asylum applicant must also demonstrate that his proposed particular social group has social visibility and particularity,at quoting matter of c a,bia matter of m e v g,at.the social visibility requirement considered whether the proposed particular social group was easily recognizable and understood by others to constitute a social group.matter of c a,at.
in subsequent cases,the bia further elaborated on the meaning of the particularity and social visibility requirements.in matter of s e g,bia,the bia stated t he essence of the particularity requirement,therefore,is whether the proposed group can accurately be described in a manner sufficiently distinct that the group would be recognized,in the society in question,as a discrete class of persons.in matter of e a g,bia,the bia explained t he purported group social visibility,the extent to which members of a society perceive those with the characteristic in question as members of a social group is of particular importance in determining whether an alien is a member of a claimed particular social group.
the bia attempts to clarify its social visibility requirement received mixed reviews from the circuit courts.in,at,we noted that most circuits had accepted the bia social visibility and particularity criteria,but that the third and seventh circuits had rejected the criteria as an unreasonable interpretation of the ambiguous statutory term.
in,we clarif ied the social visibility and particularity criteria without reaching the ultimate question of whether the criteria themselves are valid,whether they were due chevron deference.id.at we did,however,comment that s o long as the social visibility and particularity criteria are applied in a way that did not directly conflict with prior agency precedent,we would be to reject the new criteria as unreasonable under chevron.id.at.
we now hold that the bia interpretation in w g r and m e v g of the ambiguous phrase particular social group,including the bia articulation of the particularity and social distinction requirements is reasonable and entitled to chevron deference.we consider the requirements in turn.
we recognized in that the particularity requirement is distinct from the social visibility requirement.the particularity requirement is separate,and it is relevant in considering whether a group boundaries are so amorphous that,in practice,the persecutor does not consider it a group.at.
the bia current articulation of its particularity requirement is reasonable and is consistent with its own precedent,which has long required that a particular social group have clear boundaries and that its characteristics have commonly accepted definitions.see,matter of s e g,at rejecting as too amorphous a proposed group of male children who lack stable families and meaningful adult protection,who are from middle and low income classes,who live in the territories controlled by the gang,and who refuse recruitment matter of a m e j g u,bia explaining that affluent guatemalans did not qualify as a particular social group in part because the characteristic of wealth or affluence is simply too subjective,inchoate,and variable to provide the sole basis for membership matter of c a,at,rejecting a proposed group of noncriminal drug informants working against the cali drug cartel due,in part,to the fact that the distinction between government informants who had been compensated for their services and those who acted out of civic motives was not sufficient to carve out a particular subgroup of uncompensated informants matter of v t s,bia holding filipino s of mixed ancestry cognizable as a particular social group in part because a country conditions report stated that of the philippine population had an identifiable chinese background.the bia statement of the purpose and function of the particularity requirement does not,on its face,impose a numerical limit on a proposed social group or disqualify groups that exceed specific breadth or size limitations.nor is it contrary to the principle that diversity within a proposed particular social group may not serve as the sine qua non of the particularity analysis.cordoba holder,cir,at.rather,the bia imposes the particularity requirement in order to distinguish between social groups that are discrete and those that are amorphous.matter of w g r,at.recognizing that,in order to be particular,a group must have some definable boundary is not unreasonable.
we thus find the definition of the particularity requirement articulated in w g r and m e v g to be both reasonable and consistent with the bia own precedent.brand x,at.
the bia articulation of its social distinction requirement is also reasonable.the social distinction requirement is not,as garay contends,a new requirement.rather,the social distinction requirement is reasonably read to be precisely what the bia characterizes it to be a renaming of the social visibility requirement.matter of w g r,at.
in,we did not reject the erstwhile social visibility requirement as an unreasoned concept,as alleged by garay.rather,we examined the concept and concluded that the social visibility inquiry can not require visibility.we held that the proper inquiry is whether a proposed particular social group shared characteristic or characteristics would generally be recognizable by other members of the community,or whether there was evidence that members of the proposed group would be perceived as a group by society.at internal quotation marks omitted.the bia explanation of its social distinction requirement is consistent with our articulation of the appropriate inquiry.
additionally,although we commented in on the potential import of the persecutor perspective in assessing social visibility,id.at looking to the text of the statute,in the context of persecution,we believe that the perception of the persecutors may matter the most,the agency is not bound by our belief,as we did not hold that it was the only reasonable construction of an unambiguous statutory term brand x,at,at noting that left the issue for the bia to decide.moreover,the bia articulation of the social distinction requirement does not preclude consideration of the persecutor perspective.rather,as we acknowledged in,the bia has noted at least two ways in which the perception of the applicant persecutors may be relevant.at.we noted that,while the bia did not give the persecutor perspective the same role in the analysis as the one this court had recommended in,it did give that perspective an important place.id.accordingly,the bia social distinction requirement does not unreasonably discount the perceptions of persecutors.
finally,the social distinction requirement is not redundant in light of the nexus requirement for asylum and withholding claims.rather than conflate the social distinction and nexus requirements,the bia reasoning reflects an appreciation of the need to distinguish between the showing an applicant must make in order to demonstrate membership in a particular social group and the showing that is necessary to demonstrate that he was persecuted,or fears persecution,on account of that membership.this is consistent with the supreme court conception of the nexus requirement.see ins,explaining that the statute makes motive critical and an asylum applicant must provide direct or circumstantial evidence of his persecutors motives in order to satisfy the nexus requirement.
accordingly,we reject garay challenges to the bia construction of the phrase particular social group because we find that the bia articulation of the particularity and social distinction requirements in matter of w g r is reasonable and entitled to chevron deference brand x,at.
having determined that the bia definition of particular social group is entitled to chevron deference,we next consider garay contention that the bia erred in finding that his proposed social group of former members of the mara gang in el salvador who have renounced their membership did not fit within that definition.
the attorney general,while retaining ultimate authority,has vested the bia with power to exercise the discretion and authority conferred upon the attorney general by law in the course of considering and determining cases before it,at quoting d.as a general rule,we review the bia denial of withholding of removal for substantial evidence.garciamilian holder,cir.citing pagayon holder,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,we may reverse the bia only on a finding that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it and also compels the further conclusion that the petitioner meets the requisite standard for obtaining relief.id.quoting ins,at.
in,the supreme court stated that the bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.at quoting ins.in,we held that we review the bia findings for substantial evidence,but that t he bia construction of ambiguous statutory terms is entitled to deference under chevron.at.in this case,whether we apply a chevron deference or substantial evidence standard of review assuming they might in some instances be different makes no difference,because the bia application of the particularity and social distinction criteria to garay withholding claims was reasonable.
the bia application of the particularity requirement to garay is reasonable in light of the absence of record evidence demonstrating that salvadoran society recognizes the boundaries of a group comprised of former mara members who have renounced their membership,regardless of the length and recency of that membership.matter of w g r,at the boundaries of a group are not sufficiently definable unless the members of society generally agree on who is included in the group,and evidence that the social group proposed by the respondent is recognized within the society is lacking in this case.
similarly,we agree that substantial evidence supports the bia conclusion that garay proposed group lacks social distinction.id.at.the record evidence does,as garay points out,include some evidence of rehabilitation programs run for the benefit of former gang members and of threats former gang members face from members of their own and other gangs.the record evidence does not,however,compel the conclusion that salvadoran society considers former gang members as a distinct social group,distinct from current gang members who may also avail themselves of government programs or from suspected gang members who face discriminatory treatment and other challenges in salvadoran society.see vitug holder,cir.we review for substantial evidence the factual findings underlying the bia determination that a petitioner is not eligible for withholding of removal.
accordingly,we reject garay challenges to the bia determination that his proposed social group of former members of the mara gang in el salvador who have renounced their membership is not cognizable 
garay also purports to challenge the bia denial of his withholding claim based on his membership in a particular social group consisting of deportees from the united states to el salvador.this assertion appears to have been an afterthought as his brief only asserts that the bia decision turned exclusively on particularity.the bia decision is entitled to deference,see supra page,and we conclude that the bia denial of withholding based on a particular social group of deportees from the united states to el salvador is reasonable.
as we have explained in section ii b,the bia imposes the particularity requirement in order to distinguish between social groups that are discrete and those that are amorphous.see supra page.in w g r,the bia explained that particularity chiefly addresses the question of delineation,or as earlier court decisions described it,the need to put outer limits on the definition of particular social group.matter of w g r,at 
although we have recognized that social visibility and particularity tend to blend together,we have not merged the two prongs,at.as noted,we held that t he particularity requirement is separate,and it is relevant in considering whether a group boundaries are so amorphous that,in practice,the persecutor does not consider it a group.id.at.we stated that the particularity consideration is merely one factor as to whether a collection of individuals is considered to be a particular social group in practice.id.
the bia application of the particularity requirement to garay purported class of deportees from the united states to el salvador was reasonable.the bia found that a proposed class of deportees was too amorphous,overbroad and diffuse because it included men,women,and children of all ages,regardless of the length of time they were in the united states,the reasons for their removal,or the recency of their removal.matter of w g r,at.garay presented scarcely any contrary evidence viewing all the evidence,the bia rejection of garay proposed class was reasonable,if not compelled.
indeed,the bia determination is supported by case law declining to recognize much more circumscribed purported groups of deportees most recently,in lynch,cir,we affirmed the bia determination that a purported class of imputed wealthy americans deported to mexico did not constitute a particular social group.citing,at,we held that the proposed group was not sufficiently particular that it can be described with passable distinction that the group would be recognized as a discrete class of persons,at.
as in,the bia rejection of garay purported class of deportees from the united states to el salvador is not contrary to our holding in that considerations of diversity of lifestyle and origin may not be the sine qua non of particularity analysis.at.to go so far would come close to doing away with the particularity requirement,which was included in the plain language of the statute enacted by congress,at.however,this was not our intent.where a petitioner makes a prima facie showing of a discrete class of persons,neither diversity of lifestyle nor origin will undermine that group.but where,as here,a petitioner proffers a group that is amorphous rather than discrete,he can hardly be heard to argue that the bia may not consider the proposed group lack of cohesion in determining that it is not particular.
applying the deference due to the bia decision and reviewing the entire record,we reject garay challenge to the bia determination that his proposed group of deportees from the united states to el salvador is not cognizable.
garay challenges the bia denial of his cat claim as based on legal error and on facts not found by the ij.the government responds that substantial evidence supports the agency decision and any error in the bia assessment of garay cat claim was invited because he asked the bia to undertake plenary review of his cat claim.we find that the denial of garay cat claim was premised on legal error and vacate the denial of cat relief.
we review de novo issues of law regarding cat claims.edu holder,cir.the bia findings underlying its determination that an applicant is not eligible for relief under the cat are reviewed for substantial evidence.arteaga,at.under that standard,we uphold the bia determination unless the evidence in the record compels a contrary conclusion.id.where the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and law rather than adopting the ij decision,our review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent that the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
