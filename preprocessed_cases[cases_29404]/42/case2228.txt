khubeb vahora,a native and citizen of india,sought asylum in the united states based on his muslim faith.the immigration judge ij denied asylum and granted voluntary departure,and the board of immigration appeals bia or board affirmed.vahora now petitions for review of the bia decision.he contends that the board erred in determining that he had not been subjected to past persecution and that he had not established a fear of future persecution.he also submits that the ij did not fulfill the regulatory obligation to advise him of avenues of relief other than asylum and that his case should have been closed administratively and joined with a case involving his parents.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we deny the petition for review.
backgrounda.
in,vahora,then thirteen years old,lived with his grandparents in the gujarat province of india while his parents were abroad.although he attended school in anand during much of this period,he was staying at his grandparents home in ahmedabad on march.that evening,vahora heard loud noises coming from outside the home and chants urging the killing of muslims.muslim homes and businesses in ahmedabad were being set on fire by a rioting hindu crowd at his grandfather instruction,vahora fled from the home through the back door.as he looked in one direction,vahora saw a muslim bakery burning.he ran from the mob that he described as carrying burning wood,and shortly came upon two hindu men holding down a muslim man while a third hindu man stabbed him.vahora recognized all of the perpetrators and the victim and could identify them by name.the hindu men saw him standing there and spoke to him.he did not respond,but instead turned and ran while the men pursued him.he eventually came upon a rickshaw,which carried him to a temporary camp for fleeing muslims.he learned later that his grandparents home was among those that had been burned.
after he had spent two days in the camp,vahora grandparents located him.the family remained there for a few more days,then relocated to anand.after several weeks,the family sent vahora to mumbai to live with an aunt and uncle,where he stayed for several months.he testified that his grandparents told him that the men involved in the attack he had witnessed inquired after him quite often,and that the family interpreted their questions as threatening.see also id.t heir real meaning was they wanted,they were looking to kill me.
after several months in mumbai,vahora father returned and took vahora with him to south africa,where he had been living.after several months in south africa,the family decided to travel to the united states.they returned to mumbai and obtained visas.vahora testified that,while in mumbai,about a week before he left for the united states,he saw some men standing outside a store where he was headed to buy milk.he hid in another store until they left,and,when he then entered the first store,the shopkeeper told him that the men had been asking about him.vahora and his family left mumbai for the united states in september.
in the united states,vahora father apparently attempted to obtain a change of status to an visa,and vahora started attending school.in,when he was,vahora was a passenger in a car driven by a friend who was speeding.the vehicle was stopped and,through a course of events not disclosed by the record,vahora lack of legal status in the united states was discovered by law enforcement.the department of homeland security thereafter initiated removal proceedings against him.
because vahora makes several claims in his petition for review that relate to the procedural history of his case before the ij,we discuss that history in some detail.
on january,at vahora first substantive hearing,the ij noted that vahora was a minor with parents present in the united states,but was in removal proceedings alone.he inquired of counsel for vahora and for the government whether vahora parents had lawful status in the united states or were the subject of separate removal proceedings.vahora attorney indicated that,with the assistance of another attorney,the parents had submitted a request for change of status to an l visa.according to vahora attorney,the parents initial application had been denied,but there was either an appeal or a motion to reopen pending,and no removal proceedings were currently pending against vahora parents.in response,the ij asked the government attorney whether proceedings could be initiated against the joined with vahora or whether vahora proceedings could be administratively closed until such time as a final decision on the parents application had been reached.the ij noted that he hoped to find a solution that did not put him in the position of having to order someone back to india when his parents are still here and their status is unadjudicated.counsel for the government agreed to a continuance to permit an investigation of the status of the parents pending cases,but voiced the belief that it would be premature to close administratively vahora case.government counsel further noted that,although he could not direct that proceedings be initiated against the parents,he would inquire of immigration and customs enforcement whether they intended to do so.the ij continued the hearing,and vahora was directed to file his asylum application at his next court date.
on april,vahora appeared for his continued hearing.at this hearing,he was represented by another attorney from the same law firm that had represented him at his initial appearance.when the ij inquired about the asylum application due at the hearing,vahora attorney indicated that she was newly assigned to his case within the firm and had not prepared an application.according to new counsel,vahora previous representative had left the firm.she repeatedly stated vahora desire to make an application for asylum or withholding of removal,and she repeatedly sought a continuance.when the ij told the attorney that he would not further continue the hearing and would only consider applications for relief that were ready to proceed,as previously ordered,vahora attorney requested that the ij terminate proceedings on the basis of the parents pending l nonimmigrant visa application.counsel for the government did not agree to termination,stating that it was her understanding that the government is placing the subject father in removal proceedings.vahora attorney then presented a copy of an case status update page showing the application for his father,but the ij nevertheless concluded that p endency of the application for another alien did not provide for the status of vahora,and,therefore,there was no basis for termination.with no other applications for relief pending,the ij granted vahora voluntary departure.
represented by new counsel,vahora appealed to the board,seeking an opportunity to file an asylum application before the ij.the board agreed with vahora that prior counsel had provided ineffective assistance by failing to comply with the asylum application deadline and remanded for further proceedings.
on remand to the ij,vahora presented his application for asylum.in these proceedings,his counsel did not seek,or even mention,the possibility of termination or administrative closure.indeed,at his final merits hearing,the government noted that vahora parents were now in removal proceedings before another ij,apparently with an asylum claim arising out of the same set of facts.the government proposed joining vahora case with his father,but the ij declined,noting the independent procedural histories of the cases.although the ruling already had been made,vahora own counsel then added,w e would have objected to any joining of the cases.the father was not present at the time vahora experienced his persecution.
vahora testified to the facts underlying his claim,which we already have set forth.when questioned about events subsequent to the riots,vahora testified that,even after his departure and up to the time of his immigration hearing,his grandparents were approached by the men involved in the stabbing and their associates to inquire about him.he also stated that he could be located anywhere in india by members of the same political party as the hindu men whose crime he had witnessed and that they will just go to any,any length to protect their associates.vahora noted that he had been found once in mumbai,despite its size,and that he could not be safe from party members in any indian city.he testified that while in india,he was full of fear and remain ed inside the house and did even go out.
at the close of the hearing,the ij denied relief.the ij first concluded that,although his application was submitted beyond the deadline,vahora youth and the ineffective assistance he received from former counsel constituted extraordinary circumstances sufficient to excuse his failure to comply with the deadline.see a b d.turning to the merits of the claim,the ij accepted as credible vahora testimony about the riots and his flight from his grandparents home.although he noted that vahora contentions that muslims were placed in fear of their lives during the rioting were well supported by the historical record,the ij concluded that the events in vahora particular case did not rise to the level of past persecution,relying in part on an unpublished decision of this court the ij also concluded that vahora had not established that he faced fear of future persecution on a countrywide basis.accordingly,the ij denied all relief but voluntary departure.
vahora appealed to the bia.he principally contended that the ij erred in his adjudication of the asylum claim.he further contended that the ij had failed to advise him of other available avenues for relief from removal as required by a and that his proceedings should have been closed administratively or terminated because he was a minor in parental custody 
the board affirmed the denial of relief in a separate opinion.the board specifically agreed with the ij conclusion that vahora had demonstrated neither past persecution nor a fear of future persecution.the board noted that,a lthough the indian muslim respondent was caught up in a riot by hindus in march,and was threatened with harm after witnessing a stabbing,this incident does not compare to cases where the seventh circuit has clearly found past persecution.further,the board concluded that vahora had failed to demonstrate that there was no reasonable possibility of safe relocation elsewhere in india.finding no merit in vahora procedural challenges,the board dismissed the appeal and extended the period of voluntary departure.vahora now petitions for review.
discussion 
vahora raises both procedural and substantive challenges to the board order.first,he claims that the board erred in its resolution of his asylum claim when it concluded that he had established neither past persecution nor a fear of future persecution.next,he claims that the ij erred in failing to close administratively his case at the outset,because he believes that,as a minor child in parental custody in the united states,his case should have been treated together with that of his parents.finally,he claims that the ij failed to properly advise him of the potential availability of adjustment of status through his father visa and that the failure to do so requires reversal and remand.we address these contentions in turn.
we note,as an initial matter,that the board issued its own decision dismissing vahora appeal.although both parties suggest that the decision of the ij and the bia should be viewed together,our precedent does not support this position.we consistently have reaffirmed that a opinion of the board is our sole basis for review,even if the board opinion agrees with specific conclusions of the ij.see,moab gonzales,cir.our standard of review for legal questions is de novo h owever,we defer to the board factual findings,reversing the board only if the record lacks substantial evidence to support its factual conclusions.mekhtiev holder,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,the agency determination will stand if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.raghunathan holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also ins,
we first consider vahora asylum claim.vahora contends that the board erred in concluding that he had not been subjected to past persecution.vahora claim of past persecution centers on the events of the gujarat riots.the board concluded that vahora own experience in this period,in which he witnessed a stabbing and was threatened with harm thereafter as a witness,did not compare to cases where the seventh circuit has clearly found past persecution.in support of its conclusion that this harm did not rise to the level of persecution,the board relied on cases involving egregious forms of persecution,including particularly severe beatings,torture and psychological torment we never have indicated,however,that these types of incidents set a floor for conduct that meets the legal definition of persecution,and we do not do so here.
we have no intention to minimize a child witnessing of a stabbing and other acts of violence committed against members of his own minority religious group.nevertheless,under our precedent,the board conclusion that the harms vahora personally suffered do not rise to the level of persecution is supported by substantial evidence.vahora has not presented us with any factually analogous cases in which the petitioners were found to have suffered past persecution.moreover,in circumstances similar to vahora,we have rejected such a claim.see,ingmantoro mukasey,cir rejecting claim by an ethnic chinese christian living in indonesia as not demonstrating past persecution where petitioner father store was burned by native indonesian muslim men looking for the petitioner,resulting in only bruises obtained while she ran from the scene see also bhatt reno,cir denying petition of indian citizen after noting that he was beaten several times,had protestors in front of his store and received threats from individuals belonging to radical hindu groups in retaliation for assistance he had provided to muslims.
the board conclusions regarding vahora fear of future persecution also are supported by substantial evidence.the board ruled that vahora had not established that he faced a reasonable possibility of persecution on a basis,as required by the regulations.see b ii.before this court,vahora presses his contention that,because,in his view,he had established past persecution,he need not demonstrate that he had a fear of future persecution on a basis.although we agree with this statement of the law it does not aid vahora because we already have concluded that the board determination that he had not suffered past persecution is supported by substantial evidence.
vahora makes no significant effort to argue that,if the regulatory requirement applies in his case,relocation is unreasonable.at his hearing before the ij,he testified that the hindu men responsible for the stabbing and their political associates have inquired about his from his grandparents in gujarat and that,on one occasion,men asked a shopkeeper near his uncle home in mumbai about him.he also notes that his immediate family is still in the united states,that he is only years old and that he has lived outside india for the last eight years.we can not say that these circumstances,without more,demonstrate that he can not relocate safely and reasonably in india.the board determination that he has not shown a fear of future persecution is,therefore,supported by substantial evidence and can not be disturbed.
vahora also challenges the ij refusal to close administratively his case so that it could be joined with his parents case.the government,relying on mukasey,cir,responds that we lack jurisdiction to consider this question.
we address the jurisdictional issue first.as both the first and third circuits have noted,a dministrative closure is a procedural convenience that may be granted if both parties to the removal proceedings agree,but it does not constitute a final order.rather,administrative closure of a case temporarily removes a case from an immigration judge calendar or from the board docket.attorney,cir alteration in original emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted citing gonzales,cir.once a case has been closed administratively,either party can move to have the case recalendered once circumstances indicat e that the case is ready for a hearing.matter of hashmi,bia.as the sixth circuit has noted,this temporary removal of the case from the docket is similar to a court granting of a continuance,albeit an indefinite one.gonzales,cir calling the two processes not distinguishable in the jurisdictional inquiry.
following the supreme court decision in kucana holder,it is clear that an immigration court denial of an alien request for a continuance is reviewable.the court reached that conclusion by evaluating the jurisdictional bar found in a b ii,which prohibits courts from reviewing any decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than a decision on asylum.the court specifically rejected the view that those decisions committed to agency discretion by regulation,rather than by statute,fall within the ambit of the jurisdictional bar.kucana.at.
the government submits that the central holding of kucana does not answer the jurisdictional question here.the government notes that the court specifically reserved judgment on whether a separate statutory provision,found in the administrative procedures act apa,prevents review of certain discretionary decisions of the agency not otherwise barred by the ina own proscription.see kucana.at a.the apa,which governs most aspects of review of agency action in the courts has no application,according to its provisions,where agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a.the government urges us to adopt the view that administrative closure falls within this exception to judicial review,as two other courts of appeals have done.see ochoa holder,cir,at.
to evaluate the government submission,we turn to the precedents interpreting a.in heckler chaney,inmates sentenced to death challenged a decision by the food and drug administration not to enforce a statute it administered in the context of lethal injections.the court held that the relevant section of the apa,a,prevented review if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.id.at.the court noted at some length the historical tradition of considering such enforcement decisions to be wholly discretionary and concluded that the apa did not upset that tradition.accordingly,the court held that it could not review the fda inaction under the abuse of discretion standard provided by the apa.
notably,the court in heckler stated that its recognition of agency discretion over enforcement was attributable in no small part to the general unsuitability for judicial review of agency decisions to refuse enforcement.id.at.since heckler,the questions to which the supreme court has applied this rule have been of a similar character.in lincoln vigil,the court held that agency allocation of funds in a appropriation was unreviewable.id.at after all,the very point of a appropriation is to give an agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.the court otherwise has limited the exception to judicial review provided by a to cases involving national security,such as webster doe,and department of navy egan,or those seeking review of refusal to pursue enforcement actions.franklin massachusetts,stevens,concurring citations omitted.outside of these distinct,areas in which the courts have long been hesitant to intrude,id.at,the court has found no basis for review only when it has concluded that there is effectively no law to apply to the question,id.quoting citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,u,abrogated in part on other grounds by califano sanders,in evaluating whether there is no law to apply,the court has focused on whether a given decision can be evaluated under a judicially administrable standard of review.franklin,at stevens,concurring.
in,the ninth circuit applied heckler holding to the question of administrative closure in the immigration context,the issue we confront here.that court concluded that the decision to grant or deny administrative closure is one committed to agency discretion by law,a,and,therefore,unreviewable in arriving at this conclusion,the ninth circuit first noted that administrative closure is a procedural device mentioned neither in the immigration and nationality act nor in the accompanying regulations,and that bia precedent states only that administrative closure is 
an administrative convenience,and a case may not be administratively closed if opposed by either of the parties.this language does not provide any guidance to the bia regarding when it should exercise its discretion to grant administrative closure.indeed,it gives even less guidance than the bia statement that it could reopen proceedings sua sponte in exceptional situations,which we found insufficient to allow review in ekimian ins,cir.accordingly,we must conclude that b ecause we can not discover a sufficiently meaningful standard for evaluating the bia decision not to close a case,we lack jurisdiction to review the claim that the bia abused its discretion in not doing so.id.at.
at citation omitted.the eighth circuit has agreed generally with the analysis,hernandez holder,cir,although,it has clarified that the rule is not classified properly as jurisdictional.ochoa,at when a plaintiff complains about an action that is committed to agency discretion by law,it does not mean that a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claim.instead,it means that there is no law to apply because the court has no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency unfettered exercise of discretion.other circuits,without explicit consideration of the potential problems posed by the apa,have reviewed the agency administrative closure determination under the abuse of discretion standard.holder,cir,at.
we agree with the eighth circuit conclusion that this issue is not termed properly one of jurisdiction this is not a question of whether this court has the authority to review,but rather whether the lack of any judicially manageable standard,heckler,at,makes any review within our power,as a practical matter,impossible.
however,when we evaluate a as applied to administrative closure,in light of supreme court precedent from heckler forward,we respectfully disagree with the eighth and ninth circuits.as the ninth circuit has noted,administrative closure is not a practice specified in the statute,nor is it mentioned in the current regulations.it is a procedural device,not unlike the myriad other procedural devices employed by bodies in administrative agencies and in the executive office for immigration review in particular.like all of these devices,closure is one tool that assists the person performing duties in the orderly management of the docket and the courtroom we routinely have reviewed procedural rulings in immigration and other administrative adjudications to determine whether an individual has received a full and fair hearing before an agency in our appellate review of cases arising in the district courts,we often evaluate the same kinds of procedural rulings we certainly have reviewed an ij refusal to grant a continuance,the procedural device most closely akin to the administrative closure sought to be reviewed here.see juarez holder,cir accord,at holding,as a matter of sixth circuit law,that the reviewability of continuances was dispositive for the reviewability of administrative closure decisions,at citing with approval.
simply put,the decision to grant or deny administrative closure is cut of the same cloth as various other decisions that we review with regularity in both administrative and arenas.the decision to continue a matter without a specific date for its restoration to a trial docket simply is not the sort of decision that involves a complicated balan
