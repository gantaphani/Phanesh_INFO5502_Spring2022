factual and procedural history 
background on raya vaca 
raya vaca,a year old native and citizen of mexico,first came to the united states at approximately the age of six.his mother brought him and his siblings to join his father,who at the time was living and working in salinas,california.while his parents worked in agriculture,raya vaca attended school and,after turning eighteen,held various jobs.at age,he began a relationship with trisha,a united states citizen.the two lived together for seven years before raya vaca removal,and they have two children who are united states citizens.raya vaca brother is also a united states citizen.
while in california,raya vaca was convicted of three misdemeanors.in,he was convicted of misdemeanor burglary in violation of california penal code section and sentenced to ten days in jail and three years of probation.in,he was convicted of obstruction of a police officer in violation of california penal code section a and false identification to a police officer in violation of california penal code section a,for which he served three days in jail and three years of probation.
raya vaca has also had prior contact with immigration authorities.immigration officials sent him to mexico in,after which he sought to reenter the united states in march,may,june,september,november,and september.on three of those occasions,some of the individuals traveling with raya vaca identified him as a smuggler.with the exception of his attempted reentry in september,raya vaca returned voluntarily to therefore suffered no formal immigration consequences,such as a removal each attempted entry.after attempting to reenter on september,however,raya vaca stipulated to removal and waived his right to a hearing an immigration judge ij then considered raya vaca written representations of waiver sufficient to find him removable and issued an order of removal on september.
ii.raya vaca july reentry and removal order 
on july,raya vaca entered the united states by walking through the mountains,with the intention of returning to salinas to join his family.he was apprehended the following day near the state route border patrol checkpoint outside potrero,california.immigration officials initiated expedited removal proceedings pursuant to.
expedited removal proceedings under 
an expedited removal proceeding under allows immigration officers to determine whether certain aliens are inadmissible,and enter removal orders,generally without hearing or further review.
two classes of individuals are subject to expedited removal proceedings.originally,only aliens arriving in the united states were subject to the proceedings.however,the department of homeland security dhs has expanded the reach of expedited removal proceedings to aliens who have entered the united states,as long as they are physically present in the without having been admitted or paroled,are discovered within air miles of the united states border,and can not establish that they have been physically present in the for the fourteen days prior to the encounter with immigration authorities.designating aliens for expedited removal.all such aliens are deemed applicants for admission into the united states,regardless of whether they seek to enter at a port of entry or have already entered the country.a.
during an expedited removal proceeding,an immigration officer must conduct an inspection and determine whether the alien is inadmissible because the alien has made a material misrepresentation to gain admission into the united states,has falsely represent ed himself to be a united states citizen,or does not possess a valid entry document.see a,b a i see also id.a c i,a c ii i,a a i.when making a finding of inadmissibility,the examining immigration officer must create a record of the facts of the case and statements made by the alien.b i.the officer shall have the alien read or have read to him or her the statement.id.moreover,the officer shall advise the alien of the charges against him or her on form i,notice and order of expedited removal,and the alien shall be given an opportunity to respond to those charges in the sworn statement.id.then,if the officer determines the alien to be inadmissible,the officer shall order the alien removed from the united states without further hearing or review unless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution.b a i.
unless an alien professes a fear of persecution or claims to be a lawful permanent resident lpr,an expedited removal order is not subject to administrative appeal.id.b c.however,the attorney general has the discretion to provide a type of statutory relief to certain aliens withdrawal of application for admission.see id.a.when an individual is permitted to withdraw his application for admission,he may leave voluntarily and without a removal order,and thus without facing formal immigration consequences see.
raya vaca expedited removal proceedings 
raya vaca faced expedited removal proceedings because he was present in the united states without admission,had been discovered within miles of the border,and could not establish that he had been present in the united states for the prior fourteen days.see designating aliens for expedited removal.at.
during raya vaca expedited removal proceedings,border patrol agent alberto baca interviewed raya vaca in english and prepared a record of sworn statement.raya vaca then signed an acknowledgment that he had read the record of sworn statement the jurat.agent baca found raya vaca inadmissible and subject to removal because he had illegally entered the united states without inspection and was not in possession of any valid documentation permitting him to enter.agent baca ordered that raya vaca be removed from the united states.
iii.proceedings before the district court 
on november,a border patrol agent arrested raya vaca and several other individuals about seven miles north of the united states mexico border,near tecate,california.when raya vaca admitted that he was a mexican citizen with no valid entry documents,the agent arrested raya vaca and transported him to a border patrol station.
on december,the government charged raya vaca by information with one count of illegal reentry after having been removed from the united states,in violation of a.
raya vaca moved to dismiss the information under d,asserting that no valid removal order existed upon which the information could be predicated.raya vaca contended that neither the stipulated removal order nor the expedited removal order could serve as a valid predicate for the prosecution under.the government disclaimed any intent to rely on the stipulated removal order as a predicate element for the charge.instead,the government contended that raya vaca had no plausible relief from his removal order and thus that he suffered no prejudice attributable to any due process violation at his expedited removal proceeding.see united states barajas alvarado,cir stating that to show prejudice,an alien must show that he had plausible grounds for relief.therefore,according to the government,raya vaca challenge under d to his removal order could not succeed.
the district court denied raya vaca motion to dismiss the information.given the government failure to argue that no due process violation occurred,the district court assumed that raya vaca due process rights were violated in the course of his expedited removal proceedings and looked to whether an immigration official would plausibly have exercised his discretion to grant raya vaca relief in the form of withdrawal of his application for admission.after weighing the factors outlined in the immigration and naturalization service ins inspector field manual,which discusses when an official should permit an alien to withdraw his application for admission,the district court deemed it implausible that raya vaca would have been granted such relief and thus concluded he could not show prejudice 
raya vaca entered a conditional guilty plea,preserving his right to appeal the district court denial of his d motion.the district court sentenced him to time served days in prison and one year of supervised release.the district court entered judgment on march,and raya vaca filed a timely notice of appeal.
standard of review 
we review a denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment de novo when the motion is based upon alleged due process defect s in the underlying deportation proceeding.united states camacho lopez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we review for clear error the district court findings of fact.id.
discussion 
for a defendant to be convicted of illegal reentry under,the government must establish that the defendant left the united states under order of exclusion,deportation,or removal,and then illegally reentered.united states barajas alvarado,cir.
a defendant charged under has a due process right to collaterally attack his removal order because the removal order serves as a predicate element of his conviction.united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.to sustain a challenge to an indictment or information under,a defendant must demonstrate that he exhausted the administrative remedies available for seeking relief from the predicate removal order the deportation proceedings improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review and the removal order was fundamentally unfair.d.to satisfy the third prong that the order was fundamentally unfair the defendant bears the burden of establishing both that the deportation proceeding violate d his due process rights and that the violation caused prejudice.united states leon leon,cir.
administrative exhaustion and deprivation of judicial review 
as the district court recognized and as the government concedes,the statute governing expedited removal proceedings afforded raya vaca no opportunity for administrative or judicial review.see,b c except as provided in the subparagraph on interviews,a removal order is not subject to administrative appeal id.b a i if an immigration officer determines that an alien who is arriving in the united states is inadmissible,the officer shall order the alien removed from the united states without further hearing or review emphasis added see also barajas alvarado,at t he immigration nationality act ina precludes meaningful judicial review of the validity of the proceedings that result in an expedited removal order.we therefore conclude that raya vaca exhausted all available administrative remedies and was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review.
ii.due process violation 
raya vaca must next establish that the removal order was fundamentally unfair meaning,in part,that the expedited removal proceedings as conducted failed to comply with the requirements of due process.see d leon leon,at.to this end,he asserts that he suffered three distinct due process violations during his expedited removal proceedings the immigration officer failure to inform raya vaca in violation of dhs regulations of the charge of inadmissibility he faced and to read to him or allow him to read his sworn statement the officer failure to advise raya vaca of the possibility of withdrawing his application for admission and the officer failure to afford raya vaca the opportunity to consult with counsel.
applicability of the due process clause 
we first confront the threshold question whether the due process clause,with its attendant protections,applied to raya vaca at the time of his expedited removal proceedings.
the supreme court has categorically declared that once an individual has entered the united states,he is entitled to the protection of the due process clause in zadvydas davis,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of indefinitely detaining aliens who were once admitted to the united states but later ordered removed,d.in holding unconstitutional the indefinite detention of an alien present within the united states,the court distinguished the situation at hand from one involving an alien seeking entry into the country 
the distinction between an alien who has effected an entry into the united states and one who has never entered runs throughout immigration law o nce an alien enters the country,his legal circumstance changes,for the due process clause applies to all persons within the united states,including aliens,whether their presence here is lawful,unlawful,temporary,or permanent.
id.at citations omitted.similarly,when considering whether certain conditions could be placed on an alien eligibility for federal medical insurance,the supreme court stated,
there are literally millions of aliens within the jurisdiction of the united states.the fifth amendment,as well as the fourteenth amendment,protects every one of these persons from deprivation of life,liberty,or property without due process of law.even one whose presence in this country is unlawful,involuntary,or transitory is entitled to that constitutional protection.
mathews diaz,d citation omitted see also,shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei.it is true that aliens who have once passed through our gates,even illegally,may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to due process of law.this long line of precedent admits of no exception an alien who has entered the united states is guaranteed due process protections 
here,there is no dispute that raya vaca had entered the united states in july before he was apprehended near the state route border patrol checkpoint,outside potrero,california,within the borders of the united states.even an alien who has run some fifty yards into the united states has entered the country.see united states martin plascencia,cir affirming adjudication of illegal entry for alien who had avoided inspection at the border and had run into the country before being apprehended see also matter of z,bia finding that alien had entered country when he disembarked from his vessel onto dry land within the territorial boundaries of the united states at an area not designated as a port of entry,after which he fled for some distance into the interior.
heeding,as we must,the supreme court repeated pronouncement that the due process clause applies to all who have entered the united states legally or not and given the clear fact of raya vaca entry,we hold that raya vaca was entitled to expedited removal proceedings that conformed to the dictates of due process 
due process right to notice and opportunity to respond 
our conclusion that the due process clause applied to raya vaca,however,does not end the inquiry.raya vaca contends that the immigration officer conducting the expedited removal proceedings failed to advise raya vaca of the charge against him and to read to him or permit him to read the sworn statement the officer prepared,in violation of dhs regulations and raya vaca due process rights.we must determine whether raya vaca indeed had such due process rights and,if so,whether they were violated during the expedited removal proceedings.
the regulations governing expedited removal proceedings codify,in mandatory terms,the immigration officer duty to inform the alien of the charge against him and to allow the alien to review the sworn statement prepared in his name.see b i the examining immigration officer shall advise the alien of the charges against him or her,and the alien shall be given an opportunity to respond to those charges in the sworn statement.see also id.requiring the examining officer to take the alien sworn statement and to have the alien read or have read to him or her the statement 
although not every violation of a regulation rises to the level of a due process violation,see,united states caceres,d,certain regulations may in fact be mandated by the constitution or federal law,id.at see also bridges wixon.observing that particular rules and regulations for investigations preceding deportation hearings were designed to afford aliens due process of law.that is,some regulations protect due process and other constitutional rights.this is the case here.due process always requires,at a minimum,notice and an opportunity to respond.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d identifying notice and an opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case as the essential principle s of due process.the regulations instructing the immigration officer to advise an alien of the charge against him and to permit the alien to read or be read the sworn statement prepared in his name protect those fundamental due process rights notice of the charge the alien faces and the alien opportunity to respond to that charge accordingly,because raya vaca was protected by the due process clause when he faced removal,we conclude that any failure to inform raya vaca of the charge against him and to provide him the opportunity to review the sworn statement constituted a violation of raya vaca due process rights.see yamataya fisher.concluding that alien who had entered the country,allegedly illegally,several days prior to apprehension had to receive all opportunity to be heard upon the questions involving her right to be and remain in the united states to comport with due process united states brignoni ponce,d declining to recognize an exception to the fourth amendment requirement of articulable reasonable suspicion for stops near the border,even though such an exception would facilitate immigration enforcement.
we further conclude that raya vaca due process rights to notice and an opportunity to respond were indeed violated during his expedited removal proceedings.raya vaca asserted in a signed declaration that no immigration officer explained to him either the nature of the removal proceedings or that he could be ordered removed from the united states.raya vaca further asserted that the immigration officer neither read to him nor permitted him to review the information in the sworn statement.while raya vaca initialed the record of sworn statement and signed the jurat,he did not,according to his declaration,understand what he was signing.further,raya vaca acknowledged on the jurat that he had read or had read to him this statement,consisting of pages including this page.however,the record of sworn statement and jurat together totaled four pages,and the jurat the sole page raya vaca acknowledged having only four questions he was asked and answered,none of which spoke to his admissibility.beyond suggesting that the number of pages listed on the jurat was perhaps a typographical error,the government does not argue that the immigration officer did indeed comply with the regulation at issue by advising raya vaca of the charge against him and reading to him,or allowing him to read,the sworn statement.united states ramos,cir immigration officer who conducted stipulated removal proceedings testified about the processes she followed.taking into consideration raya vaca declaration,the error on the jurat,and the government failure to contest raya vaca allegations,we hold that the immigration officer failed to advise raya vaca of the charge against him and to permit him to review the sworn statement,in contravention of raya vaca due process rights.
in so holding,we reject the government argument that in order to show the due process violation itself the first prong of a showing of fundamental unfairness must establish that he was prejudiced by the failure to comply with the regulation.as noted earlier,there are,for present purposes,two types of regulations those that protect fundamental due process rights,and and those that do not.united states caceres,d.the second type of regulation only implicates due process concerns when the failure to comply with the regulation causes prejudice.see id.at united states calderon medina,cir see also montes lopez holder,cir explaining that the prejudice requirement in calderon medina applies to the violation of a relatively minor procedural rule,not serious regulatory violations.a violation of the first type of regulation,however,implicates due process concerns even without a prejudice inquiry.see united states reyes bonilla,cir holding,without considering prejudice apart from the plausibility of relief,that violation of regulation providing for right to counsel constituted denial of due process see also united states vidal mendoza,cir holding,without prejudice inquiry,that immigration judge failure to inform alien of eligibility for relief,as required by regulation,violated due process.
because the regulatory violation here constituted a denial of raya vaca right to notice and an opportunity to respond,no showing of prejudice is necessary to establish a due process violation.we further reject the government argument that it should have been obvious to raya vaca that he was being scrutinized for his presence in the united states without valid documentation.even if express notice of the charge of inadmissibility were not necessary,we do not see how he could have known the specific charge against him without being told of it,and raya vaca averred he was unaware that he was facing a formal removal order based on his lack of documentation.
accordingly,we conclude that raya vaca has established a due process violation and thus satisfied the first requirement for showing that his removal order was fundamentally unfair.we now turn to the final remaining issue prejudice 
iii.prejudice 
to succeed in demonstrating that the expedited removal order was fundamentally unfair,raya vaca must also establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of the entry of the order.see united states jimenez marmolejo,cir d.to do so,raya vaca must show that he had plausible grounds for relief from the removal order jimenez marmolejo,at.
even though raya vaca did not formally apply for admission to the united states,he is considered to have been an applicant for admission and as such was eligible for withdrawal of application for admission.see a.as mentioned earlier,an individual granted leave to withdraw his application for admission may exit the united states voluntarily and without a removal order.see.raya vaca contends that he had plausible grounds for relief from removal in the form of withdrawal of his application for admission.
analytical framework for plausibility of relief 
to assess whether a defendant has shown that he would plausibly have been granted a discretionary form of relief from removal,we follow a process.see united states rojas pedroza,cir.first,we identify the factors relevant to the agency exercise of discretion for the relief being sought.id.second,we determine whether,in light of the factors relevant to the form of relief being sought,and based on the unique circumstances of the defendant own case,it was plausible that the agency official considering the defendant case would have granted relief from removal.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
this court leading case discussing the plausibility of relief in the form of withdrawal of application for admission is united states barajas alvarado,cir.in barajas alvarado,we looked for guidance to the inspector field manual,an internal agency document that counsels immigration officers as to when to grant withdrawal of application for admission.see id.at.as noted in barajas alvarado,the inspector field manual,while not entitled to the force of law,provides helpful insight as to when relief is plausible and as to whether relief was plausible for raya vaca in.see id.at.
the inspector field manual provides for a highly individualized determination and instructs officers to consider all facts and circumstances related to the case to determine whether permittin
