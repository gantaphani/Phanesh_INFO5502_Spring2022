background 
is a native and citizen of colombia.he entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident on october,at the age of.entire immediate family resides in the united states.on april,he pleaded guilty to criminal sexual assault by a family member,in violation of illinois law.he was sentenced to periodic imprisonment for twelve months and supervised probation for months,and he served eight months of his imprisonment in a program.at.
in,the immigration authorities commenced deportation proceedings against based on his criminal sexual assault conviction,charging him with having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of entry,for which he was sentenced to imprisonment or actually confined for one year or more.see a a i renumbered in.moved to terminate the proceedings.he argued that his crime was not one of moral turpitude and that he had not been sentenced to confinement or actually confined for one year or more.
during the course of those deportation proceedings,the ij determined that the crime was one of moral turpitude,but that had not been sentenced to imprisonment or confined for more than a year.consequently,the ij terminated the deportation proceedings.the ins filed an appeal,which it subsequently withdrew.accordingly,the ij order of june,dismissing the deportation proceedings became a final administrative order.see.
on june,reported to the police station to register as a sexual offender,as he was required to do every year.the police determined that he had missed a prior reporting date because he had moved in the interim and therefore arrested him.on june,the dhs served him with a notice to appear in removal proceedings to answer the charge that,under a a iii,he was subject to removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as defined by a a.the predicate felony was conviction,the same conviction that had served as the basis for his deportation proceedings.
through counsel,contended that res judicata barred the dhs from initiating proceedings a second time using the same conviction.the ij agreed.the dhs appealed,and the bia sustained the appeal,vacated the ij decision and remanded the case for further proceedings.the board explained that,although both immigration proceedings were based on the same conviction,the law governing immigration consequences of criminal convictions ha d changed significantly since the prior proceedings.at.the board noted that the definition of aggravated felony had been expanded to include sexual abuse of a minor.in view of this change in law,the board continued,we find that the doctrine of res judicata does not preclude the service from relying on the conviction to pursue the respondent deportation.id.
on remand to the ij,indicated an intention to seek waiver of his removal under ina c,c repealed the proceedings were continued twice,and,in the interim,the bia issued its ruling in in re blake,bia.in that decision,the bia held that an alien deportable because of a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor is not eligible for a section c waiver because there is no statutory counterpart of that ground of deportability in the enumerated grounds of inadmissibility in section a of the ina.when removal proceedings recommenced,the ij held that,based on blake,was ineligible for a section c waiver.
timely appealed to the bia.the bia determined that illinois conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony for sexual abuse of a minor,which rendered him ineligible for a section c waiver.the board accordingly dismissed the appeal.
timely petitioned for review of the bia decision.
discussion 
challenges the bia decision on several grounds.first,he contends that the doctrine of res judicata bars the immigration authorities from instituting removal proceedings based on the same criminal conviction that had formed the basis of their prior,unsuccessful deportation effort.second,he submits that the removal proceedings instituted in this case violate the transitional rules governing the implementation of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.third,claims that the instant removal proceedings violate established immigration procedures because the dhs could have filed a motion to reopen his original deportation proceedings rather than commencing removal proceedings in.fourth,contends that the dhs violated his substantive due process rights by instituting these proceedings 
we first turn to contention that the board committed legal error in determining that the doctrine of res judicata did not prevent the dhs from charging him as being removable based on the same criminal conviction for which he previously was found not to be deportable.
the applicability of res judicata hinges on three elements an identity of the parties or their privies identity of the cause of action and a final judgment on the merits.prochotsky baker mckenzie,cir.the second of the cause of determined by using the operative facts or same transaction test.in re matter of energy,cir.under this formulation,a cause of action consists of a core of operative facts which give rise to a remedy.id.relatedly,res judicata also prevents a party from splitting a single cause of action or using several theories of recovery as the basis for separate suits.shaver woolworth,cir see also prochotsky,at noting that this prevents vexatious litigation.the doctrine of res judicata minimizes the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits,conserves judicial resources,and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.montana united states,d.
as a general matter,res judicata applies to administrative hearings if the administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it where the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate.united states utah constr.mining,d see also astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,d.also,and more specifically,res judicata applies to the adjudication of petitions for relief in immigration courts.hamdan gonzales,cir see also medina ins,cir matter of,bia.notably,however,we have applied res judicata much more flexibly in the administrative context.int l harvester osha,cir this court does not adhere to a rigid view of the doctrine in the administrative context.see also collins pond creek mining,cir r es judicata of administrative decisions is not encrusted with rigid finality that characterizes the precept in judicial proceedings.gonzales,cir sharp kabushiki kaisha thinksharp,facchiano dep t of labor,cir.
in united states fisher,cir,for example,the environmental protection agency epa had entered into a consent decree with respect to a large tract of land in northern indiana used for the reclamation of solvents.several years later,and after congress had amended the relevant environmental statute to create new avenues of action,the epa brought a new suit rather than seeking to modify the consent decree.we explained that,under res judicata,consent decrees normally prevent a new lawsuit arising from the same dispute that underlay the litigation in which the decree was entered.id.at.under the circumstances of the case,however,and given the statutory change in the interim,we held that the epa was justified in commencing a new action 
the superfund amendments under which the present suit was filed were enacted four years after the consent decree was signed.the amendments direct the epa in no uncertain terms to take peremptory steps to protect the public health.the epa has no authority to refuse to enforce the statute just because its staff made commitments before congress spoke.
as fisher suggests,in determining whether the doctrine of res judicata should be applied with less rigidity than usual,courts have placed great weight on the identity of the institution of government responsible for the change in law.notably,although changes in case law almost never provide a justification for instituting a new action arising from the same dispute that already has been litigated to a final judgment,statutory changes that occur after the previous litigation has concluded may justify a new action.federated dep t stores,moitie,d fisher,at james moore et,moore federal practice,ed noting that p assage of a new statute will not per se create grounds for a new claim,but,when a new statute provides an independent basis for relief which did not exist at the time of the prior action,a second action based on the new statute may be justified.compare moitie,at.holding that considerations of fairness and equity do not vitiate the res judicata effect of a previous,unappealed judgment,even if that judgment rest s on a legal principle subsequently overruled in another case,with astoria fed.sav.loan ass n,at.noting that congress may abrogate res judicata implicitly in the administrative context if the doctrine application would contravene a statutory purpose.
additionally,the rule against claim splitting,which is one component of res judicata,is inapplicable when a statutory change creates a course of action unavailable in the previous action.car carriers,ford motor,cir p rior litigation acts as a bar not only to those issues which were raised and decided in the earlier litigation but also to those issues which could have been raised in that litigation.emphasis in original see also wedow city of kansas city,cir noting that the rule against claim splitting does not apply to claims that did not exist when the first suit was filed.indeed,courts consistently have refused to apply res judicata to preclude a second suit that is based on a claim that could not have been asserted in the first suit.see.sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir of course,res judicata will not attach if the claim asserted in the second suit could not have been asserted in the first.
in the present case,when the immigration authorities first sought to deport based on his illinois conviction for sexual assault,they had to rely on the ground that he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of entry,at noting that was charged as deportable under a a i at the time that this earlier deportation proceeding was instituted,conviction for sexual assault did not qualify as an aggravated felony,see a.in,however,congress amended the statutory definition of aggravated felony,another ground for removal,to include sexual abuse of a minor,and it specifically applied that new definition retroactively regardless of how long ago the conviction was entered.iirira,a b,stat.at codified at a a ins,cir holding that congress has clearly manifested an intent to apply the amended definition of aggravated felony retroactively.after the passage of iirira,therefore,illinois conviction for sexual assault did qualify as an aggravated felony.consequently,congress provided the immigration authorities with a new ground upon which to institute removal ground that had not been available when the immigration authorities had first sought to deport.
under these circumstances,the two immigration proceedings can not be said to share an identity of the cause of action,a required element of res judicata.see prochotsky,at.we have defined identity of the cause of action as a core of operative facts which give rise to a remedy.in re matter of energy,at.although the immigration proceeding at issue here is based upon conviction,the same conviction on which his deportation proceeding was based,the ground that the immigration authorities now invoke was unavailable to them in the first proceeding and therefore could not have been asserted.see ripplin shoals land,llc army corps of eng rs,cir r es judicata does not apply to claims that did not exist when the first suit was filed.citing lundquist rice mem l,cir see also comm r sunnen.but where the second action between the same parties is upon a different cause or demand,the principle of res judicata is applied much more narrowly.as we have noted,courts consistently have refused to apply res judicata to preclude a second suit that is based on a claim that could not have been asserted in the first suit.see cases cited supra note and accompanying text.
moreover,two circumstances require a less rigid application of res judicata in this case.the relevant change in the law here is statutory in nature,as opposed to a change in case law,and that change is being applied in the administrative context.see fisher,at moore,supra,acknowledging that a new statute may justify institution of a subsequent action see also collins,at r es judicata of administrative decisions is not encrusted with rigid finality that characterizes the precept in judicial proceedings.int l harvester,at this court does not adhere to a rigid view of the doctrine in the administrative context.
finally,we note that the application of res judicata under these circumstances would be inconsistent with iirira statutory scheme and therefore would frustrate congress policy decision that aliens convicted of sexual abuse of a minor merit removal regardless of when their convictions occurred.see a.several of our sister circuits have suggested a similar approach.in tran gonzales,the sixth circuit concluded that the immigration authorities could institute new removal proceedings based on convictions that were previously the subject of closed deportation proceedings,cir.under iirira amended definition of aggravated felony,the alien became subject to removal proceedings on an entirely different charge,and therefore it did not matter that the same conviction had been the subject of the previous deportation proceeding.id.at see also channer dep t of homeland,cir it may be that when dhs attempts to remove aliens convicted of aggravated opposed to aliens falling into some other category making them determination of whether res judicata applies changes,given congress clear and emphatic position with respect to such aliens.
similarly,in gonzales,cir unpublished the ins brought deportation proceedings against,an individual who had been convicted of sexual abuse of a minor,alleging that he was deportable because he stood convicted of a crime of moral turpitude the deportation proceedings were terminated,and the ins failed to appeal the ij decision.in,after iirira expanded the definition of aggravated felony to include sexual abuse of a minor,the ins again brought removal proceedings against alleging that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.he appealed the bia decision that res judicata was inapplicable,but the ninth circuit rejected that submission.the court explained that res judicata was inapplicable because 
the government could not have taken advantage of iirira expanded definition of aggravated felonies,which included sexual abuse of a minor,to deport petitioner.the government inaction in challenging the ij termination of deportation proceedings based on petitioner alleged crimes involving moral turpitude may have resulted in a final judgment with respect to the second degree rape and sodomy convictions as crimes involving moral turpitude.under iirira,however,the situation was altered where the expanded class of crimes that qualify as aggravated felonies swept petitioner convictions in the new grounds for removal.therefore,the import of the convictions,as a factual basis for removability,ca
