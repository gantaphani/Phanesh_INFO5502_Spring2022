lydia garcia milian,a native and citizen of guatemala,petitions for review of the denial of her applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat by the board of immigration appeals bia.because substantial evidence supports the bia determinations that garcia milian was not persecuted on account of an imputed political opinion and that the attack she suffered did not occur with the acquiescence of the guatemalan government,we deny her petition.
garcia milian entered the united states illegally in june.after the government initiated removal proceedings,she conceded removability and,on may,applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.see,b.
garcia milian testified at the removal proceedings and the ij concluded that her testimony was credible.according to garcia milian,she lived in salama,guatemala,a small city of approximately people.between and,she lived with noe garcia,her common law husband as a truck driver,garcia was frequently away from salama and would stay with garcia milian for only two days each month.during the time they were together,garcia never discussed politics or the ongoing civil war in guatemala with garcia milian,and never told her that he was in a guerilla group or organization.in approximately,garcia married another woman and did not return to salama.garcia milian did not have any further contact with him from that time forward.
around,garcia milian noticed two masked men following her when she was out shopping or going to school.this occurred around twenty times.garcia milian did not report these incidents to the police because she did not think that the police would help her.subsequently,in may,the two masked men came to her home at night and demanded that she open the door.when she did so,they told her that they were looking for noe garcia because he had been in a guerilla group and ordered her to tell them his current whereabouts.although she did not know where he lived,she lied and told them he was living in san miguel a city.the men subsequently beat and raped her.before leaving,they told garcia milian that if they could not find garcia,they would return and kill her.
after the men left,garcia milian took a taxi to her mother home in another town.garcia milian did not seek treatment at a hospital because she was afraid that the men would find out and kill her.two days later,she reported the incident to the salama police,who told her they could not investigate the incident because she could not identify her assailants.fearing for her life,garcia milian left guatemala for mexico,and then paid a coyote to smuggle her across the border into the united states.
in addition to testifying at the proceeding,garcia milian submitted a state department report on guatemala titled country reports on human rights practices,and four amnesty international reports.the reports indicate that guatemalan police had minimal training or capacity for investigating or assisting victims of sexual crimes,and that the guatamalan government had been ineffective in investigating violence against women and homicides generally,due to weaknesses throughout the criminal justice and law enforcement system.
the ij denied garcia milian applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.the bia affirmed the ij decision.it noted that w hile the respondent appears to have been the victim of criminal acts on the several occasions described,she has not established a nexus between any incident and a protected ground under the act.based on its review of the record,the bia concluded that there was no evidence the respondent ever expressed a political opinion and no evidence to suggest that she was harmed based on any real or imputed political opinion.as a result,the bia denied garcia milian asylum and withholding of removal claims.the bia also rejected garcia milian cat claim.it held that the record did not establish that it is more likely than not that the respondent will face torture by or with the acquiescence or willful blindness of an officer of the government of guatemala.
we have jurisdiction under to review final orders of removal.li holder,cir.we review the bia denials of asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief for substantial evidence and will uphold a denial supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.kamalyan holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted asylum pagayon holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted withholding of removal see haile holder,cir cat relief.in order to reverse the bia,we must determine that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it and also compels the further conclusion that the petitioner meets the requisite standard for obtaining relief.ins elias zacarias.the agency f indings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.kamalyan,at quoting b b.
we begin by considering garcia milian challenge to the bia denial of her asylum application.
applicants for asylum bear the burden of proving eligibility for asylum.a.in order to carry this burden,an applicant must first establish refugee status,b,by proving past persecution or fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a persecution is on account of a protected ground only where the persecution occurred because of that ground.elias zacarias,at parussimova mukasey,cir.accordingly,the persecutor motive is critical and the applicant must come forward with some evidence of motive,direct or circumstantial.elias zacarias,at.
here,garcia milian based her asylum claim on the ground that the masked men persecuted her on account of her political opinion.although she does not claim to have any political opinion of her own,an applicant can also establish persecution on account of imputed political opinion that is,on account of a political opinion attributed to him by his persecutors.navas,cir.in establishing an imputed political opinion,the focus of inquiry turns away from the views of the victim to the views of the persecutor.sangha,cir.therefore,the applicant for asylum must present evidence of the persecutor views.a persecutor statements attributing political views to the applicant may be persuasive evidence.for example,one party to a conflict may insist to the victim that the victim is aligned with the other side.id.citing singh ilchert,cir.similarly,persecutors statements that they are retaliating against the victim for the political views of the victim family would support an imputed political opinion claim.kebede ashcroft,cir.in the absence of such direct evidence,an alien may point to the applicant association with,or relationship to,people who are known to hold a particular political opinion in order to raise the inference that the persecutors have imputed a political view to the alien.navas,at.for example,evidence that the applicant is a member of a large,politically active family many of whom have already been persecuted for their political beliefs may raise the inference that persecutors have imputed or would impute the same political opinion to the applicant.sangha,at.similarly,a petitioner may demonstrate facts necessary to prove an imputed political asylum claim where she is victimized by an party with a long history of harassing and persecuting the petitioner family due to her father position,and her abusers made comments indicating that petitioner was chosen as a victim because of her father ties to the government.silaya mukasey,cir.
by contrast,we have upheld the bia denial of an asylum application based on imputed political opinion where there was neither direct evidence of the persecutor viewpoint,nor indirect evidence sufficient to compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the bia.in molina estrada,for example,the bia denied the alien asylum claim because he failed to show persecution on account of a protected ground.molina estrada ins,cir.on appeal,the alien pointed to his testimony that guerillas had attacked his family house in guatemala and threatened members of his family because his father was a high ranking officer in the armed forces.id.at.noting that the petitioner offered no evidence that his father held particular political beliefs,that the guerillas knew of or assumed any such beliefs,or that they had made any statements suggesting that they attacked his father home because of his father political beliefs,id.at,we concluded that petitioner testimony was not enough to compel any reasonable factfinder to conclude that petitioner was subject to persecution because of imputed political beliefs.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
as in molina estrada,the record here does not compel the conclusion that the masked men imputed a political opinion to garcia milian.first,there is no direct evidence that they did so.the masked men did not make any statements attributing political views to garcia milian or indicating that they were retaliating against her due to the views of her.nor did the masked men themselves express any political views.garcia milian provided no evidence as to the political opinions of the masked men there is no evidence that they were part of a political organization or that they opposed noe garcia political position if any.silaya,at noting that petitioner abusers were members of an group which had targeted the family due to the father position since petitioner childhood.further,garcia milian points to only a single piece of indirect evidence the masked men statement that they were looking for noe garcia because he had been in a guerilla group.in the circumstances of this case,however,this single statement is insufficient to compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the bia.the statement could have been interpreted as evidence that the men either imputed a political opinion to garcia milian or merely wanted to extract information from her about noe garcia whereabouts.unlike the victim in kebede,therefore,garcia milian failed to identify circumstantial evidence in the record raising a compelling inference that the masked men were imputing noe garcia political opinions to her.for the same reason,the evidence in the record does not raise the inference that the men sought to punish garcia milian for her association with noe garcia.because garcia milian single piece of indirect evidence provides little or no support for her claim that she was persecuted for an imputed political opinion,it clearly does not compel that conclusion,and we must uphold the bia holding to the contrary 
because garcia milian did not present evidence of imputed political opinion that would compel any reasonable factfinder to conclude that petitioner was subject to persecution because of imputed political beliefs,molina estrada,at internal quotation marks omitted,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the bia conclusion that garcia milian was not persecuted on account of a protected ground.accordingly,we reject garcia milian challenge to the bia denial of her asylum application 
we turn to garcia milian claim that the bia erred in denying her cat claim.to qualify for cat relief,an alien must establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c see also nuru gonzales,cir.torture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment,a,that either is not lawfully sanctioned by that country or is lawfully sanctioned by that country,but defeats the object and purpose of cat,nuru,at.in addition,the torture must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.zheng ashcroft,cir quoting a emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.thus relief under the convention against torture requires a two part analysis first,is it more likely than not that the alien will be tortured upon return to his homeland and second,is there sufficient state action involved in that torture.tamara gomez gonzales,cir.
in addressing the prong of her cat claim,garcia milian points to her testimony that the police were unwilling to investigate the attack by the masked men which occurred before she left the country,implicitly arguing that because the police previously acquiesced in torture,the police are likely to acquiesce in future instances of torture.see reyes sanchez,cir.she has also submitted evidence that the guatemalan government has been generally ineffective in preventing or investigating violence against women.we must determine whether this evidence compels the conclusion that the guatemalan government would acquiesce in torture if garcia milian returned to guatemala.
public officials acquiesce in torture if,prior to the activity constituting torture,the officials have awareness of the activity or consciously close their eyes to the fact it is going on and breach their legal responsibility to intervene to prevent the activity because they are unable or unwilling to oppose it.ornelas chavez gonzales,cir quoting a see also cole holder,cir.by contrast,a government does not acquiesce in the torture of its citizens merely because it is aware of torture but powerless to stop it.mouawad gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
evidence that the police were aware of a particular crime,but failed to bring the perpetrators to justice,is not in itself sufficient to establish acquiescence in the crime.instead,there must be evidence that the police are unable or unwilling to oppose the crime.otherwise,a person could obtain cat relief merely because he was attacked by a gang of neighborhood thugs whom the police were unable to apprehend.reyes sanchez,at.in rreshpja gonzales,for example,the applicant claimed that the police had acquiesced in her attempted kidnaping because when she reported the crime,the police told her that the information she had provided was insufficient to identify or arrest the man who had attacked her,cir.the court upheld the bia denial of her cat claim because the police inability to solve a crime under those circumstances did not constitute acquiescence in the crime.id.at.similarly,in this case,garcia milian testimony that the police declined to investigate the masked men attack because they lacked sufficient information does not compel the conclusion that the police acquiesced in the attack,and therefore does not support garcia milian claim that it is more likely than not the police will acquiesce in any future attacks if she returns to guatemala.
nor does evidence that a government has been generally ineffective in preventing or investigating criminal activities raise an inference that public officials are likely to acquiesce in torture,absent evidence of corruption or other inability or unwillingness to oppose criminal organizations.in tamara gomez,for example,the court rejected the petitioner claim that the columbian government acquiesced in attacks by a organization,even though the police informed the petitioner that it lacked the resources to protect individual families,and the record contained significant evidence that the columbian government was unable to prevent the terrorist group crimes.at.the court held that neither the failure to apprehend the persons threatening the alien,nor the lack of financial resources to eradicate the threat or risk of torture constitute sufficient state action for purposes of the convention against torture.id.at.similarly,in menjivar gonzales,the court rejected a petitioner claim for cat relief despite her evidence that she had been attacked by a gang member and the record
