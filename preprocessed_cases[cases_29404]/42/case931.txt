michelle chambers,a jamaican native,petitions for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia ordering her removal pursuant to a e i.in re michelle chambers,no.a,wl,aff g no.a immig.buffalo.she contends that the bia erred in finding that she knowingly assisted her former boyfriend attempted illegal entry into the united states and that irrespective of whether she knew he could not legally enter the united states,her actions were insufficient to constitute an affirmative act of assistance within the meaning of the statute.we disagree and therefore deny the petition.
background 
chambers was,at all relevant times,a lawful permanent resident of the united states residing in hempstead,long island,new york.in february,she traveled by automobile with her brother,a united states citizen,to ontario,canada,to visit relatives.in,her former boyfriend,christopher woolcock,a resident of jamaica,had been deported by the united states after being convicted of a felony.he was also in ontario at the time of chambers visit,allegedly to attend his uncle wedding.prior to chambers and woolcock trips to ontario,they agreed during the course of a telephone conversation to meet there and return together to the united states.
on february,with chambers brother driving,she,her brother,and woolcock traveled from ontario headed for the united states in an automobile with georgia license plates.chambers was in the front passenger seat and woolcock was in the back seat.at the border crossing,chambers brother handed united states customs officials his passport,his sister travel documents,and a green card issued in woolcock name.because the customs database revealed that woolcock had previously been deported,the three were referred to immigration offices for further examination.
during subsequent questioning by an immigration inspector,chambers repeatedly said that woolcock lived in long island and that he had traveled to canada with her and her brother.she also denied having woolcock passport.moments later,however,she retrieved it from underneath a seat cushion in the area where she had been waiting to be interviewed.following her interview,chambers gave a sworn statement to the inspector in which she admitted lying about woolcock residence having previously agreed with woolcock to accompany him at the canadian border as he tried to enter the united states that prior to that conversation,h e was going to come some other way through kennedy airport that she thought woolcock had last been in the united states seven years before that she was aware he had been deported previously and that woolcock was planning to stay with her at her home upon entering the united states.
chambers was charged with knowingly aiding or assisting the illegal entry of another alien under a e i,and given a notice to appear at removal proceedings.that removal hearing was held before immigration judge ij philip montante,on august.chambers testified that she thought woolcock was permitted to enter the united states because he had shown her a green card with his much younger picture on it and had told her that an immigration officer at the time of his deportation in had informed him that he could return to the united states after ten years she again admitted having lied to immigration officers both when she told them that woolcock was a long island resident and when she said that she did not know the whereabouts of woolcock passport.and she admitted that she had also lied when she told the immigration inspector during her interview that woolcock was going to live with her when they returned to long island.in fact,chambers testified,he was to live with his mother.
chambers explained her misstatements by saying she was frightened because she had been told she would be deported.asked on why she had never decided to visit her family in canada until the weekend that woolcock was also in canada,chambers answered,well,we just decided.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij issued an oral decision concluding that chambers had knowingly aided the illegal entry of another alien.the ij noted chambers several misstatements at the canadian border and found that she lied to the court today.in re michelle a chambers,a,at.relying on these misstatements and chambers sworn statement that she and woolcock had planned the trip across the border,the ij concluded that chambers knew that woolcock could not legally enter the united states and that her actions were an attempt to induce and to encourage woolcock illegal entry.id.at.the ij also noted that he perceived chambers testimony that woolcock told her that he could reenter the united states ten years after his deportation to be inconsistent with chambers statement to the immigration inspector that woolcock was last in the united states seven years prior to the incident at the border.id.at well,if he had been in the united states seven years ago,does that fly in the face of her statement that woolcock told her allegedly that he could return after years and here it was seven years ago that he was in the united states.
on january,the bia affirmed in a short opinion that closely followed the ij reasoning.first,the bia determined that if chambers believed that woolcock could only reenter the united states after having been absent for years after his deportation,chambers would have had knowledge that woolcock would not have been able to reenter the united states after the passage of only years.in re michelle chambers,a,at.second,it concluded that in light of chambers numerous admitted and deliberate misrepresentations to customs officials at the border,the ij did not err in finding chambers testimony at the hearing incredible or in finding that her deception at the border reflected guilty knowledge.id.
chambers petitions for review.
discussion 
standard of review 
since the bia affirmed the ij order in a brief opinion that closely tracks the ij reasoning,and since our conclusion is the same regardless of which decision we review,we will consider both the ij and the bia opinions.lewis gonzales,cir quoting wangchuck dep t of homeland security,cir brackets in original.
we review the ij and bia factual findings for substantial evidence,and we consider questions of law and applications of law to fact de novo.ins,cir.the bia findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.the petitioner knowledge at the time in question is a question of fact.see,farmer brennan,d weyant okst,cir see also locurto giuliani,cir t he defendants intent is a factual question.
ii.chambers acted knowingly 
section a e i of the immigration and naturalization act provides that an alien is not admissible into the united states if he or she at any time knowingly has encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided any other alien to enter or try to enter the united states in violation of the law.a e i chambers argues that the circumstances surrounding her stop at the border compel the conclusion that she did not act knowingly.specifically,she contends that her behavior was consistent with the acts of someone who thought she was participating in a legal act her brother readily handed over woolcock green card to the customs officer no subterfuge in the form of fraudulent documents or hidden compartments was used and chambers complied with all of the various officers requests.she argues further that her misstatements were not only immaterial to the charge of aiding illegal alien entry,but also were later recanted.
but chambers does not contest that she lied at the border regarding woolcock residency and the whereabouts of his passport.the nature of these misstatements plainly supports the inference drawn by the ij and the bia that chambers knew woolcock could not legally enter the united states.for example,her statements that woolcock lived in long island and drove with her and her brother to canada could reasonably be construed as an attempt by chambers to convince officials that woolcock then resided in the united states lawfully.such an inference would in turn support the corollary inference that chambers wanted border officia
