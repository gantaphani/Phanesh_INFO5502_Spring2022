defendant agustin rivera santana seeks relief from a sentence of months in prison,imposed as a result of his illegal reentry into the united states after being removed for a conviction of an aggravated felony,in violation of a and b.on appeal,rivera santana mounts several procedural challenges to the sentence,contending that the district court erred in making two upward departures in the advisory sentencing guidelines range,augmented by an upward variance of months therefrom.he also asserts that the resulting sentence the statutory maximum is,in any event,substantively unreasonable.as explained below,we reject these contentions and affirm.
rivera santana was born in mexico in in,he came to the united states as a lawful permanent resident and worked as an agricultural laborer in california.on december,rivera santana was convicted of reckless driving in california and sentenced to days in jail.in the and early,he was arrested four more times in california for drunk driving in january and again in april for grand theft in and for assault and battery in 
in,rivera santana shot and killed his pregnant wife.he was thereafter convicted in california of voluntary manslaughter and received an sentence.rivera santana was paroled from prison on january,and was deported to mexico on february.just a few days later,on february,he reentered the united states illegally.on that occasion,rivera santana was attempting to smuggle other aliens across the border.he was arrested by border patrol agents the next day,february,and deported to mexico a week later.on march,a mere five days after being deported,rivera santana illegally reentered this country a second time,evading apprehension until august,when he was arrested in california for driving under the influence dui.he nevertheless remained in the united states for another year,until being arrested on may,by agents of the immigration and naturalization service.on may,rivera santana prior removal order was reinstated,and he was deported again on june.
in march,rivera santana illegally reentered the united states for a third time,travelling to virginia to live with his daughter and her family.soon thereafter,on august,he was convicted in virginia of an open container violation and fined fifty dollars.a few months later,on february,rivera santana sexually assaulted his granddaughter in his daughter home.as a result,he was convicted in virginia beach of aggravated sexual assault and attempted forcible sodomy.for these offenses,he was sentenced to thirty years in prison,with all but six years and ten months suspended.rivera santana is scheduled for release from the virginia prison facilities on march.
on march,the grand jury in the eastern district of virginia indicted rivera santana for illegal reentry after a prior removal for a conviction of an aggravated felony,in violation of a and b on june,rivera santana entered a plea of guilty to that offense,which carries a statutory maximum of months in prison.the stipulated statement of facts filed during rivera santana plea proceedings reflects that his voluntary manslaughter conviction in california constitutes an aggravated felony under b.see.
in conjunction with the sentencing proceedings in the district court,the probation officer prepared rivera santana presentence investigation report the psr.the psr recommended an adjusted offense level of,reflecting a enhancement pursuant to guidelines section the illegal reentry guideline for rivera santana prior voluntary manslaughter conviction.the resultant offense level,considered in combination with the applicable criminal history category,calculated at iv,yielded an advisory guidelines range of to months on september,the government moved for an upward variance,requesting that rivera santana receive the month statutory maximum.
the district court conducted its sentencing hearing on october,first determining that rivera santana criminal history was underrepresented in the guidelines calculations because certain of his prior convictions and arrests were unscored.see ussg a providing for upward departure where reliable information indicates that the defendant criminal history category substantially the seriousness of the defendant criminal history.hence,the court upwardly departed,adding seventeen criminal history points to the psrrecommended eight the court revised total of criminal history points elevated rivera santana criminal history category to vi the highest possible.
the sentencing court then determined that a criminal history category of vi,coupled with an offense level of,produced an inadequate advisory guidelines range to months.the court explained 
rivera santana history bespeaks a very dangerous person.it bespeaks one of the most dangerous people i ever seen before this court.it bespeaks a person who habitually,continually commits crimes,benefits not at all from leniency which has been extended in a number of ways and occasions as is outlined in the psr,and that there is one of the most effectively demonstrated tendencies to recidivate i have seen since i came on the bench in.
the sentencing court then upwardly departed for a second time,to a higher offense level.see ussg a b providing for upward departure if highest criminal history category deemed insufficient.in so doing,the court allocated one offense level for every three of the seventeen unscored criminal history points,raising the offense level by five levels,from to.with a criminal history category of vi,the second departure authorized the court to establish the advisory guidelines range at to months.
the district court then concluded,however,that a sentence of to months was not sufficient to punish the defendant and to accomplish the objectives of the sentencing guidelines.after considering the sentencing factors set forth in a,the court decided that an upward variance to the statutory maximum was warranted in elaborating on the a factors and in further justification for a variance to the statutory maximum,the court explained 
this man has proved for years that he is a danger to society.he has proved for years that he has no respect for the law.he has proved for years that it is necessary to take strong action to protect the public.a man who will kill his wife,pregnant wife,and kill his own child and molest his granddaughter has no respect for the law and is a menace and a proven danger to the public,to the citizenry of the nation that he has chosen on multiple occasions illegally to invade,and when he comes here,he violates all kinds of laws,any kind of law that stands in the way of accomplishing what he wants to do.
if he wants to gratify himself,he plunders an child.if he wants to have some company or make some money,he smuggles illegal aliens.he gets deported,he comes right back.he drives drunk.he steals,he beats.he is,in short,an anathema to society.
accordingly,the sentencing court concluded that,in order to deter rivera santana,properly protect the public,and promote respect for the law,it was obliged to vary upward to the statutory maximum and impose a sentence of months in prison.the court entered its judgment order on october,and rivera santana has timely appealed.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
we review for reasonableness a sentence imposed by a district court.see gall united states,d.in undertaking such a review,we must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence including an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.united states diosdado star,cir internal quotation marks omitted.absent a significant procedural error,our next step is to assess the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.see id.in either event,a deferential standard applies to any sentence,whether inside,just outside,or significantly outside the guidelines range.see united states savillon matute,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
rivera santana maintains on appeal that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.his procedural challenges arise from three separate decisions made by the sentencing court the upward departure under guidelines section a,departing from the guidelines range of to months to an advisory guidelines range of to months the criminal history category departure the upward departure under guidelines section a b,further departing to an advisory guidelines range of to months the offense level departure and the upward variance,pursuant to a,resulting in the statutory maximum of months.rivera santana identifies four instances of procedural error attributable to the two departures and the variance.first,he suggests that the district court gave too much weight to the illegal reentry guideline,guidelines section,as a foundation for its departures and variance.second,rivera santana asserts that the court erred in making its upward departures by relying on improper factors and in calculating his offense level and criminal history points.third,he posits that,in departing,the sentencing court failed to apply an incremental approach.and,fourth,he claims that the court erred in basing its month variance on the a factors,without considering the relevant mitigating factors and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.separately,rivera santana contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the aims of sentencing and is essentially a life sentence,given his age years and his health.we assess each of these contentions in turn.
rivera santana first contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the enhancement authorized by the illegal reentry guideline,section,is an arbitrary one.see br.of appellant.he argues that the sentencing commission improperly adopted that specific guideline,having failed to conduct adequate empirical studies or examination of past sentencing practices.id.additionally,rivera santana asserts that the illegal reentry guideline enhancement constitutes a weak base on which to layer both a departure and a variance.id.at.
although a sentencing court may be entitled to consider policy decisions underlying the guidelines,including the presence or absence of empirical data,see kimbrough united states,d,it is under no obligation to do so,see united states mondragon santiago,cir accord united states lopez,cir see also united states perez frias,cir concluding that illegal reentry guideline was properly adopted by commission.moreover,rivera santana procedural challenge to the illegal reentry guideline rests on a faulty premise that any application of that guideline is flawed because it impermissibly double counts a defendant prior criminal record first,in determining the offense level,and again in calculating the criminal history score.see br.of appellant.
recognizing that we have previously rejected such a contention,see united states crawford,cir,rivera santana objects instead to what he characterizes as the triple or even that purportedly occurred in this case when the sentencing court made two upward departures and an upward variance after the illegal reentry guideline enhancement had been applied.see reply br.of appellant.this nuanced objection is entitled to no more mileage than its forerunner the objection that we rejected in crawford.the sentencing court committed no procedural error because the guidelines do not expressly prohibit the triple counting of rivera santana prior record.see crawford,at affirming triple counting of different types of criminal history points for same aggravated felony conviction see also united states zuniga peralta,cir affirming upward departure pursuant to guidelines section in addition to enhancement under illegal reentry guideline.nor did the court impermissibly count riverasantana extensive criminal record when it imposed the upward variance justified under the a sentencing factors.united states ventura,affirming upward variance from illegal reentry guideline enhancement based on assessment of a factors united states guevas gomez,cir concluding that n othing in section b or in the guidelines suggests that the district court departure authority does not extend to the illegal reentry guideline.
rivera santana next contends that both of the district court upward departures were procedurally defective because the court erroneously relied on our decision in united states rybicki,cir establishing analysis for whether sentencing court may depart,which he maintains is no longer controlling,due to the supreme court decision in united states booker,d and the court improperly augmented his criminal history points by scoring prior arrests that were dissimilar to the offense of conviction,see united states dixon,cir affirming departure based on defendant prior arrests involving misconduct similar to offense of conviction.rather than assess the extent to which rybicki may be good law,and without deciding whether certain of rivera santana prior arrests with no dispositions ascertained could be scored because they were sufficiently similar to the offense of conviction,we are entitled to summarily reject this contention because,even if we assume that an error occurred,it is harmless.see united states savillon matute,cir.
although rivera santana objected to the district court making any upward departure from the calculations,he nevertheless acknowledged that the court acting within its discretion was authorized under the guidelines to elevate his criminal history category to vi by adding twelve criminal history points for unscored prior offenses.see.rivera santana maintained,however,that the court was entitled to make the first departure only,that is,the criminal history category departure that elevated his advisory guidelines range to to months.having carefully assessed this point,we discern no abuse of discretion in the sentencing court decision that the advisory guidelines range of to months was inadequate.this decision was soundly explained by the court,which identified a host of supporting facts,including the extensive and serious nature of rivera santana criminal activities,his chronic recidivism,his squandering of opportunities accorded by his lenient punishments,and the consequences of his most recent illegal reentry.indeed,the court emphasized that rivera santana was one of the most dangerous people,with one of the most effectively demonstrated tendencies to recidivate,that the court had ever sentenced.see.
in moving beyond the criminal history category departure to the offense level departure,the sentencing court carefully considered rivera santana position that only twelve as opposed to seventeen additional criminal history points could properly be scored.in fact,the court calculated the offense level departure by allocating one offense level for every three of those twelve points,which yielded an offense level of and an advisory guidelines range of to months.the court alternatively performed the same calculation utilizing its determination that seventeen additional criminal history points were justified,resulting in an offense level of and a guidelines range of to months.ultimately,the court settled on and fixed the guidelines range for rivera santana at to months.
nevertheless,having endeavored to fashion an appropriate sentence by way of its two departures,the court concluded that the advisory guidelines range of to months was yet inadequate,and thus proceeded to implement an upward variance to the month statutory maximum.hence,notwithstanding the court consideration of the alternative departure ranges,it is clear that the court would have imposed the same upward variance to the statutory maximum whether from the guidelines range of to months,or from the guidelines range of to months 
as a result,we are,in any event,entitled to affirm the sentence imposed assuming its substantive reasonableness because any procedural error that may have been made in calculating either of the two departures would necessarily be harmless.see savillon matute,at agreeing that it would make no sense to set aside a reasonable sentence and send the ca
