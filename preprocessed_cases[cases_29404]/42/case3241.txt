petitioner ai jun zhi,a chinese citizen,petitions for review of the denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal.as we explain below,one of the bases for the immigration judge ij adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence and another must be set aside and remanded as a result of legal error.the ij also failed to provide zhi with proper notice and a reasonable opportunity to produce corroborating evidence,as required by our opinion in ren holder,cir.we therefore grant zhi petition and remand for further proceedings.
zhi has primarily lived outside of china since,first in saipan and later in guam.from to,zhi was married to a chinese citizen,with whom he has two daughters on august,zhi entered guam on a b visa,and married a united states citizen,shirley munos santos,six days later.the couple divorced on december.santos did not file a visa petition on zhi behalf during their marriage.
in,zhi opened a bookstore in china,which he intended to be a source of income when he returned.his,hong zhang,managed the store.zhi testified that in april,zhang called zhi to ask if zhang friend,a falun gong practitioner,could keep books about falun gong in the bookstore.zhi agreed.zhi testified that on february,the local police found out about the books and closed the bookstore.the police detained zhang for two days,but then released him after learning that zhi owned the bookstore.
zhi received a phone call from his father the day the police closed the bookstore.zhi father told him never to come back to china or contact either of his parents again,and then promptly hung up.the police searched zhi parents home and informed them that if they did not report zhi upon his return to china,zhi parents would bear responsibility for his criminal actions.zhi also received a call from a friend who told zhi the police had issued a warrant for zhi arrest and had charged him as a falun gong cultist.
zhi proffered four letters from family and friends explaining what had happened in more detail and warning him not to return to china.zhi friend,jian ming,mailed zhi mother letters to avoid detection by undercover chinese authorities who zhi mother believed were monitoring her mail.ming explained in his own letter that he was afraid to help zhi and would not do so again.he asked zhi to avoid further contact with him.
zhi mother reported in her two letters that the police closed his bookstore on february.zhi sister,however,wrote that police closed the bookstore on february.when asked about the discrepancy at his asylum hearing,zhi testified that his sister told him during a telephone conversation that she wrote the year down wrong.
in september,zhi received a notice to appear for removal proceedings.he conceded removability and requested relief in the form of asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of imputed political opinion.the ij denied zhi application on august.in her oral decision,she explained that zhi did not present credible evidence establishing a fear of future persecution.although she relied primarily on the inconsistency concerning the year zhi bookstore closed,she explained that the discrepancy in dates was particularly significant in light of the timing of zhi very marriage to a citizen,which she interpreted as an attempt to remain in the united states.the ij also based her decision on zhi failure to submit reasonably available corroborating evidence.
the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij decision on april.zhi timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
where,as here,the bia adopts the ij decision and also contributes its own reasoning to the analysis,we review both decisions nuru gonzales,cir.
we review factual findings,including adverse credibility decisions,under the deferential substantial evidence standard.mendoza pablo holder,cir.we may reverse factual determinations only when any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary based on the evidence in the record.b b.we review de novo questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact.mendoza pablo,at.
an asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing his claim through credible evidence.see b b i,iii.for applications filed after may,such as zhi,the credibility standards set forth in the real id act apply.see,div.b,title i,h,stat.may.although an ij may base her adverse credibility determination on any relevant factor,she must do so in light of the totality of the circumstances.b b iii shrestha holder,cir.in other words,the ij can not selectively examine evidence in determining credibility,but rather must present a reasoned analysis of the evidence as a whole.tamang holder,cir see also bassene holder,cir stating that an ij must view purported inconsistencies in light of all the evidence presented in the case internal quotations and citations omitted.the ij can not cherry pick solely facts favoring an adverse credibility determination while ignoring facts that undermine that result,shrestha,at,and must consider the petitioner explanation for any inconsistency that is cited as a factor supporting an adverse credibility determination,id.at.under the real id act,an ij may base credibility determinations on factors that do not go to the heart of the applicant claim.b b iii ren,at recognizing abrogation of the ninth circuit heart of the claim test.however,an ij can not base an adverse credibility determination solely on an utterly trivial inconsistency that under the total circumstances has no bearing on a petitioner veracity.shrestha,at.
the principal basis for the ij adverse credibility finding was that zhi sister identified the date of the bookstore closure as february,while zhi and his mother dated the closure on february.the ij rejected zhi explanation that his sister merely wrote down the year wrong in her letter.the ij stated that,while she may otherwise have considered the sister date a typographical error,she refused to do so here because zhi only offered his explanation after he was questioned about it on.the ij characterized the inconsistency as a major discrepancy because zhi relied heavily upon the letters to establish his fear of persecution,and because it was zhi sister husband who ran the bookstore.the bia agreed,explaining that zhi testimony about the closure date was central to his evidence establishing the circumstances for which the chinese government allegedly seeks to harm him.
the bia and ij ignored critical evidence that undermines the adverse credibility determination.in her oral decision,the ij rejected zhi argument that he had suffered past persecution because of extreme economic deprivation.in doing so,the ij described the business receipts that zhi presented as credible evidence.these receipts include a business license renewal dated december,and twelve additional receipts dated between february,and february.the lastdated receipt was from january.these receipts support zhi explanation that his sister made a mistake when she dated her letter.they also bolster zhi testimony identifying the closure date as february.
in light of this significant record evidence,we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the bia determination that the conflict in dates resulted in a legally significant discrepancy in the evidence.in light of the receipts,no reasonable factfinder,elias zacarias,could have determined that the discrepancy in dates was anything but an utterly trivial discrepancy that under the total circumstances has no bearing on zhi veracity,see shrestha,at.the evidence overwhelmingly supports zhi explanation that his sister,in either a slip of pen or a slip of memory,misstated the year of the closure.zhi testimony,his mother two letters,the fact that his sister stated the same date but a different year,the business license renewal,and the twelve other receipts dated between february,and february,all support zhi dating of the bookstore closure and his explanation that his sister made a mistake when she dated her letter.we therefore conclude that substantial evidence does not support the agency finding that the discrepancy in dates undermines zhi credibility.
