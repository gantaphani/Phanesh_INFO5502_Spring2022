guan shan liao liao,petitioner,or applicant,a native of the people republic of china china,seeks asylum in this country on the basis of his resisting china family control policy.liao argues that he is entitled to such relief because he suffered past persecution and has a fear of future persecution as a result of his resistance to china one child population control program.at the hearing,liao testified and submitted documentary evidence in support of his application for asylum and withholding of exclusion.after the immigration judge denied relief,petitioner appealed to the board of immigration appeals board,appeals board,or board of appeals.
in denying the appeal,the board gave only cursory and somewhat ambiguous explanations for the conclusions it reached.such practice makes our review most difficult because,as this appeal illustrates,it leaves us in doubt as to whether,in denying the petition,the board methodology conformed to the applicable statutory and regulatory law.because we believe the appeals board ultimately did apply the correct legal framework,however inartfully stated,we affirm.but the ambiguities in its opinion call for a full exposition of the issues in this case.accordingly,we write to clarify the analysis the appeals board applied so that the ambiguities in its opinion are not carried into future cases,and so that the right to obtain asylum is not thereby unnecessarily clouded.
background 
on october,liao flew into the united states and attempted to gain illegal entry by sneaking out of the immigration inspection area of the los angeles international airport.after being apprehended,liao filed an application for asylum and withholding of exclusion alleging that if he were returned to china,he would be arrested for h aving more than children.in november liao posted a bond and was released from the custody of the immigration and naturalization service ins.subsequently,petitioner failed to appear at his exclusion hearing in february and was ordered to be excluded in absentia.petitioner filed a second asylum application in may.in june he moved to have his exclusion proceedings reopened and for a change of venue to new york.one month later these motions were granted,and a new exclusion proceeding commenced in new york on august.
in his second application,which contradicted his first to some extent,liao claimed his father had been persecuted in the for beliefs he had been fined when his son married at too early an age his house had been taken from him by the chinese authorities and he and his family were forced to live on the run after the authorities discovered he had harbored a cousin who was wanted for sterilization.
in his testimony before the immigration judge,petitioner supplemented his application with additional facts.most importantly,he testified that he was fined a second time for harboring his cousin,and submitted a copy of a notice ordering him to attend a birth control study class.he further alleged that had he attended this study class,he would have been detained until his cousin submitted to sterilization.since the cousin has not yet been sterilized,liao alleges that his family still living in china,including his wife,are actively evading the authorities.
in addition to the testimony elicited at the hearing,the immigration judge received evidence concerning china family planning policies,particularly those in the wenzhou area of the zhejiang province where petitioner lived.to support his claims of persecution,liao entered two new york times articles into the record.these report that homes in many different provinces are routinely knocked down for birth control violations,and that an increasingly high proportion of couples are sterilized or use contraception.a state department report providing a detailed account of birth control policies in the zhejiang province also became part of the record.
procedural history 
in an oral decision rendered at the conclusion of the hearing,the immigration judge rejected liao application.the decision began by noting that to obtain asylum or withholding of deportation,an applicant must show a persecutive motive on the part of the foreign government based on any one of five grounds,including race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.under in re chang,bia may,the controlling precedent at the time of the immigration judge decision,applicants who had been subjected to or punished for resisting china population control policy were not assumed to have been persecuted on a protected ground.given this rule,the immigration judge found that petitioner of which was related to the population control squarely within the ruling of in re chang.additionally,in holding that petitioner proof did not evince a persecutive motive on one of the five protected grounds,the immigration judge characterized liao allegations concerning the study class as hyperbole.
on january,more than six years later,and after a de novo review of the record,the appeals board ruled on petitioner appeal from the immigration judge opinion.when this review occurred,congress had overruled in re chang by amending the definition of the term refugee.illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act of,a,div,stat,codified at a iirira.the board nevertheless found that liao still did not qualify for refugee status,since none of his conduct constituted such resistance to the government family planning policies as would subject him to persecution upon his return to china.with respect to the applicant evidence regarding the study course,the board found that absent corroborating evidence to bolster his claims,liao could not show he had a fear of persecution.the board concluded by stating,we find that the evidence of record,considered cumulatively,does not show that the applicant has met his burden of demonstrating that he has suffered past persecution or has a fear of persecution on account of one of the five grounds for which asylum may be granted.it is from this decision and order that petitioner appeals.
discussion 
i standard of review 
liao petitions us to review the decision pursuant to c of the iirira.in conducting this review,we apply the substantial evidence test to the board factual findings and reverse only if no reasonable factfinder could have arrived at the same conclusion.diallo ins,cir.similarly,we defer to the board interpretation of the statutory law it administers,osorio ins,cir,reversing only when its interpretations are unreasonable.id.
when the ins has promulgated a regulation to protect a fundamental right derived from the constitution or a federal statute for an alien benefit,we require the administrative tribunal to adhere to it.waldron ins,cir.if review centers on the board application of legal principles to undisputed facts,we review the determination this case denying asylum and withholding of novo.ins,cir.
liao contends the board erred by holding he was not eligible for either political asylum or withholding of exclusion,the two alternative forms of relief for deportable aliens who claim they were or will be the subject of persecution in their home country.see melgar de torres reno,cir.since the standard for evaluating applications for withholding of deportation is similar more stringent standard for asylum claims,an applicant must show eligibility for asylum before withholding of deportation need be considered.see zhang slattery,cir an applicant who has failed to satisfy the requirements for asylum has necessarily failed to satisfy the requirements for withholding of return.for this reason,we focus our analysis on petitioner asylum claim.
ii standards for seeking asylum 
to obtain asylum,an applicant must initially establish that he is a refugee,or a person who is unable to return to his native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.when congress amended the definition in,it added the following clarifying language 
a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and 
a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
from a it may be seen that an applicant can obtain refugee status by demonstrating past persecution or a fear of persecution.for either method the applicant must satisfy two elements.to satisfy the first element the applicant must show that the applicant suffered persecution in the past or has a fear that he will be subjected to persecution upon return to his country of origin.see osorio,at.to satisfy the second element the applicant must demonstrate that the basis of the persecution is a ground protected by congress which,as noted,includes race,religion,nationality,membership in a social group,or political opinion.see id.at.importantly,if the applicant fits into the amended definition of refugee because he suffered persecution or has a fear of persecution for resisting a coercive population control program,he is then entitled to the benefit of a conclusive presumption that he has satisfied the second element,his persecution occurred on account of a protected ground.
as just observed,an applicant can establish refugee status by demonstrating he suffered past persecution in his country of origin on the basis of a protected ground.various types of conduct constitute persecution,such as,for example,the deliberate imposition of a substantial economic disadvantage.see chen ins,cir.if the applicant meets the requirements of demonstrating past persecution under this approach,then a rebuttable presumption arises establishing that the applicant has a fear of persecution.b.this presumption may be rebutted if a preponderance of the evidence establishes that a change in circumstances in the applicant country of nationality has occurred such that the applicant fear is no longer.id.b i.nevertheless,even if the presumption is rebutted,the applicant might still be eligible for a grant of asylum,but only if he can show compelling reasons.id.b ii.
alternatively,an applicant may qualify for asylum by demonstrating a fear of being persecuted on a protected basis.under this standard,the applicant must prove that he has a genuine fear and that a reasonable person in the applicant position would share that fear.see melgar de torres,at.thus,there is a subjective and an objective component to a fear.the subjective component may be based on the applicant reaction to events that impinge on him personally but to make it a fear,there must be other proof or objective facts that lend support to the applicant subjective fear.melendez dep t of justice,cir.importantly,to show that a reasonable person would share a certain fear,asylum applicants need not prove it is more likely than not that they will be persecuted if deported.ins,d.if an applicant is able to establish that he is entitled to refugee status,the attorney general may,in his discretion,grant asylum.see,at.
iii board analysis 
although liao submitted evidence to show past persecution and his fear of future persecution upon return to china,the board gave detailed attention only to that evidence relating to his fear of persecution through the birth control study class.the remaining evidence was summarily dismissed using the conclusory language quoted earlier in this opinion.when the board decides a case,as here,using summary language with little explanation for the conclusion reached,intelligible appellate review is made difficult.see zhao dep t of justice,cir an abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the board decision provides no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,is devoid of any reasoning,or contains only summary or conclusory statements.
despite our misgivings,the board underlying opinion contains sufficient rationale for the results reached for us,giving it the benefit of the doubt,to hold that it employed the correct analysis on liao refugee application.unlike in anderson mcelroy,cir,where we reversed a board decision because the agency failed to consider the entire record,we have greater assurances in the instant case that the totality of liao evidence was considered.the board not only based its findings on the evidence of record,considered cumulatively,but also described each piece of evidence at the outset of its analysis.additionally,as our subsequent analysis will demonstrate,whatever evidence the board failed to analyze in detail was for the most part insignificant.see douglas ins,cir t he bia merely failed to mention explicitly what is by any standard very marginal evidence this testimony might reasonably have been omitted in the bia decision as too insignificant to merit discussion.to consider the merits of liao arguments,we begin with the board reasoning.given the cursory nature of its opinion,such attention is warranted to avoid confusion in future cases.
the board began its analysis by listing and summarily dismissing most of liao claims that involved allegations of past and future persecution.it stated 
we find that the applicant has not established that he falls within the new definition of refugee on the basis of his having been fined because his son applied for a marriage license while underage and for harboring his cousin who had fled from birth control officials believing that he might be sterilized,having his house sealed after the family had left,and having been ordered to report for a study class on birth control policies.the applicant has not shown that these actions constitute such resistance to the government family planning policies that he would be subject to persecution upon his return to china.
by dismissing liao claims using the above language,the board impliedly defined resistance in such a way that an asylum applicant would be required to show that he would be subject to persecution upon his return to china.whether one views liao arguments as pertaining to past or future persecution,the board opinion can not be read as endorsing this definition.to show past persecution,an applicant need only show that he was subjected to certain types of persecutorial government action therefore,the use of the future tense,would be upon his return,is incompatible with a claim based solely on the past.this is illustrated by the fact that if the applicant shows that he was subjected to persecution,it then becomes the government burden to prove the applicant does not have a fear that he would be persecuted upon his return to his country of origin.
for this reason,if an applicant has to show that his resistance would subject him to persecution to qualify as a refugee under the amended definition,then the entire framework established under the regulations,b i,for claims of past persecution would be undermined by the word resistance.if it was the board intention to define resistance in this way,then this interpretation of the statutory language would plainly conflict with the rest of the asylum framework and,as such,would be an unreasonable interpretation of congress mandate.see,at.
although one could interpret the portion of the board opinion as applying to liao claims of past persecution,such as economic persecution in the destruction of his house,we believe the best interpretation of this ambiguous language is that the board intended this section to address the fear framework.even if this were the case,however,the use of the words would be,without qualification,created an ambiguity in the board rationale.typically,this terminology is associated with the higher burden of proof that attaches to applications for withholding of deportation.see diallo,at.this is because an individual can have a subjectively and objectively fear of persecution even if it is improbable that he will be persecuted upon his return to his own country.see,at.
as noted by the supreme court,depending upon the type and severity of the government persecution,o ne can certainly have a fear of an event happening when there is less than a chance of the occurrence taking place.id.the question is not therefore simply whether the applicant would be subjected to persecution upon his return,but rather whether he has a genuine and reasonable fear that he would be.despite the board inartful language,we read these two sentences of the opinion as simply faulting the applicant for failing to show that any of these actions would even potentially subject liao to persecution upon his return to china.given the overall brevity of the opinion and the lack of discussion of this particular issue,it seems highly unlikely that the board intended for these two sentences to establish a definition of resistance.this conclusion comports with our belief that petitioner did not establish even a colorable claim of qualifying for refugee status,a subject we deal with next.
iv liao evidence of past persecution 
petitioner sets forth three different bases upon which he believes a claim of past persecution can rest he was fined excessively he was threatened with detention,forced to leave his village,and deprived of valuable government services and his house was destroyed or sealed.we consider each of his arguments.
first,petitioner assertion that excessive fines were imposed on him seems to be a claim of economic persecution,see chand ins,cir economic persecution has been credited as an important part of asylum claims on numerous occasions,at,remanding case to the board to reconsider,inter alia,claim of severe economic persecution as a result of blacklisting.because the applicant counsel made no effort to set out or apply the relevant legal standards for such a claim,we would in the usual case consider the issue waived.see norton sam club,cir issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.but for purposes of completeness on this appeal we address the merits of the petitioner economic persecution argument.
while we recognize that economic deprivation may constitute persecution,an asylum applicant must offer some proof that he suffered a deliberate imposition of substantial economic disadvantage.chen,at see also chand,at.reviewing this record,we find no proof that would permit such a determination.no testimony or other evidence was presented regarding petitioner income in china,his net worth at the time of the fines,or any other facts that would make it possible for us to evaluate his personal financial circumstances in relation to the fines.absent this sort of proof,we can not assess whether or not the fines constituted a substantial disadvantage to him.it is unfortunate that such basic and relevant testimony to a claim of economic persecution was not elicited from petitioner.in any event,the problem created by this evidentiary gap is compounded by the government state department report that indicates that most families in liao relatively prosperous home area do not find the fines and fee s for birth control violations unduly heavy.since this report tends to contradict the basis for his assertion and we have no other probative evidence,the fines liao allegedly paid may not be said on this record to constitute economic persecution.
next,the applicant maintains he was threatened with detention,forced to leave his village,and deprived of valuable government services.with regard to the threat of detention,the threat ambiguously worded order to attend a birth control study not past persecution.because this threat also pertains to whether liao established a fear of persecution,we discuss the study class order more extensively in a moment.with respect to the forced exit from his village and deprivation of government services,the record is far too sparse to support a claim of past persecution.for example,liao testified he left his home because his neighbor informed him that two persons from the community were looking for him.yet,he did not indicate who these persons were or what they would have done had they found him and his family.thus,this claim is conjectural.see ins,cir finding vague threats relayed by family and friends to be insufficient to support asylum application.
petitioner also declares in his brief that after his family left the house,it was destroyed.but,in his asylum application he indicated the house was instead sealed with all of his possessions confiscated,and at his hearing he testified that nothing happened to the house because no one lived there.these inconsistencies in the proof do not provide a basis for a finding of economic persecution.more importantly,even assuming liao house was damaged,we do not know that this loss was attributable to the government because he only vaguely identified the two persons he believes were looking for him and whom he blames for having to vacate his home.thus,petitioner proof fails to establish his past persecution.
v liao evidence of a fear of persecution 
liao makes two contentions to establish his fear of persecution that he or his wife fear sterilization and that he fears detention in the form of the birth control study class.
in a conclusory fashion,the applicant asserts on appeal that his testimony and written evidence,along with the state department reports and newspaper articles,establish that he has a fear that he or his wife could face sterilization.as an initial matter,petitioner somewhat problematic testimony suggests he was concerned about his cousin being sterilized,not his wife or himself.second,in making this argument,liao does not refer to the only relevant background evidence concerning the birth control policy in his home province,that is to say,the state department report.that report indicates the birth control policy in the wenzhou area is ineffective and does not involve force.third,and most tellingly,liao does not explain why his wife,who is years old and had her children in the early,would be a potential target for sterilization.in light of the above,no basis exists to believe the applicant has a fear that either he or his wife will be sterilized.
turning now to the threat of detention,liao urges that this the form of the order to attend the study furnishes a basis for a fear of persecution.in reviewing this argument,the board of appeals observed that the only evidence liao offered regarding the nature of the study class was his own testimony.the board found this insufficient without any objective,corroborating proof to support it.importantly,the board rejected petitioner testimony,even though it found no basis in the record for finding liao to be not credible.since the board of appeals only engaged in a superficial discussion of this topic,we must look to the standard concerning when corroborating evidence of an applicant testimony is needed.
to begin,ins regulations state that,in appropriate circumstances,an applicant testimony,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a emphasis added accord diallo,at.in determining whether an applicant needs corroborating proof,the board will evaluate whether the alien testimony is believable,consistent,and sufficiently detailed to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis of the alien alleged fear.in re,wl,at bia,bia lexis see diallo,at citing in re with approval.further,in evaluating whether an applicant testimony meets this test,the board of appeals has carefully emphasized the importance of providing background evidence concerning general country conditions as a foundation for the applicant claim.when available,this type of general information allows the trier of fact to determine if an alien claim is plausible.in re,bia.the board additionally it is reasonable to do evidence of an applicant personal experiences pertaining to material facts which are central to the applicant claim and easily subject to verification.id.at.if an applicant fails to provide such evidence,an explanation should be given.id.
reviewing liao testimony in this context,it fails to establish an adequate foundation.while petitioner did refer to general background information in the record,the evidence he cites
