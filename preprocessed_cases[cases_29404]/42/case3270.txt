the government appeals the dismissal of xochitl garcia santana indictment for unlawful reentry in violation of.the district court determined that garcia prior removal order was constitutionally inadequate because garcia was denied her right to seek discretionary relief from removal.we affirm.in doing so,we hold that the generic definition of conspiracy under the immigration and nationality act ina,a u,includes proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
in,garcia pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit the crime of burglary in violation of.a nevada court found her guilty and sentenced her to a suspended term in county jail.
just over two weeks later,a deciding service officer of the immigration and naturalization service,proceeding under the summary removal procedures codified at b,ordered garcia removed as an undocumented alien convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to a a iii.the deciding service officer determined that garcia was subject to a final conviction of an aggravated felony as defined in a,and was ineligible for any relief from removal that the attorney general may grant in an exercise of discretion.she was removed.
in,garcia unlawfully reentered the united states.some years later,nevada law enforcement officials notified immigration and customs enforcement ice that they had booked garcia,a previously removed alien,into a local detention center.ice officials subsequently took garcia into custody at her home.
a grand jury indicted garcia on the charge that she was a previously removed alien found unlawfully in the united states,in violation of.she moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing that her previous removal order was fundamentally unfair.the deciding service officer erred,she asserted,in finding that her previous conviction qualified as an aggravated felony that rendered her ineligible for all discretionary relief.denying her an opportunity to seek such relief,she concluded,constituted a violation of due process.
the district court denied garcia motion,ruling that conspiracy to commit the crime of burglary under nevada law constituted an aggravated felony,so she did not qualify for any discretionary relief.upon reconsideration,however,the court struck its order denying garcia motion to dismiss for the constitutional inadequacy of her previous removal order.instead,the court granted garcia previous request upon the grounds contained in defendant motion.
this appeal followed.
the due process clause guarantees an individual charged with illegal reentry,the opportunity to challenge a prior removal that underlies the criminal charge,where the prior removal proceeding effectively eliminated the right of the alien to obtain judicial review.united states arias ordonez,cir citing united states mendoza lopez,d.section d codifies this principle.see id.it authorizes collateral attack on three conditions that the defendant exhausted available administrative remedies that the removal proceedings deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and that the removal order was fundamentally unfair.d.removal is fundamentally unfair,in turn,if a defendant due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying removal proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.united states ubaldo figueroa,cir first alteration in original quoting united states zarate martinez,cir.
an immigration official failure to advise an alien of his eligibility for relief from removal,including voluntary departure,violates his due process rights.see,united states melendez castro,cir per curiam united states lopez valasquez,cir en banc.an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is not eligible for voluntary departure in lieu of removal.see a united states vidal mendoza,cir.garcia prior removal order stated that she was ineligible for any relief,because she had previously been convicted of an aggravated felony.this appeal turns on the accuracy of that statement the government so recognizes,as it is challenging the grant of collateral relief only on the ground that garcia santana conviction for burglary conspiracy qualifies as an aggravated felony.
aggravated felony is defined to include a theft offense or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year,a g,or a conspiracy to commit an offense described in a,a u,which includes a theft offense or burglary.if garcia previous conviction for conspiracy to commit burglary does not qualify as an aggravated felony,then her prior removal order was constitutionally invalid and can not support charges under.if the conviction does qualify as an aggravated felony,then her prior removal order is proper and prosecution may proceed.
to determine whether an offense is an aggravated felony,we use the categorical and modified categorical approaches of taylor united states,d,and shepard united states,d.hernandez cruz holder,cir.under the categorical approach,we look not to the facts of the particular prior case,but instead to whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.moncrieffe holder,d quoting gonzales duenas alvarez,d.the generic definition of an offense is determined by the contemporary usage of the term.taylor,at.a state offense is a categorical match with a generic federal offense only if a conviction of the state offense necessarily involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.moncrieffe.at some alterations in original quoting shepard united states,d plurality opinion.that is,an offense is an aggravated felony if the full range of conduct covered by the state criminal statute falls within the meaning of the relevant definition of an aggravated felony.ngaeth mukasey,cir per curiam quoting penuliar mukasey,cir.by contrast,where the state statute of conviction sweeps more broadly than the generic crime,a conviction under the law can not count as an aggravated felony,even if the defendant actually committed the offense in its generic form.descamps united states,d.
nevada law defines a conspiracy as an agreement between two or more persons for an unlawful purpose.bolden state,quoting doyle state,overruled on other grounds by kacsmarek state,see also.conviction of a conspiracy in nevada requires no proof that any overt act was done in pursuance of such unlawful conspiracy or combination.
for reasons we shall explain shortly,we are convinced that,applying the methodology prescribed by the supreme court for defining generic offenses for categorical purposes,the generic federal definition of conspiracy,codified at a u,conditions conviction on performance of an overt act in pursuit of the conspiratorial objective because nevada conspiracy statute criminalizes a broader range of conduct than the properly determined generic definition of conspiracy,garcia conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony 
c ontemporary usage of a term governs its generic definition under the categorical approach.taylor,at.to identify that contemporary usage,we survey the definitions codified in state and federal statutes,adopted by the model penal code mpc,and endorsed by scholarly commentary.see,united states esparza herrera,cir per curiam.
i.the generic definition of an offense roughly correspond s to the definitions of the offense in a majority of the states criminal codes.taylor,at.a survey of state conspiracy statutes reveals that the vast majority demand an overt act to sustain conviction.by our count,states do so if the district of columbia,guam,puerto rico,and the virgin islands are included,then the tally rises to forty of jurisdictions 
such a great predominance of jurisdictions is more than sufficient to establish the generic federal definition of a crime.we have held the agreement of,or even,jurisdictions qualifies as sufficient consensus to establish the generic definition of a crime.see estrada espinoza mukasey,cir en banc referring to the agreement of states as the vast majority of states,overruled on other grounds by united states aguila montes de oca,cir en banc esparza herrera,at per curiam.here,the even more widespread agreement among
