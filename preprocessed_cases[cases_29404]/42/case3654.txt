factual and procedural background 
factual background 
the bia found baghdasaryan to be credible.accordingly,we must accept baghdasaryan testimony as true.see kalubi ashcroft,cir testimony must be accepted as true in the absence of an explicit adverse credibility finding.
in armenia,baghdasaryan operated a small business making and distributing audio tapes from his home.in september,baghdasaryan moved his business to a store in a local market owned by general hakopian,a general at the ministry of defense,who later became a deputy of the national assembly.the market was similar to a swap meet,with hundreds of vendors selling items in a large area.baghdasaryan obtained the proper permit to sell his goods,paid tax on his sales,and remitted rent to general hakopian for use of his space in the market.the record does not show whether general hakopian was entitled to keep the entire amount of rent payments for himself.
one month later,samvel hakopian samvel,general hakopian nephew,and several other men came to baghdasaryan store and demanded per month on behalf of the general,in addition to rent.baghdasaryan refused to pay and filed a written complaint against general hakopian with a local judge.when baghdasaryan received a second visit from samvel demanding money on general hakopian behalf,he followed up on his judicial complaint.shortly thereafter,baghdasaryan was arrested and fined by the tax authority for working without a license that no other vendor was required to have.baghdasaryan could only operate his business if he paid a monthly surcharge to the tax authority.baghdasaryan eventually received the license after paying a bribe.
after he was arrested and fined,baghdasaryan began organizing the other business owners in the market to fight against general hakopian corruption.in february,baghdasaryan and one hundred other business owners organized a rally to publicize the bribes exacted by general hakopian,which they believed the government sanctioned.a few days later,four individuals representing themselves as criminal investigators entered baghdasaryan store and conducted a search without a warrant.allegedly,the criminal investigators received a complaint that baghdasaryan was selling illegal items,but they failed to find any contraband in the store.around the same time,baghdasaryan began receiving phone calls threatening dire consequences if he did not withdraw his complaint against general hakopian.
during this time,the business owners also went on strike for two days.after the strike,general hakopian became very angry and told baghdasaryan that he knew baghdasaryan had organized the strike.general hakopian demanded that baghdasaryan either stop his organizing activities or face further problems.fearing harm to his family and himself,baghdasaryan started paying the monthly bribe and did so for several years.
baghdasaryan wife,hamsik aznavuryan,and their two children were eligible under the lautenberg amendment to seek asylum in the united states baghdasaryan sent his wife and children to safety in the united states in february,and then resumed his organizing activities.baghdasaryan scheduled another rally for february.several days before this rally took place,militia men forcibly took baghdasaryan from his home in the early hours of the morning without a warrant.the militia detained baghdasaryan for twenty days without charge.during his detention,baghdasaryan was beaten.during the beating,the chief of the criminal section told him that he must behave normally and that he was defaming and raising his head against the deputy of the national assembly,general hakopian.the beating only stopped when baghdasaryan agreed to stop opposing general hakopian and exposing his corruption.
when baghdasaryan returned home from jail,his mother informed him that she had received phone calls from people associated with general hakopian.the callers knew the address of baghdasaryan family in the united states and threatened to harm his family if baghdasaryan did not behave calmly.soon thereafter,baghdasaryan had an emotional breakdown,which required him to stay in the hospital for two months.
in may,baghdasaryan left armenia and attempted to join his family in the united states by traveling through south america.this attempt failed,and he returned to armenia three months later,in august.when baghdasaryan returned,two individuals from the armenian national security service met him and told him that it would be much better if you went back from where you just came from 
ii.procedural history 
baghdasaryan entered the united states using a fraudulent visa on october.on october,the immigration and naturalization service ins served baghdasaryan with a notice to appear.on january,baghdasaryan appeared before the ij and did not concede removability.baghdasaryan submitted an application for asylum and withholding of removal based on political opinion.he also requested relief under cat.after the merits hearing,the ij issued an oral decision finding baghdasaryan not credible and alternatively held that he had not established a nexus to a protected ground.the ij denied all forms of relief.
baghdasaryan appealed to the bia.the bia reversed the ij adverse credibility determination,but nevertheless dismissed the appeal for failure to establish a nexus to a protected ground.the bia found very little indication that the armenian government was imputing any political opinion to baghdasaryan and that baghdasaryan was merely the victim of criminal misconduct.the bia also affirmed the ij denial of relief under cat.baghdasaryan timely appealed.
standard of review 
because the bia conducted a de novo review of the ij decision,our review is limited to the bia decision except to the extent that the ij opinion is expressly adopted by the bia.hosseini gonzales,cir.we typically review the bia asylum and withholding of removal determinations under the substantial evidence standard see sinha holder,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,the bia determinations will be upheld if the decision is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.zhao mukasey,cir quoting abebe gonzales,cir en banc.reversal,however,is appropriate when the evidence in the record compels a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the bia decision is incorrect.id.
discussion 
i.the bia conclusion that baghdasaryan was ineligible for asylum is not supported by substantial evidence
