the united states citizenship and immigration services agency may revoke its previous approval of a visa petition at any time for good and sufficient cause.we must determine whether the enactment of j altered the agency revocation authority.we hold that it did not.because the agency decision is otherwise free of legal error and supported by substantial evidence,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants.
factual and procedural history 
plaintiff tricia herrera is a citizen of the philippines.in march,she began working in the philippines as the vice president of marketing for a philippine company,plaintiff jugendstil.at the time,jugendstil manufactured furniture and provided interior design services to clients in various countries,including the united states.jugendstil sought to transfer herrera to its united states branch office and filed an petition for nonimmigrant work in classification petition on her behalf.an approved petition allows an alien who has worked for an international company abroad to work temporarily in the united states for that same company or a legally related entity in a capacity that is managerial or executive.a l see also brazil quality stones,chertoff,cir discussing different types of l petitions see generally statutory provisions governing the admission of nonimmigrants l regulations governing l petitions.in march,the agency approved jugendstil petition on behalf of herrera,for a period of one year.herrera moved to the united states and began working at jugendstil united states branch office.the agency later approved two extensions of the petition a extension valid through march,and a extension valid through march.see l regulation governing extensions of l petitions.
in,jugendstil filed an immigrant petition for alien worker petition on herrera behalf,under a f and b c.those statutory provisions allow an employer to file an petition on behalf of an alien who,among other things,seeks to work for the company in a capacity that is managerial or executive.b c see also a a b defining the terms managerial capacity and executive capacity.the agency approved the petition in november.
in february,herrera filed an application to adjust status to legal permanent resident application under a.on april,an officer at the san francisco district office interviewed herrera regarding her application.the interviewing officer took handwritten notes,which were not provided to herrera at the time but eventually were added to the administrative record.in the interview,herrera explained that,beginning at some point in,her employer primarily provided interior design services and either did not manufacture furniture at all or did very little furniture manufacturing the interviewer requested certain documentation from herrera,which she provided two months later.
on march,the interviewing officer sent an internal referral memorandum to the california service center csc.the memorandum concluded that herrera role in the company was neither managerial nor executive and recommended that the csc revoke its prior approval of the petition.because it was an internal memorandum,the agency did not send plaintiffs a copy.
on april,herrera sent a notice to the csc that she had left her employer and accepted a new position as marketing manager with bay area bumpers,an affiliate of jugendstil.her notice stated that she wished to take advantage of the recently enacted provision codified at j portability provision.
on july,the csc issued a notice of intent to revoke its previous approval of herrera petition,pursuant to and.the statutory provision states that t he secretary of homeland security may,at any time,for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,revoke the approval of any petition approved by him under section of this title.the notice of intent to revoke explained that herrera did not meet the approval requirements for an petition because,as revealed by her statements in the interview,her job duties were not executive or managerial as required by statute.in particular,the notice mentioned the small size of jugendstil only seven employees and the nature of herrera job duties which included visits to client sites.the notice afforded herrera days to offer evidence and argument in rebuttal.
herrera responded with a letter from jugendstil and copies of jugendstil quarterly wage reports.the csc was unpersuaded and,on november,it revoked its previous approval of the petition.the revocation notice rested on the same reasons stated in the notice of intent to revoke the small number of employees and herrera of her job duties in.the revocation notice concluded that the evidence clearly demonstrate s that herrera duties were not and are not managerial or supervisory.
the next day,the csc denied herrera application.because herrera was no longer the beneficiary of an approved petition,she did not meet the requirements for approval of her application.see a i listing the requirements for approval of an application.plaintiffs do not challenge that downstream decision here they challenge only the agency revocation of its previous approval of the petition 
plaintiffs appealed the revocation to the administrative appeals office aao.the aao denied the appeal in a,written decision.the aao concluded that the evidence submitted at the time of the original petition was insufficient to establish eligibility because of the small number of employees and because of the aao determination that herrera primary function was not supervision of other employees.additionally,the aao concluded that the evidence of her role at the time of the interview was also insufficient to establish eligibility for approval of the petition.
plaintiffs filed this action in federal district court in,seeking review of the agency action under.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants,and plaintiffs timely appeal.

discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the agency lacked the authority to revoke its previous approval of the petition because herrera met the requirements of the portability provision and that,in any event,the agency revocation was legally erroneous and not supported by substantial evidence.we review the arguments in turn.
