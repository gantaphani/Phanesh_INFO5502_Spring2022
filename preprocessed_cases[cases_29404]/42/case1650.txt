the petitioner,mackentoch saintha saintha,was admitted to this country as a refugee and was subsequently granted lawful permanent resident status.when later convicted of an aggravated felony and placed into removal proceedings,saintha sought relief pursuant to article of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the cat,and under section of the immigration and nationality act the ina,codified at c.an immigration judge ij found saintha entitled to deferral of removal under the cat,but ineligible for adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility under the ina.on review,the board of immigration appeals bia found insufficient evidence to sustain the cat claim,but agreed with the ij that saintha was ineligible for the relief he sought under the ina.saintha petition asks us to review both bia determinations.for the reasons that follow,we dismiss the portion of saintha petition requesting relief under the cat for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to a c,and we deny the petition as to saintha requests for adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility under the ina.
saintha,along with his family,fled his native haiti in to escape political violence.he was subsequently admitted to the united states as a refugee pursuant to.in october,he sought and was granted an adjustment to lawful permanent resident lpr status under section a of the ina,a,retroactive to his admission date.after multiple convictions for petty larceny,saintha was convicted of robbery and sentenced to fifteen years confinement as a result of this aggravated felony conviction,the government charged him with removability under a a iii.see id.any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.
in the ensuing removal proceedings,saintha sought deferral of removal pursuant to the implementing regulations of the cat.see c,a,b.to be entitled to deferral of removal,the applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.an act is not torture for cat purposes unless it is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.a.
saintha argued at his removal hearing that,if he were returned to haiti,he would more likely than not be tortured with the acquiescence of the haitian government in retribution for the involvement of his stepfather,edy lorisme,in the political party organisation populaire de opb in support of saintha claim,lorisme testified that his sister was beaten and killed in because of her affiliation with opb.saintha and lorisme also both testified to an instance in when lorisme political opponents came to the family home in the early hours of the morning and ordered lorisme outside.according to saintha,lorisme did not leave the house and the group dispersed without further incident.after this episode,however,lorisme sought and obtained refugee status for himself and his family,and they fled haiti for the united states.
saintha and lorisme further testified that their friends and relatives continued to be victimized by politically motivated violence after their departure.they explained that shortly after the family arrival to the united states,a friend and political ally and his wife were killed in haiti in retaliation for their political activities.they also alleged that lorisme political enemies forced lorisme into hiding when he visited haiti in,and that these enemies subsequently burned saintha grandmother to death.shortly after lorisme return to the united states,the family learned that a cousin of saintha had also been killed.although unaware of the details of the cousin death,saintha and lorisme insisted that she was killed for her political beliefs.
as to the haitian government involvement,lorisme testified that he did not know what power the haitian police have to protect his son,and that the police did not protect anyone.saintha submitted as additional evidence the state department country report on human rights practices in haiti.the report indicated that there was widespread political corruption in haiti,that prison conditions were substandard,and that the haitian police were guilty of human rights violations and did little to protect haitian citizens.
during the removal proceedings,saintha also sought relief in the form of an adjustment of status under a,and in conjunction with that adjustment,a waiver of inadmissibility under c.saintha sought such relief because,though he had previously been granted lpr status,the imminent removal order would strip him of such status and with it the consequent right to remain legally in the united states indefinitely as a lawful permanent resident.see p.furthermore,even if he were granted deferral of removal under the cat,he still would not have regained his permanent resident status.see d.such deferral,if granted,would also be subject to termination in the future if an immigration judge determined that it was no longer likely that saintha would be tortured in the country to which he would be removed.see id.in light of these limits to cat relief,saintha therefore sought to adjust a second time to lpr status under a in order to remain in the united states permanently.his multiple criminal convictions,however,rendered him inadmissible,and therefore ineligible for adjustment of status.see a b any alien convicted of or more offenses,regardless of whether the conviction was in a single trial or whether the offenses arose from a single scheme of misconduct and regardless of whether the offenses involved moral turpitude,for which the aggregate sentences to confinement were years or more is inadmissible.accordingly,he was unable to adjust his status absent a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility,pursuant to c,from either the secretary of security or the attorney general.
on april,the ij found saintha removable as charged.the ij then granted his request for deferral of removal under the cat,but found him ineligible for an adjustment to lpr status and a waiver of inadmissibility under the ina.these rulings prevented saintha from being immediately removed to haiti,but left open that possibility in the future should the country conditions improve.both saintha and the government appealed their respective unfavorable rulings to the bia.
in an opinion issued november,the bia reversed the ij decision finding saintha eligible for relief under the cat,but affirmed the ij decision as to saintha request for adjustment of status and waiver of inadmissibility.regarding saintha cat claim,the bia found no clear error in the ij findings of fact that the haitian government and lorisme enemies would have the ability to learn of saintha return to haiti and that it was more likely than not that lorisme enemies would seek to torture saintha.the bia nevertheless denied the claim,finding that,upon considering the record in its totality there is insufficient evidence that the haitian government would acquiesce in saintha torture.
as to saintha requests for relief under the ina,the bia found that under the plain language of a a refugee who has already acquired lpr status is precluded from subsequently to lpr status.inasmuch as saintha could not seek adjustment of status,he was likewise ineligible to seek a waiver of inadmissibility under c.saintha filed a timely appeal and obtained a temporary stay of removal on january.
saintha first argues that the bia erred in finding insufficient evidence to conclude that the haitian government would likely acquiesce in his torture,and in finding him ineligible for deferral of removal under the cat as a result.before we reach the merits of that argument,however,we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider saintha claim.the government contends that we do not,asserting that because saintha is removable by reason of an aggravated felony conviction and has not,in its view,raised a constitutional claim or question of law,the ina precludes judicial review of his claim.we consider the issue de novo.see rux republic of sudan,cir.
courts generally do not have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal against aliens charged with removability by reason of having committed aggravated felonies.see a c a a iii.because saintha has conceded that he was convicted of an offense that constituted an aggravated felony,we would ordinarily be without jurisdiction to consider his claims.the real id act real id,however,provides a limited exception to this jurisdictional bar,a a iii,stat,codified in part at a d.section a d of the act allows for review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.
this court has previously recognized the narrow scope of this exception.see higuit gonzales,cir holding that real id confers upon courts of appeals a narrowly circumscribed jurisdiction to resolve constitutional claims or questions of law.we have held,consonant with the other circuit courts of appeal,that even after the passage of real id,we still lack jurisdiction to review factual determinations of the bia.see jean gonzales,cir conteh gonzales,cir this proscription extends to review of the bia factual findings as to credibility,evidentiary weight,and satisfaction of a correctly framed burden of proof.see also,at,available at wl legislative history of the real id act explaining that t he purpose of the real id act is to permit judicial review over those issues that were historically reviewable on and questions,not discretionary or factual questions.thus,before we can reach the merits of saintha arguments,we must first decide the threshold question of whether his petition raises a constitutional claim or a question of law such that the real id exception applies,or instead raises only factual questions,stripping us of our jurisdiction over the petition.
saintha petition seeks review of the bia rejection of his cat claim.as noted above,the bia found it probable that the enemies of saintha stepfather would seek to torture saintha upon his return to haiti.the bia further found,however,that upon considering the record in its totality there is insufficient evidence for us to conclude that it is more likely than not that the haitian government would acquiesce in his torture.the crux of the jurisdictional question here,then,is whether this bia determination with respect to haitian government acquiescence is properly characterized as factual or legal in nature.
saintha wisely does not argue that his challenge raises a constitutional claim or a pure question of law.rather,he asserts that this case presents a mixed question of law and fact,and that we retain jurisdiction as to the legal component of that question.see,at,available at wl when a court is presented with a mixed question of law and fact,the court should analyze it to the extent there are legal elements,but should not review any factual elements.the government predictably disagrees with that characterization of the bia determination.saintha claim,the government asserts,does not concern a question of law because such questions,for real id purposes,include only the narrow category of issues regarding statutory construction instead,the government reasons,saintha claim is merely an attempt to circumvent section a c jurisdictional bar by inviting this c ourt to reweigh the evidence relevant to a bia factual determination.respondent br.at.
although we have never addressed the precise question of our jurisdiction to review,id,an aggravated felon petition challenging a bia determination regarding government acquiescence in torture for cat purposes,we do not have to look far to find compelling guidance as to the appropriate analytical framework.this court has previously concluded that bia factual determinations include those which we would review,if we were to have jurisdiction,under the substantial evidence standard see menghesha gonzales,cir referring to the substantial evidence standard as the extremely deferential standard of review applicable to bia factual determinations.see also haoua gonzales,cir same.that is,we can look to the standard of review we would apply if we were to have jurisdiction to inform whether a given bia determination is factual or legal in nature.
the legislative history of the real id act confirms precisely this point 
factual questions include those questions that courts would review under the substantial evidence or b b codified as b b standard,reversing only when a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude that the decision below was erroneous.
at,available at wl.combining our precedent,as bolstered by the legislative history,with the a d proscription,we conclude that bia determinations that we would ordinarily review under the substantial evidence standard are necessarily factual in nature,and therefore beyond our jurisdiction to review when the petitioner has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
the question of jurisdiction here,then,turns on whether the bia determination as to haitian government acquiescence would ordinarily be reviewed for substantial evidence.our precedent declares that it would be.see dankam gonzales,cir we review the denial of relief under the cat for substantial evidence.haoua,at applying the substantial evidence standard of review to a bia finding concerning the likelihood that the petitioner would suffer torture at the government consent or acquiescence.because we review determinations regarding governmental acquiescence for substantial evidence,and because we only apply that standard to factual determinations,the bia cat determination here is properly characterized as factual,not legal,in nature,see also dragenice gonzales,cir referring to the ij conclusion that the evidence did not establish a likelihood of torture as a factual determination.section a c of the real id act prohibits our review of such factual determinations of the bia,and we are thus unable to review saintha petition on the merits.
notwithstanding this conclusion,dictated by our precedent,saintha repackages his primary argument in various ways in an attempt to create a reviewable legal question where there is none.for example,saintha professes to challenge the bia interpretation of the term acquiescence,claiming that the bia fail ed to recognize the inherent difference between a government that can not control torture by private actors and a government that acquiesces by turning a blind eye toward such conduct.reply br.at.as saintha acknowledges,however,the bia properly concluded that willful blindness could constitute acquiescence,but ultimately rejected his claim because the evidence did not demonstrate that the haitian government would likely remain willfully blind to his risk of torture.see petitioner br.at.in actuality,then,saintha is asking us to reach the merits of his cat claim and reweigh the evidence as to the bia acquiescence determination not,as he claims,presenting the legal question of the proper interpretation of acquiescence.
saintha next attempts to craft a question of law by suggesting that the bia did not afford the appropriate deference to the facts as determined by the ij.saintha later admits,however,that the bia cited the appropriate legal standards in its decision,and he points to no specific language in the bia opinion where those standards were misapplied.his argument,in substance,is simply that the bia did not show the appropriate deference to the ij by disagreeing with the ij determination.this argument too,then,devolves into another circuitous attack on the bia factual determination regarding acquiescence,over which,as we have already concluded,we lack jurisdiction.
saintha finally seeks to create a justiciable question by arguing that the bia misapplied its own precedent with respect to evaluating saintha risk of torture.reply br.at.rather than identifying bia precedent that would mandate a different conclusion in his own case,however,saintha only posits vaguely that the bia should be required to distinguish his case from prior bia decisions.again,because saintha does not point to any standard that the bia misapplied,this argument would have us reweigh the evidence in saintha case as compared to the we
