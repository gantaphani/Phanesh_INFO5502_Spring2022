the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed an order denying david wachira ngarurih request for asylum but granting voluntary departure.within the time permitted for appeal and shortly before the period for voluntary departure expired,ngarurih filed this petition for review.applying the narrow standards of review prescribed by congress in the immigration statute,we conclude that the bia denial of asylum is neither manifestly contrary to law nor an abuse of discretion.we further conclude that the statute does not permit a court of appeals to alter the period allowed by the bia for voluntary departure,either by reinstating or staying the departure period.accordingly,the petition for review is denied.
ngarurih is a native and citizen of kenya who entered the united states in may on a nonimmigrant student visa.ngarurih filed an application for asylum in may,alleging that he had been persecuted by the kenyan government due to his criticisms of president daniel arap moi and his government tea farming policies.
ngarurih began farming tea on a portion of his father land in the early.the kenyan government owned the tea plants and licensed the right to cultivate them.under the license,tea farmers were required to maintain their plantations in accordance with instructions issued by the kenya tea development authority ktda farmers could neither increase nor decrease the number of tea plants they cultivated without ktda approval.failure to comply with the conditions of the license could result in a fine,imprisonment,or both.
licensed farmers were required to sell their tea to the ktda,which marketed the tea internationally.although the ktda sold tea on the international market for shillings per kilogram,it paid tea farmers only shillings per kilogram.this payment typically was inadequate to cover the costs of production,so that tea farmers were almost always in debt.
in,ngarurih and some friends publicly protested the ktda policies and announced that they would no longer sell their tea to the ktda.soon other farmers began discussing a widespread boycott of the ktda.ngarurih then organized a march to the local ktda tea processing factory to demand an accounting for the excess profits that had been withheld from farmers.as a result of the boycott that ngarurih organized,tea production in kenya central province slowed dramatically 
on july,ngarurih organized a march to take the farmers protest to local government officials in the central province.some thirty thousand people joined this march.ngarurih spoke to the crowd,denouncing the ktda policies and the moi government failure to address the needs of poor farmers.the district commissioner heard the farmers protests and asked that a committee present him written demands.among the farmers demands were that the district tea committee be dissolved,that certain licenses and taxes be eliminated,and that the ktda decentralize management of factories and increase monthly payments to farmers.
a few days after the july march,security officers escorted ngarurih to the home of the district commissioner.according to ngarurih,the district commissioner offered him a bribe to call off the boycott of the ktda.ngarurih refused the offer.shortly after this incident,president moi issued a statement warning those inciting the farmers to end the boycott or face dire consequences.concerned for his safety,ngarurih went into hiding.after hearing that other tea farmers were being arrested,ngarurih surrendered to district authorities in early august.
ngarurih testified that three officers took him from his cell at the local police station,handcuffed and blindfolded him,and drove him to a wooded area,where they demanded that he name the other leaders of the boycott.under threat of execution,ngarurih refused to identify the other leaders.the officers then took ngarurih to a prison,where ngarurih was stripped of his clothes and placed in a dark cement cell.the cell had no light,no windows,and no toilet.for one week,prison officials flooded the cell with cold water at irregular intervals.the water level rose and fell,often rising to the level of ngarurih chest.ngarurih could not eat or sleep,nor was he allowed contact with other people.during this period,ngarurih experienced hallucinations in which he saw himself separate from his own body,floating in another part of the cell.prison officials moved ngarurih into a dry solitary confinement cell,where he remained for several months 
after being relocated to the jail in his home district,ngarurih was tried on a charge of treason.the local magistrate dismissed the charge for lack of evidence and ordered ngarurih released.local authorities immediately charged ngarurih with breach of the peace.the magistrate offered to release ngarurih if he would post a bond of one million shillings and agree to refrain from political activity for one year.under the magistrate conditions,ngarurih could not meet with more than three kenyans at a time or leave his home district without permission.ngarurih would have to report to local police officials every other week.ngarurih agreed to these conditions,and other tea farmers raised the money pledging their land titles as security to satisfy the bond.thus,after about eight months of detention,ngarurih was released from custody in early april.
rather than face another confrontation with the government,ngarurih decided to leave kenya.with the help of three peace corps volunteers in his district,ngarurih obtained a student visa to enter the united states in may.ngarurih attended gregory college in oklahoma,where he played basketball and earned an associate degree in business.ngarurih later earned a degree in international business management from the university of san francisco.
ngarurih returned to kenya in june after learning that his younger brother ngarurih had reared from been jailed.njoka had pled guilty to two counts of defiling a girl under the age of fourteen and sentenced to eight years in prison with hard labor and six strokes of the cane for each count.once ngarurih arrived in his village,he wrote to the trial court to obtain njoka file the court granted ngarurih request and sent him the records.ngarurih hired an attorney to challenge njoka conviction,and he traveled to other villages to investigate the facts of the case.ngarurih efforts were ultimately successful his brother conviction was reversed and his case remanded for a new trial.ngarurih personally posted a bond to secure njoka release from prison.several days after njoka release,ngarurih returned to the united states in august.
ngarurih student visa was set to expire in.not wanting to return to kenya,ngarurih filed an initial application for asylum and withholding of removal based on past persecution by the moi government.the immigration and naturalization service ins commenced removal proceedings ngarurih conceded that he was removable and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.ngarurih asserted that he should be deemed a refugee based on his past persecution.in addition,ngarurih asserted that he had a fear of future persecution because president moi remained in power,kenyan authorities continued to employ torture tactics,and ngarurih would likely come to these authorities attention as an outspoken political opponent.
the immigration judge ij found that ngarurih had been subject to past persecution in kenya,but she denied the request for asylum because ngarurih return to kenya in demonstrated that he was willing to return to his native country and that he could be involved in public as a criminal reprisal by the kenyan government.although the ij denied ngarurih claims for asylum and withholding of removal,she granted voluntary departure,giving ngarurih thirty days to leave the united states at his own expense and without further government action.ngarurih appealed the ij order to the bia,which affirmed the ij disposition of ngarurih claims.
the bia concluded that ngarurih return to kenya in constituted a fundamental change in circumstances that diminishe d his claim that he feared persecution in kenya likewise,the bia concluded that ngarurih return to kenya diminished his claim that he was entitled to asylum based upon the severity of his past persecution.thus,the bia affirmed the ij resolution of ngarurih asylum claim and granted ngarurih permission to depart the united states voluntarily.according to the bia order,ngarurih had thirty days from the date of entry of the order or any extension granted by the district director to depart the united states.the order further provided that ngarurih failure to depart within that period would result in his being removed,fined,and ineligible from certain forms of relief for a period of ten years.shortly before that voluntary departure period expired,ngarurih filed this petition for review.
the immigration and nationality act authorizes the attorney general,in his discretion,to confer asylum on any refugee.b.a refugee is any person who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,the home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.an applicant for asylum may qualify as a refugee either because he suffered past persecution or because he has a fear of future persecution.b.under either standard,the applicant bears the burden of demonstrating eligibility for asylum.a gonahasa ins,cir.
an applicant shall be found to be a refugee on the basis of past persecution if the applicant can establish that he or she has suffered persecution in the past in the applicant country of nationality on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,and is unable or unwilling to return to,or avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country owing to such persecution.b.an applicant who demonstrates that he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a fear of persecution.id.this presumption may be rebutted if the immigration judge finds by the preponderance of evidence that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution or the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of his native country.b i.
without regard to past persecution,an applicant has a fear of persecution if he has a fear of persecution in his country of nationality on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country,and he is unable or unwilling to return to,or avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of such fear.b i.the fear of persecution standard involves objective and subjective components.an applicant may satisfy the subjective element by presenting candid,credible,and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.chen ins,cir internal quotations omitted.the objective element requires a showing of specific,concrete facts that would lead a reasonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution.bia,cir.
we must uphold the bia determination that ngarurih is ineligible for asylum unless that determination is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d.considering the record as a whole,we ask whether the bia ruling is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence,and we will reverse the bia decision only if ngarurih presented evidence that was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.ins,d.see also rusu ins,cir gonahasa,at,at.
where,as here,the bia did not adopt the ij opinion but offered its own reasons for denying relief,we review the bia order rather than the ij ruling.see rusu,at,at.contrary to ngarurih assertion,the bia order adequately discloses the grounds upon which it denied ngarurih requests for relief.see sec chenery.
the bia first concluded that ngarurih voluntary return to kenya in undermined his claim to have a fear of persecution.citing b i,the bia reasoned that although ngarurih past persecution established a presumption of fear of persecution,the evidence of ngarurih stay in kenya without incident constituted evidence of a changed circumstance that rebutted the presumption.more generally,the bia analogized ngarurih return to kenya to a case in which an asylum applicant leaves the united states without first obtaining advance parole in such a case,the applicant would be deemed to have abandoned his asylum application.see a 
ngarurih testified that he returned to kenya in when he learned that his younger brother had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for rape.suspecting that his brother had been falsely accused,ngarurih left the united states to assist in the criminal appeal.when he arrived back in his home village,ngarurih wrote a letter to the trial court,bearing his own signature,requesting his brother file.after retaining an attorney to prosecute the appeal,ngarurih traveled to other villages to investigate the facts of his brother case.once his brother conviction was reversed,ngarurih posted the bond that secured his brother release from prison.
ngarurih presence in kenya was known by his family,other tea farmers who sought to persuade him to run for parliament,and government officials.indeed,ngarurih stated that he was approached by a police officer who said,so you back we know you back and do worry,we be watching you.thus,despite his efforts to maintain a low profile,ngarurih undertook activities that placed him in direct contact with government officials,seeking the protection of kenya laws.yet there is no evidence that ngarurih suffered any mistreatment at the hands of the kenyan government during his stay in.
these facts,found by the ij and established by ngarurih own testimony,support the bia conclusion that ngarurih return to kenya in constituted a fundamental change in circumstances sufficient to rebut the presumption raised by the fact of past persecution that ngarurih had a fear of future persecution.the question for the bia was not whether ngarurih had a fear of persecution when he returned to kenya in.the pertinent question is whether ngarurih qualified as a refugee a person unable or unwilling to return to his home country due to a fear of the time he applied for asylum.there is perhaps no evidence more relevant to this question than what happened or did not happen to ngarurih when he actually returned to kenya in.
while one could argue that the factfinder could have reached a different conclusion,it is not our task to reweigh the evidence and determine which of the competing views is more compelling.it is instead to ensure that substantial evidence supports the bia judgment.gonahasa,at.considering the record as a whole,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the bia denial of ngarurih application for asylum thus,we can not say that the bia ruling is manifestly contrary to law or an abuse of discretion.see b d.
the bia further ruled that ngarurih return to kenya in undermined his claim to humanitarian asylum.even in the absence of a fear of persecution,an immigration judge has discretion to grant asylum to an applicant who demonstrates compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution or that there is a reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country.b iii.see also krastev ins,cir describing asylum conferred under this regulation as humanitarian asylum.
we have construed this exception narrowly,stating that humanitarian asylum is available only in the rare case where past persecution is so severe that it would be inhumane to return the alien even in the absence of any risk of future persecution.gonahasa,at quoting vaduva ins,cir.accord toptchev ins,cir krastev,at.in short,e ligibility based on severity of persecution alone is reserved for the most atrocious abuse.gonahasa,at.accord bucur ins,cir describing the humanitarian asylum regulation as designed for the case of the german jews,the victims of the chinese cultural revolution,survivors of the cambodian genocide,and a few other such extreme cases.
the bia concluded that ngarurih return to kenya in return made for the purpose of assisting in his brother appeal in kenya a willing return that undermined his present claim to be unwilling to return to kenya based on his past persecution.while we have no doubt that ngarurih felt a need to help his brother through legal processes,that fact does not answer the question whether the circumstances were so objectively compelling as to render ngarurih return to kenya unwilling.after reviewing the entire record,and considering the particular facts of ngarurih return,we can not say that the bia conclusion was manifestly contrary to law or an abuse of discretion.see b d.
even if the bia erred in finding ngarurih willing to return to kenya,that error was harmless ngarurih as it not compare in severity to the kinds of persecution for which the humanitarian asylum regulation was designed.the seminal case on humanitarian asylum involved a native of china who testified that both he and his family suffered persecution for several years during the cultural revolution.matter of chen,bia.when chen was only eight years old,his father,a christian minister,became a target of the red guards.id.the red guards ransacked his house,put him in prison,and dragged him through the streets more than fifty times over several months.id.during a bible burning in,chen father was pushed into a bonfire and badly burned.id.chen,still only a child,was put on house arrest for six months when he cried,red guards kicked and bit him and deprived him of food.matter of chen,at.although chen was ultimately allowed to attend school,his persecution did not stop.on different occasions,chen was pelted with rocks,denied medical care,and exiled to rural villages for.id.even though the regime had changed such that chen could not demonstrate a fear of persecution,the bia granted chen humanitarian asylum.matter of chen,at.
at about the same time that ngarurih was being jailed and tortured for his political opposition in kenya,david daada gonahasa was suffering similar mistreatment in uganda.after organizing rallies in opposition to the ruling party,gonahasa was seized by military intelligence officers,stripped,beaten,cut on his arms by bayonets,and confined in a small cell.gonahasa,at.he later learned that government officers had visited his home,roughed up his wife,and threatened to kill him.id.on these facts,we concluded in dicta that gonahasa was not entitled to humanitarian asylum because his past persecution was simply not severe enough to warrant such relief.gonahasa,at.
we later denied humanitarian asylum to constantin rusu,a native romanian who was persecuted by the ceausescu regime for organizing a transcendental meditation group.rusu,at.rusu alleged that he was interrogated and assaulted on multiple occasions by the romanian secret police the securitate and that on one occasion,they tortured him by removing his teeth with pliers and a screwdriver.id.we concluded that although the persecution he suffered was horrible,it is not of the scale warranting a grant of asylum.rusu,at.
we have reviewed the entire record in this case and conclude that ngarurih past persecution was no more severe than the persecution suffered by gonahasa and rusu,and not nearly as severe as the persecution suffered by chen.even if ngarurih were unwilling to return to his home country,he can not establish past persecution severe enough to warrant relief under b iii.thus,we can not say that the bia denial of humanitarian asylum in this case is manifestly contrary to law or an abuse of discretion.see b d.
having concluded that the evidence in the record does not compel the granting of asylum,we address ngarurih alternative request to restore his opportunity to depart the united states voluntarily.both the ij and the bia granted ngarurih voluntary departure.this relief was available for thirty days after the bia order was filed,and that period has long since expired.relying upon our decision in ramsay ins,cir,ngarurih urges us to reinstate the bia award of voluntary departure by restarting the period granted by the bia order.
ngarurih request implicates the illegal immigration and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,an enactment well known for restricting judicial review of discretionary decisions in immigration matters.see reno,d noting that many provisions of iirira are aimed at protecting the executive discretion from the,that can fairly be said to be the theme of the legislation before iirira,it was unsettled whether courts of appeals had authority to reinstate voluntary departures.some courts held that absent a specific grant of authority to award such relief,it was left to the attorney general alone to decide whether to extend the period for voluntary departure.see,nkacoang ins,cir castaneda ins,cir alsheweikh ins,cir.the ninth circuit,on the other hand,held that reinstatement of voluntary departure was automatic upon affirmance of a final order of deportation.ins,cir en banc.other courts held that nothing prevented a court of appeals from reinstating voluntary departure,under certain limited circumstances,in the course of considering a final order of deportation.kaczmarczyk ins,cir ins,cir.
we held in ramsay that a court of appeals could reinstate a voluntary departure in two circumstances where the ins is wielding its discretion to withhold voluntary departure to deter applicants from seeking judicial review of bia decisions,or where the ins does not suggest it will present the district director with any other reason for refusing the reinstatement.at alteration in original.where a court concluded that voluntary departure should be reinstated,the period for voluntary departure granted by the bia begins to run anew from the date the mandate issues from the court of appeals reinstating the voluntary departure.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,we relied in part upon the first circuit analysis in,which offered two basic justifications for reinstating voluntary departure.first,the court expressed the concern that the ins might employ voluntary departure orders to keep aliens from prosecuting appeals from final orders of deportation.see,at.accord kaczmarczyk,at.this concern reflected the fact that under immigration law,a court of appeals lost jurisdiction of a petition for review once the alien left the united states.see c.second,the court noted that nothing in the law deprives the court of appeals of the legal power to order the appropriate remedy,at.
the enactment of iirira undercut both of these justifications for reinstatement of voluntary departure.perhaps most fundamentally,iirira repealed former and replaced it with a new judicial review provision,that does not purport to cut off appellate jurisdiction once an alien leaves the country.see moore ashcroft,cir noticeably absent from the permanent rules is any similar language removing federal review jurisdiction in the event an alien departs or is removed.thus,an alien may continue to prosecute his appeal of a final order of removal even after he departs the united states,and there is no longer any prospect that the government could manipulate voluntary departure orders to deprive an alien of judicial review.see ashcroft,cir stating that congress desire to expedite removal by voluntary assent now does not conflict with the alien ability to pursue a petition for review tapia garcia ins,cir stating that deportation no longer forecloses judicial review.
iirira also changed the rules concerning judicial review of voluntary departure decisions.section specifically precludes review of a denial of a request for voluntary departure.f.likewise,the general judicial review provision precludes review of orders granting voluntary departure 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section h,i,or of this title 
id.a b emphasis added.thus,it is no longer true that nothing in the law deprives the court of appeals of the legal power to reinstate voluntary departure,at.these intervening changes in the statute make ramsay inapplicable to this,or any,permanent rules case 
this conclusion is consistent with congress expressed intention to preserve the exercise of executive discretion in granting voluntary departures.under current law,the decision whether to permit an alien to depart the united states voluntarily is committed entirely to the discretion of the attorney general.b.by regulation,the attorney general has permitted the ins district director,in the exercise of discretion,to extend the period initially prescribed for voluntary departure.as the ninth circuit has recognized,it is executive rather than judicial officers who decide when an alien must depart,and n either the statute nor the regulations give courts any designated role in this process of setting the deadline for departure,at.
the bia gave ngarurih thirty days from the date of its february,depart the country voluntarily.that deadline has long since passed,and ngarurih has even exhausted the maximum period permitted by the statute.see b providing that the period for voluntary departure can not exceed sixty days.for us to specify in effect a different period starting more than a year later would contravene congress scheme and invade the executive branch authority to specify a deadline for voluntary departure,at.because the statute plainly precludes our review of the bia order granting voluntary departure,we hold that a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to entertain a request to reinstate voluntary departure 
relying upon recent decisions from the sixth and ninth circuits,ngarurih further contends that we should exercise our general equitable power,pursuant to,to stay the period specified for voluntary departure.these decisions hold that an alien may obtain a stay of his voluntary departure period if he meets the requirements for a stay of removal.see nwakanma ashcroft,cir per curiam el himri ashcroft,cir.having concluded,however,that a b precludes judicial review of the bia order granting voluntary departure,we can not evade this statutory directive by resort to equity.indeed,since we lack jurisdiction over the bia order granting voluntary departure,there is nothing before us to stay.
it is not enough to say that we have jurisdiction over the order of removal.that fact gives us only the prerogative to apply equitable remedies to that order.thus,we are free to grant a stay of removal when the alien satisfies the statutory requirements for such relief.see f.we are not free to grant additional relief with respect to a voluntary departure order that even the dissent agrees is not properly before us.
rather than explain how a court can operate on an order not properly before it,the dissent argues that appellate review is meaningless for asylum applicants who are forced to return to countries where they may be killed or imprisoned and thus unable to return to the united states if we determine that they are entitled to asylum.post at.see also nwakanma,at,at berzon,concurring.this is not so much an objection to review procedures concerning voluntary departure as it is an objection to the procedures for appellate review of immigration cases generally.absent a stay of removal,an alien in an ordinary immigration appeal may be removed to his home country even before his appeal is decided.even in that case,there is a possibility that the alien will face persecution in the home country rendering him unable to return should he prevail on appeal.the remedy for this concern is the stay of removal,which we retain the option to grant in any case where the alien satisfies the statutory requirements.this relief is just as available to the alien who sought voluntary departure as it is to the alien who did not.
in essence,the dissent contends that an alien with a meritorious asylum claim should be permitted to take the benefits of voluntary departure without bearing any of the costs.see post at arguing that we should not force aliens with possibly meritorious asylum appeals to choose between preserving certain benefits made available under the ina and their safety.this contention can not be reconciled with the voluntary departure scheme described in the statute.this statutory scheme reveals congress intention to offer an alien a specific from the ordinary bars on subsequent return for a quick departure at no cost to the government.so important was the aspect of this bargain that congress provided for certain penalties to attach when an alien overstays his voluntary departure period.see d.thus,an alien considering voluntary departure must decide whether an exemption from the ordinary bars on subsequent relief is worth the cost of returning to the home country within the period specified.having made his election,however,the alien takes all the benefits and all the burdens of the statute together 
under the dissent view,an alien could request voluntary departure,overstay the specified period and deprive the government of a quick departure,wait out the appellate review process,and then demand the full benefits of voluntary departure.this scenario is not at all what congress intended,and it is not for us to recalibrate the scheme that congress created in the manner that the dissent now urges.the voluntary departure order is not properly before us,as congress has insulated that order from appellate review.we are not at liberty to apply equitable remedies to that order,certainly not in a way that contravenes the statutory scheme.ins pangilinan,d stating that courts of equity can no more disregard statutory requirements and provisions than can courts of law 
congress has reposed broad authority in the attorney general to adjudicate individual immigration cases,and congress has expressly protected this executive discretion by restricting appellate jurisdiction and constructing deferential standards of review.the bia ruled that ngarurih claim to asylum was not powerful enough to warrant the extraordinary relief of asylum.that ruling is supported by substantial evidence and applicable law,and it must be affirmed.the bia also granted ngarurih thirty days within which to depart the united states voluntarily.because congress left it to executive officers,not this court,to determine how long an alien should have to exercise voluntary departure,we can not reinstate voluntary departure or otherwise alter the bia order in this respect.for all of these reasons,the petition for review is hereby 
gregory,circuit judge,concurring in part and dissenting in part 
for the reasons that follow,i concur in the majority conclusion that substantial evidence supports the board of immigration appeal bia denial of ngarurih application for asylum and that the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira divests us of jurisdiction to reinstate ngarurih voluntary departure period.however,while i believe that ngagurih is not entitled to a stay of voluntary departure,i respectfully dissent from the majority far reaching,and in my view unnecessary,conclusion that the iirira precludes us from exercising our general equitable powers to stay or toll a voluntary departure period.as the sixth and ninth circuits,i do not believe that the iirira precludes us from staying a voluntary departure period pending our resolution of an asylum appeal provided that the merits of such appeal justify a stay of the removal order.nwakanma ashcroft,cir per curiam holding that the iirira does not bar federal appellate courts from staying a voluntary departure period and thus concluding that a stay of voluntary departure pending appellate review should be available on the same showing that authorizes a stay of removal pending review el himri ashcroft,cir w e hold that this court retains equitable jurisdiction to stay the voluntary departure period and that the standards for obtaining a stay of removal shall also apply to stays of voluntary departure.without the ability to maintain the status quo by staying a voluntary departure period,our review of asylum appeals will be rendered meaningless because the alien will already have been subjected to the harm from which our decision is suppo
