every day along the southwest border,previously deported aliens lacking entry documents are arrested,detained,and charged with illegal reentry.once convicted,they serve a term of imprisonment,and then are again deported.the numbers are so great that federal prosecutors in these border states began to resort to an efficient means of securing a conviction a plea agreement that binds the government and the defendant,but not the district judge.
the government secures the benefit of a streamlined process that minimizes the burden on its prosecutorial resources.it need not go before a grand jury to secure an indictment battle motions,including collateral attacks on the underlying deportation prosecute a jury trial or oppose an appeal.the defendant,in turn,waives constitutional and other rights and agrees to a term of incarceration and,often,a term of supervised release ordinarily discouraged by the sentencing guidelines.what is the incentive for the defendant to take this deal the prosecutor binds his office to recommend a downward departure in the offense level now advised by the guidelines,and to present a united front in favor of a reduced sentence to the district judge.if the judge does not accept this sentence,the defendant may walk away from his guilty plea,and proceedings will begin anew.
paul gabriel morales heredia morales was one such defendant.but in morales case,the orderly and efficient process did not play out as intended.the government extended the promise of a reduced prison term with one hand and took it away with the other.the prosecutor recommendation of a prison term rang hollow as he repeatedly and unnecessarily emphasized morales criminal history,adding for good measure his personal opinion that defendant history communicates a consistent disregard for both the criminal and immigration laws of the united states.morales counsel timely objected and sought specific performance of the plea agreement.the district judge denied this relief on the irrelevant ground that the prosecutor statements did not influence him.we conclude that morales is entitled to relief,and we vacate his sentence and remand for further proceedings before a different judge.
the immigration and nationality act of imposed felony criminal liability for a previously deported alien who subsequently entered,attempted to enter,or was found in the united states.see,stat,codified as amended at.for several decades thereafter,this provision like the immigration laws as a whole was lightly enforced along the southwest border.aliens were seldom charged with illegal reentry under.a few were charged with misdemeanor improper entry,and most were simply deported without criminal sanctions in,out of more than undocumented aliens apprehended in the southern district of california,only were charged with a felony of any kind,and many of those charges arose from conduct other than the unlawful entry itself 
in the mid,the federal government increased its enforcement of the immigration laws in the southwest,rapidly expanding the resources available to the border patrol since then,the united states has prosecuted increasing numbers of aliens for illegal reentry under and improper entry under.in,the department of justice initiated fewer than illegal reentry prosecutions by,that number had grown to more than in each of the past five years,the federal government has initiated over illegal reentry prosecutions,including an high of last year these prosecutions constitute a significant proportion of the federal criminal docket.more than a third of all federal defendants in the ninth circuit are charged with immigration offenses 
plea programs are both a response to and a cause of this rise in prosecutions.in,the united states attorney office for the southern district of california began to offer accelerated plea deals to defendants charged with illegal reentry under b,who faced increased sentencing exposure because their previous removal had occurred subsequent to a felony conviction.see united states estrada plata,cir.defendants were required to waive indictment,plead guilty at the initial appearance,waive appeal of their sentence,and stipulate to a sentence,below the applicable range of the guidelines.see id.in,the same united states attorney office began to offer pleas to all illegal reentry defendants with substantial criminal histories,requiring defendants to plead guilty under a and to stipulate to the entry of an order of removal that would result in their deportation immediately upon their release from prison making widespread use of pleas,the southern district of california prosecuted more felony immigration offenses in than it had in the previous ten years combined in other border districts where the federal government had committed additional resources to enforcement,programs also emerged,and prosecutions rapidly increased 
in,congress endorsed pleas by directing the united states sentencing commission to promulgate a policy statement authorizing reduced sentences for participants in programs.see prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today protect act of,m b,stat.the sentencing guidelines now permit the district court to adjust the offense level of a defendant who participates in a program not more than four levels downward.see.the courts of appeals eventually split over whether a district court could impose a sentence for a defendant in a district without a program on the basis of an unwarranted sentencing disparity with a defendant who had committed the same offense.compare,united states gonzalez zotelo,cir,with united states rodriguez,cir.the department of justice responded in by establishing uniform eligibility requirements for pleas for all defendants across the country.see memorandum for all united states attorneys from james cole,deputy attorney general,at,hereinafter cole memorandum,available at.
while the details may vary from district to district,all programs are based on the premise that a defendant who promptly agrees to participate in such a program saves the government significant and scarce resources that can be used to prosecute other defendants,and has demonstrated an acceptance of responsibility above and beyond what is already taken into account by the adjustments contained in the sentencing guidelines.id.at.according to the department of justice,plea agreements have become an important nationwide tool to address the compelling,and otherwise potentially intractable,resource issue posed by the number of immigration crimes on the federal criminal docket id.
because the object of a plea is to achieve greater than normal efficiency through a lighter than normal sentence,the parties in a case typically encourage the district court to impose the negotiated sentence.federal rule of criminal procedure provides them with the means to do so.rule governs the process for entering pleas and sets forth requirements for the district court acceptance of a guilty plea.see.a,b.it also recognizes three distinct types of plea agreements.see.c.the government may agree to dismiss or not to bring further charges to make a sentencing recommendation that does not bind the district court or to make a sentencing recommendation that binds the district court if the court accepts the agreement.id.
specifically,rule c c authorizes the government to agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case,or that a particular provision of the sentencing guidelines or sentencing factor does or does not apply.the agreement is contingent until the court accepts it.freeman united states,d plurality opinion.when presented with a rule c c agreement,the district court may accept the agreement,reject the agreement,or wait to consider the agreement until it has reviewed the presentence report.see.c.if the district court ultimately accepts the agreement,it must impose the recommended sentence.see.c.if it ultimately rejects the agreement,it must give the defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea.see.c 
while rule c c may apply to any offense,it plays a particularly important role in illegal reentry cases.the department of justice requires that united states attorneys retain the discretion to compel defendants who wish to participate in programs to enter into rule c c agreements.see cole memorandum at.in some judicial districts,defendants are in fact required to enter into rule c c agreements in,the central district of california began to offer a rule c c agreement as its standard plea offer to most defendants charged with illegal reentry as far as we are aware,this policy remains in effect.in the central district and throughout the ninth circuit,rule c c agreements are a common way of resolving illegal reentry prosecutions.see,united states gonzalez,app x cir united states soto lopez,app x cir united states martinez,app x cir united states cruz gramajo,cir.
within this larger context,enter or,reenter morales.like so many others,morales,a native and citizen of mexico,has repeatedly crossed the southwest border into the united states without authorization.after being removed from the united states in,and,he again entered without inspection in.immigration authorities apprehended him.the government charged morales in an information with illegal reentry,in violation of.the government also provided notice that one of morales prior removals had occurred subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction,thereby increasing the statutory maximum penalty from two years imprisonment to twenty years imprisonment.see b.
in january,morales and the government executed a written plea agreement under rule c c.morales agreed to plead guilty to the sole count of illegal reentry in the information at the earliest opportunity provided by the government.he agreed to waive his constitutional rights to be indicted by a grand jury,to contest his guilt at trial,to confront adverse witnesses,to testify on his own behalf,and to avoid.morales also promised not to pursue any affirmative defenses,to seek the suppression of evidence under the fourth or fifth amendments,or to pursue any other pretrial motions.finally,he agreed to waive his right to appeal his conviction.morales acknowledged that his conviction might subject him to deportation.
in return,the united states promised to recommend a particular sentence that would bind the district court unless it rejected the agreement.the parties agreed on the applicable provisions of the united states sentencing guidelines.they also agreed that morales total offense level under the guidelines was nine.this included the reduction advised by the guidelines for participation in a program.see.the parties agreed that the probation office could prepare a pre sentence report psr that addressed only morales criminal history,and that no further factual development of the record was required.the parties acknowledged that the district court would calculate morales criminal history category.the intersection of the criminal history category with morales stipulated total offense level would determine his sentencing range under the guidelines.see ch,pt.
morales and the united states agreed that the appropriate disposition of the case was a prison term equal to the low end of the applicable guidelines range,plus the statutory maximum of three years of supervised release,see b.they did so despite the provision of the sentencing guidelines advising against supervised release in cases involving aliens who,like morales,would likely be deported after incarceration.see.c.morales acknowledged that the conditions of his supervised release would include compliance with the immigration laws of the united states.
both parties agreed to recommend that the district court impose the stipulated sentence.they also agreed that they would not seek,argue,or suggest in any way,either orally or in writing,that any other specific offense characteristics,adjustments,departures,or variances in sentence be imposed,or that the court impose a sentence other than what has been stipulated to by the parties herein.both reserved the right to supplement the facts by supplying the court with relevant information,as well as the right to correct any and all factual misstatements relating to the district court guidelines calculations.if the district court imposed the stipulated sentence,both parties waived the right to appeal any part of the sentence except the court calculation of morales criminal history category.
the district court provisionally accepted morales plea of guilty,while cautioning morales that it reserved the right to reject the rule c c plea agreement and that,if it did so,morales would have an opportunity to withdraw his plea.several weeks later,morales probation officer disclosed his presentence report to the parties and the district court.the psr detailed morales criminal history,which included felony convictions for burglary,receiving stolen property,and the sale of heroin,as well as a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.the probation officer determined that morales had three criminal history points,resulting in a criminal history category of ii and,with the downward adjustment in offense level,an applicable guidelines range of six to twelve months in prison.the probation officer recommended that the district court impose the stipulated sentence of six months imprisonment plus three years of supervised release.
the government then filed its sentencing position in the district court.the government recommended a sentence of six months imprisonment and a period of supervised release,as it had agreed to do.it then went on to detail d efendant year criminal history already identified in the psr.discussing morales conviction for possession of heroin for sale,the government noted that morales had been arrested with balloons filled with over grams of heroin.addressing morales domestic violence conviction,the government explained that morales allegedly choked the mother of his daughter,grabbed her face,shook her vigorously,shoved her against a wall,and cut her lip.morales criminal history,the government argued,communicates a consistent disregard for both the criminal and immigration laws of the united states.
furthermore,though it argued that a sentence was reasonable,the government also noted that defendant demonstrated propensity for drug trafficking and offenses is also concerning,and an appropriate sentence is warranted to ensure sufficient deterrence to future criminal conduct.and,to support the recommended term of supervised release,the government stated that morales poses a danger to the community because his criminal history includes both drug trafficking and battery.
defense counsel promptly emailed the prosecutor to express his view that the government had breached the plea agreement by failing to recommend,in substance,a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range.counsel urged the government to withdraw its sentencing position and file a new one.the prosecutor denied breaching the agreement.shortly thereafter,the government filed a supplemental sentencing position without withdrawing the original.in its supplemental memorandum,the government corrected two technical errors and reiterated its support for a month prison term and a period of supervised release.the government stated that it had consistently advocated for this sentence and that its prior memorandum had analyze d defendant criminal history because criminal history is a major component of any thorough sentencing analysis.
a few weeks later,the district court informed the parties that it would not accept the terms of the rule c c agreement and that morales therefore had the right to withdraw his guilty plea.defense counsel immediately moved for specific performance of the plea agreement,arguing that the government initial sentencing memorandum had breached it.at a hearing on the motion,the district court expressed its view that rule c c is a different kind of plea agreement,and that it retained discretion to reject the agreement irrespective of the government statements.defense counsel argued that the breach jurisprudence is no less applicable in the c c context than it is in any other plea agreement context.
the district court denied morales motion for specific performance of the plea agreement in a written order.it explained the government brief description of defendant criminal history and prior immigration violations had no effect on this court rejection of the rule c c plea.rather,it had determined that the stipulated sentence was inadequate on the basis of its independent review of the psr.the district court noted that all of the cases cited by defendant did not involve a rule c c plea.
four days later,at the sentencing hearing,morales declined to withdraw his guilty plea when given the opportunity to do so.the district court sentenced him to months of incarceration times longer than the stipulated prison term and three years of supervised release.the month prison term was equal to the high end of the guidelines range that would have applied without the downward adjustment for a plea.morales timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction to review morales sentence pursuant to a.because morales counsel objected to the government statements before the district court,we review de novo whether the government breached the plea agreement.united states whitney,cir.
c riminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas,not a system of trials.lafler cooper,d.in the vast majority of criminal cases,a prosecutor promise of less harsh treatment induces the defendant to waive his constitutional rights and admit guilt.plea bargaining is desirable because it conserves resources,encourages prompt and final resolution of criminal cases,helps avoid the corrosive impact of prolonged pretrial detention,and abates the risk to public safety caused by lengthy pretrial release.santobello new york,d.however,all of these considerations presuppose fairness in the plea bargaining process.id.at.accordingly,when the prosecutor makes a promise to the defendant,that promise must be fulfilled.id.at.the integrity of the criminal justice system depends upon the government strict compliance with the terms of the plea agreements into which it freely enters.see whitney,at.
plea agreements are essentially contracts.puckett united states,d.we enforce their literal terms,construing any ambiguities in the defendant favor.see united states franco lopez,cir.in interpreting the agreement and crafting an appropriate remedy for any breach,our task is to secure the benefits promised the defendant by the government in exchange for surrendering his right to trial.id.
the government breaches its agreement with the defendant if it promises to recommend a particular disposition of the case,and then either fails to recommend that disposition or recommends a different one.see,united states johnson,cir.see generally wayne lafave et,criminal procedure d ed.when it offers to recommend a specific sentence,the government induces the defendant to forfeit his constitutional rights in exchange for a united front.united states camarillo tello,cir.w hen the sentencing court hears that both sides believe a certain sentence is appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances,this is more persuasive than only the defendant arguing for that sentence t his united front is the defendant benefit of the bargain.id.
the government promise to recommend a particular disposition can be broken either explicitly or implicitly.see whitney,at.the government is under no obligation to make an recommendation enthusiastically.johnson,at.however,it may not superficially abide by its promise to recommend a particular sentence while also making statements that serve no practical purpose but to advocate for a harsher one.see whitney,at united states mondragon,cir johnson,at.that is,the government breaches its bargain with the defendant if it purports to make the promised recommendation while winking at the district court to impliedly request a different outcome.united states has no horses,cir.an implicit breach of the plea agreement occurs if,for example,the government agrees to recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable guidelines range,but then makes inflammatory comments about the defendant past offenses that do not provide the district judge with any new information or correct factual inaccuracies.whitney,at quoting mondragon,at.
as the district court observed,we have not previously applied the principles governing the breach of plea agreements to rule c c agreements the only logical conclusion,however,is that those principles apply with equal force in this context.our decisions in mondragon and whitney confirm that the government breached its agreement with morales by denying him the united front for which he bargained.the government statements in this case did at least as much to recommend a harsher than sentence as the statements that breached the plea agreements in mondragon and whitney.
in mondragon,the government promised the defendant that it would make no recommendation regarding the sentence.at.after defense counsel characterized the defendant previous crimes as petty,the district court asked the government whether it had any comment.id.the government pointed out in response that the defendant had frequently run from law enforcement,resisted arrest,and skipped court dates.see id.we rejected the government argument that its comments served the legitimate purpose of responding to the court question or correcting factual misstatements by opposing counsel.see id.at.because the prosecutor comments did not provide the district judge with any new information or correct any factual inaccuracies,but simply repeated information already contained in the psr,we concluded that the comments could have been made for only one purpose to influence the district court to impose a harsher sentence.id.by implicitly making a sentencing recommendation,the government breached the plea agreement.id.
in whitney,the government promised the defendant it would recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable guidelines range.see whitney,at.after defense counsel stated that the defendant was merely a nonviolent thief,and not a good thief,the government responded to rebut the claim,arguing that the defendant was in fact a good thief.id.at.as in mondragon,the prosecutor comments provided no new factual information to the district court.see id.at.we rejected as disingenuous the government argument that it was compelled to provide an argument to justify even its guideline sentence recommendation.id.at.the district court had given no indication that it was considering imposing a sentence lower than the government recommendation the defendant could not have requested a sentence under the terms of the plea agreement and the probation office recommended a sentence more than double the low end of the guidelines range.see id.at.we therefore concluded that the prosecutor critical comments could only have been intended to persuade the district court to impose a higher sentence than the government had promised to recommend,and not to guard against an unsolicited downward departure.id.
here,the parties agreed to recommend that morales receive a prison term equal to the low end of the applicable guidelines range plus a term of supervised release.the government breached its agreement,however,through its repeated and inflammatory references to morales criminal history in its sentencing memorandum.like mondragon and whitney,all of the aggravating factual information in this memorandum had already been provided to the district court in the psr.moreover,there was no reason to believe that the district court was considering imposing a sentence less harsh than the stipulated one.nor were the government statements made off the cuff or in response to commentary or argument by the defense.rather,given the opportunity to argue for the sentence it had promised to recommend,the government offered a series of prejudicial statements related to the seriousness of the defendant prior record.whitney,at.the central theme of the government sentencing position was that morales was a dangerous recidivist who had spent twenty years flouting the law and menacing others.whether intentional or not,the government breached the plea agreement by implicitly recommending a higher sentence than agreed upon.
we recognize that this case differs from whitney in a significant respect here,the government bound itself to recommend not only a guidelines sentence,but also a statutory maximum term of supervised release.this supervised release term is contrary to the guidelines,which provide that t he court ordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release when a defendant,like morales,is likely to be deported after imprisonment.c emphasis added.the government contends that the inflammatory material was properly included in the sentencing memorandum to support the recommended term of supervised release.we disagree.
as an initial matter,this does not appear to have been the government actual motivation for the offending statements,almost none of which appear in the portion of the sentencing memorandum that discusses supervised release.furthermore,while the government could permissibly make some factual reference to morales criminal history to justify the stipulated term of supervised release,the government offers no justification for the depth and tone of its discussion.that morales possessed balloons of heroin when arrested for selling drugs,and that his misdemeanor domestic violence conviction was for choking and shoving the mother of his infant daughter,are prejudicial details likelier to inflame than to provide information relevant to the imposition of supervised release.see b.and the prosecutor references to morales propensity for drug trafficking and consistent disregard for both the criminal and immigration laws of the united states are merely pejorative editorializing 
most important,the particular context of this plea agreement negates the government purported justification for its statements.morales was induced to enter into a plea by the offer of a binding sentencing recommendation resulting in a lower prison term than he would receive if he pleaded guilty later.to his detriment,morales stipulated to the term of supervised release even though he knew he would be deported following his release as the parties acknowledged in briefing and at oral argument,a term of supervised release is apparently a common provision of pleas in illegal reentry cases in the central district of california the government had no reason to call special attention to the ugliest aspects of morales past to justify what is,in these circumstances,a routine recommendation.
indeed,given the government promise of leniency,it is notable that its sentencing memorandum contained no mitigating information at all.rather,it emphasized that morales,a danger to the community,needed to be deterre d because of his year criminal history,his consistent disregard for the law,and his criminal propensity.the reader is left to wonder why the government believed a guidelines sentence was appropriate in the first place.accordingly,we conclude that,as a whole and in context,the government pejorative comments about morales criminal history and detailed descriptions of his prior offenses served no purpose but to argue for a harsher punishment than it had agreed to recommend.whitney,at.by implicitly advocating for a sentence other than the stipulated one,the government breached the plea agreement.
the government also breached its agreement with morales in a second,independent way.the government did not only agree to recommend a particular sentence,as in whitney,or to avoid recommending a sentence,as in mondragon.it also expressly promised in the plea agreement not to seek,argue,or suggest in any way that the district court impose a sentence other than what has been stipulated to by the parties herein.we enforce the literal terms of this promise and require the government strict compliance with it.see whitney,at franco lopez,at.
even if the inflammatory language in the government sentencing position had partially served a legitimate purpose,which it did not,it surely also suggest ed that the district court impose a harsher sentence.the government freely undertook a broad commitment to morales to avoid even the implication that a sentence other than the stipulated one might be appropriate.see webster third new international dictionary defining suggest as to mention as a possibility,put forward by implication,or propose as desirable or fitting.at a minimum,by characterizing morales as a dangerous criminal,the sentencing memorandum suggested in some way that a sentence other than six months in prison could be advisable.under this provision of the contract between morales and the government,it is irrelevant whether these statements also served another purpose.therefore,even if we did not conclude that the offending language had no practical purpose but to argue implicitly for a harsher than stipulated punishment,we would still conclude that the government breached the express terms of this plea agreement.
the government breach of the plea agreement was neither cured nor curable before the district court.
the government filed a supplemental sentencing position in the district court in response to defense counsel objection.this supplemental filing did not acknowledge,let alone rectify,the government previous errors.it merely corrected two clerical mistakes and argued that the government initial sentencing memorandum had properly analyze d morales criminal history to support the recommended term of supervised release.the government denial that it had breached the agreement did not restore the united front for which morales had bargained.
moreover,even if the government had acknowledged its error in its supplemental memorandum,doing so would not have cured the breach.only some breaches may be curable upon timely objection to the district court.puckett,at emphasis in original.for example,if the prosecution makes a mere slip of the tongue or typographical error,united states alcala sanchez,cir,or simply forg ets its commitment and is willing to adhere to the agreement,puckett,at,the prosecution may cure the inadvertent mistake by promptly discharging its obligations.but a breach like the one that occurred here can not be undone.once the prosecution has forcefully argued for a sentence other than the stipulated one and has denied the defendant a united front,one really can not calculate how the government error and breach may have affected the perceptions of the sentencing judge.alcala sanchez,at.that the district court claimed not to have been influenced by the government sentencing memorandum is simply irrelevant.camarillo tello,at accord santobello,at gunn ignacio,cir.
nor does morales decision not to withdraw his plea before his sentence was imposed cure the government breach morales bargained for the opportunity to withdraw his plea if the district court rejected the plea agreement despite the government support.to conclude that morales choice not to withdraw his plea somehow negates the breach would force morales to bear the burden of the government error.indeed,it would effectively license the government to violate rule c c agreements with impunity,as the defendant would be compelled either to accept the result of the proceedings infected by the breach or to risk proceeding to trial or attempting to negotiate a new agreement with no leverage.we decline to lessen the government duty of strict compliance in this manner.alcala sanchez,at.
we do not review the breach of a plea agreement for harmless error on appeal.see,mondragon,at.rather,automatic reversal is warranted when objection to the government breach of a plea agreement has been preserved.puckett,at citing santobello,at.furthermore,case law requires that any further proceedings occur before a different judge,even if we have no doubt that the first district judge treated the defendant fairly and impartially.alcala sanchez,at quoting united states johnson,cir accord whitney,at.once the district judge has seen or heard the offending words that denied the defendant the benefit of his bargain,any further proceedings before him would necessarily be tainted by the government breach.the only way to undo the damage is to reassign the case.
when the district court rejects a rule c c plea agreement after overruling the defendant objection to an alleged breach,the defendant may appeal the district cou
