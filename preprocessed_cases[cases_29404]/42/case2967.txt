feng ying zheng,a citizen of the people republic of china,claims she fears persecution if removed to china because of the country coercive population control policies.zheng seeks review of the board of immigration appeal bia final order affirming the immigration judge ij decision denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article iii of the convention against torture cat.because we find the bia erred by failing to consider significant evidence supporting zheng claim,we conclude the denial of relief was not supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we vacate the bia order of removal and remand for further proceedings.
zheng was born on march,in guantou village,lian jiang city,in the fujian province of china.she entered the united states without inspection on september.on may,zheng married chang qin lin.zheng and her husband presently have three united states citizen children a son,born january,and two daughters,born september,and july.zheng sister and brother live in new york both have been granted asylum based on china birth control policies.
on january,zheng filed an application for asylum.on july,the immigration and naturalization service,now the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement within the department of homeland security,commenced removal proceedings against zheng by issuing a notice to appear.the ij held an evidentiary hearing on zheng application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat on july.zheng,her husband,and her sister testified.
at the hearing,zheng testified she feared returning to china because she believes upon return she will be arrested immediately and either she or her husband will be forcibly sterilized because she had a second child when her first child was a boy.she testified she and her husband would like to have more children and do not practice any form of birth control.she testified she fears she will be subject to forced sterilization or abortion because of china family planning policies.zheng further testified her fear of returning to china is also based on the experiences of her sister,who,after becoming pregnant for the second time,was arrested and given an injection causing an abortion.zheng stated that prior to her departure from china she did not have problems with china birth control policy.
zheng sister,feng zhen zheng,also testified at the hearing.zheng sister testified she was also an applicant for asylum based on china birth control policy and had appeared before an immigration judge in new york in.the sister testified that when she was six months and seven days pregnant in china,she was forced to abort her second pregnancy and lost a female fetus on july,at lianjian hospital in lianjian city.she testified after she got pregnant she was hiding at her mother home in guantou,which is thirty minutes from lianjian hospital.someone reported her and she was arrested at her mother house by an officer from the birth planning office who then sent her to lianjian hospital to have an abortion.her first child was a boy.
the parties also submitted numerous documents concerning china population control policies,including the united states department of state country report on human rights practices in china,united states department of state profile of asylum claims and country conditions for china,march,report by the canadian government,and an april assessment on china prepared by the united kingdom.additionally,zheng submitted an affidavit of john shields aird,a specialist on demographic developments and population policy in china,who is also a retired demographer formerly employed at the bureau of census.aird affidavit refutes alleged misrepresentations concerning china coercive population control policy in department of state reports and documents issued by the canadian government.
the ij denied zheng application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat on july.the ij found zheng had not suffered past persecution in china.the ij further found zheng had a subjective fear of future persecution,but determined zheng fear of persecution was not objectively reasonable.because zheng failed to meet her burden to demonstrate her eligibility for asylum,the ij concluded zheng failed to establish her entitlement to withholding of removal.the ij also found zheng failed to meet her burden under the cat.
the ij found both zheng and her husband to be generally credible.additionally,the ij found zheng sister to be generally credible.however the ij stated she would not give great weight to the sister testimony.the following explanation was provided t his court did not have the sister asylum application before this court to determine the credibility of her own application,with respect to how it affects the respondent case.accordingly,the ij did not analyze zheng sister testimony concerning her forced abortion in determining whether zheng fear was objectively reasonable.
although the ij found zheng had a subjective fear of persecution in china,the ij concluded the documentation in the record does not objectively support this fear.in determining zheng fear was not objectively reasonable,the ij explained the current information in the record regarding china reflects that the forced coercive family planning policies are not being followed in fujian province and that fujian province is lax on enforcing family planning policies.the ij found zheng failed to also prove to the court that she would be persecuted because she has had two children born in the united states.the ij also found the respondent has failed to show that the threat of persecution exists countrywide,noting a ccording to the country information,there are clearly areas in china in which a person,who wants to have two or more children,even three or four children,can live and have that number of children.
in reaching its finding,the ij relied primarily on the uk assessment and the report by the canadian government.according to the uk assessment,f or differing reasons,most authorities agree that the fujian province is lax in implementing the birth control policies and t he authorities work by incentive schemes rather than coercion,with forced abortion and sterilization no longer tolerated,and efforts to increase the professionalism of family planning workers.the uk assessment also states in,there have been signs that the government is beginning to relax its policies in the cities and minorities in some rural areas are permitted to have four children.the report prepared by the canadian government similarly concludes t here is less effective enforcement of the policy in the fujian province than in other parts of china.
zheng appealed to the bia arguing the ij erred in finding zheng did not establish a well founded fear of future persecution.zheng also claimed the ij violated her due process rights to a full and fair hearing.the bia dismissed the appeal.the bia found no merit in zheng claims that her due process rights were violated.on the merits,the bia adopted the facts set forth by the ij and affirmed the ij determinations that zheng failed to establish eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.specifically,the bia found zheng failed to establish that she has suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground,or that she has a fear of persecution if returned to china to include as a result of their coercive population control policies because she has two united states citizen children.
we review the bia decision as the final decision of the agency.to the extent the bia adopted the findings or the reasoning of the ij,we also review the ij decision as part of the final agency action.falaja gonzales,cir citing ismail ashcroft,cir.we review the bia determination that zheng failed to establish she is eligible for asylum under a substantial evidence standard.lau may sui ashcroft,cir citing ashcroft,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,we will not overturn the bia decision unless we find,based on the evidence,no reasonable could arrive at the conclusion reached by the bia.id.quoting,at.
the immigration and nationality act provides the attorney general the discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee.b.a refugee is an alien unwilling to return to her home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a.congress has expanded the definition of refugee to include a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program.id.a b.such individuals shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.id.
zheng does not claim she has suffered past persecution,but claims she has a well founded fear of future persecution if removed to china based on china coercive population control policies.to establish a well founded fear of future persecution,zheng must show her fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.mwangi ashcroft,cir citing ins,d.subjectively,zheng must demonstrate with credible evidence that she genuinely fears persecution objectively,she must demonstrate through credible,direct,and specific evidence that a reasonable person in her position would fear persecution.id.citing feleke ins,cir.
we hold the bia determination that zheng failed to establish her fear of persecution was objectively reasonable is not supported by substantial evidence for two reasons.
first,we believe the ij erred by failing to consider zheng sister testimony about being forced to abort her second child in july and by relying instead on general reports that since enforcement of the policy has been lax in fujian.the fact that in fujian family planning authorities forced zheng sister to abort her second child when she was six months and seven days pregnant is specific,direct evidence demonstrating zheng fear is objectively reasonable.nyonzele ins,cir stating a cts of violence against an alien family members may demonstrate a fear of persecution citing ins,cir makonnen ins,cir holding acts of persecution against immediate family member with similar political views and active in similar political activities is relevant to show fear of persecution accord zhang gonzales,cir stating acts of violence committed against an applicant friends or family can establish fear of persecution quoting nagoulko ins,cir zhang ashcroft,cir noting treatment of similarly situated family members is highly indicative of persecution petitioner would encounter upon return.
although the ij found zheng sister testimony to be credible,the ij did not consider it in determining whether zheng fear was objectively reasonable,explaining t his court did not have the sister asylum application before this court to determine the credibility of her own application,with respect to how it affects the respondent case.we find the ij explanation for giving little weight to zheng sister testimony difficult to understand.if the ij heard the sister testimony and found her to be credible,it is unclear to us why the ij needed to consider separately the credibility of the sister asylum application in order to accept the sister testimony.
the government argues it was appropriate for the ij to rely on country reports in concluding zheng fear was not objectively reasonable.as the government notes,we have stated department of state country condition reports are persuasive authority for determining whether an has a fear of persecution.perinpanathan ins,cir citations omitted.however,as other courts have cautioned,use of such official report does not substitute for an analysis of the facts of each applicant individual circumstances.krastev ins,cir accord lin ashcroft,cir.by failing to consider zheng sister testimony about her forced abortion,which the ij found credible,the ij failed to analyze significant credible concrete evidence demonstrating zheng fear is objectively reasonable.
moreover,zheng sister testimony,and zheng fears,are corroborated by the state department reports.for example,the state department country report provides 
central government policy formally prohibits the use of force to compel persons to submit to abortion or sterilization however,intense pressure to meet family planning targets set by the government has resulted in documented instances in which local family planning officials have used coercion,including forced abortion and sterilization,to meet government goals.during an unauthorized pregnancy,a woman often is paid multiple visits by family planning workers and pressured to terminate the pregnancy.senior officials have stated repeatedly that the government made it a principle to ban coercion at any level.senior officials acknowledge that problems persist and insist on the government determination to address such problems 
according to the state department profile,i n there were credible reports that several women were forced to undergo abortion in fujian.additionally,under the section entitled actual implementation and practice,the uk assessment notes government officials have acknowledged that there have been instances of forced abortions and sterilisations sic,and there are anecdotal accounts of raids on rural villages by task forces rounding up women for forced sterilisation sic or abortion there are still,in,routine allegations of enforced sterilisations sic,particularly in rural areas,and regular of regulations.
we also believe the bia determination that zheng failed to demonstrate children born in the united states are treated the same as children born in china is not supported by substantial evidence because it fails to take into account the information provided by aird affidavit.in his affidavit,aird refutes the finding in the profile that children born to chinese nationals living abroad are not counted under china family planning rules.according to aird,
the agency admits that it can not cite an official source authorizing especially lenient treatment for the parents of children.there is no provision for such special treatment in any of the national or provincial policy regulations and directives that have been made public.the state department bases its argument on what it calls anecdotal information alleged statements by individual chinese in four chinese cities,mainly family planning officials.however,family planning officials in china,from the top leadership in the sfpc down to the local level,have an interest in giving a deceptively moderate impression of program enforcement in order to counter the adverse publicity generated by actual case histories of extreme punitive measures applied to particular chinese couples 
aird notes t he profile quotes a chengdu sichuan university graduate as saying that a married woman going abroad from her city can have a second child and return without penalty if one member of the couple gets an american graduate degree.according to aird,t his may be true in some cases,particularly because of chinese government concerns about the brain drain resulting from the failure of chinese graduate students to return home after the end of their training.aird states s uch exceptions,however,are not available to most chinese asylum seekers.aird affidavit includes several examples of statements from chinese officials indicating the policy applies to chinese couples living abroad.aird concludes the reason why the chinese family planning authorities attempt to enforce family planning rules on their nationals living abroad is that to ignore their violations would tend to undermine the enforcement of the rules in china.the chinese authorities can not afford to let rumors get about that couples of childbearing age can evade the limit by leaving the country illegally,having unauthorized children in foreign countries,and returning home without suffering the standard penalties.
