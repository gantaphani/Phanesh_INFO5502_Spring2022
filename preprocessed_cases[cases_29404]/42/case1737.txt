jesusita filipita garza garza appeals her sentence under a b i for transporting aliens unlawfully in this country for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.garza raises three issues on appeal whether the district court erred by imposing a reckless endangerment enhancement to her sentence under united states sentencing guidelines manual b whether the district court erred by entering judgment under a b i,which requires a financial gain motive,rather than a b ii,which does not and whether the district court erred by failing to reduce her sentence under b for an act committed other than for profit.we affirm the conviction and sentence but remand to the district court with instructions to correct the judgment to reflect that garza only pled guilty to,and was only convicted of,a violation of a a ii,with a maximum sentence as prescribed by a b ii,and to delete the reference to for commercial advantage or private financial gain from the judgment.
facts and proceedings below 
on february,garza drove an dodge pickup truck to the united states border patrol checkpoint located miles north of laredo,texas,on interstate.she was accompanied by two visible passengers her child and a friend.during primary inspection at the checkpoint,a border patrol canine alerted to the presence of hidden persons in the vehicle.the border patrol officers then referred the vehicle to the vehicle and cargo inspection system vacis,a large machine,which detected an object underneath the back seat of the pickup truck.border patrol officers searched the back seat and discovered two men who admitted to being mexican citizens illegally present in the united states.
garza was taken into custody and advised of her rights.she admitted to the officers that she knew that the aliens she was transporting were illegally in the united states.she claimed she had stopped at a gas station where the men had asked for a ride.garza went on to admit that she had agreed to give the men a ride past the border control checkpoint to a bus station but claimed that she had not discussed payment with the men and she did not expect to receive any compensation for transporting them.
the presentence report psr cited a statement by one of the aliens.according to the statement,garza told the men to get in the truck and hide underneath the back seat.both men squeezed while lying on their stomachs.garza child sat on top of the seat.the position was uncomfortable,warm,and limited mobility.they rode in this manner for approximately forty minutes.the probation officer opined in the psr that the aliens could have been seriously injured had garza been involved in an accident.
garza was indicted for transporting an alien unlawfully in this country within the united states for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain,under.garza consented to allow a magistrate judge to accept her guilty plea.at rearraignment,garza counsel informed the magistrate judge that garza was pleading guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement,but that garza had an agreement with the government to reserve the issue of financial gain for sentencing.the district court accepted garza guilty plea upon the recommendation of the magistrate judge and entered judgment.the judgment stated that garza had pled guilty under a b i to the offense of t ransporting an undocumented alien within the united states by means of a motor vehicle for commercial advantage or private financial gain.
the sentencing guidelines calculation proposed in the psr began with an offense level of pursuant to a applicable to the smuggling,transporting,or harboring of an unlawful alien.that level was increased to under the reckless endangerment enhancement of b,which applies i f the alien transporting offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.the level calculation was reduced to level for acceptance of responsibility under a b.ultimately,the psr recommended an offense level of with a criminal history category of ii resulting in a guidelines range of to months.
garza objected to the psr,arguing that the manner in which she transported the aliens did not warrant imposing a b enhancement.she renewed this objection at sentencing garza did not,in her objections to the psr or at sentencing,argue that the statute under which judgment was entered was improper or raise any other challenge to the calculation of her sentence under the guidelines.the district court overruled her objection to the b adjustment for reckless endangerment and sentenced garza to months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.this appeal followed.
on appeal,garza renews her objection to the enhancement under b.she also argues that because no financial gain motive was ever admitted or established,her conviction under a b i,which applies to offenses done for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain,was reversible error,and that the district court should have applied a reduction to garza guidelines calculation under b for offenses committed other than for profit.
ii.standard of review 
when the relevant objections are properly preserved,this court reviews a district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its factual determinations for clear error.united states villegas,cir per curiam.we review the legal sufficiency of a conviction de novo.see united states phillips,cir we review questions of law and application of statutes de novo.

iii.discussion 
whether the reckless endangerment enhancement was proper 
garza renews her contention,raised in her objections to the psr and at sentencing,that the district court erred when it determined that her offense qualified for a reckless endangerment enhancement under b.section b reads in relevant part 
if the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person,increase by levels,but if the resulting offense level is less than level,increase to level.
the district court concluded that the manner in which the aliens were on the floorboards,partially under the back seat and wedged between the front seat and the back seat,with a child sitting on top of the back a qualifying risk and applied the enhancement.in light of the court findings,the relevant test,and the extant case law,we find no reversible error in the district court construction of b.
on appeal,garza first contests the district court factual conclusion that the aliens positions in the vehicle would impede their ability to exit and increase their risk of injury.at sentencing,garza counsel referred the district court to a photograph of the aliens when they were found in the pickup truck and argued that the aliens positions were not dangerous b oth were on the floorboard s,with one also under the back seat,they were able to talk to the driver,and they could breathe.the district court did not dispute this description of the aliens positions,but concluded that the situation nevertheless appeared dangerous
