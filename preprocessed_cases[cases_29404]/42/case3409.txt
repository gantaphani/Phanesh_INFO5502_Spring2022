we address whether the department of homeland security has authority to terminate an alien asylum status,and conclude that it does not.the issue arises out of structural changes to our immigration system made when the department of homeland security assumed functions of the immigration and naturalization service.
petitioners,gurjeet singh nijjar and his wife,paramjit kaur nijjar,are natives and citizens of india.nijjar applied for asylum in,based on political persecution he claimed to have suffered in india from to,on account of his being a sikh and a supporter of khalistan.he claimed this persecution caused him to flee india in.the immigration and naturalization service granted his asylum application in.he brought his wife and son into the united states as derivative asylees in.
a few years later,in,our immigration and asylum system underwent a major restructuring.prior to,two agencies within the department of justice the immigration and naturalization service ins and the executive office of immigration review eoir handled asylum applications.on march,the ins ceased to exist most of its functions were transferred to a new department,the department of homeland security various agencies within the department of homeland security became responsible for the immigration functions previously administered by the ins.one of the new department of homeland security agencies,the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis administers asylum applications through its asylum officers the eoir,which remains an agency of the department of justice,also continues to administer asylum applications,through immigration judges 
on november,nijjar was notified that the ins although it no longer existed intended to terminate his asylum status for fraud.he had stated in his asylum application under the name gurjeet singh nijjar that he was persecuted in india from to.ins information,however,indicate sic that you were in the united states continuously from september under the name gurjit singh.the letter instructed nijjar to attend a termination interview with an asylum officer of the no longer existing ins on january,to respond to the allegation of fraud.
at nijjar request,the interview was rescheduled three times,but he neither appeared nor offered an excuse for not appearing.on november,the uscis,of the department of homeland security,sent nijjar a termination notice,informing him that his asylum status had been terminated by the uscis no reason was given for the termination.enclosed with the termination notice was a notice to appear,form i,which placed nijjar in removal proceedings.the notice to appear scheduled a hearing before an immigration judge 
the problem that gives rise to this opinion is that nijjar termination notice,the written notification that his asylum status had been terminated,came from the uscis.he argues that the uscis,within the department of homeland security,did not have authority to terminate his asylum status,and that only the attorney general has such authority.nijjar moved to terminate the removal proceedings on the ground that his asylum status had not properly been terminated.the immigration judge concluded that she lacked jurisdiction to review an asylum officer termination of asylum status.since nijjar had no right to be in the united states except as an asylee,and asylum status had been terminated,she ordered him removed to india.the only basis for his wife and son being in the united states was as derivative asylees of nijjar,so they were also ordered removed.
on appeal,the board of immigration appeals agreed that the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction to review the asylum officer termination of nijjar asylum status.since the termination stood,the immigration judge order of removal was affirmed.gurjeet and paramjit nijjar petition for review.we have jurisdiction over the nijjars petitions under.
the oddities about the government stationery used for the several letters and forms sent to nijjar make the case something of a morass,if the words in these documents are taken literally.we assume for purposes of decision that the forms purporting to come from the defunct ins within the department of justice actually came from the uscis within the department of homeland security.we make this assumption because nothing else makes any sense.the communication that matters,the termination notice that terminated nijjar asylum status,is on the letterhead of an existing agency,uscis,department of homeland security.
there are two regulations addressing the termination of asylum status,and.the latter,a duplication of the former,was promulgated by the department of justice on february,one day before the ins ceased to exist,since with the creation of the department of homeland security,asylum would now be administered by agencies in two cabinet departments,instead of one the duplication of regulations was intended to be a temporary measure,interim in nature.nearly a decade later,however,the regulations governing asylum termination have not been substantively changed,and are identical to the regulation that existed when asylum was handled by agencies in just one cabinet department the ins and eoir in the department of justice.
the regulations provide that authority to terminate asylum is accorded to the same office that granted asylum.the regulations state an asylum officer of the uscis may terminate a grant of asylum if following an interview,the asylum officer determines that there is a showing of fraud in the alien application such that he or she was not eligible for asylum at the time it was granted.the regulations also state that when asylum status is terminated,the uscis shall initiate removal proceedings.and that is what was done with nijjar.the uscis placed him in removal proceedings after it terminated his asylum status.so far,all the procedural steps are in accord with the regulations.
during removal proceedings,the immigration judge held that she lacked jurisdiction to review the asylum officer termination of asylum status for fraud.that determination was based on the language in,which states that an asylum officer may terminate a grant of asylum,and on the absence of any regulation providing for review of such a termination by the immigration judge in removal proceedings or otherwise.the board of immigration appeals affirmed.the third circuit in bhargava attorney general,held that this view of jurisdiction was a correct interpretation of the regulation,because both the regulation and the statute are silent with respect to an immigration judge jurisdiction to review a termination of asylum by dhs.the fifth circuit in qureshi holder following bhargava,held that n either the ij nor the bia has authority to review uscis decision to terminate asylum,though the asylee may obtain review of questions of law but not fact underlying the termination qureshi in dictum also says that the alien may make a new application for asylum not addressed in qureshi is that this hypothetical second asylum application would ordinarily be quite aside from whatever negative implication the fraud determination would have on the applicant credibility in his second attempt to obtain asylum.
at this point,the answer to the question posed by this case is to deny the petition,citing bhargava and qureshi.but so far,all we have looked at are the regulations.we also have to ask where the asylum officer,of the uscis,of the department of homeland security,got its authority to terminate asylum status.and that is where we run into an insuperable problem.congress did not confer the authority to terminate asylum on the department of homeland security.congress conferred that authority exclusively on the department of justice.
congress expressly provided that the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general may grant asylum but the subsection governing termination of asylum is not parallel,and does not say that either cabinet department may terminate asylum.the termination of asylum subsection of the statute says that asylum may be terminated if the attorney general determines that any of several conditions are met 
fraud in the application is not mentioned explicitly,but is one of the additional limitations under which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum that the attorney general is authorized to establish by regulation it is difficult to imagine that congress left cabinet departments free to compete with each other and grab whatever authority they like.it is even more difficult to imagine that congress intended so important a determination as terminating asylum status for fraud to be an unreviewable decision,made by an officer below the level of,and without the independence of,an immigration judge,on the basis of an informal interview 
chevron and other forms of to the agency have no application here,because congress did not confer discretion on the department of homeland security to issue regulations or interpret the statute insofar as it addresses termination of asylum.congress said that termination of asylum is within the authority of the attorney general.true,the regulations issued by the department of justice say that the asylum officer may also terminate asylum,but the statute says otherwise.
we can not apply chevron deference when congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.congress spoke directly to the precise question of who can terminate asylum,making its intent clear the attorney general.that is,under chevron,indeed the end of the matter.when congress assigns authority to one cabinet department,that department is not free to reverse the congressional determination by assigning it to another 
a subsequent amendment of the statute makes congressional intent especially clear in this case.congress amended in the real id act,carefully distinguishing authority for grants from authority for terminations of asylum before the creation of the department of homeland security,the statute authorized only the attorney general to both grant and terminate asylum status then,in,effective retroactively to march,congress amended b,the provision for granting asylum.the amendment for granting asylum changed the attorney general to the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general,ratifying what the department of homeland security had been doing since though congress in this curative amendment conferred additional authority on the department of homeland security in several respects,it left authority to terminate asylum exclusively with the attorney general.the new law added the department of homeland security to subsection b,for granting,but not subsection c,for terminating,asylum.this termination section still confers authority only on the attorney general.
about all the government has to say regarding this issue of authority in its brief is that the regulation clearly authorizes the asylum officer to terminate asylum.indeed it does,but the government offers no reading of the statute that would authorize the department of homeland security to promulgate that regulation.at oral argument,the government offered two additional theories that what the department of homeland security can grant it implicitly can take away,and that the congressional failure to include the department of homeland security in subsection c was an oversight.
the first argument what we can give,we can take away is euphonious but not logical.popular songs are full of euphonious lyrics that make false statements,such as the beatles lyrics 
there nothing you can know that is known nothing you can see that is shown nowhere you can be that is where you meant to be 
we held in gorbach reno that t here is no general principle that what one can do,one can undo.there,congress conferred authority on the attorney general to give naturalization,but only on the district court to take it away here,congress conferred authority on both the attorney general and the department of homeland security to give asylum,but only on the attorney general to take it away.
the second argument amounts to a claim of scrivener error by congress,corrected by the regulation.the statutory language though,looks more like congressional reliance on our application of expressio unius est exclusio than a mistake.the amendment by the real id act carefully delineates exactly where to substitute the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general for the attorney general.illogicality can be evidence that congressional intent is contrary to the apparent plain meaning of the words but there is no logical problem with assigning power to grant asylum to two departments but the power to take it away to only one.w e begin with the understanding that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.w he statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.here,the statute is plain and not absurd.
in amalgamated transit union,where congress said an appeal could be taken not less than days after the order but at any time thereafter,we cured the illogical result caused by the scrivener error by reading less to mean more.here,if we could think of no reason why congress might have meant what it said in assigning authority to terminate asylum only to the attorney general,construction of the statute would present a closer question.but a sensible congressional purpose is obvious.grants of asylum are presumably far more frequent than terminations so granting two departments authority and leeway to structure these grants addresses a volume problem terminations of asylum are grave enough so that congress might sensibly intend just what it did,assigning the authority to the attorney general,where a neutral arbiter,the immigration judge,rather than an asylum officer,would make the decision,and where the decision would be subject to appeal to the board of immigration appeals,rather than being unappealable.that would be consistent with the procedure for when an asylum officer denies an application for asylum status,and must refer the denied application for asylum to an immigration judge for de novo consideration subject to appeal reading the statute to mean what it says makes termination procedure parallel to denial procedure.reading the statute as the government urges not only conflicts with its plain meaning but also creates an unfair anomaly.we can think of no reason why congress would give an alien more procedural protection when his asylum application is denied in the first instance,than when his asylum status is granted but subsequently taken away.
congress has provided one way for asylum status to terminate through the attorney general.there is no statutory authorization for a second way.the regulations pursuant to which the department of homeland security terminates asylum status,a and a,are ultra vires because the governing statute,c,confers that authority exclusively on the attorney general.
the nijjars petitions for review of the bia orders of removal are granted,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
