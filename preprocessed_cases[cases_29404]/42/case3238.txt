yongguo lai,a native and citizen of china,petitions for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia dismissed lai appeal from an immigration judge ij decision denying his application for asylum,withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture cat.the bia relied on the ij finding that lai claim of persecution and torture on account of his christian religion was not credible.the ij based her adverse credibility ruling,in relevant part,on lai testimony during that contained information the ij found to be missing from and inconsistent with lai initial written application and direct testimony,and uncorroborated in one respect.we hold that the bia adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we grant the petition and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
background 
in a written statement included with his initial application,lai explained that he started practicing christianity a few years after he lost his job as a factory worker in fushun,china.he began going to church with his wife,and was baptized on december.according to lai statement,on july,police searched and detained lai as he arrived at a gathering place in a suburb of fushun to listen to a korean preacher.lai and other church members were taken to a police station,where lai was beaten and interrogated twice.lai wife paid for him to be released after days,at which time the police told lai that he could not mention his detention to anyone and that he could no longer participate in such illegal gatherings.lai also had to regularly report to the police station after his release.in his statement,lai also wrote that his wife told him the police had come to their home in china looking for him several times after he arrived in the united states.
lai left china for the united states in november.he then applied for asylum,withholding of removal and protection under cat,claiming persecution on account of his religion.lai testified before the ij in august,and his direct testimony,in large part,reiterated his initial written statement.however,during by the government attorney and questioning by the ij,lai revealed information not included in his written statement or in his direct testimony.first,lai said that after arriving in the united states he called a fellow church member in china,yan li,who told him that she had been detained for more than six months.second,lai said that his wife had recently been arrested.lai further explained that his wife was forced to sign a paper promising that she would tell the chinese government if she received any information about lai whereabouts,and that she now had to visit the police station on a weekly basis.third,lai told the ij that all of his fellow practitioners were arrested or persecuted after he came to the united states.
the ij denied all three of lai claims for relief.the ij found that lai testimony was not credible,citing lai failure to include key events mentioned during in his written statement or direct testimony lai ability to leave china without problems,when the country conditions report indicated that illegal religious activities ordinarily would have been a basis for denying exit authority and evidence demonstrating that lai was at best a christian of convenience.the bia dismissed lai appeal,finding no clear error in the ij adverse credibility determination and citing lai failure to mention his wife arrest and li detention in his written application.the bia also noted lai failure to provide corroborating evidence from his wife about her recent experiences.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review factual findings,including adverse credibility determinations,for substantial evidence.garcia holder,cir.where,as here,the bia reviewed the ij decision for clear error and relied upon the ij opinion as a statement of reasons but did not merely provide a boilerplate opinion,we look to the ij oral decision as a guide to what lay behind the bia conclusion.tekle mukasey,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.in so doing,we review here the reasons explicitly identified by the bia,and then examine the reasoning articulated in the ij oral decision in support of those reasons.id.stated differently,we do not review those parts of the ij adverse credibility finding that the bia did not identify as most significant and did not otherwise mention.id.
substantial evidence does not support the adverse credibility finding 
lai contends that substantial evidence does not support the bia adverse credibility determination.we agree.
in a id act case,an ij making a credibility finding consider s the totality of the circumstances,and all relevant factors,and may base the determination on 
the demeanor,candor,or responsiveness of the applicant or witness,the inherent plausibility of the applicant or witness account,the consistency between the applicant or witness written and oral statements whenever made and whether or not under oath,and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made,the internal consistency of each such statement,the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record including the reports of the department of state on country conditions,and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements,without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim 
b b iii.the ij must provide a specific cogent reason for the adverse credibility finding,but we will only overturn the ij conclusion when the evidence compels a contrary result.garcia,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we have noted that the real id act requires a healthy measure of deference to agency credibility determinations,which makes sense because ijs are in the best position to assess demeanor and other credibility cues that we can not readily access on review.shrestha holder,cir.but the real id act does not give a blank check to the ij enabling him or her to insulate an adverse credibility determination from our review of the reasonableness of that determination.id.at.
in evaluating inconsistencies which may be a basis for an adverse credibility determination under b b iii the relevant circumstances that an ij should consider include the petitioner explanation for a perceived inconsistency,and other record evidence that sheds light on whether there is in fact an inconsistency at all.id.at citation omitted.to ignore a petitioner explanation for a perceived inconsistency and relevant record evidence would be to make a credibility determination on less than the total circumstances in contravention of the real id act text.id.
at times,we have recognized that an omission may form the basis for an adverse credibility finding.see,zamanov holder,cir zamanov supplemental declaration and his testimony before the ij tell a much different and more compelling story of persecution than his initial application and testimony before the asylum officer while zamanov earlier story cited only the police to his home and major babaev threats and extortion as evidence of persecution,the additions described his activities serving as a poll watcher and protesting the government alleged falsification of election results.husyev mukasey,cir the inconsistency or,to be more accurate,the omission identified by the ij consists of husyev failure to mention in his asylum application and interview the fifteen speeches that he gave in ukraine in the early to denounce the persecution of ethnic minorities at the hands of ukranian.we conclude that the ij adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.alvarez santos ins,cir it is simply not believable that an applicant for asylum would fail to remember,and thus to include in either of his two asylum applications or his principal testimony,a dramatic incident in which he was attacked,stabbed,and fled to the mountains the very incident that precipitated his flight from guatemala only to be reminded of it at the conclusion of his testimony,after taking a break,and,assertedly,because of an itch in his shoulder.emphasis omitted.
in general,however,omissions are less probative of credibility than inconsistencies created by direct contradictions in evidence and testimony.it is well established that the mere omission of details is insufficient to uphold an adverse credibility finding.singh gonzales,cir alteration omitted quoting bandari ins,cir see also arulampalam ashcroft,cir nor does arulampalam omission at the airport of specific details about his torture that were later revealed in his testimony support the adverse credibility finding.the airport interview was fully consistent with arulampalam later testimony the only difference was the level of detail.lopez reyes ins,cir it is well settled that an applicant testimony is not per se lacking in credibility simply because it includes details that are not set forth in the asylum application.
in affirming the ij adverse credibility finding,the bia relied on two omissions that it characterized as significant inconsistencies between the respondent testimony and the statement attached to his asylum statement.first,the bia cited lai answer to a government question about lai later contacts with his fellow church members.he responded that one,yan li,had told him she had been detained for more than six months.lai did not volunteer this information as part of his direct testimony.instead,it surfaced as part of the government detailed questioning during 
q.did you ever have any contact with any of these people ever again 
a.after i came to the united states,i called them.
and,sir,who did you call 
yan li,yan li.
and what did she say,sir 
a.you know,she said do come back ever.
do you know when she was released from prison,sir 
a.she was detained for more than six months.she did tell me exactly when she was released,but she was jailed for more than half a year.
neither the government nor the ij asked lai to explain why he had omitted information about li detention earlier or suggested to him that his answer was substantively inconsistent with his prior statements.
second,and more significantly,the bia relied on lai testimony that his wife was recently arrested.again,the government elicited this information during.it was not part of lai direct testimony 
does sic your wife and daughter still live in the same house that you lived in when you were living in china,sir 
no,not now.
where do they live now 
a.they live with my wife mother.
q.why did they move in with your wife mother 
a.the police would often come to harass them.
q.did they have any problems with the police since they moved to this house 
q.what happened 
a.the police,you know,went to her mother place for harass them,and just indiscernible months ago,my wife was arrested.
q.why was she arrested 
a.they felt that i betrayed my country.i escaped to a foreign country.
and what happened then,sir 
a.she was asked to write on a piece of paper to promise that she would tell the government if she receive any news from me or if she knows my whereabouts.
and,sir,is she now attending weekly visits does she now have to go to weekly meetings at the police station 
in this instance,the ij asked lai why he did not include this information in his written statement.lai explained that the arrest occurred quite recently.the ij then asked lai why he failed to update his application earlier in the hearing 
okay.and today i put you under oath and asked you if everything in that application is true and correct.do you remember that 
and i asked if you wanted to update anything in your declaration or application,and you said no 
oh,yeah.there nothing need to be corrected in my application.
q.so you do think it would have been important in your declaration to tell the court that your wife was arrested recently because of you 
no.i only found out quite recently,the past couple of days when i called home.and also i assume,you know,when you asked me whether i need to make any corrections,you know,i assuming you want to find out if the materials supplied are true which are.maybe i did not comprehend it properly.sorry.
lai explanation was consistent with what he was asked earlier in the day.the ij had asked lai at the beginning of the hearing whether his application was true and correct she did not ask whether it was complete.thus,his responses at the outset were accurate.
the ij nonetheless summarily rejected lai explanation,simply concluding that lai was not persuasive,that the omitted information was clearly material and that it went to the heart of lai claim.again,she did not explain what,if anything,about lai answers was substantively inconsistent with his written statement or direct testimony only that his failure to mention these events seriously undermines his credibility.
the government suggests that the late disclosure of such information was a sound basis for questioning lai credibility because it was likely a scripted,attempt to enhance lai persecution claim.see,alvarez santos,at.aside from the ij and bia failure to articulate this rationale,the argument is flawed for three reasons.
first,this new information was introduced sometimes bit by bit through very specific questions from the government,not through lai volunteering it to support his claim.it is difficult to see how lai could have scripted a attempt to bolster his claim in response to these specific questions,sprung on him in the course of the hearing.there is no reason why,if lai was indeed trying to artificially bolster his claim,he would have waited to do so until after his direct testimony that he and his attorney could have controlled,while hoping the government would create the openings to reveal the new information.see id.at at the very end of his direct testimony,after a short break,alvarez santos was asked by his attorney if he had anything else to add.he then proffered for the first time the following story.moreover,the additional information in lai case was supplemental rather than contradictory.none of it contradicted any of lai other evidence or testimony.his failure to mention the information earlier in the process meant there were omissions,but not substantive inconsistencies.
second,the information concerned events and adverse consequences for third parties,not for lai himself,zamanov,at the applicant initially omitted three instances of mistreatment that he himself experienced,including beatings and arrests husyev,at the applicant initially failed to mention that he gave speeches,which made him a target alvarez santos,at at the end of his direct testimony,after a short break and in response to his attorney asking whether he had anything to add,the applicant mentioned for the first time that men came to his house,caught him and stabbed him.here,the omitted information concerned lai fellow church member detention and his wife arrest,both of which he learned about after arriving in the united states.because asylum claims ordinarily are centered around events and circumstances that the applicants have experienced directly,the initial omission of incidents affecting only third parties is less probative of credibility.
third,lai gave a plausible and compelling explanation for the omission of his wife arrest the arrest occurred shortly before he testified,and he did not understand that he should have added information about her at the beginning of his hearing dealing with his own circumstances.see shrestha,at i n evaluating inconsistencies,the relevant circumstances that an ij should consider include the petitioner explanation for a perceived inconsistency,and other record evidence that sheds light on whether there is in fact an inconsistency at all.citation omitted.the bia noted that lai was afforded ample opportunity to amend or add to his application at the beginning of his merits hearing,and that he swore to the accuracy of his application,declaration,and supporting documentation.but the ij did not clearly address the need to add this type of information,such that lai reasonably could have been expected to mention the information earlier.and,as we have said,the information did not conflict with the rest of lai application or cast doubt upon the accuracy of it.moreover,lai was never asked to explain the omission concerning yan li detention.see sin
