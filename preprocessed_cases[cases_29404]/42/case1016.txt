chinese national yan fang zhang a petitions for review of the september,order of the board of immigration appeals bia,summarily affirming a july,order of immigration judge ij adam opaciuch,denying yan fang zhang claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief pursuant to the convention against torture cat petitioner contends that the ij erred in finding that she failed to demonstrate past political persecution based on her union activities in china.she further contends that the ij erred in failing to recognize that,having borne two children in the united states,petitioner had a fear of future political persecution,specifically,sterilization,if returned to china.because the ij findings on yan fang zhang past persecution claim are supported by substantial evidence,no extended discussion is necessary for us to deny further review of this argument.on her feared future persecution claim,however,we are compelled to remand for further proceedings to allow the bia to explain why it denies yan fang zhang relief from removal when,on apparently identical facts,the agency granted such relief to her husband.as we explain herein,absent such an explanation,we can not determine whether the denial in this case is arbitrary.
background 
alleged past persecution for union activities 
on june,yan fang zhang left the fujian province of china and illegally entered the united states.approximately one year later,on june,she applied for asylum on the ground of past political persecution connected with union activities at her former place of employment.
at her asylum hearing,petitioner testified that,in january,her employer laid off workers,including petitioner.to protest these layoffs,yan fang zhang and several of her terminated staged a protest at the employer factory.when the discharged workers refused to leave the premises,factory supervisors called the police to remove the protesters.a scuffle ensued during which petitioner struck a supervisor she claims accidentally and was,in turn,struck by him.
b.the alleged fear of future sterilization 
on june,immigration authorities served yan fang zhang with notice of removal.see a a i i.the following year,on may,petitioner amended her asylum application to claim that she feared future persecution,including sterilization,if returned to china.to support this claim,yan fang zhang offered evidence of her march marriage to jian di zheng,another chinese immigrant,whom petitioner met in the united states and by whom she had two daughters,the first born in september and the second born in april.
at the outset of yan fang zhang removal hearing,the ij inquired as to the immigration status of petitioner husband.counsel informed the ij that petitioner spouse had been denied relief from removal but granted voluntary departure in.in july,however,he had filed a motion to reopen his petition based on petitioner first pregnancy,which motion remained pending.in light of these circumstances,the ij initially considered consolidating the couple cases,but ultimately decided to proceed only with yan fang zhang application for relief 
the family planning is really,it deals with future persecution being that she got two kids now.i mean that just gets her real main argument and that going to be the husband argument now that he married and he has two kids.i should do them together rather than piece meal but,you know.who knows.maybe his motion to reopen will be denied.
tr.of ij hearing,july,at.
testifying in support of her claimed fear of future persecution,yan fang zhang stated that the chinese government considered children born to its nationals in the united states to be chinese citizens.because she now had two children,she feared that,if returned to china,she would be fined,detained,and sterilized because of china restrictive family planning policies.although these policies were not strictly applied in some rural areas,zhang explained that,if returned to china,she could not relocate from her former urban home because she would then be unable to see her family.
petitioner husband did not testify at her hearing nevertheless,the parties stipulated that his testimony regarding china family planning policies would be consistent with that offered by petitioner.
c.the ij ruling,
in an oral decision rendered the same date as the hearing,the ij denied petitioner application for relief from removal.although the ij assumed that petitioner had testified credibly about her union activities,he concluded that she failed to demonstrate either that the actions of which she complained constituted persecution or that she was targeted on account of her political opinion.the ij found that the challenged layoffs were prompted by the employer financial difficulties,not workers political beliefs petitioner was laid off because she had relatively little seniority,not because her parents had failed to join the communist party when,during a union protest of the layoffs,factory supervisors called the police,the only official action taken against the protesters was to remove them from the premises,which conduct did not constitute persecution and a physical altercation between petitioner and a factory supervisor during the union demonstration,and that supervisor subsequent visits to petitioner parents home,were attributable to personal anger,not politics.the ij found no evidence that the public security bureau or any other government official ever threatened petitioner.
with respect to petitioner claimed fear of future persecution,the ij concluded that,although petitioner had a subjective fear of future persecution based on china restrictive family planning policies,she failed to demonstrate that this fear was objectively reasonable.citing country reports on conditions in china,the ij concluded that petitioner would,most likely,be fined if she returned to china with two children born in the united states,action that does not amount to persecution.ij ruling,july,at.further noting china very large floating population,the ij found that,on return to china,petitioner might well relocate to an area where state family planning policies are not strictly enforced.id.at.
accordingly,because the ij found that petitioner failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution,he denied her application for asylum and withholding of removal.similarly finding no evidence to indicate that petitioner would be tortured if returned to china,the ij denied her cat relief.
petitioner bia appeal 
yan fang zhang appealed the ij decision to the bia.while that appeal was pending,petitioner counsel,by letter dated may,advised the bia that,on april,the agency had granted to yan fang zhang husband asylum and withholding of removal apparently based on the same family planning claim.on september,the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision in petitioner case,making no mention of the contrary ruling in her husband case.
ii.discussion 
standard of review
