biniam berhane,a native and citizen of ethiopia,claims that throwing rocks at police during demonstrations amounts to a political crime,which permits him to seek asylum,as opposed to a serious nonpolitical crime,which bars him from seeking asylum and withholding of removal.b a iii,b b iii.the board of immigration appeals rejected berhane argument,concluding that he had committed a serious nonpolitical crime.
at first glance,there are three seemingly good reasons for upholding this decision.the board interpretation of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act receives chevron deference.ins.its assessments of an applicant qualifications for asylum receive deferential substantial evidence review.ins.and berhane was prolific he participated in such demonstrations and dangerous the demonstrators probably injured police officers,ja.
but the board opinion,one paragraph of which bears on this point,raises more questions than it answers.although the government acknowledged at oral argument that not all rock throwing amounts to a serious nonpolitical crime,the board fleeting assessment of berhane situation offers little explanation for why he falls on the wrong side of the line.and although the board definition of a serious nonpolitical crime is well established whether the criminal nature of the conduct outweighs its political motives,the board and the courts of appeals have not issued any decisions to our knowledge in which rock throwing was the principal criminal act.for these reasons and those elaborated below,we vacate the board decision and remand the matter to the board for further consideration and further explanation of its position.
ethiopia held contested parliamentary elections in may.before the elections,berhane and his brother joined a prominent group,the coalition for unity and democracy.spurred by the coalition mission to reduce authority and promote democratization and human rights,ja,berhane taught others about the group and recruited new members to the cause.
the coalition political agitation increased after the parliamentary elections.refusing to accept what they perceived as fraudulent election results,coalition members participated in a series of street protests.in response,according to the state department country report,police shot and killed protestors from june through june.between november and november,the report adds,police forces opened fire on demonstrators who were throwing rocks and who may have had machetes and grenades.berhane joined more than street demonstrations to fight for power and democracy and justice in ethiopia,ja,though the record does not indicate whether he attended any of the protests mentioned in the country report.
soon after the election,the ethiopian government arrested many coalition members,including berhane brother,whom the police arrested in february and whom his family has not seen since.after his brother arrest,berhane fled the country,and soon thereafter the police arrested berhane father.
in march,berhane illegally entered the united states through mexico.when the department of homeland security caught up with him,it ordered him to appear at a removal proceeding.conceding removability,berhane filed for asylum,withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture.berhane asked for asylum on the basis of political opinion,claiming that he feared harm if he returned to ethiopia due to his prior involvement in the coalition.
during his hearing before an immigration judge,berhane admitted that he threw rocks at police and their vehicles during street protests.he also used rocks to set up barricades on the streets,which kept police vehicles away from the demonstrations.others protesting alongside berhane set tires on fire and may have had grenades,though berhane denied taking part in these more violent activities.when asked whether his rock throwing was the reason the police wanted to arrest him,berhane agreed that it could be one reason,but he also thought that they wanted him because he participat ed in the neighborhood and recruit ed members of the coalition.ja.
the immigration judge denied berhane petition.although the ij expressed doubt about berhane credibility,he ultimately did not make an adverse credibility finding.the larger concern,the ij concluded,was that berhane had thrown rocks at police,ja,which amounted to a serious nonpolitical crime and which made berhane statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.see b a iii,b b iii.the ij also denied berhane claim under the convention against torture.
the board of immigration appeals affirmed,agreeing that berhane had committed a serious nonpolitical crime,which barred him from receiving asylum or withholding of removal.it also rejected berhane claim under the torture convention.in his petition for review,berhane contests only the board conclusion that he committed a serious nonpolitical crime.
although neither party challenges our authority to consider berhane petition,we have an independent obligation to ensure jurisdiction before pressing forward.hertz friend.congress has removed some immigration decisions of the attorney general from our those specified under to be in the discretion of the attorney general.a b ii.section b a,the first provision at issue,says that an alien is ineligible for asylum if the attorney general determines that there are serious reasons for believing that,prior to arriving in the united states,the alien committed a serious nonpolitical crime.id.b a emphasis added.the second provision at issue,b b,which speaks to the availability of withholding of removal,says that an alien is ineligible for relief if the attorney general decides he committed a serious nonpolitical crime emphasis added.the question is does the attorney general determin ation or deci sion that an act is a serious nonpolitical crime amount to an act of discretion,eliminating our authority to review the decision 
we think not.the reach of the act provision extends only to those decisions specified by statute to be in the attorney general discretion.a b ii.to specify that a decision belongs to the attorney general discretion requires more than a hint.s pecify means to name or state explicitly or in detail.kucana holder,quoting webster new collegiate dictionary.and b a and b b contain no such designation.
the sections,it is true,say that whether an alien committed a serious nonpolitical crime is something the attorney general determines,b a,and decides,id.b b.but empowering the attorney general to determine or for that matter decide something no more specif ies discretion than empowering the attorney general to exercise any number of responsibilities under the act,be they interpretations of the act,adjudications under the act,the adoption of rules under the act or anything else that might count as an administrative determination under the act.no doubt,the courts give broad deference to the attorney general in each of these that in turn allows the attorney general to exercise considerable discretion.see,at.but just because the courts give the attorney general broad discretion in an area does not mean that congress has specif ically committed the area to the attorney general discretion.otherwise,our lack of authority to review some immigration decisions of the attorney general would become the unyielding rule.if discretion mean t nothing more than the application of facts to principles or any of these other traditional actions of the attorney general,it would be difficult to envision any action by the attorney general that would not get caught in the provision orbit.soltane dep of justice,cir internal quotations omitted.that is not what congress had in mind.see alaka att y of the,cir the attorney general authority to decide whether an alien committed a particularly serious crime,b a ii,b b ii,is not a discretionary decision over which courts of appeals lack jurisdiction nethagani mukasey,cir same.
kucana holder,reinforces this conclusion.in holding that a decision committed to the attorney general discretion by regulation does not satisfy the prerequisite that congress specif y by statute the attorney general discretion over an issue,id.at,kucana admonishes the courts to read the act provisions accord with the traditional understanding that executive determinations generally are subject to judicial review.id.at.it takes clear and convincing evidence,kucana says,to dislodge the presumption of judicial review over agency actions.id.internal quotation marks omitted.no such evidence appeared there,and none appears here.congress committed many issues under the act to the attorney general discretion,showing that the national legislature understood what it must do to place a decision of the attorney general out of our showing just as clearly that it did not do so here.see,d the attorney general may,in his discretion waive inadmissibility of illegal aliens id.c a hardship waiver based on a good faith marriage is within the attorney general discretion id.a h a waiver of inadmissibility for misrepresentations is within the discretion of the attorney general.
one of our unpublished decisions,we acknowledge,held that whether an alien committed a serious nonpolitical crime was a discretionary determination over which we lacked jurisdiction.celaj ashcroft,app x,cir.but that case was decided before kucana,to say nothing of being decided through a opinion.with the benefit of kucana reasoning,we think that giving the attorney general authority to determine the serious nonpolitical crime bar applicability is insufficient to specify that the decision belongs to the attorney general discretion.
did the board properly conclude that berhane activities in,throwing rocks at the police during serious nonpolitical crimes in trying to answer this question,the parties and we share some common ground.a finding that berhane committed a serious nonpolitical crime renders him ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal.b a iii,b b iii.the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act delegates to the attorney general,and ultimately through the attorney general to the board,authority to determine the meaning of a serious nonpolitical crime.see b a see chevron natural res.def.council,at.the board has permissibly interpreted this language to mean that a crime is serious and nonpolitical when the criminal nature of the act outweigh s its political nature,u.at see in re mcmullen,bia.as applied to berhane,this inquiry raises factual questions about the nature of his conduct and legal questions about the appropriate circumstances to consider in the balance.the former questions receive substantial evidence review,requiring us to uphold the agency finding unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it,at.the latter questions receive chevron review,requiring us to uphold the board determination as long as it represents a permissible reading of the statutory bar for serious nonpolitical crimes.see,at.
as gauged by these considerations,the question is whether the board permissibly determined that the criminal nature of berhane actions outweigh ed their political components.on one side of the scales,there were ample bases for finding that his actions were criminal.berhane testimony confirms as much.his actions were violent he recalled hit ting the police with rocks and disappear ing from the area when he saw that they were in bad condition.ja.they were destructive in addition to taking aim at the police,berhane sometimes threw rocks to crash some cars,which he qualified only by saying that he targeted government vehicles.ja.and they were frequent he threw rocks during demonstrations,and he ultimately threw rocks at the police countless times.ja.taken together,these facts support the agency finding that berhane acts were criminal in nature.
on the other side of the scales,the record establishes a political motive for berhane actions.the main purpose of throwing the rocks,berhane explained,was to give a lesson to the policemen that he was for democracy and for equality of ethiopian people.ja.and the protestors,berhane says,used force to show that the protestors were supporting the coalition principles and to oppose the government.ja.
matters grow more complicated when we consider the board explanation for determining that the criminal aspects of berhane actions outweighed the political motives for engaging in them.here is what the board said 
in reaching his determination that the respondent was barred from asylum and withholding of removal,the immigration judge stated that in view of the scope of the respondent activities,the political aspects were outweighed by the criminal law aspects.contrary to the respondent appellate contentions,the immigration judge findings of fact have not been shown to be clearly erroneous.further,we find the immigration judge properly applied the approach taken by the board in matter of mcmullen in determining that the political aspects were outweighed by the criminal law aspects.we are not persuaded to disturb the immigration judge decision.
ja citations omitted.in a footnote to this paragraph,the board quoted with apparent approval this aspect of the immigration judge decision 
the immigration judge would understand if respondent took part in a peaceful demonstration or took part in a demonstration calling to international attention the actions of the ethiopian government in its possible intimidation of voters and electoral leaders.instead,respondent testified that he took part in at least demonstrations in which rocks were thrown,tires burned,and boulders placed in such a way that the police would be impeded in their activities.by throwing these rocks,the demonstrators damaged or destroyed public and private property and probably injured police officers as well.
the board brief analysis is susceptible of at least two readings.one is that rock throwing during political demonstrations invariably will amount to a serious nonpolitical crime.a portion of the immigration judge decision quoted by the board seems to embrace this interpretation,as the ij distinguishes between permissible peaceful demonstration s and impermissible demonstrations in which rocks were thrown.the other possibility is that rock throwing by itself is not what sinks berhane application.it is the number of demonstrations in which he threw rocks,combined with other activities burning tires and placing boulders in the streets and the consequences of all of berhane activities at the demonstrations damage to public and private property and the fact that police officers probably were injured.
at oral argument,we asked the attorney general representative whether the first interpretation was the correct the board treated all rock throwing at antigovernment demonstrations as a serious nonpolitical crime.counsel responded,quite reasonably,that,in weighing the criminal and political nature of an applicant actions at a demonstration,the board makes findings and does not believe that all rock throwing amounts to an crime.it is tempting to accept counsel assurances,to invoke the board broad discretion in deciding who has committed a serious nonpolitical crime,see,at,and to leave it at that.but several competing considerations suggest that the better course is to ask the board to clarify its decision.
to our knowledge,this is the first board or court of appeals decision to deal with a conventional,if nonetheless violent,form of street that the state department reports,to say nothing of the nightly news,indicate happens with some regularity in other countries.the board original decision in this area in,in re mcmullen,at,dealt with far more serious criminal bombing directed at civilian and government not only implicate the bar for serious nonpolitical crimes,but also implicate the bar,a mcmullen,at.other more recent decisions are at least one step removed from this one in terms of criminality and risks to public safety.in ashcroft,the criminal acts of burning buses,breaking windows and fighting with the police outweighed the political motive of protesting important political and social issues,cir.in efe ashcroft,the criminal act of killing a police officer at a rally outweighed the alien political motive,even where the police were alleg
