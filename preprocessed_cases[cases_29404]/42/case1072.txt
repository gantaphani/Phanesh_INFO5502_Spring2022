ii.the proceeding before the ij 
the only witness to give oral testimony at the hearing conducted by the ij was petitioner gao,who was represented by counsel,as was the government.in addition to the testimony,the evidence presented included gao application for political asylum and withholding of removal,accompanied by a narrative statement attached to the application a state department country report on china a medical certificate of the changle city public health association,pertaining to gao mother a graduation certificate pertaining to the physician who treated gao mother gao notarial birth certificate,household registration booklet,and graduation certificate and a business license and tax certificate in the name of gao mother.
from his testimony and exhibits,the following story put forward by gao emerged in february of,gao and his mother opened a bookstore in nungman,china,his hometown.although he considered himself the owner and operator of the bookstore,the license and tax certificate for the business were in the name of his mother,ai hua yang.he conducted the business in his mother name because he was unmarried and in local custom unmarried children are considered children.gao lived with his mother in an apartment above the bookstore when the business was opened.
in,gao began working in fuzhou,at the fuda elevator company,while taking classes there three nights a week at the university.in fuzhou,he occupied an apartment formerly belonging to his grandmother.gao returned to his hometown,as time permitted,to assist his mother in the operation of the bookstore.
in june of,gao began selling books,magazines,and other materials pertaining to the falun gong movement.
falun gong or wheel of the law,also known as falun dafa,blends aspects of taoism,buddhism and the meditation techniques of qigong a traditional martial art with the teachings of li hongzhi,who left the country in.the chinese g overnment estimates that there may be as many as million adherents of falun gong falun gong followers estimate that there are as many as million adherents worldwide.some experts estimate that the true number of falun gong adherents lies in the tens of millions.despite the mystical nature of some of li teachings,falun gong does not consider itself a religion and has no clergy or formal places of worship.
country report.
gao was not an adherent of falun gong,nor was he very knowledgeable about its practices.in his testimony,he described falun gong as that book concerning to,to your physical health.gao sold the books only because they we re the best sellers and he and his mother could make money selling them.he obtained the books from a former high school classmate,chen fang di,who also owned a bookstore.
in july of,the practice of falun gong was outlawed by the chinese government.because of media reports that the practitioners of falun gong and the sellers of its literature were subject to arrest,gao decided in september of to stop selling such literature.he and his mother moved the falun gong books and materials out of the store and into a warehouse at the rear of the store.nevertheless,several policemen came to the bookstore in october of.gao was working in fuzhou at the time,but his mother was at home.when gao returned home that evening,he found his mother lying in bed with bruises and cuts on the left side of her face and on her left arm.her kneecaps also were injured.
gao mother told him that she had sustained her injuries during a scuffle with the police,in the course of which she fell down the stairs in front of the store.she related that the police had pushed all the bookshelves onto the ground and had confiscated the falun gong books in the warehouse as well as the business license.she reported that the physical altercation with the police had erupted when she resisted the taking of the license.
heeding his mother advice that he leave at once,gao returned immediately to his apartment in fuzhou.before he left,however,he tried to contact his friend,chen fang di,who had supplied gao with the falun gong literature.gao spoke by telephone with chen grandmother,who informed him that the police had arrested chen,confiscated his falun gong inventory,and closed his bookstore.
gao stayed in his apartment in fuzhou for only one night.the next day he traveled to nanping,where his maternal aunt resided.he stayed with his aunt for three days and enlisted her help to take his mother for treatment to a medical doctor.the doctor later furnished a certificate attesting to his treatment of gao mother translated,it states as follows patient ai hua yang was seriously injured and her knee s injured due to a fall in october.in addition,her coronary heart disease has been deteriorating.after gao left the home of his maternal aunt,he went to the home of his paternal uncle in fuzhou.gao alternated his residence between the two homes,and occasionally worked in nanping repairing water heaters.
in october or november of,gao received a telephone call from a friend who was a fellow student at the university.this friend told him that the police had visited a dean of the university in an effort to discover gao whereabouts.gao also remained in contact with his mother,who informed him that the police had visited her on a number of occasions as well.the police sought to arrest gao in order to find out who had supplied him with falun gong literature and who had purchased it from the store.
after gao left china on june,he remained in contact with his mother,who advised that the police continued to seek him out through her.in response to a question at the hearing as to why the police did not target his mother individually,gao testified that his mother had a serious heart problem,that she might have had a heart attack if placed in custody,and that the local police officers in her village were aware of that possibility and acted accordingly.
iii.the decision of the immigration judge.
in a somewhat disjointed oral decision,the ij reached the following conclusions with respect to gao application for asylum i t must be vehemently emphasized that gao did not sell falun gong books because he is a falun gong sympathizer or supporter.he sold falun gong books because it was profitable.gao,therefore,is not meritorious of political asylum.the ij recognized that the testimony of an applicant for asylum sometimes is the only evidence available and can suffice if it believable,consistent,and sufficiently detailed in light of country conditions to provide a plausible account for the fear.the ij went on,however,to state that i n this particular case,she had problems with gao credibility and did not find that his testimony was sufficiently credible and plausible to stand alone in support of his claims.
in support of her finding of a lack of credibility and plausibility,the ij stated it makes absolutely no sense that gao mother has circumvented any problems with the police,and that the emphasis is on gao even though he is not the licensed book seller or owner.the ij also found that gao mother presumably ha d never been interrogated and had had absolutely no problems with the chinese government save for the one incident when the police came and ransacked the store.rejecting gao explanation that the police took into consideration his mother heart condition,the ij stated that,if this supposition were true,it would drastically undercut any testimony regarding the alleged campaign to eradicate all those connected with the falun gong movement.
further commenting on the issue of credibility,the ij stated as follows gao insisted today in testimony that a famous,traditional doctor attended to his mother and issued a medical document to that effect but there is no such medical document in the record.she concluded that the medical documentation is not consistent with gao testimony at all and,therefore,creates a problem of credibility and plausibility.
based on gao testimony that the police wanted to find out who sold the falun gong books to him and who purchased them from him,the ij concluded that the police were only looking to speak to gao.a finding of past persecution or fear of future persecution,necessary to a grant of asylum,could not,according to the ij,be predicated on the desire of police officers merely to speak with or question gao.the ij found it especially telling that gao was neither the license holder nor the official store owner.the ij concluded,on that basis,that gao did not fit into any particular social group and that there was absolutely no nexus between gao and any political opinion or any other such protected ground.
in light of these determinations,the ij denied gao application for asylum as well as his application for withholding of removal.the ij also denied gao application for relief under the cat,finding that he set forth absolutely no facts or circumstances to show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if forced to return to china.
iv.analysis 
asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture 
pursuant to b of the immigration and nationality act,b,an applicant for asylum must establish that he or she is a refugee,unable or unwilling to return to his or her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of one or more of five enumerated grounds r ace,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir.once an individual proves either past persecution or a fear of future persecution,the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum pursuant to.see zhang slattery,cir.
an alien has a fear when a reasonable person in her circumstances would fear persecution if she were returned to her native country.ins,cir.fear involves both a subjective and an objective component.the former may be based on the applicant reaction to events that impinge on her personally but to make it a fear,there must be other proof or objective facts that lend support to the applicant subjective fear.melendez united states dep t of justice,cir.when an asylum applicant has demonstrated that she has been subjected to past persecution,there is a presumption that a fear of persecution exists.melgar de torres reno,cir see b see also melendez,at.once demonstrated,the burden shifts to the government to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that country conditions have changed to such an extent that the petitioner no longer has a fear that she would be persecuted if she were to return to her native country.melgar de torres,at see b.
for withholding of removal,the applicant must meet the requirements of asylum eligibility and establish that it is more likely than not that were he or she to be deported his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of one of the five bases for asylum.islami gonzales.cir see b a diallo ins,cir.since this is a burden heavier than that imposed for eligibility for asylum,it follows that an applicant unable to demonstrate eligibility for asylum can not demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal.see abankwah ins,cir.however,if a showing for withholding of deportation is made,the attorney general does not have the discretion afforded to him in an asylum case,and withholding must be granted.id.
article of the cat provides that n o state party shall expel or return a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.treaty doc,see ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.torture has been defined as the intentional infliction of pain or suffering that is perpetrated or sanctioned by a nation authorities.see also a.to establish eligibility for protection under the cat,an applicant must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.ramsameachire,at quoting c.the regulations provide the following 
in assessing whether it is more likely than not that an applicant would be tortured in the proposed country of removal,all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered,including,but not limited to 
i evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant 
ii evidence that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured 
iii evidence of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal,where applicable and 
iv other relevant information regarding conditions in the country of removal.
relief under the cat requires the applicant to establish that there is greater than a fifty percent chance that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured upon return to his or her country of origin.wang ashcroft,cir c.
legal conclusions 
the principal reason given by the ij for denial of asylum and withholding of removal is found in the ij vehement emphasi s that gao did not sell falun gong books because he was a falun gong sympathizer or supporter but,rather,because it was profitable.the ij thus focused on the thoughts,actions,and motives of gao.but the question in this case is not whether gao was or is a practitioner of falun gong,but whether authorities would have perceived him as such or as a supporter of the movement because of his activities.if authorities would persecute him as an adherent or as a supporter of falun gong,then such persecution would be on account of an enumerated ground.
although we have not had the occasion to rule definitively on the matter,there is wide endorsement of the concept of persecution on account of imputed political opinion.amanfi ashcroft,cir extending concept to persecution on account of imputed status as a homosexual.with respect to the perception of falun gong itself,the ninth circuit has noted that the government crackdown on falun gong practitioners is motivated by a perceived political opinion.hongke zhang ashcroft,cir emphasis added.here,the ij failed to explore the question of whether this same political opinion was imputed to gao by the chinese authorities because he sold falun gong literature.
in agreement with the first circuit,we accept the proposition that an imputed political opinion,whether correctly or incorrectly attributed,can constitute a ground of political persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act.ins,cir.decisions of our sister circuits accept the same proposition.in ins,the ninth circuit held that a petitioner may establish a fear of persecution on account of a political opinion imputed to him by his persecutors,whether or not he actually holds that opinion.ins,cir see also najjar ashcroft,cir morales ins,cir mya lwin ins,cir ins,cir.
the ij certainly was on notice that gao was advancing the theory of imputed political opinion.in his asylum application,gao wrote the government believes that i am a supporter of the falun gong movement.at his hearing,gao testified they wanted to arrest me to find out where i obtained the books,and whom did i sell those books to.in emphasizing that gao was not a falun gong adherent and that he sold falun gong books only for profit,however,the ij failed to explore adequately the views held by the alleged persecutors with respect to gao support for the movement.such perceived support,based on gao activities,would constitute an imputed political opinion suffic
