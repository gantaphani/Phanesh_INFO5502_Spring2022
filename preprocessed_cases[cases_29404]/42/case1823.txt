based on a tip,houston police suspected that the defendant,juan angel martinez,had witnessed a violent crime and might possess the weapons used therein.the tipster provided a street address and indicated that martinez was staying there with his girlfriend.rather than seek a warrant,the police set up a ruse to draw martinez out of the house.martinez and his girlfriend took the bait,exited the home and drove off in a vehicle,unaware that they were being watched.police officers stopped the vehicle a few blocks away,placed the defendant in the back of a police car,and then asked his girlfriend for consent to search her home,which she gave.police discovered three firearms inside,but soon learned that the tipster was wrong.martinez had not witnessed a violent crime,nor were the guns used in such a crime.martinez was charged with being an illegal alien in possession of firearms,in violation of g a,g,and a.
martinez filed a motion to suppress both the guns and any statements given to police.the district court decided to suppress the statements but not the guns.after a bench trial,martinez was found guilty of being a felon in possession.on appeal,martinez again argues that the guns must be suppressed.specifically,he claims that the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion,and that the guns must be suppressed as the fruit of that poisonous tree.we agree with martinez.
facts and procedural history 
law enforcement in houston received a tip that a man named angel might have been a witness to a quadruple homicide,might be in possession of the weapons used in the homicide,and might be planning to flee to mexico with those weapons.the tipster stated that angel was staying with his girlfriend,and provided her address in pasadena,texas.the day after receiving the tip,the police did not seek a warrant.rather,six officers set up surveillance outside the residence.three or four hours later,a car drove away from the residence.the officers stopped the car and interviewed the driver,a man named bernardo,who confirmed that a man named angel was in the residence.at the request of the police,bernardo agreed to call the residence and ask angel to come to the location of the stop to retrieve his car.approximately twenty minutes later,juan angel martinez martinez and his girlfriend,georgina amatt amatt,left the house,totally unaware that they were under surveillance.the police stopped them a few blocks away.they immediately placed martinez in the back of a police cruiser,where he consented to being transported to the police station for questioning.meanwhile,a officer obtained consent from amatt to search her residence,which resulted in the discovery of three firearms.
the police quickly learned that martinez middle name was angel,but contrary to the tipster information,neither martinez nor the discovered weapons had anything to do with the quadruple homicide.martinez was charged only with being an illegal alien in possession of firearms and with being a felon in possession of firearms,in violation of g a,g,and a.he filed a motion to suppress the statements given and the evidence seized.the district court held a lengthy suppression hearing at which both sides presented the testimony of multiple witnesses.afterwards,the district court granted the motion to suppress the statements but denied the motion to suppress the evidence.the court later conducted a bench trial and found martinez guilty of being a felon in possession.the district judge sentenced him to a term of months plus three years supervised release.
on appeal,martinez argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the weapons discovered at amatt home.he argues that the informant tip was not itself reliable and specific enough to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that martinez had engaged in criminal activity.he adds that the police might have established the reliability of the information by taking steps to corroborate it,but they did not adequately do so.without reasonable suspicion,he says,the stop of his vehicle was unlawful,and the firearms must be suppressed as the fruit of that poisonous tree.
ii.standard of review 
as a preliminary matter,the parties disagree as to the appropriate standard of review to be applied in this case.generally,when considering a motion to suppress evidence under the fourth amendment we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its fourth amendment conclusions de novo.united states gonzalez,cir.in this case,however,the government argues that martinez never raised his appellate claim in the district court,and that we should review it for plain error only.therefore,we first consider whether martinez claim was raised below.
after a lengthy evidentiary hearing,defense counsel summarized his arguments to the district judge,one of which was as follows the reasonable suspicion itself would be sufficient,because they did have reasonable suspicion that martinez had just committed a crime.martinez plainly asserted that the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion because the police could not reasonably suspect that he had just committed a crime.this requirement comes from a long line of case law holding that an investigatory stop would be proper only if based on reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.united states roch,cir quoting terry ohio,d.once all the evidence had been heard,and the arguments made,the district court explicitly ruled that the stops were supported by reasonable suspicion.the judge stated that the stop was justified,that the information that the officers had was sufficient basis for the stops of the vehicles.
on this record alone,it would seem obvious that our review of the fourth amendment claim,which was presented to and decided by the district court,would be de novo.however,the government argues that martinez challenge to the reasonable suspicion was not specific enough to alert the court and the government to the particular concern he raises on appeal.in particular,the government says that martinez did not argue in the district court that the informant tip was inadequate to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.if martinez had specifically stated that the informant tip was unreliable,says the government,then it might have its witnesses,or called new witnesses,to establish the reliability of its informant or its information.but this the government was already obligated to do.
the crucial fact in this case is that the government bore the burden of proving reasonable suspicion.see roch,at w here the facts are undisputed that the arrest and seizures were made without benefit of warrants of any kind,the government bears the burden of proving it had a reasonable suspicion to seize the defendant.see also terry,at.i n justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which,taken together with rational inferences from those facts reasonably warrant that intrusion.the primary basis for that suspicion in this case was the informant tip.realizing this,the government asked its own witnesses about the informant tip on direct exam the government complaint,then,can not be that it was caught unawares,nor that martinez was under some obligation to inform it ahead of time of his particular concerns.again,the burden rests with the government to demonstrate reasonable suspicion,and where that suspicion hinges on an informant tip,part of the government burden is to address the reliability of that information.
it is true that once the government had presented its evidence,martinez still needed to make his specific legal arguments clear to the district court.if he failed to do so,we would review for plain error only.see united states maldonado,cir.the government,relying on our holding in maldonado,asserts that martinez was not sufficiently specific.in maldonado,we considered whether the defendant had properly raised a dickerson to the police officer search.id.at.during the,the officer discovered a bulge in the defendant boot.he reached in,removed a round package,and opened it to find heroin inside.id.at.at a suppression hearing,defense counsel argued that the officer lacked probable cause to open the package,but never argued that dickerson prevented the officer from seizing the package in the first place.id.at.we took pains to explain that the two legal issues were distinct,and concluded,t he district court ruled on the issues presented it.had the dickerson issue been presented,testimony could have been taken,and argument received,on that issue and the district court would have dealt with it.id.at.because it was not,we confined our review to plain error only.id.
this case is very different from maldonado.as we have said,the touchstone of the maldonado inquiry is whether the objection was specific enough to allow the trial court to take testimony,receive argument,or otherwise explore the issue raised.united states burton,cir.in this case,the court not only explored the issue of the informant tip and how it affected the officers reasonable suspicion,but explicitly ruled on it.in finding that there was reasonable suspicion,the court stated i credit the officers testimony as to the information they had been given and the basis on which they made the traffic stops.
it is true that martinez did not make the best case to the district judge for why reasonable suspicion was lacking.the relevant portion of his argument amounted to little more than a single sentence the reasonable suspicion itself would be sufficient,because they did have reasonable suspicion that martinez had just committed a crime.however,martinez plainly asserted his view that the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion because the police did not have a reasonable belief that martinez had committed a crime.the district court considered this argument,though without the benefit of helpful case law or rhetorical prowess,and ruled against martinez.this is enough to preserve the issue for review in our court.on the record before us,we are well situated to review the district court fourth amendment conclusions de novo,and we now do so.
iii.discussion 
a.the police did not have reasonable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop.
an investigative vehicle stop is permissible under terry only when the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot.united states jaquez,cir per curiam.an informant tip may,in certain cases,provide reasonable suspicion.this will depend on various factors,including 
the credibility and reliability of the informant,the specificity of the information contained in the tip or report,the extent to which the information in the tip or report can be verified by officers in the field,and whether the tip or report concerns active or recent activity,or has instead gone stale.
united states gonzalez,cir citing alabama white,d united states perkins,cir citing same.
the first of these factors,the credibility and reliability of the informant,deserves particular scrutiny in this case.the government insists on characterizing the tipster as a confidential informant,but it never introduced any evidence about the informant whatsoever and made no effort to illustrate his or her reliability in the district court.in fact,the government elected not to call a single witness who had any knowledge of the tip or the informant.they knew only that the police department had received information from another person about a man named angel.none of them testified,nor could they have,about the source of that information,the reliability of that source,or the specifics of what he or she said.thus there is no evidence in the record suggesting any basis for finding the informant credible,such as,for example,whether or not the informant had any past dealings with the police.for our purposes,then,the report is the functional equivalent of an anonymous tip.to characterize it as anything else would be to assume the very credibility and reliability that the government has the burden of proving.
without establishing the reliability of the informant,the government had to establish reasonable suspicion based on some or all of the other factors listed above the specificity of the information provided,the extent to which the information is corroborated by officers in the field,and whether that information concerns recent activity or has instead gone stale.at the time of this stop,the police had a tip that a person named angel was storing weapons that had been used in a crime in his girlfriend house corroboration by the individual leaving the specified house that a man named angel was inside and visual verification that two people left the residence minutes after a phone call was placed asking angel to pick up his car,and that those two people drove toward the location where the was supposed to occur.therefore,at the time of the stop,the only verified information that the police had was that a man named angel was in a specified residence.notably absent,however,is any verified information that criminal activity may be afoot.jaquez,at our review of precedent,both our own and that of the supreme court,makes clear that this is insufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion.
the supreme court has evinced a strong distrust of anonymous tips.in particular,it has stated that an anonymous tip that provides verifiable information as to a person identity and location,without more,is insufficient to justify an investigative stop.in florida,d,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of a stop based on an anonymous tip.in that case,the police received a tip from an unknown caller who said that a young black male,standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt,was carrying a gun.id.at.the police arrived at the stop about six minutes later,identified an individual meeting the description in the tip,searched him,and found a gun in his pocket.id.a unanimous supreme court found that the anonymous tip was insufficient to create reasonable suspicion.id.at.
the court reasoned that in informant cases,the tip replaces the unusual conduct which leads the police officer to reasonably conclude in the light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot id.at.quoting terry,at.when the informant is known,her reputation can be assessed,and she can be held responsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated.id.citing adams williams,d.in anonymous informant cases,however,the tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant basis of knowledge or veracity about the suspect involvement in criminal behavior.id.quoting alabama white,d.still,there are situations in which an anonymous tip,suitably corroborated,exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop.id.quoting white,at.
the court concluded that an anonymous informant ability to describe a person appearance and location is insufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.the court explained 
an accurate description of a subject readily observable location and appearance is of course reliable in this limited sense it will help the police correctly identify the person whom the tipster means to accuse.such a tip,however,does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity.the reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality,not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.
id.at.citation omitted emphasis added.this language bears directly on the case before us.absent any information about the informant,the police had verified information that the person in the car they stopped was the angel whom the informant desired to accuse.they had no verified information,however,that linked martinez to any criminal behavior.the informant also provided no verifiable predictive information about martinez future behavior that would have indicated any inside knowledge about martinez it is clear to us,then,that compels the conclusion that the police did not have the requisite reasonable suspicion to justify the terry stop of martinez.they had a reasonable basis to suspect that his name was angel,but little more.
we find further support for this conclusion in our own precedent,even without cl
