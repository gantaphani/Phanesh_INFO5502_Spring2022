this interlocutory appeal requires us to answer a single question does a district court have jurisdiction over a claim that indigent minor immigrants without counsel have a right to counsel in removal proceedings our answer to this jurisdictional query is no.we underscore that we address only the jurisdictional issue,not the merits of the claims.congress has clearly provided that all claims whether statutory or constitutional that aris e from immigration removal proceedings can only be brought through the petition for review process in the federal courts of appeals.a b.despite the gravity of their claims,the minors can not bypass the immigration courts and proceed directly to district court.instead,they must exhaust the administrative process before they can access the federal courts.
background 
the appellees collectively the minors or children are immigrant minors,aged three to seventeen,who have been placed in administrative removal proceedings.the children are at various stages of the removal process some are waiting to have their first removal hearing,some have already had a hearing,and some have been ordered removed in absentia.none of the children can afford an attorney,and each has tried and failed to obtain pro bono counsel for removal proceedings.
the children,suing on behalf of themselves and a class,claim a due process and statutory right to appointed counsel at government expense in immigration proceedings they claim that,as minors,they lack the intellectual and emotional capacity of adults,yet are force d to appear unrepresented in complex,adversarial court proceedings against trained government attorneys.according to the complaint,this lack of representation ensure s that they and thousands of children are deprived of a full and fair opportunity to identify defenses or seek relief for which they qualify in immigration court.
the children acknowledge that,generally,an immigrant who has been placed in removal proceedings can challenge those proceedings only after exhausting administrative remedies and filing a petition for review pfr in a federal court of appeals.but they argue that this case falls outside the general rule because,in light of the complex nature of removal proceedings and the appeals process,minors can not effectively raise claims through the pfr process.as a result,they conclude,they would be denied meaningful judicial review of their claims if the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.
the government moved to dismiss the complaint on multiple grounds,including ripeness because in some cases the removal proceedings had not commenced and in others they had not concluded at the time the complaint was filed and jurisdiction because the immigration and nationality act ina channels judicial review of claims arising out of removal proceedings through the pfr process.a b.the district court granted the government motion in part and denied it in part.as to ripeness,the court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the named parties against whom removal proceedings have not yet been initiated,reasoning that r emoval proceedings might never be commenced.the other children claims were ripe because the agency did not have authority to appoint counsel or to declare a statute barring counsel unconstitutional,and e xhaustion is not required to make a claim ripe when the agency lacks authority to grant relief.
the district court then turned to the government jurisdictional challenge.the court recognized that the ina judicial review mechanism,a and b,is broad in scope and was designed to consolidate and channel review of all legal and factual questions that arise from the removal of an alien into the administrative process,with judicial review of those decisions vested exclusively in the courts of appeal.quoting aguilar ice,cir.emphasis in original.
despite the statutory strictures,the district court identified an exception to the ina exclusive review process and concluded that it had jurisdiction over the minors due process claims.citing mcnary haitian refugee center,d,and city of rialto west coast loading corporation,cir,the court explained that the due process claims challenged a procedure or policy collateral to the substance of removal proceedings and,in light of the fact that an immigration judge is unlikely to conduct the requisite due process balancing,the administrative record would be insufficient to provide a basis for meaningful judicial review.conversely,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the statutory claims,in part because the constitutional balancing standard does not apply and concerns about the adequacy of the administrative record are not warranted.
the government filed this interlocutory appeal,challenging the district court determination that it had jurisdiction over the constitutional claims.the minors,disputing,among other issues,the district court dismissal of the statutory claims.
i.the immigration and nationality act provides exclusive judicial review through the petition for review process.
this appeal turns on our interpretation of two provisions of the ina,so we begin with the statute the section titled exclusive means of review,a,prescribes the vehicle for judicial review a petition for review shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal lest there be any question about the scope of judicial review,b mandates that j udicial review of all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states shall be available only in judicial review of a final order 
section b is,as the first circuit noted,breathtaking in scope and in grip and therefore swallows up virtually all claims that are tied to removal proceedings.see aguilar ice,cir.taken together,a and b mean that any issue whether legal or factual arising from any activity can be reviewed only through the pfr process.see viloria lynch,cir.it is well established that this court jurisdiction over removal proceedings is limited to review of final orders of removal.bibiano lynch,wl,at cir.holding that b venue provision is not jurisdictional,but contrasting the venue statute with other statutes in the ina that use the terms judicial review or jurisdiction.
although a and b might seem draconian at first glance,they have two mechanisms that ensure immigrants receive their day in court.singh gonzales,cir.first,while these sections limit how immigrants can challenge their removal proceedings,they are not statutes that,by their terms,foreclose all judicial review of agency actions.instead,the provisions channel judicial review over final orders of removal to the courts of appeals.see elgin dep t of treasury,d explaining that heightened scrutiny is not appropriate where congress channels judicial review of constitutional questions to a particular court but does not deny all judicial review of those questions.the supreme court has thus characterized b as a zipper clause,reno am.arab anti discrimination comm.aaadc,d,explaining that the statute purpose is to consolidate judicial review of immigration proceedings into one action in the court of appeals.ins cyr,d.
second,and equally importantly,b has limits.by channeling only those questions arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien,the statute excludes from the pfr process any claim that does not arise from removal proceedings.accordingly,claims that are independent of or collateral to the removal process do not fall within the scope of b.see torres tristan holder,cir.ancillary determinations made outside the context of a removal proceeding,however,are not subject to direct review.aguilar,at reading arising from to exclude claims that are independent of,or wholly collateral to,the removal process see also city of rialto,at recognizing that mcnary allowed the petitioners to challenge a policy that was collateral to their substantive eligibility for relief.
thus,we have distinguished between claims that arise from removal proceedings under b which must be channeled through the pfr process and claims that are collateral to,or independent of,the removal process.see aguilar,at nadarajah gonzales,cir.singh,at.for example,in nadarajah gonzales,we held that an immigrant could challenge his administrative detention by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court,notwithstanding b.at.nadarajah had prevailed at every administrative level of review,had been granted asylum,and had never been charged with any crime,yet was being held in detention without any established timeline for a decision on when he may be released from detention.id.at.we explained that b does not apply to federal habeas corpus provisions that do not involve final orders of removal.id.at.because nadarajah ha d prevailed at every administrative level and been granted asylum,his petition did not involve a final order of removal,and b did not channel jurisdiction to the courts of appeals.id.at.
similarly,in the unique situation in singh gonzales,we recognized that the district court had jurisdiction over the petitioner claim that arose after his attorney failed to file a timely pfr.at.we noted that singh claim could not have been raised before the agency because it arose after a final order of removal was entered and,absent habeas review,singh would have had no legal avenue to obtain judicial review of this claim.we therefore concluded that his petition did not challenge a final order of removal under b.id.at.we did not,however,allow singh to raise a different ineffective assistance of counsel claim that arose before a final order of removal entered and that could and should have been brought before the agency.id.at skurtu mukasey,cir.distinguishing singh and holding that a claim must be brought through the pfr process because the claim is a direct result of the removal proceedings.
in contrast,in martinez napolitano,we held in the context of a district court challenge under the administrative procedure act that w hen a claim by an alien,however it is framed,challenges the procedure and substance of an agency determination that is inextricably linked to the order of removal,it is prohibited by section a,cir.
in light of b and a and our precedent,the children claims must be raised through the pfr process because they arise from removal proceedings.the counsel claims are not independent or ancillary to the removal proceedings.rather,these claims are bound up in and an inextricable part of the administrative process.the first circuit was the first court to consider whether a claim falls outside the scope of b.the court unequivocally said no.thus,we agree with the court analysis in aguilar that,b y any realistic measure,the alien right to counsel is part and parcel of the removal proceeding itself a n alien right to counsel possesses a direct link to,and is inextricably intertwined with,the administrative process that congress so painstakingly fashioned.aguilar,at.
claims are routinely raised in petitions for review filed with a federal court of appeals.see,ram mukasey,cir.holding that the petitioner did not knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to counsel zepeda melendez ins,cir.holding that the ins deportation of an immigrant without notice to counsel violated the immigrant statutory right to counsel.in part,this is because immigration judges have an obligation to ask whether a petitioner wants counsel although immigration judges may not be required to undertake herculean efforts to afford the right to counsel,at a minimum they must inquire whether the petitioner wishes counsel,determine a reasonable period for obtaining counsel,and assess whether any waiver of counsel is knowing and voluntary.biwot gonzales,cir.an immigration judge failure to inquire into whether the petitioner wants or can knowingly waive counsel is grounds for reversal.see id.as we discuss below,special protections are provided to minors who are unrepresented.see infra at pp.
the legislative history of the ina,as well as amendments to b,confirm that congress intended to channel all claims arising from removal proceedings,including claims,to the federal courts of appeals and bypass the district courts.consolidation of the review process for immigration orders of removal began in,when congress amended the ina to channel immigrants challenges to their removal proceedings to the courts of appeals via the pfr,at,as reprinted in,see also magana pizano ins,cir.recognizing changes to ina,vacated on other grounds,d mem.the change was intended to create a single,separate,statutory form of judicial review of administrative orders for the removal of aliens from the united states and to shorten the time frame for judicial review of deportation orders by eliminat ing a suit in a district court,at conf,reprinted in,citations omitted.
congress continued to streamline judicial review of immigration proceedings in,when it enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,pub,stat.iirira repealed the old scheme and instituted a new and significantly more restrictive one in.aaadc,at.the new judicial review provisions were designed to make perfectly clear that only courts of appeals and not district courts could review a final removal order,that review of a final removal order is the only mechanism for reviewing any issue raised in a removal proceeding,and that the statute was intended to preclude all district court review of any issue raised in a removal proceeding,at.
when it enacted b in,congress was legislating against the backdrop of recent supreme court law.in,in mcnary haitian refugee center,the court offered a blueprint for how congress could draft a statute that would cover not only individual challenges to agency decisions,but also broader challenges to agency policies and practices.a group of immigrants,who applied unsuccessfully for amnesty under the special agricultural workers saw program or thought they would be unsuccessful in the future,filed an action in district court,alleging injuries caused by unlawful practices and policies adopted by the ins in its administration of the saw program.at.the court held that,under the governing statute,the district court had jurisdiction to hear a challenge to ins practices and policies because the statute channeled only individual not wider policy claims through the pfr process 
of significance to our analysis,the court explained that congress could have crafted language to channel challenges to agency policies through the pfr process if it had chosen to do so 
h ad congress intended the limited review provisions of e to encompass challenges to ins procedures and practices,it could easily have used broader statutory language.congress could,for example,have channel ed into the reform act special review procedures all causes arising under any of the provisions of the legalization program.it moreover could have referr ed to review on all questions of law and fact under the saw legalization program.
id.at.citations omitted.
in mcnary,the court did everything but write the future statute and so it makes sense to presume that congress was aware of this precedent when it amended the ina in.see united states wells,d w e presume that congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with the supreme court precedents.with this presumption in mind,we note that b neatly tracks the policy and practice language suggested in mcnary the amended section channels review of all questions of law and fact to the courts of appeals for all claims arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states.b.thus,the legislative history and chronology of amendments to b confirm the plain meaning of the statute.we conclude that a and b channel review of all claims,including challenges,through the pfr process whenever they arise from removal proceedings.because the children claims arise from their removal proceedings,they can only raise those claims through the pfr process.aguilar,at.
ii.the minors have not been denied all forms of meaningful judicial review.
the minors do not seriously dispute that the plain text of b prohibits them from filing a complaint in federal district court.instead,they attempt to get around the statute by claiming that they have been or will be denied meaningful judicial review in light of their juvenile status.in other words,they argue that b,as applied in this context,creates a catch that effectively bars all judicial review of their claims.
the argument goes as follows minors who obtain counsel in their immigration proceedings will be unable to raise claims because they have no such claim.as a practical matter,children who lack counsel will be unable to reach federal court to raise a claim because they are subject to the same exhaustion requirements and filing deadlines that apply to adults.even if an unrepresented child were able to navigate the pfr process,the child would still be deprived of meaningful judicial review,because the record on appeal would be insufficient to sustain review.because,according to the minors,their claims will never see the light of day through the pfr process,the panel should construe b as not covering these claims.
the assertion that the minors will be denied meaningful judicial review stems from dicta in mcnary.in mcnary,the court noted that the saw regime imposed several practical impediments to judicial review.most importantly,saw procedures d id not allow applicants to assemble adequate records for review at.agency interviews were neither recorded nor transcribed,and saw applicants had inadequate opportunity to present evidence and witnesses on their own behalf.id.because the administrative record was minimal,the courts of appeals had no complete or meaningful basis upon which to review application determinations.id.as a result,if the workers were not allowed to pursue their claims in the district court,they would not as a practical matter be able to obtain meaningful judicial review of their application denials or of their objections to ins procedures.id.citing the presumption favoring interpretations of statutes that allow judicial review of administrative action,the court concluded that it is most unlikely that congress intended to foreclose all forms of meaningful judicial review.id.
the difficulty with the minors argument is that mcnary was,at its core,a statutory interpretation case involving a completely different statute see shalala.council on long term care,d declining to apply mcnary because it turned on the different language of that different statute,and noting that the court suggested that statutory language similar to the language at issue here any claim arising under would have led it to a different legal conclusion.the point in mcnary was that congress used language a determination respecting an application for saw status that did not encompass the constitutional pattern and practice claims urged by the workers.as a consequence,their claims fell outside of the narrow channeling provisions of the statute.
in providing two alternative formulations of channeling language,the court more than foreshadowed what language would be expansive enough to remove district court jurisdiction.thus,the court note to congress laid out the language necessary to limit challenges to ins procedures and practices.mcnary,at.mcnary does not provide an avenue for litigants to circumvent an unambiguous statute.
we would be naive if we did not acknowledge that having an unrepresented minor in immigration proceedings poses an extremely difficult situation.but we are not convinced that agency removal proceedings raise the same concerns that were present in the saw proceedings.unlike the saw program,removal hearings are recorded and transcribed and provide a basis for meaningful judicial review.immigration judges are both trained and required to probe the record and to ask questions to elicit information about possible avenues of relief.see b detailing immigration judges obligation to administer oaths,receive evidence,and interrogate,examine,and the alien and any witnesses.immigration judges must adequately explain the hearing procedures to the alien,agyeman ins,cir,and where immigrants proceed pro se,the judges have a duty to fully develop the record.id.quoting jacinto ins,cir.they are also required to inform immigrants of any ability to apply for relief from removal and the right to appeal removal orders.see united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.
unrepresented minors receive additional special protections in removal proceedings.unless the child is accompanied by an attorney or legal representative,a near relative,legal guardian,or friend,the immigration judge can not accept the child admission of removability.c.immigration judges also must ensure that any waiver of the right to counsel is knowing and voluntary on review,we can indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver,united states cisneros rodriguez,cir.citation omitted,and when the petitioner is a minor,we factor the minor age,intelligence,education,information,information,and understanding and ability to comprehend into our analysis.jie lin ashcroft,cir.further,recognizing a growing need for support systems the courts can use to effectively and efficiently manage the cases of unaccompanied minors,in,the office of the chief immigration judge provided guidelines for the friend of the court model for unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings.although the friend of the court does not act as a representative,the friend assistance role can be critical in monitoring the proceedings.these protections distinguish removal proceedings from the saw program,and the concerns highlighted by mcnary are not in play.
at argument,counsel for the children claimed that it was essentially impossible to get the claim before a federal court.this assertion is belied by the fact that the minors counsel has previously raised a claim through the pfr process.see guzman heredia gonzales,cir.in guzman heredia,the petitioner was a boy who was placed in removal proceedings.he explained to the immigration judge that he had been unable to find an attorney to represent him and requested that the immigration judge appoint an attorney for him.the judge denied the request,stating that he could not give people a free lawyer.the immigration judge then ordered the petitioner removed,and the board of immigration appeals affirmed.at this stage,the petitioner obtained pro bono counsel,who argued in a pfr that 
petitioner fifth amendment right to due process was violated when the immigration judge refused to appoint an attorney to represent him in removal proceedings.because petitioner is an unaccompanied child of years of age,he is of limited cognitive abilities and lacks understanding of legal process.due to the seriousness of the proceedings against him and the importance of the interest at stake,namely immigration proceedings in which the government seeks to remove petitioner from his family,home and school in the united states,the constitution compels that petitioner have been afforded the protection of appointed counsel at public expense.
id.although the case ultimately settled,guzman heredia lays rest to the contention that claims will never surface through the pfr process.
the reality is that current counsel for the minors are in a unique position to bring multiple test cases on the counsel issue the claim in this suit is that indigent minors are entitled to counsel as a matter of constitutional and statutory right.for accompanied minors,a parent could make the claim or,for unaccompanied minors,a next friend could help them do so even better,the ij and the government could acknowledge that absent a knowing and voluntary waiver,a minor proceeding without counsel has de facto requested a right to counsel.
under any of these scenarios,a claim is teed up for appellate review.it is true that at present neither the immigration judge nor the board of immigration appeals has authority to order counsel.but the question at hand is a legal one involving constitutional rights.even if not raised in the proceedings below,the court of appeals has authority to consider the issue because it falls within the narrow exception for constitutional challenges that are not within the competence of administrative agencies to decide and for arguments that are so enti
