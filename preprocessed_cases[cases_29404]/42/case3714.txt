cosme medina,also known as cosme,returns to our court,again convicted of attempted reentry into the united states after removal in violation of.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and three years of supervised release,following a increase in his offense level for a prior conviction under california penal code section a,which criminalizes lewd and lascivious acts on a child under fourteen.we must decide whether,in light of mukasey,cir en banc,a conviction under section a constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,qualifying it as a crime of violence that warrants the increase under.we hold that it does.
we must also decide whether the district court erred in denying medina motion to dismiss the indictment grounded in the government deportation of material witnesses without first informing medina of his right to retain them,and medina motion to suppress his initial statements to the field agent for failure to give miranda warnings.we affirm the district court rulings and,under united states,d,reject medina argument on appeal that his conviction and sentence are unconstitutional.
factual and procedural background 
medina,who was seen by a border patrol agent running from the fence between the united states and mexico along with two other individuals,was apprehended after getting into the passenger seat of a parked car.blocking the car escape with his own parked vehicle,agent mills approached the suspects with his gun drawn and ordered the driver out of the car.mills then asked medina about his citizenship and immigration status,and medina answered that he was a mexican citizen with no immigration papers.medina was then arrested,waived his miranda rights,and was interrogated at a border patrol station.he told the agents that he was forced to cross the border under threat of physical harm.he explained that a smuggler tricked him to get him close to the border with the promise of work,obtained the phone number of medina family members and,under threat of injury,told them to pay.medina also stated that he was kept in the smuggler house for several days without food and that he was beaten when he tried to turn back from the fence.the border patrol agents then interviewed on the record the two other mexican nationals apprehended with medina.after determining that the witnesses did not corroborate medina allegations of duress,the government deported them to mexico.neither medina nor his counsel received an opportunity to interview the witnesses before they were deported.
before trial,medina moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that he was not advised of his right to retain material witnesses and that the government acted in bad faith in deporting the witnesses.after holding an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the motion,finding that the government did not act in bad faith and that the deported witnesses would not have provided testimony favorable to medina.medina also moved to suppress the statements he made to mills during the questioning immediately upon apprehension field statements.following another evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the motion,finding that medina was not in custody during that time.the jury convicted medina of attempted reentry into the united states after removal in violation of.
medina prior criminal history was particularly relevant to the sentence imposed by the district court.in,at that time as convicted of violating california penal code section a,which prohibits lewd and lascivious acts on a child under fourteen,and was subsequently deported.he attempted reentry soon thereafter and was convicted under,with a increase under for the prior section a conviction.in a published opinion,we upheld the district court conclusion that a conviction under california penal code section a is a categorical crime of violence,mandating the increase under.see united states,cir.medina was again deported.
at issue here is medina second unlawful reentry.for this most recent violation of,the district court sentenced medina to sixty months imprisonment and three years supervised release,again applying the increase for the prior conviction of a crime of violence,pursuant to.the district court relied squarely on our decision,but also noted that,within the contemporary meaning,that offense is categorically a crime of violence even without medina.medina timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
increase for a conviction under california penal code section a 
medina argues that his conviction under california penal code section a for lewd and lascivious acts with a child under the age of fourteen does not warrant a increase in his offense level under b a ii.the district court,relying on,held that a section a conviction constitutes a crime of violence,which triggers the increase.we affirm the district court and hold that our recent en banc decision in does not undermine its conclusion.
california penal code section a criminalizes the conduct of a ny person who willfully and lewdly commits any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body,or any part or member thereof,of a child who is under the age of years,with the intent of arousing,appealing to,or gratifying the lust,passions,or sexual desires of that person or the child.for a violation of,the sentencing guidelines provide for a base offense level of eight and instruct that the offense level be increased by sixteen levels i f the defendant previously was deported after a crime of violence.b a ii.the guidelines definition of crime of violence includes,inter alia,sexual abuse of a minor.id.at cmt.b iii in,in an appeal involving the identical defendant and the identical crime as those before us now,we held that a conviction under section a constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,and is therefore a crime of violence for purposes of b a,at.
we reaffirm that decisional law defining the term sexual abuse of a minor in the sentencing context,is informed by the definition of the same term in the immigration context,a a and vice versa,as established in.analyzing the term in in,we expressly relied upon the analysis in united states,cir,which took into account the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor in,at.further,established that congress intended sexual abuse of a minor in a a to carry its standard criminal definition.at.nothing in overrules prior case law interpreting the provisions in a parallel manner.moreover,the supreme court directs that we must interpret the statute consistently,whether we encounter its application in a criminal or noncriminal context.leocal ashcroft,d.with this admonition in mind,we outline the historical treatment of section a and related laws in our circuit.
case law establishing section a as a crime of violence 
under the version of,a increase was warranted if the conviction constituted an aggravated felony thus,in the sentencing context,courts were required to refer to the definition of aggravated felony in,which included then,as it does now,sexual abuse of a minor,a a.in,we reviewed whether section a proscribes sexual abuse of a minor as defined in a a.we first rejected any suggestion that the federal sexual abuse laws,codified at chapter of the united states code,limit the class of state laws reached by the term,at.instead,we interpret ed the undefined term sexual abuse of a minor by employing the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the words that congress used.id.internal quotation marks omitted.considering the full range of conduct covered by section a,id.internal quotation marks omitted,we determined that t he conduct indisputably falls within the common,everyday meanings of the words sexual and minor,id.at.we then held,categorically,that t he use of young children for the gratification of sexual desires constitutes an abuse.id.we thus concluded that a conviction under section a qualifies as an aggravated felony under a a because it constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,and,therefore,warrants the imposition of a offense level increase.id.
in,the sentencing commission revised the guidelines to provide a increase for crimes of violence and an increase for aggravated felonies.b.crime of violence was defined to include forcible sex offenses including sexual abuse of a minor.id.at cmt.b ii ii.subsequently,in,we considered the exact question posed a section a violation constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of.we noted that the facts were remarkably similar to those in united states,cir,in which we held that a conviction under a virginia statute prohibiting carnal knowledge of a child between thirteen and fifteen was a crime of violence because the underlying conduct constituted sexual abuse of a minor,at.expressly relying on baron medina,we concluded that the amendment to the guidelines did not alter our conclusion that a violation of section a constitutes sexual abuse of a minor.id.we therefore held that conviction under section a constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,and is therefore a crime of violence for purposes of b a.id.
the guidelines were revised again following to list sexual abuse of a minor as an independent example of a crime of violence.cmt.b iii changing the relevant definition of crime of violence from forcible sex offenses including sexual abuse of a minor to forcible sex offenses,statutory rape,sexual abuse of a minor.then,in united states,cir,reh g en banc denied,cir,we considered whether a north carolina statute that prohibits a person who is sixteen years of age or more and at least five years older than the victim from taking indecent liberties with a child under sixteen,punishes sexual abuse of a minor,and is thus a crime of violence under.employing the taylor united states,d,categorical approach and considering the full range of conduct criminalized by the statute,we held that it does not,at.central to our reasoning was the fact that the statute prohibits conduct that is not necessarily physically or psychologically harmful,and therefore,is not necessarily abuse.id.in so stating,we noted our agreement with conclusions that the use of young children for the gratification of sexual desires constitutes abuse,and that the conduct covered by section a is undoubtedly psychologically harmful.id.at alteration omitted quoting,at.by contrast,we concluded,the north carolina statute focuses on improper motivation and prohibits conduct that need not be either physically or psychologically harmful to the minor.id.at.because the conduct punished by the north carolina statute did not necessarily constitute abuse,we declined to conclude that it constitutes a crime of violence.id.at.
this line of cases reinforces the conclusion that a conviction under california penal code section a is a crime of violence because it constitutes sexual abuse of a minor.it also clarifies that we separate sexual abuse of a minor into three elements whether the conduct proscribed by the statute is sexual whether the statute protects a minor and whether the statute requires abuse.it demonstrates that in our analysis of the conduct covered by section a and similar statutes,we define the term abuse as physical or psychological harm in light of the age of the victim in question.see,at noting that,under,section a punishes abuse because it requires use of young children,implying harmful or injurious conduct internal quotation marks omitted united states,cir the age affects whether the conduct the statutory rape law covers constitutes abuse.valencia gonzales,cir noting that the age of the victim affects whether a statute is categorically a crime of violence united states,cir distinguishing california penal code section a,which criminalizes annoyance and molestation of minors under eighteen,from section a,particularly because section a applies only to minors of less than years of age,at w hen an older person attempts to sexually touch a child under the age of fourteen,there is always a substantial risk that physical force will be used to ensure the child compliance.internal quotation marks omitted,at the use of young children for the gratification of sexual desires constitutes an abuse.
the effect of our en banc decision in 
recently,in,we considered whether a conviction under any of four california statutory rape provisions constitutes the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor within the meaning of a.at.the statutes at issue were california penal code sections c,criminalizing intercourse with a minor more than three years younger than the perpetrator b,criminalizing sodomy of a person under eighteen b,criminalizing oral copulation with a person under eighteen and h,criminalizing penetration by a foreign object of a person under eighteen.applying the taylor categorical approach,at,we first determined the generic elements of the crime sexual abuse of a minor,at.because congress elected not to a definition for sexual abuse of a minor,we concluded that the reference in the statute carried the standard criminal definition.id.at.we decided that we did not need to survey current criminal law to ascertain a federal definition because congress has enumerated the elements of the offense of sexual abuse of a minor at.id.at.based on,we determined that the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor requires four elements a mens rea level of knowingly a sexual act with a minor between the ages of and and an age difference of at least four years between the defendant and the minor.id.to support our conclusion,we conducted a review of federal and state case law and the model penal code,and concluded that the congressional definition comports with the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the words.id.quoting,at.
we clarified that sexual abuse of a minor,as we defined it,is a common title for offenses under state criminal codes,noting that i n all cases that we were considering,the offenses define what would,in more common parlance,be referred to as statutory rape.id.at.indeed,each of the four statutory provisions at issue in penalized sexual offenses against persons under the age of eighteen,not just younger children.therefore,our construction of the generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor encompassed statutory rape crimes is,sexual offenses involving older as well as younger adolescents,not crimes prohibiting conduct harmful to younger children specifically.focusing on the abuse prong of the term,we concluded that our precedent and the precedent of our sister circuits treated these categories differently,acknowledg ing a significant difference between sexual relations with someone under and sexual relations with someone between the ages of and.id.at.for example,we noted that under national contemporary standards sexual activity with a younger child is certainly abusive,but sexual activity with an older adolescent is not necessarily abusive.id.at see also united states,cir this court and others have held that sexual offenses by adults against children carry the inherent risk of force upon or injury to the child.we found that the assumption that a minor legal incapacity implies that the proscribed sexual intercourse is may be valid where the minor is a younger child but does not hold true where the victim is an older adolescent,who is able to engage in sexual intercourse voluntarily,despite being legally incapable of consent,at alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.we also observed that t he fact that the vast majority of states do not forbid consensual sexual intercourse with a male or female indicates that such conduct is not necessarily abusive.id.at.
the distinction between offenses punishing sexual conduct with older adolescents and offenses punishing the same conduct with younger children explains why we and our sister circuits have consistently held that sexual offenses against younger children constitute crimes of violence.see,dos santos gonzales,cir holding that a conviction under a connecticut statute criminalizing contact with the intimate parts of a child under the age of sixteen years is a crime of violence united states,cir holding that a conviction under california penal code section a is a crime of violence,at,at,at holding that a conviction under a texas statute criminalizing the aggravated sexual assault of child under fourteen is a crime of violence ramsey ins,cir per curiam holding that a conviction under a florida statute criminalizing attempted lewd assault on a child under sixteen is a crime of violence united states,cir holding that a conviction under a utah statute criminalizing the indecent touching of a child under fourteen is a crime of violence.
applying these distinctions in,we held that because the california statutory rape provisions punished conduct not only with younger children but also with older adolescents,and did not require an age difference of four of the elements of,convictions under these statutes do not categorically constitute sexual abuse of a minor.at.contrary to medina argument,given that our holding was intended to define statutory rape laws only,in no way undermines our prior conclusion that t he use of young children for the gratification of sexual desires constitutes abuse,at see also,at,but instead reaffirms it.medina maintains that by using the federal statutory definition for sexual abuse of a minor,abrogates our explicit rejection of the federal definition in and overrules.because was intended by to define only statutory rape crimes,however,it does not undermine the conclusion of that does not define sexual abuse of a minor as applicable to younger children.in fact,rather than overruling,we affirmatively relied upon it in.see at.moreover,if we were to define sexual abuse of a minor in as limited to,we would eliminate the need for the separate and independent example of statutory rape as a crime of violence.when interpreting the guidelines,we must give meaning to all its words and render none superfluous.trw andrews,d.we therefore reject the proposition that defines the universe of sexual offenses contemplated by term sexual abuse of a minor.
finally,a literal reading of,taken to its logical conclusion,would lead to an absurd result.as noted above,one of the elements of the generic offense that we extrapolated from is that the minor be between the ages of twelve and sixteen,at.if the generic elements articulated in comprise all the conduct constituting sexual abuse of a minor,then no child under the age of twelve would be contemplated by the term minor,and sexual crimes against children under twelve would not be crimes of violence subjecting the offenders to a increase.because we do not believe that our en banc panel intended such a bizarre result,but was expressly considering statutory rape statutes only,we do not read to hold that provides the only relevant definition of the term sexual abuse of a minor found in.thus,and holdings that a violation of california penal code section a constitutes sexual abuse of a minor and warrants a increase under as a crime of violence remain valid law subsequent to.the district court did not err in increasing medina offense level by sixteen,thereby enhancing medina sentence.
deportation of material witnesses 
the district court did not err in denying medina motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to obtain medina waiver of the right to retain material witnesses.medina contends that the government failed to obtain from him a valid knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to retain a deportable alien witness,as required by united states,cir per curiam.after an evidentiary hearing and a review of the videotapes of the witness statements,the district court found that the two witnesses did not provide exculpatory evidence that would corroborate medina claim of duress.the district court also found that the government acted in good faith by videotaping the interviews with the witnesses.concluding that there is no bad faith and that medina was not prejudiced,the court held that a waiver was not required and denied the motion to dismiss the indictment.
the right to retain a deportable alien witness is based upon the fifth amendment guarantee of due process of law,const.amend.v,and the sixth amendment guarantee of compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in one favor,const.amend.vi.see united states,cir.we have previously held that this right may be subject to a knowing and intelligent waiver,at.the supreme court has since narrowly construed the right,however,holding that a constitutional violation may be found only if the criminal defendant makes a plausible showing that the testimony of the deported witnesses would have been material and favorable to his defense,in ways not merely cumulative to the testimony of available witnesses.united states,d.the court implicitly overruled lower threshold that a constitutional violation occurs when the government deports an alien whose testimony could conceivably benefit the defendant.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted p rompt deportation of alien witnesses who are determined by the government to possess no material evidence relevant to a criminal trial,the court reasoned,satisf ies immigration policy,and mitigates the substantial financial and physical burdens upon the government,not to mention the human cost to potential witnesses who are incarcerated though charged with no crime.id.at.
thus,the right to retain deportable witnesses is limited to the right to retain witnesses who are material and favorable to the defense.if the government conclude s that the witnesses possess no evidence relevant to the prosecution or the defense,id.at,it does not need to seek a waiver,and it may deport the witnesses before granting the defendant the opportunity to interview them thus,before reaching the question of whether medina waived his right under,we must examine whether the witnesses deported by the government in this case would have provided testimony that was material and favorable to the defense 
sets forth a test for determining whether the government unconstitutionally deported witnesses.t he defendant must make an initial showing that the government acted in bad faith and that this conduct resulted in prejudice to the defendant case.united states dring,cir.to establish that the government acted in bad faith,the defendant must show either that the government departed from normal deportation procedures or that the government deported the witness to gain an unfair tactical advantage over him at trial,at quoting dring,at.here,the government did neither.as explained below,border patrol agents questioned the two witnesses,determined they had no information that supported medina account of duress,and deported them.there is no indication that the government actions deviated from regular procedure or that it gained some tactical advantage from the deportation of these witnesses.thus,medina failed to demonstrate that the witnesses were deported in bad faith.
to demonstrate prejudice,the defendant must make a plausible showing that the testimony of the deported witnesses would have been material and favorable to his defense,in ways not merely cumulative to the testimony of available witnesses,at.dring,at.the supreme court recognized the difficulty for a defendant who has not had an opportunity to interview a witness in making a showing of materiality,and suggested the defendant may draw on the events to which a witness might testify,and the relevance of those events to the crime charged,at.
though medina has
