opinion of the court 
this appeal arises from the entry of an order of removal under a b an immigration judge ij found petitioner removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal,and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed.petitioner concedes removability under a b,but contests the adverse determination of his eligibility for cancellation of removal.because petitioner has failed to meet his statutorily prescribed burden of demonstrating eligibility for relief from removal,we will affirm.
facts procedural background 
petitioner damian syblis,a native and citizen of jamaica,entered the united states on may,as a nonimmigrant visitor.pursuant to his visa status,syblis was authorized to remain in the united states for a temporary period not to exceed three months.despite this limitation,he remained in the united states beyond three months without seeking additional authorization.
syblis contact with the law began on july,when he was charged with possession of marijuana,in violation of ann.the charges were later amended,for unknown reasons,to possession of drug paraphernalia,in violation of ann.he was convicted on november,of the amended charge.on march,in a matter unrelated to the incident,syblis was convicted of possession of marijuana,in violation of ann.
thereafter,on july,the united states department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against syblis,charging him with removability pursuant to a b for overstaying his visa authorization,and pursuant to a b i for his paraphernalia and marijuana convictions.appearing before an ij on april,syblis conceded removability on the grounds that he had overstayed his visa however,he contested his removability on the grounds that he was convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance.during that time,syblis also renewed a previous application for an adjustment of status,pursuant to a ii,and requested a waiver of criminal inadmissibility grounds,pursuant to h 
on june,the ij considered syblis controlled substances arguments to determine his eligibility under h.the ij concluded that both of syblis convictions for possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana related to controlled substances for purposes of a a i ii because syblis had two convictions that related to controlled substances,instead of only one,the ij found him ineligible for a waiver of criminal inadmissibility under h.the ij pretermitted syblis application for an adjustment of status,and ordered him removed from the united states to jamaica.
syblis appealed the ij determination of ineligibility to the bia.because syblis conceded removability under a b,the bia declined to reach the merits on his challenge to the ij decision to sustain the removal charge concerning a b i.in analyzing the ij denial of syblis request for relief,the bia first observed that syblis had the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for relief under the waiver statute.it then acknowledged that ann.punished paraphernalia offenses potentially related to controlled substances included within the controlled substances act the csa,such as methamphetamine,cocaine,heroin,and,and those not included within the csa,such as those recognized by the official united states pharmacopoeia national formulary.the bia based its ultimate conclusion on the fact that syblis had not meaningfully demonstrated that his conviction fell into the latter category.app.at.because syblis convictions both the paraphernalia offense and the marijuana offense appeared to relate to controlled substances,and syblis had not made any specific proffer otherwise,the bia affirmed the ij conclusion that he was statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under h.
this timely petition for review followed.

iii.analysis 
an alien applying for relief or protection from removal has the burden of proof to establish that the alien satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements.c a i see jean louis att y,cir an alien bears the burden of establishing his eligibility for discretionary cancellation of removal.if the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply,the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.d.
as previously noted,a a i ii renders inadmissible any alien convicted of a violation of any law or regulation relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title.a a i ii.and h provides for a waiver of that finding of inadmissibility,where the alien has been convicted of only a single offense of simple possession of grams or less of marijuana.h emphasis added.here,syblis has two convictions that potentially relate to controlled substances under a a i ii his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia under ann.and his conviction for possession of marijuana under ann.he has chosen to argue that ann.does not relate to controlled substances under a a i ii.if syblis is correct,he may be eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under h because he will have only been convicted of one law relating to a control led substance 
we are thus faced with the question of whether syblis has adequately met his burden of demonstrating his eligibility for relief.to meet this burden,syblis must affirmatively demonstrate either that ann.is not a law relating to a controlled substance or that the controlled substance involved in his conviction was not defined by federal law.see rojas attorney general,cir en banc analyzing a substantively identical statute to determine the government burden in a removal proceeding 
in his petition for review,syblis argues that he has met this burden he argues that ann.can not relate to controlled substances because the range of behavior targeted by the statute covers controlled drugs and not controlled substances.syblis finds this to be a key distinction,as the statute defines the terms drug and controlled substances separately.because,as he sees it,ann.does not relate to controlled substances,syblis contends that our inquiry is at an end,and our court need not reach the question of whether the controlled substance involved in his conviction was defined by federal law.alternatively,however,he argues that,if we conclude that ann.does meet the relating to portion of the analysis,he has still met his burden because his record of conviction is silent as to the type of substance involved in his offense.
we begin with a discussion of whether ann.relates to controlled substances for purposes of a a i ii.in rojas,we acknowledged a parallel but distinct line of cases developed to address situations in which the relevant federal conduct is presented not as a generic,unitary crime but as a conviction relating to other crimes or objects.at.analysis of those cases does not require a strict match between the federal and state statutes as required by the categorical approach see id.at noting that many cases deciding whether a statute relates to controlled substances involve statutes of conviction that have no exact federal analog,making impossible the comparison of elements that the categorical approach requires.rather,the inquiry focuses on the nature of the defendant conviction,and whether it stand s in relation,pertain s,has bearing of concern,or refer s to the object or crime of comparison.id.at quoting desai mukasey,cir.this inquiry hones in on the expansive scope generally accorded the relating to language.see,mizrahi gonzales,cir congress use of the phrase relating to in federal legislation generally signals its expansive intent.denis,cir applying the phrase relating to broadly luu le ins,cir observing that the ninth circuit has previously construed the relating to language broadly.
in order to determine whether ann.relates to controlled substances for purposes of a a i ii,we must,therefore,survey the interrelationship between ann.and controlled substances,and apply the phrase relating to broadly,seeking a logical or causal connection.denis,at alteration in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we find that this test is easily met here.
the statute specifically states 
i t shall be a misdemeanor for any person to possess or distribute controlled paraphernalia which shall mean a hypodermic syringe,needle or other instrument or implementation or combination thereof adapted for the administration of controlled dangerous substances by hypodermic injections under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use such controlled paraphernalia for purposes of illegally administering any controlled drug,or gelatin capsules,glassine envelopes or any other container suitable for the packaging of individual quantities of controlled drugs in sufficient quantity to and under circumstances which reasonably indicate an intention to use any such item for the illegal manufacture,distribution,or dispensing of any such controlled drug.
ann.tit.emphasis added.the statute defines controlled substance as any drug,substance,or immediate precursor in schedules i through vi,listing,for example,methamphetamine,cocaine,heroin,peyote,and.see ann.tit.the substances listed in schedules i through vi are covered,at least in part,by the csa.
syblis argues,however,that the underlying element of ann.refers to only the use of controlled drugs and not controlled substances.petitioner opening br.at.it is on this distinction that syblis bases his argument that ann.does not relate to controlled substances.he directs our attention to the fact that the term drug is defined separately in the statute as 
i articles or substances recognized in the official united states pharmacopoeia national formulary or official homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the united states,or any supplement to any of them ii articles or substances intended for use in the diagnosis,cure,mitigation,treatment,or prevention of disease in man or animals iii articles or substances,other than food,intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or animals iv articles or substances intended for use as a component of any article specified in clause i,ii,or iii or v a biological product.
ann.tit.he argues that this definition of the term drug mirrors the language of a statute we examined in borrome attorney general,cir,where we concluded that certain provisions of the statute did not relate to controlled substances.syblis argues that we should reach the same conclusion here.we disagree.this case concerns neither the same situation nor the same statute as in borrome.there,we examined the food,drug,and cosmetic act the fdca to determine whether it was a law relating to controlled substances.a significant point of distinction here is that the fdca is not a drug paraphernalia statute.on that point alone we are justified in disregarding that case for purposes of our analysis.
we decline to dismiss borrome so quickly,however,as that case brings to the forefront major flaws in syblis argument.despite syblis contentions,the fact that the remaining portion of ann.refers to drugs bears little on our analysis as to whether the statute stand s in relation,pertain s,has bearing of concern,or refer s to controlled substances.rojas,at quoting desai,at.we made this point in borrome 
a law need not require for its violation the actual involvement of a controlled substance in order to relate to a controlled substance.if congress wanted a correspondence between the laws of conviction and the federal csa,it would have used a word like involving instead of relating to in this vein,the bia and several of our sister courts of appeals have held that a law prohibiting the possession or use of drug paraphernalia is a law relating to a controlled substance.
at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.syblis construction of ann.cuts too narrowly for purposes of the relating to analysis and,rather than construe the language of the statute broadly,invites us to revert back to the analysis that we rejected in rojas.at stating that the formal categorical approach would not apply to a relating to inquiry.we decline that invitation.
the basis for our conclusion in borrome further demonstrates the error in syblis arguments.we concluded that the fdca prohibits countless activities that are completely unconnected to controlled substances and that the connection between the substances listed in the csa and those at issue in the fdca was not at all evident from the face of the statute.rojas,f d at quoting borrome,at.that is clearly not the case here.a nn.is plainly intended to criminalize behavior involving the possession or distribution of various substances at least some of which are covered by the federal schedules of controlled substances.this point is demonstrated by the statute use of the term controlled substances and its coinciding definition.further,the statute makes clear that an object is not controlled paraphernalia unless it is in some way linked to substances.indeed,the statute painstakingly describes the circumstances and intent that must be present in order for a conviction to be obtained under the statute,all of which relate to the production or use of substances that,again,are covered in part by the federal schedules of controlled substances.on this basis,we are satisfied that ann.is sufficiently connected to controlled substances so as to be related to controlled substances for purposes of a a i ii.see luu le,at although the definition of drug does not map perfectly the definition of controlled substance in our opinion the statute is clearly a law relating to a controlled substance.
because ann.relates to controlled substances for purposes of a a i ii,syblis must prove that the substance involved in his conviction was not defined by federal law in order to be eligible for relief.rojas,at.syblis faces an additional hurdle at the outset,however,because his record of conviction is inconclusive as to the specific substance involved.our inquiry thus compels us to determine whether an inconclusive record of conviction is sufficient to satisfy a noncitizen burden to demonstrate eligibility for relief from removal.for our court,this question is a matter of first impression.
five other courts of appeals have addressed this issue.the fourth,seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits have held that an inconclusive record is insufficient to satisfy a noncitizen burden of proving eligibility for discretionary relief.see sanchez holder,wl,at cir.july,noting that if,in the relief context,the analysis has run its course and the answer is still unclear,the alien loses by default young holder,cir en banc relying on the statutorily prescribed burden of proof to conclude that a noncitizen can not carry his burden of demonstrating eligibility for discretionary relief by merely establishing that record of conviction is inconclusive,overruling sandoval lua gonzales,cir concluding that an inconclusive record of conviction satisfies a noncitizen burden of establishing eligibility for discretionary relief accord salem holder,cir garcia holder,cir.each case relies heavily on the statutorily prescribed scheme associated with removal proceedings.
the fourth circuit,for example,explained that it is the alien burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the inadmissibility ground do es not apply.salem,at emphasis added.with an inconclusive record of conviction,i t is equally likely that the noncitizen was convicted of the federal crime as it is that he was not.id.at.the tenth circuit added that,t he fact that the noncitizen is not to blame for the ambiguity surrounding his criminal conviction does not relieve him of his obligation to prove eligibility for discretionary relief.garcia,at.on that basis,those courts have concluded that the noncitizen can not meet his or her burden where the record is inconclusive.
the only court to conclude otherwise is the second circuit,which employed th
