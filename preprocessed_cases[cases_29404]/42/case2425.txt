mohamadou tandia petitions for review of the order of the board of immigration appeals bia or board denying his applications for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat and ordering his removal from the united states.tandia claimed that he suffered persecution in his home country of mauritania and feared future persecution if he were forced to return.the immigration judge ij determined that tandia account of his two arrests and detentions was uncorroborated and not credible.tandia now contends that the ij credibility determination was erroneous and that he has demonstrated past persecution and a fear of future persecution.because we conclude that the ij credibility determination indeed was flawed and that the overall decision is not supported by substantial evidence,we grant the petition for review and reverse the decision of the board.
background 
tandia left mauritania in june and was admitted to the united states on a visa.he applied for asylum within weeks of his arrival.in april,he was served with a notice to appear that charged him with removability for overstaying his visitor visa.he conceded removability and requested,in addition to asylum,withholding of removal and cat relief.he claimed past persecution and a fear of future persecution on the basis of his race black,ethnicity soninke tribe and political opinion,including his membership in an opposition party,the united democratic front,union des forces d√©mocratiques ufd,and his resistance to the imposition of arabic as the official language in mauritanian schools.
after a hearing on the merits of the application in may,the ij denied all forms of relief because he believed that tandia testimony was not credible.however,tandia successfully challenged the accuracy of the translation at that hearing,and a second hearing was held in june.the ij,sitting in chicago,conducted the hearing by teleconference tandia,his attorney and an interpreter were in kansas city,missouri.
at the second hearing,tandia testified primarily about his political activity,which began when,at the age of nineteen,he became a member of the ufd to oppose laws that were against the people.at see also id.at.the ufd is a major opposition party in mauritania and has been banned by the government.according to tandia,the government persecuted him for his political activities on two occasions.first,in january,tandia and several other students organized a demonstration to protest the cessation of instruction in public schools.approximately students gathered outside the high school in kaeda.tandia and the other leaders of the rally,about to people,were arrested and taken to a detention facility outside the city,where they were held for eight weeks.during that time,they were interrogated every day,id.at,denied sufficient food and water and subjected to extreme heat,id.at.the guards regularly beat the students with sticks,belts,branches and their fists.tandia stated that he suffered injuries on my face,my back,my belly,my fingers,my arms.id.at.tandia and the other students never were charged with any crime or allowed to consult with lawyers.after eight weeks,the students were forced to promise not to engage in any further public opposition to the government,and they were released.
the second incident tandia described occurred years later,after he had abstained from political activity for a number of years following his detention and beating.however,after leaving his public high school,where classes were taught only in arabic,he organized another group to protest the high tuition and instruction in the public schools.tandia later enrolled in a private school where he received instruction in french instead of arabic.in august,tandia and the rest of the students in his class at the private school about were arrested.according to tandia,the reason for the arrests was that we would not stay in the public schools and be forced to learn in arabic as opposed to french.id.at.although he was not beaten,tandia suffered mental abuse and was detained for about four months.id.he was not released until after the national baccalaureate exam had been administered.without passing that exam,tandia could not continue with his education and,consequently,would be limited in his further intellectual and professional pursuits.
tandia testified that in december,shortly after he was released from detention,he paid a bribe and obtained a passport and visa.he crossed the border to senegal,and from there he traveled to the united states.
tandia family members corroborated his testimony.his uncle,bocar tandia,who received asylum in the united states after leaving mauritania in,testified at the hearing.he stated that,like tandia,he was involved in the ufd,the main political opposition there in mauritania fighting against the corrupted regime.id.at.according to bocar,from to the present,many black africans,such as members of the soninke tribe,experienced problems in mauritania.id.at.bocar testified that,if tandia returned to mauritania,he would be denied basic rights as a citizen,including education.tandia also submitted an affidavit from a cousin,issakha tandia,who corroborated his membership in the ufd and opined that tandia was in danger of being persecuted arrested,imprisoned,and possibly even killed due to his politics and his race.id.at.issakha and another cousin who submitted a letter on tandia behalf have been granted asylum in the united states.
the ij denied tandia requests for relief from removal.the ij believed that tandia credibility was lacking on several factors.id.at.first,the ij found,tandia provided inconsistent testimony about the year he had transferred from public school to private school and the year he had resumed political activity after his detention in.second,the ij found implausible one of the reasons tandia had given for fearing removal to mauritania,namely,that he could be punished for leaving the country based on his opposition to the government.the ij concluded that this statement was not credible because the government had given tandia permission to leave the country in the form of a passport.id.at.finally,the ij stated that tandia reasons for fearing a return to mauritania were vague and unconvincing and differed from his uncle testimony on the subject.id.tandia testified that he would be persecuted because he is a member of the opposition party,he is soninke,he participated in demonstrations,and he transferred to a private school bocar,on the other hand,testified that tandia rights as a citizen would be infringed as the government would force him to learn the arabic language and culture.id.
in addition to doubting tandia credibility,the ij determined that he had failed to corroborate his testimony.the ij noted that the state department country reports for mauritania painted a somewhat grim picture of life there for those of tandia race,tribe and political affiliation,but concluded that tandia nevertheless lacked specific evidence to corroborate his political activity or his arrests.the ij denied all forms of relief,and the bia affirmed without opinion.
discussion 
where,as here,the bia summarily affirms the ij decision,we review the ij decision as the final agency determination.see ayi gonzales,cir.our review is deferential we will reverse the ij findings that tandia was not credible,had not suffered past persecution and did not establish a fear of future persecution only if we determine that they are not supported by substantial evidence.see diallo ashcroft,cir.although tandia opening brief in this court mentions his claims for withholding of removal and cat relief,he does not set forth any arguments in support of these claims,so they are waived.see balliu gonzales,cir.
tandia first submits that the ij credibility determination is flawed because it rests on a few minor inconsistencies that do not undermine his testimony that,on two occasions,he was arrested and detained for a long period of time and that he was beaten frequently during the first detention.an ij credibility determination generally is entitled to deference,but it must be supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding,and it can not rely on trivial details or easily explained discrepancies.see ayi,at lhanzom gonzales,cir.
we agree with tandia that the ij reasons for discrediting his testimony concern only insignificant details in the account he gave of his persecution.the first two inconsistencies relied upon by the ij concern dates when tandia transferred to private school and when he reengaged in public political activity after being detained and beaten in.indeed,tandia written statement and oral testimony diverge on these points in his written account,tandia stated that he transferred to private school in january of,at at the hearing,tandia stated at least four times that he began private school in.id.at.when confronted about the discrepancy,tandia explained that he had not enrolled immediately in private school after leaving public school because he had to repeat some classes before he could begin his senior year at the private school.id.at.rather than evaluate this explanation,the ij ignored it,and concluded instead that the discrepancy in the dates rendered tandia an incredible witness notably,the central points of tandia testimony were consistent that the government enacted instruction in the public schools and that tandia changed schools so that he could continue his lessons in french.see san kai kwok gonzales,cir holding that the ij erroneously discredited an alien who confused the dates but consistently identified details of the underlying events hanaj gonzales,cir holding that the ij erroneously discredited the petitioner based on details when the alien description of the acts forming the basis of his persecution claim was consistent.indeed,the transcripts tandia placed in the record support his testimony that he transferred to private school,and the state department report confirms that bilingual education ended around this time.
the date on which tandia resumed political activities is also insignificant because he consistently testified that his arrest for that activity occurred in august,that he was arrested with a number of his classmates and that he was detained for four months.see san kai kwok,at hanaj,at.moreover,the statement in his affidavit that he started to organize opposition to the government education policies in is not inconsistent with his hearing testimony that he was arrested and detained for such activity in.
the ij next reason for discrediting tandia also is not supported by the record.the ij found it implausible that the government might,as tandia testified,persecute him because,among other reasons,he left the country the ij justified this opinion on the ground that the government would not have given tandia a passport if that were the case.as tandia points out,however,he had testified that he obtained his passport through bribery therefore,the issuance of a passport did not indicate official approval of his plans.the ij inference that the mauritanian government approved of tandia departure is not based on evidence in the record,but is based on speculation and conjecture.we can not uphold such a finding.see kllokoqi gonzales,cir.
the ij final reason for discrediting tandia rests on testimony that the ij summarily described as vague and unconvincing.the ij seems to suggest that tandia and his uncle gave different reasons for why tandia should fear future persecution,but no inconsistency is evident between tandia testimony and that of his uncle.tandia listed a number of reasons he expected political party,his race,his tribe.his uncle added some detail about the rights of citizenship tandia would be denied as a result of tandia membership in those persecuted classes.this illusory inconsistency is insufficient to discredit tandia testimony wholesale because,like the other reasons for the adverse credibility determination,it is unrelated to tandia central claim that he was twice arrested without cause and detained.see hanaj,at.the ij never addressed whether the events tandia described could amount to past persecution instead,he focused on insignificant details.in sum,the ij credibility determination suffers from factual error,bootless speculation,and errors of logic.see pramatarov gonzales,cir collecting cases.
the ij also determined that,because tandia was not a credible witness,his testimony alone did not suffice to meet the burden of proof in establishing eligibility for asylum.the ij,therefore,looked to the corroborating evidence tandia provided in support of his claims,and,finding it lacking,concluded that his request for asylum must be denied.tandia challenges this latter finding specifically,he contends that his claims are corroborated by evidence such as his ufd membership card,his school transcripts,his uncle testimony and the country reports that support his description of conditions in mauritania.tandia further suggests that corroboration was unnecessary because the ij never discredited his testimony regarding his arrests,detentions and beating 
we note that,if,on remand,the ij concludes that tandia is a credible witness,his testimony,standing alone and without the aid of corroborating evidence,may establish his eligibility for asylum.see a dawoud gonzales,cir.our conclusion that the asserted bases for the finding of incredibility can not stand,however,necessarily does not render tandia a credible witness.rather,the ij must reexamine his conclusion regarding credibility before turning afresh to the issue of corroboration.
as we have stated,before an ij may deny a claim for lack of corroboration,the ij must make an explicit credibility finding explain why it is reasonable to expect additional corroboration and explain why the alien explanation for not producing that corroboration is inadequate.gonzales,cir diallo gonzales,cir hussain gonzales,cir.had the ij ruling rested on a conclusion that additional corroborating evidence was available,but had not been provided,we would be constrained in our review by e of the real id act that section requires us to accept a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence unless a reasonable trier of fact would be compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense,the global war on terror,and tsunami relief,division id act of,e,stat,codified at b see also,at.our review of the ij decision in this case,however,reveals that the ij made no explicit finding regarding the availability of additional corroborating evidence his determination was only that tandia,who the ij had determined had not testified credibly,had failed to satisfy his burden of proof because he had failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence.
as this court recent decisions make clear,however,the ij must address the reasons offered by an alien for failing to provide the specific pieces of documentation that the ij deems necessary to sustain the alien burden of proof.id.at hussain,at diallo,at see also diallo ins,cir i n the absence of an assessment of the petitioner reasons for his failure to produce further corroboration the ij ultimate ruling can not stand.quoted in gontcharova ashcroft,cir.here,the ij decision on the lack of corroboration never addressed the explanations that tandia offered for the absence of the documentation the ij wanted.for example,the ij faulted tandia for failing to corroborate his testimony that he was the leader of the demonstration,that he was arrested and imprisoned in and,or that he sustained bodily injury from government officers.at.tandia had explained,however,that he could not document his arrests because he was never charged with any crime and because he could not approach anyone in government to verify his story.this explanation is bolstered by record evidence that baseless arrests and prolonged imprisonments of political prisoners,including students,occur in mauritania.the ij never addressed tandia explanation for the lack of other documentation.the ij also failed to address tandia explanation that he never sought medical treatment for the injuries he suffered during the first arrest because he was afraid of seek
