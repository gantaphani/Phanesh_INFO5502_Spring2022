opinion of the court 
we have stressed previously that a s judicial officers,immigration judges have a responsibility to function as neutral and impartial arbiters and must assiduously refrain from becoming advocates for either party.abdulrahman ashcroft,cir.here,we find the immigration judge ij failed this basic requirement.
petitioner qun wang alleges that his wife was forcibly sterilized after giving birth to a second child.the ij found him incredible and denied him relief from deportation.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed.because of the manner in which the ij conducted wang hearing,and the deficiencies in her opinion,we do not believe that the existing record can sustain an adverse credibility finding.accordingly,we will grant the petition.
events in china 
wang is a old native and citizen of the people republic of china.he alleges that an intrauterine device iud was forcibly inserted into his wife by government officials after she gave birth to their first daughter in november.wang claims that because the daughter was born with a disability,and because he and his wife wanted a son,they asked the local authorities for permission to have a second child.their request was denied pursuant to fujian province family planning regulations,under which those with an agricultural registration,including wang wife,are not permitted to have more than one child.ar.wang alleges that his wife had the iud removed by a private doctor and she became pregnant again in december.wang wife hid at her parents house until she gave birth to a second daughter.because she did not wish to burden her ill and aging parents,and because she did not desire to remain in hiding forever,wang wife returned home one month after the birth of her second daughter,in october.shortly thereafter,wang alleges that a local birth control cadre came into their home and dragged his wife to a family planning center where she was involuntarily sterilized.wang submitted into evidence the fujian province family planning regulations that prescribe such measures.the officials also allegedly fined wang rmb or renminbi,and upon his refusal to pay,began deducting a penalty from wang parents retirement pension.
wang claims that,in the period between his wife forced sterilization and his departure for the united states,he unsuccessfully attempted to procure a visa to the united states using false documents.he also allegedly wrote a letter to the united nations human rights commission describing the above incidents.he delivered that letter to the united states consulate in guangzhou but denied to consular officials that it related to himself out of fear that its contents might be communicated to chinese authorities.wang ultimately left china for the united states through a smuggler whom he paid approximately in borrowed funds.
proceedings in the united states 
wang arrived in the united states in january without valid entry documents.the former immigration and naturalization service ins commenced removal proceedings against wang in february,charging him with removability under ina a a i i,a a i i.wang conceded removability but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.in particular,wang claimed that he had been subject to past persecution on account of political opinion.see a providing that forced sterilization constitutes persecution on account of political opinion matter of,bia en banc holding that past persecution of one spouse can be established by coerced abortion or sterilization of the other spouse.a hearing was held before immigration judge annie garcy in december.
hearing before the immigration judge 
at his hearing before judge garcy,wang was represented by yee ling poon.xiomara appeared on behalf of the ins.the ij questioning of wang during his asylum hearing preshadowed her hostile attitude towards him and his claims.
after counsel and the ij took wang through a recital of his basic factual allegations,they reached his claim that his parents pension was being withheld as a penalty for his violation of birth control policy.the ij questioned wang as to why he had not paid the fine he was issued as a result of that violation,in order to restore his parents pension 
judge to wang 
well,why do you just pay the fine and solve your parents sic problem.i do understand why you have paid it.
i do not have the money to pay.
oh come on.you here in the united states of america after having paid a smuggler to get here.and a lawyer working on your case and you dressed in a suit and tie and you want me to believe that you ca pay.
a.the money i pay to the snake head smuggler i have to borrow money in order to pay the snake head.
q.so you choose to pay the smuggler instead of paying the fine and protecting your parents sic pension.what sympathy do you want from me about that 
not that i do not want to protect my parents.if i will stay in china no one will lend me money to pay the fine.
you not in china,you in the united states and you making money when you work.
q.so why do you expect sympathy from me that you choose to pay money to a smuggler instead of protecting your parents sic pension you must be out of your mind if you think i have sympathy for that.
first of all,i believe when government impose fine against my family it outrageous.secondly,i owe a lot of money to different sources and i have to pay them back.they force me to.certainly i do regularly send money back to support my parents.
all these sources that you describing are a bunch of illegal people who conspired with you for you to be smuggled into the united states.are those the sources that you describing to me 
yes,my trip was arranged by snake head.
well understand clearly,i have no sympathy with your problem about that.
when counsel poon attempted to question wang further about the pension,the ij instructed her to get off the pension thing,but she then persisted in pursuing the very theme she told counsel to avoid.her exchange with poon went as follows 
judge to poon 
it ridiculous.go away from this issue and move on because it just insane.
i am not trying to stick on it.i only trying because i was asked for him to explain why he edit his asylum claim now.
i do even know why he put it in.to me it just makes me more convinced that your client is willing to do anything,even to the detriment of his parents,to take care of himself.you and i both know,there is nothing that happened in this case,nothing in the sworn statement that even going to begin to explain why he chose to come here at the moment that he did,okay.
i will ask him.
and you can ask him and i know what he going to say.he finally had the money together or whatever he needed to pay the smugglers because there nothing here at all and maybe we learn something suddenly today.that there nothing here about the timing and there nothing to convince me that he should have gone ahead and paid that fine first before he came here.
because he had no money when he was in china.
i do know about that.
that what he said.
well,that what,he can say anything he wants.
when poon later objected that the government fine for having a second child should not be linked to the engagement of a smuggler to leave china,judge garcy responded 
well,it sure does.he complaining about how his parents sic pension is being taken away because the fine is paid,and i saying,pay the stupid fine and then complain about it later because if his claim is oh,boo who,you know,this horrible fine is being imposed upon me and i entitled to asylum,there absolutely no reason why the claim ca be made even after the fine gets paid.
ultimately,counsel was able to move on to more pertinent issues,such as why wang wife did not accompany him to the united states,or travel here instead of him,why he left china when he did,why he would not want to return to china,his dealings with the american consulate general office,his employment in china,his understanding of the prevailing birth control regulations and his various encounters with the birth control authorities,his wife current situation in china and her reasons for returning home after the birth of the second child.in connection with the last issue,the ij asked wang 
q.why could she have stayed longer than a year and helped take care of that sick relative and everything like that 
because while my wife was there my handicapped child was there as well.
well,wherever your wife goes the child with the disability goes,right 
and let talk about her.have you ever had medical records about your darling first child ming wang brought to the united states of america yes or no.i want a short answer,yes or no.do you have her medical records here,yes or no 
only photos.
okay.well why have you ever,ever gone to a doctor in the united states with medical records about your first born child to see whether there a better treatment for her here in this country 
i did produce my daughter old film to my cousin and my cousin helped me to inquire doctors and we were told that in america she might need operation.
well why do you have any medical records here to prove to me that you care enough about your daughter to have asked the doctor here about her welfare 
i really indeed care my daughter,but i just was not aware that i need such document be produced into the court.
well you care about your daughter,that interesting because all you write about in your application here is how you want to try to have your wife come here because you upset about his fine and you upset about how you ca produce a son.why is it in all these pages you never once made any effort to try to find out whether medical care would be available to your child here potentially even on a visa for her to travel to this country 
indeed i am a father of a child.i really care for my kids especially my daughter and i just did not,i was just not aware that i need to produce such a particular document to this court.
the judge eventually moved on to ask wang about the similarities between his wife submission to the court,and his own account.she then again asked wang why he delayed his departure from china for such a long time.wang responded 
actually when my wife was forcefully sterilized i had such desire to leave the country,but as i explained before it not the easy that whenever you want to leave you want to go to america you can easily achieve such goal.you have to go through many people help.
i guess one of the things you had to do was you had to invent some kind of a lie and go over to the embassy and try to be an imposter and try to lie about trying to get a visa under another name first,that was important for you to try to do that first,is that right you did want to miss a chance to do that now did you 
no,not exactly the case.actually when i,especially my wife was sterilized,my family was persecuted and i did not know many alternatives and eventually my friend help me and obtain the visa for me and try a visa to come here.
the ij inquired further as to why wang wife has not come to the united states instead of wang,and then terminated the hearing.
oral opinion of the immigration judge 
the ij oral opinion was consistent in tone and substance with her comments during the preceding hearing.e mbarass ed to have wang in her court room,in her oral opinion,she described wang as obsessed with having a son and maligned him for ignor ing his daughter.she reiterated her horror that wang was interested only in his wife ability to reproduce instead of taking responsibility for the child that is in existence at the present time.that is an outrageous thing.she observed that she was comfortable denying asylum to the respondent as a matter of discretion because he a horrible father as far as the court concerned because he pays no attention to his daughter except to the extent that a picture of her arm might win the heart of the undersigned so as to have the respondent granted asylum in this court.she indicated that she was not bothered about the respondent plight.id.
the ij found wang wife statement of events incredible in part because she too failed to exhibit the sentiments the ij was looking for.the ij explained that b oth the respondent and his wife,shocking to the conscious sic of the undersigned,make absolutely no comments about how they wish that they could come to the united states for careful medical treatment of their first born daughter who apparently has limited physical mobility in her arms.she concluded from this that the wife statement was obviously designed for her to sign and untruthful.in her disdain for the wangs,the ij seriously considered the possibility that wang wife was sterilized after wang arrived in the united states,perhaps to aid his asylum application.
in her opinion,the ij affirmed her earlier characterization of wang as selfish for refusing to pay the fine for his second child that just so horrible that the respondent would allow his parents to have their pension taken away because the respondent egotistically does want to pay a fine that imposed upon him and his family.the ij later continued in other words,he thinks it more ethical to make his wife and his parents suffer than it is to pay smugglers.
finding it ridiculous that wang had not made headway on the fine while working in the united states,the ij warned wang if the respondent thinks that this court is going to be sympathetic to the fact that he owes smugglers and he worried about his welfare here,the respondent is sadly mistaken.there is absolutely nothing noble,not even for seconds in paying a smuggler even one cent of money when the respondent is here in the federal building that houses the united states attorneys office and could file a statement against the smuggler.based on this reading of the situation,the ij found that the respondent problem with the fee is self imposed because the respondent has chosen to pay a smuggler instead of paying off a fee.
in the course of her opinion,the ij focused repeatedly on wang actions towards his elder daughter and parents.the ij found infuriating and beyond comprehension that wang never even one time did anything honest on behalf of his disabled daughter,he allegedly failed to pursue free medical treatment for his elder daughter in the united states.accordingly,the ij chose to humiliate wang,observing that 
wang s pends a lot of time talking about how he can get his wife sterilization reversed so that he could have more kids and does spend one line talking about what he might do for his child that he actually has.for the child that is alive.for the child that should matter.for the child who apparently ca even feed herself and dress herself.that a situation that the respondent has crafted that obviously is troubling to the court because it certainly does reveal somebody who acts with selfishness and who acts with complete disdain for honesty with regard to an application for a visa,and frankly,with complete lack of concern about somebody who he has created.
the ij appeared to believe these considerations were relevant to the sensibleness of the claim that presented,discretionary factors that this court feels comfortable to consider under the immigration nationality act and frankly just the law applicable to the case.
appeal to the board of immigration appeals 
after the ij rejected wang claims,he appealed her order to the bia.the bia,addressing only wang asylum claim,dismissed the appeal in june.in a opinion,the bia upheld the ij adverse credibility determination as not clearly erroneous and agreed with her that the events described by wang were inherently implausible.as examples of the inconsistencies and implausibilities in wang account,the bia wondered why wang wife returned home after successfully hiding at her parents house and why wang remained in china after the persecution began.it also noted the absence of corroborating evidence showing that family planning officials were penalizing wang parents as a result of wang birth control policy violation.
wang now appeals the order of the bia where an opinion issued by the bia essentially adopts the opinion of the ij,we review the latter.see gao ashcroft,cir.in this case,the bia brief opinion relies heavily on the opinion of the ij.alaelua ins,cir finding that the bia adopted the ij opinion where the bia failed to analyze the rele
