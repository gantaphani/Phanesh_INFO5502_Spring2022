opinion of the court 
besik gambashidze,a native of the republic of georgia,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying him withholding of removal.the applications of his wife,anna,and their four children are dependent on his application.this case requires us to address for the first time a recently codified regulation,b i b,which controls how the possibility of relocation within the proposed country of removal affects the claim of an alien who seeks withholding of removal based on past persecution.
gambashidze was politically active in georgia in the following its independence from the soviet union in,ultimately joining a group known as the round table,which opposed georgian president eduard shevardnadze.for this activity,gambashidze was allegedly persecuted by the police,both in tbilisi the capital of georgia and in his hometown of rustavi,a city kilometers southeast of tbilisi.the persecution lasted from early to,at which time gambashidze and his family moved to another home in tianeti,a city fifty kilometers north of tbilisi.details of his stay in tianeti are scant,but he did not encounter the police in his eight months there.
in early,gambashidze came to the united states on a tourist visa,and the rest of his family followed over the next eighteen months.gambashidze applied for various forms of relief to avoid being removed to georgia,but was unsuccessful on all claims before the immigration judge ij and on appeal before the bia.on this petition for review he challenges only the bia disposition of his claim for withholding of removal.the bia assumed,arguendo,that gambashidze had demonstrated past persecution,and was therefore entitled to a presumption of a likelihood of future persecution.see b i.the board nonetheless held him ineligible for withholding of removal because he had not met his burden of proof in demonstrating that he has a well founded fear of persecution upon return to georgia because he and his family were able to internally relocate and live unmolested for several months prior to entering the united states.
the bia invoked b i b to reach this result.the regulation envisions a inquiry whether relocation would be a successful means of escaping persecution,and whether relocation would be reasonable.while there is ample evidence that it would be reasonable for gambashidze to relocate to tianeti,the record discloses next to nothing about the true viability of tianeti as zone for gambashidze.since the burden of proof in an rebuttal is on the government,b ii,the slim record on this critical point can not support the bia decision.because there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record for the bia conclusion regarding internal relocation,we will grant the petition for review.
i.the administrative record and the bia decision 
the administrative record consists principally of gambashidze live testimony before the ij,very brief live testimony by his wife,the state department country report on georgia the country report,and the affidavits and statements submitted by gambashidze in connection with his application.since neither the ij nor the bia rested their decisions on information in the country report,we will not discuss it.as for gambashidze testimony and written submissions,the ij found him not credible,but the bia did not rest its decision on credibility grounds therefore,for ease of exposition we will present gambashidze testimony as truthful.
gambashidze testimony 
as we have already noted,gambashidze was politically active as an opponent of georgian president eduard shevardnadze.gambashidze had been a supporter of georgia first president,zviad gamsakhurdia,who was removed after less than a year in office in the coup that resulted in shevardnadze control of georgia.gambashidze remained loyal to factions,and opposed shevardnadze this political activity consisted mainly of his membership and participation in a group known as the round table.he participated in round table demonstrations and rallies and gave the group financial assistance.
gambashidze testimony and written submissions do not suggest that he was persecuted for his political activity from to,but a series of encounters with police based on his round table activity began in.in february,he participated as a speaker at a rally in tbilisi,representing his hometown of rustavi.a large number of police broke up the demonstration,and gambashidze was taken to police headquarters.there,he was beaten on his feet and stomach and released after five hours.then,in july of,gambashidze was summoned to police headquarters in rustavi,where he was warned to cease participating in demonstrations.he did not.
in september,four rustavi policemen came directly to his house at night and took him away he was beaten on his feet,and again told to stop participating in round table demonstrations.gambashidze wife corroborated his account of the police coming to the house,and the foot injury that gambashidze sustained.in march of,while on a visit to tbilisi,gambashidze was apprehended by a police patrol and brought to police headquarters.he was handcuffed to a pipe and beaten,and again warned to stop participating in political demonstrations.two months later,in may,police took him from his house in rustavi to the rustavi office of the ministry of internal affairs,where a official tried to force him to confess to participation in a recent attempt to assassinate president shevardnadze.gambashidze claimed he had no involvement and would not confess he was severely beaten and the internal affairs official threatened him and his family.
at this point,in gambashidze words,he had reached the edge i started making ready to get out of georgia.the family moved to a summer house owned by gambashidze wife in tianeti.while gambashidze lived may until january had no incidents with the police.he was able to make at least one trip to tbilisi to obtain a visa from the american embassy without being stopped by the police.while none of gambashidze family had trouble with the police in tianeti,after gambashidze left for the united states in january police inquired of his mother as to his whereabouts.it is not entirely clear whether gambashidze continued his political activity while in tianeti.he did not specifically testify that he engaged in political demonstrations while he was living in tianeti,but in response to a general question at the beginning of his testimony,for how many years did you engage in those political demonstrations he answered,i would say up to.
gambashidze and his family came,two at a time,to the united states during and.he applied in late for various forms of relief that would allow him and his family to remain in the united states.
b.the ij decision and the bia affirmance 
the ij rejected all of gambashidze claims on various and multiple grounds,most of which do not concern us here since gambashidze has petitioned for review of only the denial of his claim for withholding of removal.the ij denied him relief on that claim on two grounds first,that he had not supported his claim with credible testimony,and second,that even taking his testimony as true,gambashidze accounts of his life in georgia did not establish past persecution or any probability of future persecution.the bia affirmed in a per curiam opinion,in which it advanced a different ground for denying the claim for withholding of removal that gambashidze could avoid any future persecution by relocating within georgia.specifically,the bia stated 
w e find that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof in demonstrating that he suffered past persecution or has a well founded fear of persecution upon return to georgia.specifically,the respondent has not met his burden of proof in demonstrating that he has a well founded fear of persecution upon return to georgia because he and his family were able to internally relocate and live unmolested for several months prior to entering the united states.
we have jurisdiction under over this timely petition for review of this final determination of the bia.
