petitioner argues that,by finding him ineligible for section c relief,the bia denied him equal protection.relying on komarenko ins,cir,the panel held that petitioner is eligible for section c relief.abebe gonzales,cir,vacated,cir.under komarenko,at,a deportable alien can be eligible for section c relief only if his grounds for deportation are substantially identical to a ground for inadmissibility here,petitioner is deportable for committing an aggravated felony,a a iii,which the panel held is substantially identical to the most analogous ground for a crime involving moral turpitude,id.a a i i.abebe,at.petitioner claims that the rationale of komarenko ca be squared with that of ins,cir.he therefore asks us to overrule komarenko,and hold that a deportable alien can only be eligible for section c relief if his conviction is substantially identical to a ground for inadmissibility.see abebe,at berzon,concurring.
under its plain language,section c gives the attorney general discretion to grant lawful permanent residents relief only from not deportation.see c repealed,though,followed francis ins,cir,and held that equal protection required us to extend section c relief to aliens facing such aliens would have been eligible for section c relief from inadmissibility,had they left the united states and attempted to reenter,at.in following francis,reasoned that there is no rational basis for granting additional immigration relief to aliens who temporarily leave the united states and try to reenter,aliens facing inadmissibility,and not to aliens who remain in the united states,aliens facing deportation,at.according to francis and,it is wholly irrational for congress to give any advantage to aliens outside the united states that it denies to similarly situated aliens within the united states.
we are not convinced that francis and accorded sufficient deference to this complex legislative scheme,and therefore reconsider this question,as we are authorized to do en banc.we note at the outset that the statute does discriminate against a discrete and insular minority or trench on any fundamental rights,and therefore we apply a standard of bare rationality.united states,cir quoting alvarez dist.dir.of the ins,cir.congress has particularly broad and sweeping powers when it comes to immigration,and is therefore entitled to an additional measure of deference when it legislates as to admission,exclusion,removal,naturalization or other matters pertaining to aliens.see kleindienst mandel,d boutilier ins,d flemming nestor,d.our task,therefore,is to determine,not whether the statutory scheme makes sense to us,but whether we can conceive of a rational reason congress may have had in adopting it 
we can congress could have limited section c relief to aliens seeking to enter the country from abroad in order to create an incentive for deportable aliens to leave the country.pasquarell,cir quoting laguerre reno,cir see desousa reno,cir.a deportable alien who wishes to obtain section c relief will know that he ca obtain such relief so long as he remains in the united states if he departs the united states,however,he could become eligible for such relief.by encouraging such,the government could save resources it would otherwise devote to arresting and deporting these aliens.see greene,cir,abrogated in part by ins cyr,d.saving scarce resources that would otherwise be paid for by taxpayers is certainly a legitimate congressional objective.
our dissenting colleagues argue that the reason we attribute to congress is not so rational after all because aliens who are excludable yet potentially eligible for a section c waiver are generally allowed to enter and to apply for waiver from within the country,and so the government will wind up having to deport those aliens anyway,if they are denied c relief.dissent at.but the fact that the government may choose,as a matter of grace,to admit aliens who seem very likely to be granted c relief does not mean that it wo exclude those it believes are less likely to obtain such relief.the rationality of the statute lies in giving that discretion,on a case by case basis,to an agency that can assess the likelihood of the alien success and the cost of his removal 
the dissent makes a similar error when it argues that it is inconsistent with the statutory scheme to assume that a rational congress would want these persons to leave the country.dissent at.the supposed irrationality here,as we understand it,would be in having people leave the country only to be after they are granted relief.
the dissent overlooks the fact that not all those who apply for relief ultimately receive it many,perhaps most,will not.and as to those,it makes perfect sense to want them to be outside our borders when they get the bad news.at that point,they can not rely on inertia to remain in the country despite the adverse decision,and force the government to chase them down and pay for their deportation.as judge posner noted in laguerre reno,cir,t o induce their voluntary departure,a little carrot is dangled before them,consisting of the opportunity to seek a waiver should they seek to return to the country and by doing so trigger exclusion proceedings.to what extent this will actually save the government resources is something we wo know until we try it,but it is hardly irrational to presume that a significant number of aliens may decide to depart in order to get a shot at c relief.congress certainly is entitled to experiment,without interference from the judiciary for much the same reason,the dissent is mistaken in arguing that we undermined the validity of f under the rationale of ins cyr,d.dissent at.the ins may certainly choose to treat different classes of aliens the same,even though the statute does not,and nothing in cyr prevents it from doing so.of course,our ruling might cause the government to reconsider the regulation,and eventually repeal it as no longer necessary.but that up to the government nothing we say today casts any doubt on the regulation.
we thus overrule holding that there no rational basis for providing section c relief from inadmissibility,but not deportation.the bia therefore did violate petitioner right to equal protection by finding him ineligible for section c relief from deportation.since petitioner was not eligible for section c relief in the first place,the bia could not have committed an equal protection violation by denying him such relief.we affirm the bia section c ruling,and have no reason to reconsider komarenko.indeed,under our ruling today,komarenko becomes a dead letter,as its only purpose was to fill a gap created by.
petitioner also argues that the ij erred by denying his claim for withholding of removal.but petitioner did raise a withholding of removal claim in his brief before the bia,and the bia was therefore not required to consider it.see,bowers collegiate athletic ass n,cir issues raised in the notice of appeal but not argued in appellant principal brief are deemed abandoned.when a petitioner files no brief and relies entirely on the notice of appeal to make an immigration argument,as he may do before the bia,see f,then the notice of appeal serves in lieu of a brief,and he will be deemed to have exhausted all issues raised therein.but when a petitioner does file a brief,the bia is entitled to look to the brief for an explication of the issues that petitioner is presenting to have reviewed.petitioner will therefore be deemed to have exhausted only those issues he raised and argued in his brief before the bia.here,petitioner did file a brief,which did not raise the withholding of removal issue.he therefore did exhaust that claim,and we lack jurisdiction to review it.barron ashcroft,cir citing d.to the extent ladha ins,cir,is to the contrary,it is overruled.
petition denied in part and dismissed in part 
i concur in the judgment,denying in part and dismissing in part yewhalashet abebe petition for review.i do not join most of the majority opinion however,because i believe it is both unnecessary and unwise to overrule our prior decision in ins,cir,to reach that result.the government has not advocated such a drastic step.the original decision by a panel of our court,abebe gonzales,cir,reached the same result in this case as the majority reaches today,simply by applying our existing precedent,komarenko ins,cir.the en banc panel should do the same.
i share the concern expressed in the dissent with overruling more than sixty years of agency precedent and more than years of our own precedent.i also share the fear that the path taken by the majority puts into jeopardy the agency ability to continue to grant discretionary relief in removal proceedings pursuant to.although the majority says otherwise,its interpretation of the statute appears to leave no room for that practice to continue.in addition,i would prefer to avoid aggravating a circuit split with the numerous other courts that have adopted the same balance we struck in komarenko.
i nevertheless concur in the judgment because i conclude that aliens who could have been,but were not,charged with removal on grounds equivalent to a ground for inadmissibility are not similarly situated to aliens who were actually so charged.abebe equal protection challenge therefore fails.put another way,although i agree with most of part i of the dissent,i disagree with part ii and do not believe we should overturn our decision in komarenko and follow the second circuit recent decision in blake carbone,cir.i would adhere to komarenko and deny abebe petition accordingly.
as the dissent points out,since at least the executive branch now in the form of the department of homeland security,or dhs,and formerly through the immigration and naturalization service,or ins has interpreted the immigration and nationality act ina as granting it the discretion to afford relief from both deportation of an alien inside the united states,a process now called removal and exclusion of an alien seeking admission to this country at the border,now described as inadmissibility.see matter of,bia.congress was aware of this practice when it drafted the amendments to the ina,including section c.see in the matter of,bia examining the legislative history.although the amendments made it harder for aliens to qualify for such discretionary relief,there is nothing in the legislative history,which catalogued other perceived abuses,to suggest that congress disapproved of the government use of the predecessor to section c to grant waivers in deportation proceedings.this is among the reasons that the board of immigration appeals held,shortly after the amendments passage,that the attorney general retained the discretion under section c to grant relief in both deportation and exclusion proceedings.id.
initially,the government permitted aliens to apply for relief from deportation only if they had temporarily left the country such that they might have been subject to exclusion.in,we held in that there was no rational basis in the context of section c for discriminating against aliens who had remained in the united states.ins,cir.
today,the majority holds that we were mistaken in and that there is a legitimate basis for so limiting the availability of section c relief.even assuming there are arguments in favor of that position,we rejected it years ago.there is no compelling reason to overturn that judgment now.no relevant circumstances have changed,and our decision has been on the books for nearly three decades without causing any mischief in the law.the majority may be animated by a desire to avoid future problems or more expansive conceptions of equal protection,such as that expressed by the second circuit in blake,but that appears to me to be an empty fear.we have extended rationale to other situations,and any putative harm in the future could more easily be avoided by continuing to limit that precedent to its context.
the majority does quarrel with the legal rule of,that the equal protection clause prohibits irrational disparities in treatment.it simply disagrees with the application of that rule to a statutory provision that was repealed a dozen years ago.it disagrees that the disparate treatment our court previously concluded was irrational is,in fact,irrational.reasonable minds may always disagree over the outcome of a close case,however,and our prior conclusion is consistent with the conclusions of every other circuit.i see no justification for saying now that all of those decisions were incorrect,especially when the vitality of section c,a statute long since repealed,has already diminished to near insignificance.there is no pressing need to pay so little heed to the weight of precedent and correct what,at most,is simply a misapplication of an agreed upon rule.
the rational basis the majority identifies in support of discriminating against aliens who failed to temporarily leave the united states after committing an offense that might qualify them for removal or inadmissibility relies on a tenuous chain of inferences.the majority hypothesizes that congress anticipated that some aliens might decide to travel across the border based on knowledge that,under the immigration statute,they could be eligible for discretionary relief if they left the country and returned,but would not be so eligible if they did not leave the country.the majority further speculates that,from the group of aliens who left the country for this reason,some might be successfully stopped at the border upon their return and denied reentry,thereby saving the government the expense of having to later remove them.perhaps.but it is not an accident that the majority opinion finds it necessary to acknowledge,at,that it is not seeking to identify the actual rationale for the legislation.i doubt that anyone believes that the majority tortured construct was in the mind of anybody on capitol hill.justifications for overruling one of our court longstanding precedents should be made of sterner stuff.we might just as well say that congress simply preferred to let the agency grant discretionary relief only to those aliens who love international travel.we must place some rational bounds on what survives rational basis review if the constitutional right of equal protection is to have any meaning whatsoever outside the context of suspect classifications 
not only does the majority overrule our precedent,it casts doubt on dhs power to grant section c relief in deportation or removal proceedings.it concludes that u nder its plain language,section c only gives the attorney general discretion to grant lawful permanent residents relief from deportation.majority op.at emphasis in original.in doing so,the majority holds that years of agency practice was contrary to the will of congress and in violation of the plain language of the statute the agency is charged with interpreting,and that countless otherwise deportable or removable aliens have remained in this country due to the agency error.
later,when addressing the dissent,the majority says otherwise and contends that nothing in the opinion undermines the validity of f.that regulation codifies dhs approach,which we approved of in komarenko,of limiting the availability of section c relief in removal proceedings to aliens charged with removal on a ground that has a substantially identical statutory counterpart in the ina inadmissibility provisions the statutory counterpart rule.f komarenko ins,cir.but if the statute itself does not authorize dhs to grant section c relief in any removal proceedings whatsoever,as the majority holds,where does authority to grant similar relief from inadmissibility come from 
it is not an answer to say that the government may choose to treat different classes or aliens the same.the statute in question is one that authorizes ins now dhs to grant discretionary waivers to persons in exclusion proceedings.if the agency had the authority to grant discretionary waivers to everyone,including persons in deportation proceedings,whether or not the statute provides such authority,then there would be no reason for the statute in the first place.the whole thrust of the majority reasoning is that congress,in adopting the relevant statute,could rationally distinguish between deportation and exclusion proceedings and could limit the ability of ins to grant discretionary waivers only to those in exclusion proceedings.under the reasoning of the majority,the agency does not have the authority to grant such waivers to aliens in deportation proceedings,and if that the case,f serves no purpose.
finally,not only has every circuit to consider the question accepted conclusion that section c relief is available in deportation and removal proceedings regardless of whether an alien has left the country,but every circuit to consider the question except the second circuit,see blake,at,has also followed komarenko and upheld the constitutionality of dhs statutory counterpart rule.see kim gonzales,cir caroleo gonzales,cir gonzales,cir gjonaj ins,cir numerous courts have held there must be a comparable ground of exclusion for an alien in deportation proceedings to be eligible for section c relief.we decline to change this rule.valere gonzales,cir holding that if the removable alien crime of conviction is not substantially equivalent to a ground of inadmissibility then the removable alien is not similarly situated for purposes of claiming an equal protection right to apply for c relief soriano gonzales,cir ins,cir see also mukasey,cir rejecting the reasoning of the second circuit decision in blake vue gonzales,cir same.in overruling and discarding komarenko as a dead letter,the majority creates a circuit split between those circuits that follow komarenko,those that follow but not komarenko,and our court.because i can discern no good reason to abandon our sister circuits after they have faithfully accompanied us down this now path,i can not join the majority opinion.
turning to the merits of abebe equal protection challenge,the dissent states that i n cases such as this,it is the act or offense itself that makes one alien similarly situated to another,not the grounds the government chooses to use to deport the aliens.dissent at.i disagree.
the government sought to remove abebe on two independent grounds his two convictions for committing crimes involving moral turpitude cimts and his conviction for committing an aggravated felony.abebe argues that his aggravated felony conviction could also qualify as a cimt and that,if the government had sought to remove him solely for cimts,which can also render an alien eligible for exclusion,then he would have been eligible for discretionary relief under section c.he contends that dhs statutory counterpart rule violates his right to equal protection under the due process clause because it denies him the benefit of section c relief simply because the government chose to remove him as an aggravated felon instead of an alien who had committed cimts.abebe asks that the court impose a rule under which an immigration judge would be forced to determine whether,given a particular conviction,the government could have sought to remove an alien on a ground equivalent to a ground for inadmissibility.
abebe can not demonstrate that he has been irrationally subjected to discriminatory treatment,however,because he can not show that he was in the same position as an alien who was charged with removal on a substantially similar ground to a ground for inadmissibility.put simply,two aliens who have been charged with removal on different statutory grounds are not similarly situated.that the underlying facts are such that the government could have charged them with removal under similar statutory grounds is not enough.if that rule were adopted,it would create a host of problems in countless situations,predictable and unpredictable,where the government is vested with,and exercises,discretion.to take the most obvious example,imagine the quotidian circumstance of a prosecutor faced with the decision of what charges to bring against an individual based on a given set of facts.each charge will carry different consequences,but a defendant can not contest the charges actually brought against him by arguing that the government could have charged him with a different offense under a different statutory provision.
congress has vested the executive branch with discretion in whether,when,and how to charge an alien with removal.how it exercises that discretion will have a serious impact on the life of a removable alien,whether it means forcible removal from the country or the availability of section c relief.to hold that the exercise of that discretion is unconstitutional where it is not exercised in the most advantageous way possible for a given alien under the circumstances would open the door to a torrent of claims.an alien is no more entitled to section c relief when charged with a ground of removal that has no statutory counterpart under the ina inadmissibility provisions than a defendant is entitled to a sentencing range consistent with the least serious crime with which he could have been charged.
this is not to say that the executive branch exercise of discretion is without constitutional limits.we have permitted claims to proceed against prosecutors whose decisions were allegedly made on the basis of sex,race,or religion.united states,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states armstrong,cir en banc,rev,d.absent evidence of discrimination against a suspect class,however,there is no judicial remedy for even arbitrary charging or plea bargaining decisions,even though such an arbitrary exercise of power would be a due process violation.morris dist.court,cir citing,at.this is because judicial inquiry into prosecutors processes would entangle courts in the core decisions of another branch of government,raising concerns.id.
in komarenko,this court provided additional,pragmatic reasons for denying section c relief to an alien charged with deportation under a subsection of the former deportation statute that was not substantially identical to a subsection of the former exclusion statute.like abebe,the petitioner in komarenko argued that his underlying conviction could have qualified as a cimt,a statutory ground for exclusion,which would have made him eligible for section c relief.the court held that the two grounds were entirely dissimilar and that the distinction between the two classes is not arbitrary or unreasonable.at citing campos ins,cir we can not say that it is absurd that for purposes of discretionary deportation review congress chooses to treat different crimes differently.we declined to engage in speculation over whether a particular alien could have been excluded under the moral turpitude provision,and noted that adopting the petitioner proposed approach would extend discretionary review to every ground for deportation that could constitute the essential elements of a crime involving moral turpitude.id.emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that s uch judicial legislating would vastly overstep our limited scope of judicial inquiry into immigration legislation,and would interfere with the broad enforcement powers congress has delegated to the attorney general.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.this reasoning applies with equal force today and,as discussed above,six of the seven other circuits to face the question have reached the same result.
this is not a situation,as the dissent contends,where two lawful permanent residents are being treated differently because one chose to step across the border for a day.dissent at.it is a situation where two individuals are being treated differently because the charges against them are materially different,and different charges bring different consequences.this simple fact is as true in immigration proceedings as it is in criminal law.we can not look only to the underlying conduct rather,the consequences that ultimately flow from an individual actions depend heavily on the government exercise of its charging discretion.
here,abebe had a number of prior convictions.the government could have chosen to seek removal based on his convictions for cimts,his aggravated felony conviction,or both.it chose option three,aggressively seeking removal on every available ground.the court should not put immigration judges in the business of such charging decisions.in light of how the government chose to charge abebe with removal,he was not similarly situated to an alien charged with being inadmissible,or an alien charged with removal on a ground with a statutory counterpart in the ina inadmissibility provisions,and his equal protection challenge fails.
i therefore concur in the judgment of the court.
distilled to its essence,this case involves the irrationality of affording privileges to lawful permanent residents who step across the border for a day,but denying the same privileges to those who do not.the majority not only blesses this unequal treatment,but goes much further,overruling more than years of precedent,approving an unconstitutional statutory scheme not even the board of immigration appeals endorses,and implicitly declaring unconstitutional a federal regulation.
i respectfully dissent.
first,some background.prior to enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act in iirira,there were separate procedures and substantive rules relating to the deportation of persons already present in the united states,and the exclusion of persons seeking entry.sonchik,cir.the ina defined deportable aliens in,transferred to,and excludable aliens in a.the exclusion procedures did not only apply to those seeking entry into the united states in the first instance.if a residing in the united states temporarily left the country,he could be excluded from.lawful permanent residents lprs are,of course,who have successfully satisfied statutory requirements and earned the favorable exercise of discretion by the government to be allowed to reside in the united states permanently.although a permanent resident,an lpr still could be deported if he committed a qualifying crime.if he left the country temporarily,he could also be excluded upon return if he had committed a qualifying offense.an lpr,as a seeking entry,would generally be subject to the same proceedings and grounds of exclusion if he traveled abroad and returned to the united states.see ina a,stat.facing a large volume of cases in which a waiver of exclusion was sought in compassionate cases involving lprs,congress afforded certain qualifying lprs the protection of subsection c

ina c,stat.
by its terms,former ina c,c repealed,applies only to persons in exclusion proceedings.the board of immigration appeals bia first recognized a problem with making section c relief available to excludables but not deportables in,in the context of section c precursor statute see matter of l.in matter of l,the bia held that relief under section c precursor was available in a deportation proceeding where the alien had departed and returned to the united states after the ground for arose.to hold otherwise,the bia noted,would render the statute capricious and whimsical.id.at.the second circuit took this interpretation to its logical extension in francis,holding that section c relief must be available to all persons in deportation proceedings who would be excludable on the same grounds,not just those who had actually left the country and reentered.immediately following francis,the bia embraced the francis analysis.matter of silva,bia.
when the question then reached our court,the matter had been so clearly determined that when we initially affirmed,in an unpublished disposition,a denial of section c relief to an alien in a deportation proceeding,the supreme court granted certiorari and remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of the solicitor general position in its brief before the supreme court.the solicitor general brief on petition for a writ of certiorari asserted the government current position that those precedents which limit section c to exclusion proceedings are erroneous and should be overruled.brief for the respondent at,ins,d.the solicitor general further stated that i n the government view,the ninth circuit position is without support in either the statutory language of section c or the case law on which the court of appeals has relied.id.at.on remand,we followed francis and held that eligibility for c relief can not constitutionally be denied to an otherwise eligible alien who is deportable under a narcotics conviction,whether or not the alien has departed from and returned to the united states after the conviction.ins,cir.
to this date,every court to consider the issue has determined that due process requires that section c must be applied to deportation proceedings as well as exclusion proceedings.see blake carbone,cir discussing cases.
our sister circuits are right.the supreme court has long held that the constitutional promise of equal protection of the laws applies to aliens as well as citizens.yick wo hopkins.under the minimal scrutiny test,which is applicable in this case,distinctions between different classes of persons must be reasonable,not arbitrary,and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.stanton stanton,d.as the second circuit recognized in francis,r eason and fairness would suggest that an alien whose ties with this country are so strong that he has never departed after his initial entry should receive at least as much consideration as an individual who may leave and return from time to time.at.
throughout this litigation,the government has been unable to provide a rational basis for this unequal treatment.the majority attempts to conjure one,urging that the rational basis for making section c relief available only to aliens in exclusion proceedings is to encourage and thus save government resources.there is no record support for this rationale,and the majority reasoning contains two fundamental flaws.first,there is no support for the contention that encouraging,as described by the majority,would actually further the interest of saving government resources.second,the rational reason the majority prescribes to congress presumes an interest which is actually in conflict with the statute itself.while the majority correctly notes that we do not have to look to the actual rationale for the legislation,in order to be rational,the reason must be consistent.
when an lpr leaves and attempts to reenter the country and is deemed excludable yet potentially eligible for a section c waiver,the lpr is generally allowed to enter and to apply for the waiver from within the country.if the alien is ultimately denied the waiver,the government must remove him.no fewer government resources are exerted than if the alien applied for a c waiver during a deportation proceeding.moreover,if the statute were to actually function as the majority presumes and encourage aliens to voluntarily place themselves
