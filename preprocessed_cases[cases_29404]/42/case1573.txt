lakshmi injeti,a native and citizen of india,entered the united states on a nonimmigrant visa in.in,she was granted an adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident lpr.injeti applied for naturalization in,and in the course of reviewing her application,citizenship and immigration services uscis discovered that her prior application for lpr status contained a misrepresentation.although injeti had in fact been married twice,the application stated that she had no former husbands.uscis also discovered that,in connection with a separate immigration proceeding,injeti had submitted a fraudulent death certificate for her first husband.on the basis of this information,it denied her application for naturalization.
injeti sought review of uscis decision in the district court for the district of maryland.finding that injeti was ineligible for naturalization because she had not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence,and failed to demonstrate good moral character,the district court granted summary judgment for uscis.injeti appeals the district court order,arguing that she satisfied both conditions.as we explain below,we affirm the district court judgment in part,and vacate it in part.
injeti was born in andhra pradesh,india in.she married her first husband,rajurao injeti,sometime between and.the two lived together in india with injeti parents until,when injeti moved to qatar,without her husband,to seek employment.though living apart,they remained in intermittent contact until.injeti alleges that,in,she received a letter from injeti parents informing her that he had died.injeti claims she has neither seen nor heard from injeti since.
in june,injeti married mohammed farook shaikh,an indian citizen whom she met in while living in qatar.according to injeti,she did not obtain a divorce prior to marrying shaikh because she believed injeti was dead.shaikh had also been previously married,but injeti claims shaikh informed her that he was a widower.
injeti entered the united states on a nonimmigrant visa in november to work as an employee of a qatari diplomat.sometime thereafter,she began working as a housekeeper for an american couple,stewart and sharon karr.stewart karr filed an visa petition on injeti behalf,which was approved in december.
on the basis of the approved petition,injeti filed an application for adjustment to lpr status.injeti application indicated that her husband,shaikh,was applying with her,and also listed the names of three children from her first marriage.however,in response to a question about the identity of former husbands or wives,injeti application incorrectly stated none.according to injeti then attorney,this inaccuracy arose from his own inadvertent error although injeti informed him that she was a widow,he mistakenly entered none in the box where the name of a former spouse should be entered.nevertheless,injeti signed the application,certifying under penalty of perjury that the information it contained was true and correct.
injeti was granted lpr status on january.shaikh was accorded lpr status as a derivative beneficiary,as were two of injeti children.sometime thereafter,injeti and shaikh filed an application for derivative lpr status for shaikh son.during the application process,immigration officials discovered that shaikh,in applying for lpr status,had submitted a fraudulent death certificate for his first wife.in fact,shaikh first wife was alive.based on this information,the government initiated removal proceedings against shaikh,injeti,and injeti two children in june.
shaikh obtained a divorce from his first wife and remarried injeti in april.around the same time,during the course of the removal proceedings,injeti submitted to immigration officials a document purporting to be a death certificate for her first husband,injeti.according to injeti,she received this document by mail sometime between and after requesting it from injeti parents.although uscis would later determine that the death certificate for injeti was also fraudulent,in the interim,an immigration judge terminated the removal proceedings against injeti,concluding that shaikh misrepresentation regarding his first wife was only attribut able to his actions.
on may,injeti filed an application for naturalization with uscis.like her prior adjustment application,this application omitted her marriage to injeti,answering to a question asking h ow many times have you been married.according to the attorney who assisted injeti with completing her application,this error occurred as a direct result of the prior inaccuracy on her adjustment application.injeti naturalization application was prepared,in part,by automated computer software,and the software simply transfer red the inaccurate information from the adjustment application to the naturalization application.j.the attorney stated in an affidavit that he did not become aware of either error until after both forms had been submitted.
while injeti naturalization application was under review,uscis received a letter from an individual named anton,who claimed to be the boyfriend of injeti daughter suvarna.the letter stated that injeti and shaikh had each submitted fraudulent death certificates for their former spouses,and that injeti remained alive in india.the letter further stated that injeti and shaikh had threatened suvarna not to tell the truth to an immigration judge.although the letter did not provide anton last name,it listed two addresses and a mailing address in australia where he could be reached.
uscis subsequently interviewed injeti,who stated that she had previously been married to injeti.uscis officials then contacted officials in india,who informed them that injeti purported death certificate,which injeti had previously submitted,was fraudulent.in fact,the certificate registration number was associated with a valid death certificate for another individual.uscis did not immediately take further action.
injeti filed suit in the district court for the district of maryland seeking adjudication of her naturalization application.in connection with these proceedings,she submitted an affidavit from her attorney,david rothwell,explaining the inaccuracies in her application forms.she also submitted her and shaikh original marriage certificate,which stated that both were widowed at the time of their marriage the district court remanded the case to uscis for adjudication.
uscis denied injeti application for naturalization.uscis reasoned that,because injeti had omitted mention of her first husband from her adjustment application and had later submitted a fraudulent death certificate,she failed to meet her burden of establishing eligibility for naturalization.specifically,she had not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence and did not possess good moral character as required for naturalization under a.
in response,injeti sought a hearing before an immigration officer.after conducting another interview and considering additional evidence,uscis again denied injeti application.it based its decision on several related considerations.first,in the absence of proof that injeti had died in,uscis concluded that injeti had been married to more than one person at the same time.she had thus committed bigamy,a crime of moral turpitude.as a result,negative answers she gave in her interview to questions regarding whether she had ever committed a crime or been married to more than one person at once had in fact been false.this crime and false testimony,along with injeti submission of a fraudulent death certificate,all prevented her from establishing good moral character.additionally,because injeti had procured her lawful permanent residence through misrepresentation,she had not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.finally,uscis concluded that injeti had deliberately engaged in an ongoing pattern of misrepresentation and deceit.therefore,she was statutorily and permanently ineligible for naturalization.
injeti filed a new complaint in the district court for the district of maryland,seeking review of the denial of her naturalization application pursuant to c.injeti complaint asserted that she met all the requireme
