petitioner walentyna korniejew seeks review of an adverse decision of the board of immigration appeals the bia or board that denied her request for asylum.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we deny the petition and affirm the decision of the bia.
backgrounda.facts 
korniejew was born in the village of dawidowicze,poland,on january.korniejew mother was jewish,and her family practiced its jewish faith in secret.korniejew parents kept their daughter faith hidden so that korniejew could attend school and college without encountering the same hostility as other jewish students.
at the time korniejew graduated from college,about the polish government began renovating some of the synagogues that had been destroyed in world war ii or that otherwise had fallen into disrepair.korniejew and a number of the jewish residents of her village decided to visit the synagogue at tykocin and to try to hold services there.when they arrived,however,they found the synagogue closed.authorities ordered korniejew group to report to the local police precinct there they were told that the synagogue was only a museum,not a place of worship.they also were warned,on pain of imprisonment,not to attempt to hold services there in the future.the group then was fingerprinted and released.
on the road home from tykocin,a small group of people on the side of the road signaled for the bus to stop.two individuals boarded the bus one of them pulled a gun,and the other drove the bus to a neighboring village.the hijackers drove the bus to a large barn where another man,wearing black and bearing a swastika on his arm,boarded the vehicle.the man threatened the group and told them that they should not attempt to visit the synagogue again.the hijackers then took the bus back to the main road.
later,in,another group attempted a similar trip to the nozyk synagogue in warsaw to celebrate rosh hashanah.the group did not experience any problems until the return trip.in her asylum affidavit,korniejew recounted that the following events occurred on their return trip from warsaw 
after about km from the city limits our bus was stopped by the police car.the policeman checked the id of our driver and asked him to give a lift to two people.after just a few minutes those two people stood up and pointed guns at the driver and at us.the driver was ordered to sit in the front row and one of the attackers took the driver seat 
the attackers asked who was the leader of our group.none of us answered.then they pointed towards two of our older people lesczynski and kozlowski and ordered them to leave the bus.after they refused to leave it they shot kozlowski,lesczynski went towards the door and left the bus.in about minutes he returned brutally beaten.
after that the attackers ordered me and natalie siemieniuk to leave the bus.we stepped out of the bus and they took us to the neighboring house.the group of people waiting for us in the house was in black uniforms with swastikas on their arms two of them grabbed me and pushed into the room,where he followed me.there he brutally raped me.in the other room the same thing happened to natalie.after they finished torturing us they returned us back to the bus.
korniejew suffered a great deal from her ordeal and could not go back to work until september.the local jewish community attempted no future trips the jewish families continued to gather in homes or at a local jewish cemetery.
in the middle of,the construction firm for which korniejew worked was hired to build a development of homes on part of the jewish cemetery where korniejew and others worshiped.the group of worshipers was advised by local authorities that,if they wished to stop the project,they must file a written protest.they did so in january.
in february,individuals who signed the protest received threatening notes vowing revenge if the complaint were not withdrawn.the company for which korniejew worked discovered that she had participated in the protest and terminated her employment.korniejew then complained twice to the attorney general of poland regarding the development in her last complaint,she included a statement regarding the ignorance of local and state authorities.
in march,korniejew was kidnapped by skinheads who threatened to kill her if the complaints to the attorney general were not withdrawn.she agreed to accede to their demands.they kept her overnight and threatened to kill her family if she cheat ed them.id 
korniejew stated that,after this last event,she and her husband were very scared and moved to her grandparents house.they stayed with her grandparents until korniejew left for the united states in april according to korniejew,her parents would visit her former apartment and for more than half a year were taking threats from our mailbox.after another six months,korniejew husband moved back to the apartment however,he left their daughter in the care of korniejew grandparents.
between and,several members of the group who had protested the cemetery development mysteriously disappeared.then,in january,korniejew husband unexpectedly disappeared.see id.at his body never was found,and,as of the time of korniejew removal hearing,the case of his disappearance remained open.
administrative proceedings 
as noted above,korniejew entered the united states with a visitor visa on april.she filed an application for asylum on october.shortly thereafter,on january,the immigration and naturalization service issued a notice to appear,and a removal hearing was held on november.
at her hearing,korniejew admitted that she was removable,but sought asylum and withholding of removal.the immigration judge ij denied the requested relief,but granted her voluntary departure.specifically,the ij found that her testimony lacked credibility based upon several discrepancies between her affidavit and her testimony.first,the ij noted that korniejew had testified that she was expelled from college however,she had stated in her affidavit that she graduated from college.the ij also found a discrepancy regarding the events of october the ij noted that korniejew had testified that two members of her party were taken off the bus by skinheads and shot.her affidavit indicates,however,that one of them kozlowski was shot after he refused to get off the bus.
the ij also was influenced by other shortcomings in korniejew presentation of her case korniejew affidavit indicated that she protested the construction in january and began receiving threats in february,whereas she testified that she received threats for six months after filing the protest which would not have been possible given that she came to the in april,korniejew failed to testify to a kidnapping that she had mentioned in her asylum application korniejew did not provide a satisfactory explanation for why she waited eight years to file an asylum application and not one of the incidents recounted by korniejew was supported by documentation.the only exception to this lack of corroboration was the letter from the police regarding her husband death which the court found to be of little probative value 
because it is not an official record and does not indicate any circumstances behind his alleged disappearance or the cause of death.moreover,according to its contents the death was reported on december,which is a day before,according to the respondent testimony,he allegedly disappeared.
the bia affirmed the judgment of the ij.it stated first that it 
will generally defer to an immigration judge adverse credibility findings that are based on inconsistencies and omissions that are central to the claim where the discrepancies and omissions are actually present in the record the discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent reasons for the adverse credibility finding and the alien has not provided a convincing explanation for the discrepancies and omissions.
the bia then determined that,based on its own review of the record,there were material inconsistencies between her asylum application and testimony.id.specifically,the bia pointed to the fact that korniejew testified that she was forced to leave the university because she was jewish in her asylum application,however,korniejew stated that she graduated from the university.the bia also mentioned the fact that korniejew failed to testify during her hearing that she was kidnapped in march.finally,the bia noted that korniejew testified that 
she began receiving threats months after she filed a protest against the construction of homes on a jewish cemetery.according to her application,her protest was filed in january.inasmuch as she entered the united states in april,we agree with the immigration judge that these two statements are irreconcilable.
id.at citation omitted.based on these examples,and the others set forth in the ij opinion,the bia was unable to find that the immigration judge incorrectly decided the issues at the hearing,and therefore affirmed the ij decision.
analysisa.standard of review 
this court review of a bia decision is limited this court must uphold the bia determination if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.toptchev ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.stated slightly differently,this court must affirm unless the evidence compels a different result.see ciorba ashcroft,cir.
furthermore,this court has recognized that c redibility determinations are accorded substantial deference and should only be overturned under extraordinary circumstances.ahmad ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.however,they must be supported by specific,cogent reasons.id.in addition,these reasons must bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
korniejew maintains that her testimony before the ij established that she had suffered past persecution in poland.this testimony,she continues,was credible.she argues that the inconsistencies cited by the ij and the bia are either illusory or negligible,and,therefore,they can not form the basis of an adverse credibility determination.
it is that the credible testimony of an alien,without more,may be sufficient to sustain an asylum claim.see capric ashcroft,cir see also a the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.however,if the ij finds the testimony to be incredible,then a convincing explanation of the discrepancies or evidence is required.capric,at.
on review,it is not the province of this court to second guess th e factual findings and credibility determinations made by the ij or the bia.see mansour ins,cir quoting karapetian ins,cir.however,we shall not automatically yield to the agency conclusions.georgis ashcroft,cir.c redibility determinations must be supported by specific,cogent reasons.in addition,these reasons must bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.ahmad ins,cir quoting nasseri moschorak,cir,overruled on other grounds by fisher ins,cir.we shall not defer to credibility determinations drawn from insufficient or incomplete evidence,georgis,at,nor shall we uphold a dverse credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record,gao ashcroft,cir.
discrepancies in the evidence 
in the present case,the ij relied on several discrepancies,as well as other shortcomings,in the evidence to deny korniejew relief.in its affirmance,the bia relied specifically on three of the inconsistencies and referenced other aspects of the ij decision.because the bia conducted its own review of the record,we look to the contradictions and shortcomings on which the bia relied to determine whether these are sufficient to support the bia determination that korniejew did not present a credible case for asylum.see supra note.
the bia refers specifically to three discrepancies in korniejew testimony.first,it cites the fact that korniejew testified during her hearing that she was expelled from college however,she had stated in her affidavit that she graduated.there is no question that the difference in korniejew affidavit and testimony constitutes a discrepancy.korniejew acknowledges this shortcoming in the evidence and simply urges this court to disregard all of the evidence concerning her college education.according to korniejew,this is a minor inconsistency,and,even without this testimony,she has established past persecution.
we can not dismiss as inconsequential evidence regarding discrimination in education.although we have not held explicitly that the denial of a higher education in all situations constitutes persecution,we have suggested that an official policy denying an ethnic or religious minority the right to a higher education could be a form of persecution.see bucur ins,cir if romania denied its ukrainian citizens the right to higher education enjoyed by ethnic romanians,this would be,we imagine,a form of persecution.id.at if a government as part of an official campaign against some religious sect closed all the sect schools but no other private schools and forced their pupils to attend public school,this would be,we should think,although we need not decide,a form of religious persecution.nevertheless,we agree with korniejew that her allegation that she was expelled from college based on her jewish faith is not the linchpin of her asylum claim.consequently,if the bia other grounds for upholding the ij credibility determination do not survive review,we can not say that this item,standing alone,can form the basis for an adverse credibility finding.
in its decision,the bia also relied upon korniejew failure to testify to the march kidnapping incident.in her affidavit,korniejew detailed the events leading to her decision to leave for the united states in april.she recounted the threats that she received in february and march,as well as the termination of her employment at the same time.additionally she stated 
on march,i was kidnapped on my way from the bakery.skinheads who kidnapped me promised to kill me if our complaints to the attorney general would not be withdrawn.i was scared and promised to do whatever they demanded.they promised to kill my family if i were to cheat them.they kept me overnight and took me back to where they kidnapped me.
korniejew also related that,following this event,m y husband was scared to death and we decided not to risk our lives.we moved to my grandparents house in dawidowicze and stayed there till i left for the at the end of april.id.
based on korniejew affidavit,the kidnapping event was an important factor in the decision to uproot her family and to leave for the united states.however,during her asylum hearing,korniejew failed to mention this occurrence during her direct examination,despite the fact that she was given opportunities to do so when counsel for the government confronted korniejew with her failure to mention this event,the following colloquy took place 
q.why did you mention that the kidnapping here today 
maybe i forgot to mention it.because it was a lot of years ago.
well would have been the most recent of something occurring to you there.and your statement says,your statement says that you were kept overnight by skinheads.
well,i mean they kept me overnight but they did do all that much to me.i mean they,they beat me up a little.but i very strongly remember that return from warsaw to bialystok that incident.
q.why would you tell the judge today about the most recent incident that occurred to you before you left poland 
well,my attorney did ask me about it.
under these circumstances,we must conclude that korniejew failure to testify to the kidnapping is significant.this incident represents korniejew most recent personal encounter with those threatening her.it also is the only time that she ever was held overnight.furthermore,this incident involved physical injury to korniejew she testified during the hearing that she was beaten up a little by her abductors.finally,at least according to korniejew affidavit,the incident contributed to her decision to remove her family from their village and to leave for the united states.we,therefore,can not fault the bia for basing its credibility determination in part on korniejew failure to testify to this event.
the bia also cited korniejew testimony regarding the tim
