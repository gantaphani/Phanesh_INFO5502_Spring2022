petitioner kyaw zwar tun petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia october,order summarily affirming the immigration judge ij decision,rendered orally on march,rejecting his claims for asylum and withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture,and ordering him removed to burma 
background 
petitioner entry and claim 
petitioner,in his late thirties,is a male native and citizen of burma.after entering the united states on a limited seaman visa in houston,texas,on may,he remained in the country illegally after his ship left port.petitioner first applied for political asylum in september.an asylum officer denied his application and placed him in removal proceedings.he conceded removability before the ij,but asserted claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,december,treaty doc,hereinafter,convention against torture,implemented by foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of,div,tit.xxii,stat.codified at note.a hearing on the merits of those claims was held before the ij on march,at the conclusion of which the ij denied tun claims and ordered him removed.
evidence at the hearing 
at the march,hearing,tun relied on his own testimony,the testimony of his cousin,ye lin,the expert testimony of aye kyaw,and various items of documentary evidence to establish that due to his political activities both before leaving burma and as a member of the burmese exile community in the united states,the authoritarian government in burma had persecuted him while he was there and is likely to do so in the event that he returns.
according to his testimony,in,as a history major at dangi college,tun became a activist.the precipitating event for his entry onto the political stage was the march,murder of a by the military at another university.tun organized a group of friends to attend a peaceful demonstration on his campus,protesting this murder it continued for two days.on the second day,as the demonstration grew,the military attacked the demonstrators,beating and arresting some protestors in order to disperse the crowd.thereafter,tun distributed pamphlets,posted posters,and attended several protest events beginning august,a day of nationwide protest.these events included a march and numerous demonstrations held throughout the city of dangi.during the month of august,tun participated in the organization of,and was a founding member of,the dangi college student union,an organization that aimed to organize further and demonstrations and activities.in early september,tun attended a demonstration organized by the student union outside a military base.demonstrations continued until september,when the military staged a coup,seized power,and dispersed the student demonstrators throughout the country.
on october,tun was arrested by five soldiers who came to his house and took him to a police station.he was held for two weeks,during which time he was interrogated repeatedly regarding the student union,subjected to beatings,forced to stay awake,and denied food.tun was released after his parents promised under compulsion that he would not participate in further demonstrations and that if he did they would be responsible.after his release,he was required to report daily to the police.he stated that he had no medical records to corroborate the beatings because,afraid to go to the hospital,he received only home treatment for his injuries.
early in,after hearing that demonstrators who had previously been released were being rearrested,tun went into hiding in an aunt home in rangoon.while in hiding,tun was married,in accord with prior arrangements made by his parents.he registered his marriage on april.his wife later informed him that military intelligence officers had come to his house to arrest him.tun stated that during the two years that he was at his aunt house,he did nothing other than attempt to get travel documents to leave burma.he did not go outside he was not politically active he did not work and his parents supported him.
tun decided to flee the country and,fearing that this would be difficult as a known political activist,secured the services of a broker who could procure both false identification and false permission to leave the country.for a payment of kyats,the broker obtained a false passport for tun and arranged for him to attend a training course in marine science at the beginning of,after which he received a seaman certificate that allowed him to leave burma.tun stated that anybody with a passport and employment letter could attend the training course,but he also said that the broker helped him gain admission.he stated that his uncle in england helped tun obtain an employment letter from a friend in singapore.the training covered operation of a fire extinguisher and lifeboat.
tun left burma on november,on a flight to singapore,where he boarded a ship to work as a seaman.as a seaman,he passed through numerous countries,including the united states,as well as indonesia,taiwan,malaysia,belgium,and mexico,but each time he left with the ship.he stated that he did not flee the ship the first time it passed through the united states because when he told a burmese crew member friend that he wanted to go to the united states to continue his activism,his friend told him not to leave yet.later,while in mexico,he learned that the crew would soon be returning to burma.thus,with the aid of his friend,he obtained his passport and seaman book so that he would be able to leave.on may,the ship arrived in houston,texas.when the ship left port,tun remained illegally in the united states.he traveled by bus to new york,where he moved in with an aunt.
tun testified that his mother,father,brother,and two sisters now live in new york city,having arrived during the.new york was the location of his hearing,yet none of these close relatives testified.moreover,tun presented no statements from any of these easily accessible relatives corroborating his political activity or arrest in burma,despite the fact that,according to his testimony,his parents had personal knowledge of his arrest through having secured his release from jail.however,tun did submit a letter from his wife,dated december,it does not mention his political activity or arrest,although it does state that military intelligence agents had come looking for him and they had indicated their awareness of his political activities in the united states.
tun explained the absence of a more informative statement from his wife by stating that his wife would get in trouble if she wrote about his political activity or arrest.he explained the lack of information from his brother by stating that his brother was living in a different city during the period of the student demonstrations in dangi.he provided no explanation for his parents failure to testify or submit a written statement.
tun did not apply for political asylum until september.he explained this delay by stating that when he first arrived,i did not know that something like political asylum was possible to be done.after being here for awhile from others i come to find out that i can apply for asylum.
a number of discrepancies exist between the information contained in tun original application and his hearing testimony.first,his original application states that he and his brother were members of the national league for democracy nld headed by nobel laureate aung san suu kyi.at his hearing,however,tun testified that he was actually only a supporter,and not a member,of the nld.the original application also stated that tun brother was arrested with him in,but he later testified that only he was arrested.tun attributed these discrepancies to the fact that a helped him draft his initial application and that he did not read it carefully before submitting it.in,tun submitted a second application for asylum together with an accompanying affidavit these were in all material respects consistent with his testimony.
tun first became politically active in the united states in,when he joined the burma action committee bac.he explained the delay between his arrival and his first political activities in this country by stating that there were not that many organizations and that he did not know very much about those that existed until the bac was formed in.as a bac member,tun has attended demonstrations,distributed literature,and attended meetings.
tun testified that he believes that he has been blacklisted by the burmese government for his political activity as well as for jumping ship and refusing to pay his taxes,and therefore,if he is returned to burma,he will be arrested and tortured.he believes that the burmese government is aware of his political activities in the united states because of its extensive network of informers and because of video surveillance outside of the burmese consulate in new york,where he has attended demonstrations.
in addition to tun,his cousin,ye lin,testified,as did aye kyaw,the founder of the bac and a professor at new york university.lin testified that he went to the burmese consulate in new york in to renew his father passport while there,he asked an embassy employee friend of his about tun.the employee told lin that tun had been blacklisted for being an activist,which lin believed meant that tun would be imprisoned if he returned to burma.lin said he was able to acquire this information only because he regularly bribed the embassy employee with alcohol,and that he did not think it would be possible to get this information in writing.lin stated that he had been a in burma and had known tun in burma,but that he did not participate in political activities with tun.
kyaw was accepted by the ij as an expert on burma.he testified that in burma,once one is identified as a political activist,one is blacklisted and will be kept under close surveillance and prevented from leaving the country.individuals placed on the blacklist are those observed participating in activities by intelligence agents,in burma or working out of burmese embassies abroad.kyaw also testified that in burma,brokers exist who,for a price,will secure false identification with which to leave the country.kyaw further testified that he had met tun at several bac meetings and once,in,at a demonstration in front of the burmese consulate in new york.
in addition to his wife letter,as documentary evidence in support of his claim,tun presented a copy of his allegedly falsified passport photographs of himself at three protests in front of the burmese consulate in new york in documents relating to his seaman status,including certificates of completion of various seamanship courses dated october,and a seaman identity card issued november,a photograph of a woman and child purporting to be his wife and daughter in burma an affidavit from his cousin ye lin that tracks his hearing testimony a letter from the bac stating that tun had protested in front of the burmese embassy and done various and substantial other political and organizational work with that organization in new york a copy of kyaw curriculum vitae and information about burmese country conditions,including the,and state department country condition reports.
tun passport appeared to contradict his testimony because it was dated december,and listed his occupation as cadet,whereas he testified that he had no marine experience or training until.in response to questioning from the ij,tun explained that the date and occupation had been filled in after the fact and the passport was not actually issued in.however,tun appeared to have agreed previously that the passport was,in fact,issued to him in december.tun explained the lack of corroboration of his membership in the dangi college student union by stating that,before he left burma,he destroyed many documents to prevent discovery of his status as a political activist.
the immigration judge decision 
at the end of the hearing on march,the ij issued an oral decision finding that tun was not a credible witness and denying his claims for asylum,withholding,and relief under the convention against torture.the ij found that the only thing tun feared about returning to burma was criminal punishment for illegally jumping ship and refusing to pay his taxes,that he was not an activist while in burma,and that his activities with the bac since were contrived to support his asylum claim.the ij noted that tun initial application was inconsistent in some respects with his testimony,but she credited his explanation that this was the fault of the who assisted him therefore she gave the most limited of weight to the initial application.she noted that tun testimony was consistent with his second application.yet,she still found him not credible because of the implausibility of certain aspects of his testimony and the contradictions between his testimony and the documentary evidence.additionally,the ij found that he failed to meet his burden of proof due to the absence of corroboration of his political activity and arrest while in burma.
tun testimony,that for the two years he lived at his aunt house he did nothing but scheme to leave burma,was held implausible and was found to be contradicted by his passport and certificates indicating that he trained to be a seaman in.tun explanation that the information on his passport was falsified after the fact was found implausible and not credible because he did not provide this information on direct examination or in his written application.thus,tun testimony that he had no marine experience or training until was found to be contradicted by the documentary evidence.the ij also found that tun actions after leaving burma rendered implausible his claim that he had been a political activist while in burma.she found it implausible that he would forego as many opportunities to jump ship and seek asylum as he did before finally doing so in houston.similarly,the ij found tun explanation of why he waited so long to file for asylum implausible in light of the fact that he had family in the united states and was part of a burmese community which does have a strong network of advice and referral.additionally,she found that his failure to become politically active in the united states until six years after his arrival,after he filed for asylum,and his limited activities thereafter,indicated that his political activities here were,and contrived to support his asylum claim.
regarding the convention against torture claim,the ij held that in light of her finding that tun was not a political activist in burma,his fear of punishment was based only on his jumping ship and refusing to pay his taxes these fears could not support a claim under the convention against torture because those activities were criminal,not political in nature.moreover,she found that tun had not carried his burden to show likely future persecution or torture on his return to burma because he relied exclusively on speculation that he would be imprisoned,but the country conditions reports do not support a finding that common criminals,as opposed to political dissidents,are subjected to torture in burma.
while finding that tun political activity in the united states was,the ij recognized the activity occurred.however,she did not address whether the activity,together with evidence in kyaw testimony and the country conditions reports of the burmese government surveillance apparatus and repression of activists,constituted evidence supporting a fear of future persecution or a likelihood of future torture.in fact,in finding that there was no evidence that common criminals were tortured in burma,the ij recognized that the evidence established a likelihood that returning political dissidents would be tortured.
tun timely appealed to the bia,which summarily affirmed the ij decision by order dated october.tun timely petitioned for review by this court of the bia order.we find that the bia order must be vacated and the case remanded for additional proceedings before the ij due to the ij failure to address whether tun had a fear of future persecution or was likely to be tortured on account of his political activities in the united states,and because to the extent that the ij did address this question,her findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.we therefore deny in part,grant in part,and remand in part for further proceedings before the ij.we affirm the ij finding that tun failed to meet his burden to prove that he suffered past persecution.
discussion 
standard of review 
we defer to the bia reasonable constructions of the immigration laws.see guan shan liao dep t of justice,cir.the bia may properly summarily affirm the ij decision and thereby adopt its reasoning,see e i,so long as the ij decision is sufficient to allow for meaningful review,see xusheng shi board of immigration appeals,cir,and the bia fulfilled its duty to conduct its own independent review.ins,cir the bia is certainly not precluded from summarily affirming an ij decision and adopting the ij reasoning in doing so,as long as the ij decision is sufficient to allow for review and we are confident that the bia fulfilled its duty to independently review a petitioner case.in such a case,we will review the ij decision directly.id.at.our review is for substantial evidence,and we will revers e only if no reasonable could have failed to find petitioner eligible for relief.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we will affirm if the ij supported her finding with evidence that is reasonable,substantial,and probative.diallo ins,cir.but this court review is limited to the reasoning of the ij,and we will not search the record independently for a basis to affirm the bia,at.the ij failure to consider material evidence in the record is ground for remand.see chen united states ins,cir.
we afford particular deference in applying the substantial evidence standard when reviewing an ij credibility findings.zhou yun zhang united states ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,the fact that the bia has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application can not insulate the decision from review.ramsameachire,at.in particular,where the ij finding rests largely on credibility,we require the ij to detail the reasoning leading to her adverse finding,by giving specific and cogent reasons for rejecting the applicant testimony,at.the reasons given must bear a legitimate nexus to the finding and must be valid grounds,as a matter of logic,for rejecting the applicant testimony.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we give particular deference to credibility determinations that are based on the adjudicator observation of the applicant demeanor,in recognition of the fact that the ij ability to observe the witness demeanor places her in the best position to evaluate whether apparent problems in the witness testimony suggest a lack of credibility or,rather,can be attributed to an innocent cause such as difficulty understanding the question.see zhang,at.on the other hand,we grant lesser deference to credibility determinations that are based on analysis of testimony as opposed to demeanor.see,at.w e will reverse where an adverse credibility finding is based upon speculation or upon an incorrect analysis of the testimony.ramsameachire,at see also,at holding that speculation and conjecture can not support an adverse credibility finding.where inconsistencies or implausibilities form the basis for the ij finding,we will review the record to determine whether the inconsistencies actually exist or the testimony was actually implausible.see ramsameachire,at,at.
an applicant may be required to provide any reasonably available documentation to corroborate the elements of her claim,or explain why such documentation is unavailable,and an ij may rely on the failure to do so in finding that the applicant has not met her burden of proof.see zhang,at.we review an ij finding that corroborative evidence was available for substantial evidence,and will not reverse unless a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.real id act of,div.b of the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense,the global war on terror,and tsunami relief,e,stat,may,codified at hereinafter,real id act provision made immediately applicable by id.h.but we may remand where the ij has turn ed down a refugee candidate for want of sufficient corroboration without identify ing the particular pieces of missing,relevant documentation or without relying on substantial evidence in the record to find that the documentation at issue was reasonably available to the petitioner.jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir.the ij should also assess the applicant reasons,if any,for not furnishing the corroboration at issue.diallo,at.
ii.general principles applicable to claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture 
asylum and withholding of removal 
an alien seeking to establish eligibility for asylum must establish that he is a refugee as defined by a,that he has suffered past persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or that he has a fear of future persecution on these grounds.qiu,at quoting a.once an asylum applicant has established eligibility for asylum,the decision whether to grant asylum rests with the discretion of the attorney general or secretary of homeland security,see b,and is generally not reviewable unless manifestly contrary to law and an abuse of discretion,b d see also melendez united states dep t of justice,cir.
while establishing a fear of future persecution automatically establishes an applicant eligibility for asylum,establishing past persecution creates only a rebuttable presumption of such a fear,which may be rebutted by a showing,by the preponderance of the evidence,either of sufficiently changed conditions in the country from which the applicant fled,qiu,at b,b i a,or that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to a different region of that country and that it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so,id.b i b.absent a showing of past persecution,demonstrating a fear of future persecution has both a subjective and an objective prong.ramsameachire,at.the subjective element can be satisfied by the applicant credible testimony that his fear is genuine.however,the objective component is largely dependent upon the context and believability the applicant can establish for his or her claims through presentation of reliable,specific,objective supporting evidence.id.internal quotation marks omitted.an applicant is not require d to provide evidence that there is a reasonable possibility that he or she would be singled out individually for persecution provided the applicant proves the existence of a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,and the applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in,and identification with,such group b iii.
while an ij credibility finding is entitled to substantial deference,and we grant particular deference to findings based on observation of an applicant demeanor,we are less deferential where credibility findings rest on purported inconsistencies or implausibilities in an applicant testimony.see,at.where inconsistencies or implausibilities form the basis for the ij finding,we will review the record to determine whether the inconsistencies actually exist or the testimony was actually implausible.see ramsameachire,at.
to establish entitlement to withholding of removal an applicant must make a stronger showing than to establish eligibility for asylum.but withholding is mandatory once entitlement is established it may not be denied in the discretion of the attorney general as may asylum.see zhang,at.to establish entitlement to withholding,an applicant must prove that it is more likely than not that,were he deported,his life or freedom would be threatened on account of one of the protected grounds of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.qiu,at quoting b a.as with asylum,an applicant who establishes past persecution on account of a protected ground is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a future threat to life or freedom,which may be rebutted on the same grounds of changed circumstances or a reasonable possibility of relocation to avoid persecution.b i.but,if either the applicant fear of future threat to life or freedom is not related to the past persecution that she suffered,or the applicant did not suffer past persecution,the applicant must affirmatively prove that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of a protected ground,and that such persecution could not reasonably be avoided by relocation within the country.b iii,b.an applicant is not require d to provide evidence that he or she would be singled out individually for such persecution provided the applicant proves the existence of a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,and the applicant establishes her inclusion in and identification with such group.id.b.
in establishing a fear of future persecution to prove eligibility for asylum,in contrast to withholding,an applicant need not prove that future persecution is more likely than not.rather,to establish that her subjective fear is,an applicant need only show a reasonable possibility of future persecution.matter of mogharrabi,wl bia quoting ins stevic,d.in other words,the applicant must show that a reasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution.id.at accord ins,cir.the supreme court has stated that a showing of a ten percent likelihood of persecution could suffice to establish that an applicant fear is.see ins,d.
the requirement that an applicant show that her fear of persecution is may be broken up into four elements the applicant must provide evidence that he has a belief or characteristic that a persecutor seeks to overcome by means of some mistreatment,that the persecutor has the capability and inclination to impose such mistreatment,and that the persecutor is,or could become,aware of the applicant possession of the disfavored belief or characteristic.see mogharrabi,at.each of these elements is to be evaluated in light of the appropriate burden of proof a clear probability in the withholding context,and only a reasonable possibility in the asylum context.id.at.
relief under the convention against torture 
the convention itself 
in,a process began by which the longstanding procedures for seeking the protections of asylum and withholding of removal would ultimately be supplemented by the protections of the convention against torture,which was adopted and opened for signature,ratification,and accession by the united nations general assembly on december,and entered into force on june.the convention defines torture as 
a ny act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.it does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.
convention against torture.article of the convention prohibits any state party to the convention from expel ling,return ing or extradit ing a ny person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,and provides that the determination of whether such grounds exist is to be made tak ing into account all relevant considerations including,where applicable,the existence in the state concerned of a consistent pattern of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights.id.
the regulatory system today 
regulations promulgated by the attorney general in established a procedure for asserting claims to relief under the convention.see regulations concerning the convention against torture,codified at c.the regulations adopted the convention definition of torture in article practically verbatim,merely inserting female pronouns to render its language.see a.they incorporated that article language providing that t orture does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions,id.a,adding,in accord with the senate understanding,that lawful sanctions do not include sanctions that defeat the object and purpose of the convention against torture to prohibit torture,id.in order to establish entitlement to relief under the convention,the regulations,again in accordance with the senate understanding,place on the applicant the burden to prove that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal,id.c.in determining whether the applicant has met this burden,relevant evidence that should be considered includes any evidence that the applicant has been tortured in the past,evidence that the applicant could relocate to another part of the country where torture would be unlikely,evidence of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal,and any other relevant information regarding conditions in that country.id.c.
the convention against torture provides significantly different protections from those provided under the traditional asylum and withholding provisions descended from the refugee convention.see,ramsameachire,at noting that alien could qualify for relief under the convention against torture but not for asylum or withholding,or vice versa,and so claims under the convention must always be considered independently of claims for asylum or withholding.individuals are protected against torture regardless of whether such torture would be on account of one of the traditional protected grounds of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.in accord with the senate understanding,even torture sanctioned by the alien country of origin for his criminal conduct will sometimes establish entitlement to relief.see wang ashcroft,cir a n alien is not entitled to cat relief unless he can prove that,upon being returned to his country of origin,he is more likely than not to suffer cruel and inhuman treatment that either is not lawfully sanctioned by that country or is lawfully sanctioned by that country,but defeats the object and purpose of cat.on the other hand,torture requires proof of something more severe than the kind of treatment that would suffice to prove persecution.see,chen,at stating that persecution in the asylum context means that,although the conduct must rise above mere harassment,the term includes more than threats to life or freedom threatening violence and physical abuse also fall within this category internal quotation marks omitted liao,at persecution has been held to include v arious types of conduct such as,for example,the deliberate imposition of a substantial economic disadvantage begzatowski ins,cir stating that t ypes of actions that might cross the line from harassment to persecution include detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,or torture.internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.the ij finding that tun failed to prove past persecution 
the ij discussion of past persecution was in some respects problematic,and her adverse credibility finding rested to a great extent on logically flawed analysis and speculation unsupported by substantial evidence as such,the adverse credibility finding here would not provide a basis for us to affirm the ij finding that tun failed to prove past persecution.however,the ij alternative finding is sufficiently supported by substantial evidence tun failed to sustain his burden of proving past persecuti
