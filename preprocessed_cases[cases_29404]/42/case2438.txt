borislav terezov,a national of bulgaria,was ordered removed in absentia when he failed to appear at his removal hearing.he moved to reopen the proceedings because,he claims,he never received the hearing notice,which was sent to an address at which he no longer lived.the immigration judge ij and the board of immigration appeals bia found that the department of homeland security dhs had mailed the notice to the last address provided by terezov.terezov has filed a petition for review,which we grant.there are significant,unexplained gaps in the administrative record compiled by the executive office for immigration review,and given the state of the record,we are compelled to conclude that the decision of the ij,as supplemented by the opinion of the bia,is not supported by substantial evidence.
in september,just two months after he entered the united states without inspection through piedras negras,mexico,terezov applied for asylum.he claimed that he endured multiple interrogations and beatings at the hands of the police in bulgaria due primarily to his rom ethnicity and his political support for the roma minority in bulgaria.on his asylum application terezov gave his address as west taylor in phoenix,arizona.in october,the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis,the successor to the immigration and naturalization service,wrote terezov from its los angeles asylum office which is actually located in anaheim,california,requesting additional proof that he resided within its jurisdiction,which includes phoenix.terezov reply is not in the administrative record.
as far as that record shows,terezov next written communication with the los angeles asylum office was a letter advising that he had moved to a new address in carmel,indiana.that handwritten letter,which bears at the top a stamped date of january,conveys the new address but nothing more.terezov did not ask that his file be transferred to the chicago asylum office or to any other office,and nothing in the administrative record discloses what,if anything,the los angeles asylum office did in response.what the record does show is that in june the uscis received from terezov an application for employment authorization at the agency california service center in laguna niguel.in this application,which terezov based on his pending asylum application,he listed a new phoenix address north street,apartment.the uscis corresponded with terezov at this new address regarding the application for employment authorization,and when the agency denied that application in july,it sent the written decision to terezov at the new address.that document states explicitly that terezov asylum application was currently at the asylum office in los angeles and directed him to contact that office if he had any questions about his application.
what happened in the following months is impossible to glean from the sparse administrative record.it appears that at some point terezov file was transferred to the chicago asylum office,though when this occurred is unclear.all that we are able to piece together is that an asylum interview was scheduled,but terezov did not attend.there is no documentation in the record showing how,or even if,terezov was told about this asylum interview,nor does the record disclose when this interview was ordered or when precisely it was to take place.all the administrative record discloses is that on february,an asylum officer based in chicago referred the matter to the immigration court in chicago due to terezov absence from the asylum interview.that same date the chicago asylum office mailed a notice to appear directing terezov to attend a removal hearing before an ij in april.the notice to appear was sent by regular mail to the indiana address given by terezov a year earlier,but there is no evidence in the record that he actually received it.terezov did not appear,and the ij immediately ordered him removed in absentia.the immigration court also sent the order of removal to the indiana address,but it was returned with the notation not deliverable as addressed,unable to forward.
one month later terezov filed pro se a motion to reopen the removal proceedings.he did not say how he learned about the in absentia order of removal,but he expressed surprise that it had issued.terezov explained that he was living in indiana looking for work from november until late february,but was not living there when the notice to appear was mailed in february.he denied ever receiving that notice.terezov added that he submitted his asylum application to the california district office,and had never tried to transfer it elsewhere.he also insisted that he notified the los angeles asylum office after he moved back from indiana to phoenix,where he lived first at north street,apartment and later at east paradise village parkway north,apartment.terezov attached to his motion copies of two return receipts that he characterized as confirmation from the postal services for on time filing change of address form.both return receipts were stamped received by the los angeles asylum office,the first in april and the second in august,and both were returned to terezov at his apartment on north street.terezov also submitted copies of the uscis communications he received at this phoenix address regarding his application for employment authorization,including the adverse decision in july that told terezov his asylum application was then located at the los angeles asylum office.
in opposing the motion to reopen,the government simply represented to the ij that its review of the administrative file showed that terezov sent only one change of address to the department of homeland security.the government explained that it failed to locate any change of address notices or letter from the respondent in the administrative file except for the handwritten change of address that is date stamped january.arguing that the notice to appear had been properly sent to the last address provided by terezov,the government contended that terezov failed to meet his burden for reopening.the ij agreed,reasoning that there is nothing in the record to reflect that he ever provided notice to the asylum office of his return to phoenix.the ij further remarked that there was no indication in the record that the notice to appear was returned as undeliverable,and concluded that terezov had failed to provide credible evidence,such as affidavits or other evidentiary material,to prove he never received it.
terezov then retained counsel and appealed the ij decision to the bia.in that appeal,counsel acknowledged that terezov had changed his address to carmel,indiana,in january while he was in the chicago area seeking employment,but reiterated terezov prior representation the he notified the los angeles asylum office in april about his return to phoenix.counsel argued that dhs and the asylum office were on notice since april of borislav terezov address,ten months before the notice to appear was mailed to the outdated indiana address.counsel concluded that,c learly,there can be no dispute that the government sent the notice to appear to the address in indiana.counsel resubmitted the two return receipts showing that the los angeles asylum office had received mail from terezov in april and again in august.counsel also submitted affidavits from terezov wife,from one of his friends in phoenix,and from his former indiana landlord,who collectively vouched that terezov lived in phoenix when the notice to appear was mailed to his outdated indiana address,and that he apprised the dhs every time he moved.
the government offered no response.despite that silence,however,the bia affirmed the denial of terezov motion to reopen.the bia adopted the ij reasoning but added its own further explanation that terezov had not provided any reliable evidence that he submitted a form after returning to phoenix,and thus was deemed to have received the notice to appear at the indiana address.the bia gave no weight to the april and august return receipts because terezov did not produce a copy of the change of address form allegedly submitted and,according to the bia,had no other proof that he
