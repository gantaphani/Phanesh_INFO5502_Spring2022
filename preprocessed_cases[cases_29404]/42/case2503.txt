background 
in november,ouaffa melliani offered dianna kirklin a deal kirklin would receive if she flew to morocco,married defendant,and helped defendant obtain paperwork necessary to stay in the united states.melliani had known defendant while she was also living in morocco,but kirklin and defendant were strangers.defendant had tried and failed on two previous occasions to obtain a united states visa.kirklin accepted melliani offer.melliani provided kirklin with detailed written instructions about how to behave when she arrived in morocco,especially when dealing with the american embassy.melliani also gave kirklin,with the remaining to be paid when kirklin returned from morocco.
kirklin flew to morocco,arriving on saturday,november.defendant met kirklin at the airport,holding a sign with her name written on it,and greeted her with a handshake.the following monday,defendant and kirklin began visiting various government offices in morocco to obtain the paperwork necessary to marry.on december,defendant and kirklin were married.they celebrated at a party with defendant family and friends.they did not consummate the marriage and stayed in separate rooms for the remainder of kirklin trip.defendant helped kirklin fill out an petition for alien relative form,which kirklin would later submit to the immigration and naturalization service ins to begin the process of obtaining a visa for defendant.
kirklin left morocco on december.defendant remained in morocco,waiting to obtain a united states visa.melliani paid kirklin the remaining.on december,kirklin submitted the petition for alien relative form to the ins.the ins approved the petition on april.
on november,defendant submitted to the united states consulate in morocco an application for a visa to enter the united states,based on his status as a spouse of a united states citizen.the consulate issued defendant a visa that day.on december,defendant presented the visa to united states immigration in chicago and was admitted into the united states as a spouse of a united states citizen.defendant went to kirklin home in rock island,illinois,where he allegedly believed he would be living.kirklin initially told defendant that he could not stay with her.she claims to have felt sorry for him,however,and let him live with her for three months before she asked him to leave.defendant then moved into an apartment with melliani.he later took a job as a truck driver,which required him to be on the road for long stretches of time.while living apart from kirklin,defendant claims to have corresponded with her on a regular basis,taken her out to dinner numerous times,and attended her family functions.the couple filed joint federal and state tax returns and opened a joint bank account.defendant and kirklin,however,did not consummate their marriage,and there was evidence that defendant had a sexual relationship with another woman during the time he was married to kirklin.
on june,defendant and melliani were jointly charged with conspiracy to commit marriage fraud.defendant also was charged with a substantive count of marriage fraud.both counts against defendant were based on his marriage to dianna kirklin in december.melliani was charged with a substantive count of marriage fraud.both counts against melliani were based on melliani marriage to jeremy cozadd cozadd in january.the charge alleged that melliani paid cozadd to marry her after her united states visa expired.
on september,melliani plead guilty to count four and was sentenced to time served and two years supervised release.defendant case remained scheduled for trial on january.on december,the government filed a superceding indictment against defendant.the new indictment included the conspiracy to commit marriage fraud and marriage fraud counts,and added a new count for witness tampering,which allegedly occurred in october.
defendant filed a motion to dismiss due to selective prosecution,arguing that the government acted improperly by prosecuting defendant and melliani,who were arabs,and not charging the two alleged american,kirklin and cozadd.the district court denied the motion.
defendant also filed a motion in limine regarding the marital communications privilege.defendant requested that the district court prohibit the government from introducing correspondence between defendant and kirklin.the content of one of those letters was the basis for the witness tampering offense added to defendant superceding indictment.the district court found that the marital privilege did not apply and denied the motion.
defendant case went to trial on april.during the government case in chief,the district court granted the government motion to give kirklin immunity in return for her testimony.the district court then stated,in response to a question by defense counsel,that the marital testimonial privilege was not available to kirklin and that she was required to testify against defendant.
after the close of the government evidence,the district court denied defendant renewed motions regarding selective prosecution and marital privilege and denied defendant motion for judgment of acquittal.the district court also rejected several of defendant proposed jury instructions on the marriage fraud counts.on april,the jury convicted defendant on all three counts.
on august,the district court sentenced defendant to months imprisonment on each count,to run concurrently,three years supervised release,and a special assessment.
ii.discussion 
marital privileges 
defendant raises two challenges related to marital privilege first,that the district court erred by finding that the marital communications privilege did not prevent disclosure of letters defendant wrote to kirklin while he was in jail and second,that the district court erred by finding that kirklin could not assert the marital testimonial privilege and refuse to testify as a witness for the government.
we review the trial court resolution of a marital privilege issue for an abuse of discretion.united states westmoreland,cir.s pecial deference is given to the evidentiary rulings of the district court.united states lea,cir.if we find that evidence barred by a marital privilege was improperly admitted,we must determine whether the error was harmless.westmoreland,at.
marital communications privilege 
the marital communications privilege,which defendant attempted to assert before the district court,applies only to communications made in confidence between the spouses during a valid marriage.lea,at.the privilege may be asserted by either spouse.id.it exists to ensure that spouses generally,prior to any involvement in criminal activity or a trial,feel free to communicate their deepest feelings to each other without fear of eventual exposure in a court of law.westmoreland,at.
prior to trial,defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to prevent the government from introducing into evidence several letters written between defendant and kirklin.one of these letters,written by defendant and postmarked october,formed the basis of the witness tampering count.the letter stated,in relevant part 
dianna do be scared for no body 
i know the ins agent told you in stade to have two person in prison we will have three.see just for those words that is unconstitutional.there is nothing nothing they will do to you nothing.even if you change the hole thing you told them,one you can say i was under pressure two you can say that at that time you forgot to take your medecin.three you can just say that my husband and i we were having a family problemes at the time and after that we worked it out and we are just fine now.the maximum points you will have if you lie or change what you said in front of the grand jury is point wich means to months in prison or month pro or dollars fine,that according to the federal sentencing gide line and that for a normal person,not some one who has a permanent brain damage,and that for a crimmel case,like murder.
the district court found that the letters were not subject to the marital communications privilege because the marriage was entered into fraudulently.the district court also found the marital communications privilege inapplicable because the spouses were joint participants in the underlying marriage fraud.
we affirm the district court decision that the marital communications privilege does not apply,based on the court reasoning that defendant and kirklin were joint participants in the marriage fraud scheme.the marital communications privilege places a limitation on truthful disclosure.westmoreland,at.however,we have recognized an exception to the privilege when spouses are joint participants in the underlying offense.id.citing united states short,cir.w e do not value criminal collusion between spouses,so any confidential statements concerning a joint criminal enterprise are not protected by the privilege.short,at.
in this case,the superceding indictment alleged that kirklin was a with defendant in the underlying marriage fraud offense.in his october,letter to kirklin,defendant tried to persuade kirklin to testify differently than she did before the grand jury and suggested certain stories kirklin could tell.he also tried to persuade kirklin that if she lie d or change d what she said in front of the grand jury,she would receive only a short prison sentence.
defendant maintains that the privilege was not destroyed by the joint crime exception because the october,letter had nothing to do with the alleged joint criminal activity that occurred in december,commission of the underlying marriage fraud.defendant point seems to be that in the letter he suggested a whole new kirklin had not contemplated or agreed to.according to defendant,the joint crime exception would apply only if the letter discussed and attempted to further the marriage fraud.defendant fails to recognize that the letter does relate to the underlying marriage fraud in it,defendant urged kirklin to change her testimony at his trial to evade the marriage fraud charges and specifically referenced the grand jury proceedings at which kirklin testified that she entered into the marriage fraudulently in sum,we find that the october,letter was admissible under the joint crime exception to the marital communications privilege.we therefore find it unnecessary to determine whether the privilege would also be inapplicable because defendant and kirklin marriage was fraudulent.
marital testimonial privilege 
the marital testimonial privilege protects an individual from being forced to testify against his or her spouse.the testimonial privilege looks forward with reference to the particular marriage at hand the privilege is meant to protect against the impact of the testimony on the marriage.westmoreland,at.only the testifying spouse can assert the privilege,and the privilege may be waived.
at defendant trial,kirklin informed the district court that,if called to testify,she would assert her fifth amendment right to refuse to answer any questions on the ground that a truthful answer would tend to incriminate her.the government informed the court that it intended to offer kirklin immunity and moved for an immunity order,pursuant to to.the district court granted the motion.
defendant attorney then asked the district court whether someone has the obligation to advise miss kirklin of her marital privilege.the district court responded that kirklin could not assert the marital testimonial privilege for the same reasons defendant could not assert the marital communications privilege the marriage was fraudulent and defendant and kirklin were joint participants in the fraud.the district court explained this ruling to kirklin and told her that it had already decided that in this case you do not have a privilege not to testify.kirklin responded,i understand.
defendant argues that it was error for the district court to instruct kirklin that she could not assert the marital testimonial privilege.defendant asserts that kirklin exclusively held the right not to testify against her husband she should not have been compelled to testify as a government witness.
defendant argument mischaracterizes what actually happened at his trial.kirklin was not compelled to testify against defendant.she asserted her fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination,was offered immunity to testify,and accepted immunity.only after she had already agreed to testify,and only at the prompting of defense counsel,did the district court inform her that the marital testimonial privilege was not available.kirklin never attempted to assert the marital testimonial privilege herself.defendant can not assert the right for her,because the testimonial privilege,unlike the communications privilege,can be waived by either spouse.thus,we find that the district court did not commit reversible error by telling kirklin that the privilege was unavailable to her.
selective prosecution 
prior to trial,defendant filed a motion to dismiss due to selective prosecution and,in the alternative,requested an opportunity to conduct discovery regarding the united states attorney charging decision.defendant argued that it was improper for the government to prosecute only defendant and melliani,who were arab,and not their united states citizen,kirklin or cozadd.
the district court denied the motion to dismiss and the discovery request.the district court emphasized that the government enjoys broad discretion in deciding who to prosecute.the district court found that the government reasonably concluded that defendant and melliani were more culpable than kirklin and cozadd,because they solicited kirklin and cozadd to effect marriage fraud.
on appeal,defendant once again asserts that the government decision to prosecute only defendant and melliani was based upon an unjustifiable defendant race and nationality.defendant maintains that the four persons involved in the alleged conspiracy were similarly situated in terms of criminal culpability,and the only difference between the four persons was that two were arabs,and two were citizens.defendant asks this court to remand his case to the district court,either to be dismissed or to allow discovery.
to show that the government engaged in improper selective prosecution,defendant must demonstrate that the federal prosecutorial policy had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.united states armstrong,d quoting wayte united states,d.to make out a prima facie case of selective prosecution,which a defendant must do in order to receive an evidentiary hearing,defendant must show that he was singled out for prosecution while other violators similarly situated were not prosecuted and the decision to prosecute was based on an arbitrary classification such as race,religion,or the exercise of constitutional rights.united states monsoor,cir quoting united states cyprian,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
under this standard,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant motion to dismiss and discovery request.the district court reasoned 
clearly,defendant and melliani,regardless of their ethnicity or religion,who solicited the marriages,paid for the marriages,and sought to gain immigration status by entering into the marriages
