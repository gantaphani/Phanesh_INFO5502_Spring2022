the immigration judge ij concluded that petitioners failed to produce sufficient or concrete direct evidence to show that they have a fear of religious persecution.the ij specifically found that petitioners testimony was not sufficiently detailed,consistent or believable to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis for their fears.slip op.at transcript of oral decision.in particular,the ij noted that all of the major incidents described in their testimony relating to the incidents of religious persecution were not even mentioned in the initial asylum application.id.kondakova explained that a neighbor helped her prepare the application and that she did not know exactly what incidents had been included in the application,that she did not read or write english,and that she did not want to relive the traumatic events.the ij did not credit the explanation.id.at noting that the most serious incident,the kidnapping of their daughter,was not included in the application,and that petitioners are highly educated and reasonably should have been expected to insure that the information in the application was complete and accurate.the ij was also concerned about the absence of any documentation about any of the incidents.id.at noting,for example,that petitioners did not submit any police reports about the kidnapping.
the ij also found that the incidents did not amount to persecution and that petitioners failed to show that the incidents were the result of their religious beliefs.id.at.the ij also noted that kondakova testimony about the status of the church day school was confusing.id.at noting that kondakova testified that the school was closed by the government in september but that she taught at the school until june.the ij also found that petitioners claims of religious persecution were not consistent with the country conditions reports prepared by the bureau of democracy,human rights and labor and the united states state department,which reported no evidence of harassment or persecution of evangelical christians in the ukraine,or with the experience of kondakova mother who served as an elected government official.id.the ij also noted that petitioners failed to establish countrywide persecution,that is,that they would be persecuted in another part of the country.id.at.finally,the ij noted that because petitioners failed to satisfy the lower burden of proof for eligibility for asylum,they also failed to satisfy the higher burden of proof for eligibility for withholding of removal.id.the ij granted petitioners voluntary departure.
the board summarily affirmed the decision of the ij,and this petition for review followed.
the board determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal is reviewed for substantial evidence,and may not be overturned unless the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.under this standard,this court must determine whether,based on the record considered as a whole,the board decision was supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.this court defers to an immigration judge adverse credibility finding where the finding is supported by a specific,cogent reason for disbelief.
under the immigration and nationality act,the attorney general has the discretion to grant asylum to a refugee,defined as a person who is unable or unwilling to return home because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a
