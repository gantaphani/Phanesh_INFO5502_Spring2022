petitioners are a family of three from albania.they seek this court review of the denial by the board of immigration appeals of their applications for asylum and associated relief.because the immigration judge had substantial evidence to support his conclusion that petitioners do not qualify as refugees,we deny the petition for review.
ilir and orjeta shkabari are a married couple.both they and their son,klidis,left shkoder,albania in october,to come to this country,where they arrived on november,after travelling through montenegro and italy.shkabari claims to have been a member of the democratic party since.his wife claims to have joined in.both allege that they were persecuted because of their political opinions in albania.
shkabari account of persecution begins even before he joined the democratic party.in december,he participated in demonstrations against the communist regime.after one of these rallies,he was beaten by police.shkabari joined the democratic party soon thereafter.following the communist regime collapse,the democratic party came to power in and remained the dominant party until it lost the election.despite his party being in power,however,lead petitioner reports being harangued and threatened on the street for his association with the party.
according to petitioners,matters worsened in.both and shkabari were beaten as they approached the polling station to vote in the election,which the socialist party ultimately won.shkabari asserted that he was unable to visit the hospital because the socialists controlled everything in the city.however,shkabari went to the hospital,in part because she was less than her husband.after he participated in rallies against the new government,shkabari claims he was arrested.according to his testimony,he was beaten,interrogated,and threatened by the police.they also allegedly poured scalding hot water on his body and shoulder.again,petitioner asserts,he was unable to go to the hospital.shkabari testified that he received medical attention at home instead.
following the death of a democratic party leader in,shkabari took part in demonstrations against the socialist government.because of his involvement,he claims,he was forced to report to the police station three times a month.when he did so,he would be beaten and threatened.
local elections were held in shkoder on october.and shkabari went to the polling place with their son.as shkabari approached the building,he claims someone knocked his son out of his arms.he alleges that the individual then shot him in the leg.because he continued to fear the hospital,shkabari was treated at home.
and shkabari appeared before an immigration judge ij with the assistance of counsel and a translator.they entered into evidence numerous documents from the democratic party,which purported to show that they were members of the party and chronicled the events.following the hearing,the ij issued an oral opinion in which he denied petitioners any relief on the basis that he did not find shkabari testimony credible and did not believe shkabari had met her burden of proof.they appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,which affirmed without opinion.petitioners have timely appealed to this court.
petitioners argue that the ij erred in finding them not credible and,thus,unable to establish a fear of persecution to be eligible for asylum,an applicant must first prove that he qualifies as a refugee.ouda ins,cir.in this case,the ij and the bia determined that the shkabaris were ineligible for asylum because they did not qualify as refugees.a refugee is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.where,as here,the bia affirms the ij decision without opinion,we review the ij decision directly.denko ins,cir.in this case,the ij denied petitioners relief because he concluded shkabari was not credible and shkabari had failed to meet her burden of proof.for the following reasons,we affirm.
before turning to the substance of the ij findings,we note that our task is complicated by a seemingly contradictory statement in the ij opinion regarding his evaluation of petitioner corroborating documentation.longstanding principles concerning judicial review of administrative action require that we assess the administrative agency decision solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.sec chenery.thus,a reviewing court will not guess at the theory underlying the agency action nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.id.at.an agency must therefore set forth its reasoning with such clarity as to be understandable.id.at.however,n o principle of administrative law or common sense requires us to remand a case in quest of a perfect opinion unless there is reason to believe that the remand might lead to a different result.fisher bowen,cir,cited in kobetic comm r of soc,cir when remand would be an idle and useless formality,courts are not required to convert judicial review of agency action into a game.quoting nlrb,d.
the pursuit of perfection is particularly unwise in the immigration context,where we frequently review oral decisions given shortly after the conclusion of the hearing.see guchshenkov ashcroft,cir evans,concurring discussing conditions under which ijs conduct hearings.while this context is no excuse for patently inadequate reasoning,see recinos de leon gonzales,cir acknowledging sobering realities facing ijs but remanding where opinion is extreme in its lack of a coherent explanation,we examine the opinion to see if it speaks with sufficient particularity and clarity.gailius ins,cir emphasis added quoting hartooni ins,cir.this court has acted accordingly,remanding a case to the bia when it denied petitioner relief after repudiating an ij adverse credibility vitiating the only rationale given did not identify any other basis for its denial of relief.gjyzi ashcroft,cir.
in this case,the ij reasoned with such clarity as to be understandable.chenery,at.but that is not to say that we are not puzzled by portions of the ij opinion.particularly troubling is one point where the ij considers the documents submitted by the shkabaris and assumes that the documents were credible because petitioners offered them in support of their application.it would then be difficult to justify any adverse credibility determination because the petitioners submitted certificates filled out by doctors and democratic party officials corroborating the stories of persecution related by shkabari in some detail.see translations and originals of four certificates.however,the remainder of the ij opinion makes clear that he did not find the documents credible.just a few paragraphs earlier,he found shkabari not to be credible and note d that the government has pointed out material inconsistencies in documents that were offered in support of the application.emphasis added see also hearing transcript i also noted certain credibility issues that i had with the testimony and the documents that were submitted.though that sentence implies that the documents were internally inconsistent,our review of the government alleged inconsistencies reveals tension between petitioners testimony and their documents,rather than inconsistencies within the documents themselves.see.nevertheless,review of the entire opinion makes clear that the ij did not find shkabari credible and that inconsistencies concerning the documents markedly detracted from their credibility.we therefore conclude that the ij reasoning was sufficiently clear to sustain review.we proceed to evaluate that reasoning.
we review adverse credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test.guang run yu ashcroft,cir.in the immigration context,that test has been construed to allow reversal only if the evidence presented by the petitioner was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.ins,d.this standard has since been codified by regulations that allow this cou
