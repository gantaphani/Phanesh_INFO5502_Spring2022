background 
liti and his wife,both of whom are years old,are natives and citizens of albania their daughter,sabina,is a native of germany but a citizen of albania.at their removal hearing,the litis testified that beginning in they became involved in activities in albania,for which they were repeatedly arrested and jailed.liti explained that he participated in public demonstrations and distributed pamphlets.at one such demonstration,he claimed that he participated with protestors in tearing down a statute of stalin,located in the center of tirana,the capital of the country.he also testified that he was detained in for three or four days,during which his feet were repeatedly hit with a plastic stick and he was placed in an unheated room during winter.liti explained that because they knew that we did like the sic communism the communists would come and pick me up and they would torture me not because of what i did but because they were suspicious of me.joint appendix at removal hr g tr.at.liti testified at the removal hearing that she spent a year in prison in albania for insulting a communist official.the litis also claimed that their family members were persecuted as well.specifically,the litis claimed that liti father and liti grandfather were executed by the communists and that liti brother spent eight years in prison for attempting to leave the country.
on july,fearing a police crackdown of activities,liti,along with his wife and five others,crashed a truck through the front gate of the german embassy in tirana.because the germans did not hand the protesters over to the albanian authorities,other activists sought refuge within the embassy grounds.liti testified that up to people entered the compound.for fourteen days,the protestors remained within the german embassy grounds,while the albanian government attempted to force them out by shutting off the water and electricity.liti claimed that the albanian government even sent in a truck with contaminated water to harm the protestors.eventually the united nations arranged passage for the protestors to germany,where they were granted political asylum.
in,the communist regime in albania fell and was replaced by a parliamentary republic.accordingly,in,the german government revoked the asylum status of all the albanian protesters,including the litis.in april,liti and his wife,along with their two daughters who were born in germany,entered the united states as visitors and filed an application for asylum the immigration and naturalization service ins referred the asylum application to the immigration court and issued a notice to appear charging the litis with violation of a b of the ina,a b.at their removal hearing,the litis conceded their unlawful status,but requested asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat.in support of their request,the litis asserted that if they were to return to albania,they would be persecuted for their leadership role in the toppling of the communist regime.liti testified that he and his wife were the first ones that stood up against the communism sic,they will never ever forget that,and if i go back to albania now,they are going to kill me,i am going to be the first one,they would kill me.at removal hr g tr.at.liti fears returning even after the collapse of the communist regime,because he believes the currently elected socialist party is comprised of the same people who were in power during the communist regime or their descendants.he stated that t he communism regime never collapsed,they pretended that the communist sic collapsed but it will never collapse.at removal hr g tr.at.liti echoed this fear,stating that we are very well known and prominent people,we are the first one,we are the first one that destroyed everything the same people are there,their children are in power and they could never,ever forget what happened.at removal hr g tr.at.to corroborate their claims,liti stated that a former demonstrator,who participated in the embassy and was granted asylum in germany,was murdered by the communists upon his return to albania.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the immigration judge ij denied the litis requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat.the ij found the litis to be incredible based on several inconsistencies between their testimony and the asylum application they submitted.specifically,the application did not mention either the litis participation in the toppling of the statute of stalin or their leadership role in crashing the german embassy gate.therefore,the ij characterized the litis testimony as embellishment rather than fact.the ij also noted that the litis failed to present any additional evidence to corroborate their claims of a fear of future persecution.given the fact that liti brother,with whom he claims he is in frequent contact,is a journalist in greece covering the injustices in albania,the ij concluded that documentation in the form of newspaper articles or affidavits was reasonably available to them.most importantly,the litis failed to provide any evidence to prove their claim that a fellow demonstrator,whose asylum in germany had been revoked,had been murdered upon his return to albania.furthermore,even if the litis were credible,the ij held that they would not be entitled to relief in light of the changed conditions in albania.finally,the ij found that evidence of past persecution was not so severe as to warrant a discretionary grant of asylum on humanitarian grounds.the litis filed a timely notice of appeal to the bia.
on march,the bia affirmed the ij decision,finding that on the total record of oral testimony and documentary evidence as to country conditions in albania,the litis do not meet the definition of a refugee as set forth in the ina.at bia decision at.specifically,the bia agreed with the ij adverse credibility determination based on the discrepancies between the litis hearing testimony and their asylum application.furthermore,the bia held the background evidence in the record contradicted the litis claim of a fear of future persecution and also concluded that the absence of reasonably available corroborating evidence militated against their claims.the litis now petition this court for review.
ii.analysis 
asylum claim 
the litis argue in their petition that the bia erred in denying their request for asylum.under the ina,the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee,which is defined as one who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b,a a.we review administrative findings of fact concerning whether an alien qualifies as a refugee under a substantial evidence test.ramani ashcroft,cir.under that standard,findings of fact are treated as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.yu ashcroft,cir quoting b b.t he petitioner must show that the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite persecution or fear of persecution.ouda ins,cir.upon review in this case,we conclude that the record does not compel a contrary result.
under the ina,an applicant for asylum bears the burden of demonstrating that persecution is a reasonable possibility should he be returned to his country of origin.perkovic ins,cir internal quotation omitted.the applicant need not demonstrate that he will probably be persecuted if returned because o ne can certainly have a fear of an event happening when there is less than a chance of the occurrence taking place.ins,d.in this case,the bia found that the litis failed to satisfy this burden because their testimony was incredible,they presented no corroborating evidence though it was reasonably available,and the government demonstrated a fundamental change in circumstances in albania to dispel any fears of future persecution upon their return.the litis challenge those findings.
adverse credibility determination 
the first issue which the litis raise in their petition is that the bia erred in affirming the ij adverse credibility determination.we have stated that though an adverse credibility finding is afforded substantial deference,the finding must be supported by specific reasons.an adverse credibility finding must be based on issues that go to the heart of the applicant claim.they can not be based on an irrelevant inconsistency.sylla ins,cir internal quotation and citations omitted.moreover,s peculation and conjecture can not form the basis of an adverse credibility finding,which must instead be based on substantial evidence.shire ashcroft,cir internal quotation omitted.where the credibility determination is based on inconsistencies unsupported in the record,we have reversed the determination.sylla,at see also ileana ins,wl,at cir,the court will not accept blindly an ij conclusion that a petitioner is not credible.in this case,the record does not support the bia credibility finding,and therefore,we are compelled to a contrary result.
in its decision,the bia deferred to the ij adverse credibility determination because there were important conflicts between the testimony of the lead respondent and the written asylum application on central events of the asylum claim,and no reasonable explanation for those discrepancies was provided.at bia decision at.the discrepancies were explained by the ij as the omission of certain events from liti asylum application.specifically,the ij found that liti failed to mention in the application his participat ion in the toppling of stalin monument during a major anticommunist protest in albania and his leadership role in crashing the gates of the german embassy with his own vehicle.at ij decision order at.like affirmative inconsistencies,omissions may form the basis of an adverse credibility determination,provided that they are substantially related to the asylum claim.ins,cir ins,cir.in this case,however,neither of the omissions cited by the ij are substantial enough to justify an adverse credibility determination.
specifically,the ij did not find anything in the application which contradicted the litis later testimony at the removal hearing.in the application,liti wrote that his family was involved in the democratic movement,that they attended secret meetings,and that they demonstrated against the communists to bring democracy to the country.in his supplemental application,he wrote that he was an activist and escaped from albania to germany and was granted asylum there.liti attached to the asylum application the letter from the german government,which stated that the litis sought protection in the german embassy in tirana in and were granted asylum.while the ij is correct that the application itself did not provide specific details of the two events about which the litis testified,the application does not contain any specific incidents,but rather consists of generalized statements of the litis activities in albania under the ij reasoning,any incident to which the litis testified at the removal hearing could be used to justify an inconsistency supporting an adverse credibility determination.the absence of specific incidents in the application,however,does not give rise to the inference that the litis are incredible,but rather reinforces their claim of a long history of political protest which can not be limited to a few specific instances.the litis asylum claim is based on a series of events over six years,which demonstrate their political activity as well as the resulting persecution by the albanian government.when measured against their six years of protest,the omission of one specific incident,such as the tearing down of stalin statue,is insubstantial and does not go to the heart of their broader asylum claim.see,at.
furthermore,we reject the bia underlying rationale that the litis are required to provide an exhaustive,detailed list of their activities in their asylum application.as the second circuit stated,the circumstances surrounding the application process do not often lend themselves to a perfectly complete and comprehensive recitation of an applicant claim to asylum or withholding,and holding applicants to such a standard is not only unrealistic but also unfair.id.at.the court noted that 
the form utilized by the ins for applications for asylum and withholding provides half a page for the applicant to explain why he or she is seeking asylum,and no more than two inches to recount mistreatment or threats against the applicant or the applicant family by the government or other groups.although the application invites the applicant to attach additional pages,we think the small space on the form itself would hardly indicate to an applicant that the failure to include every detail regarding the basis for asylum could later lead to an adverse credibility finding when the applicant elaborates on them in the course of a deportation hearing.
see also ileana,wl,at holding that several omissions of specific incidents in an asylum application do not support an adverse credibility determination pop ins,cir we hesitate to find that one seeking asylum must state in his or her application every incident of persecution lest the applicant have his or her credibility questioned if the incident is later elicited in direct testimony,at holding that the omission of two collateral incidents is insufficient to support an adverse credibility determination where there were no contradictions between the information set forth in the application and his testimony.the purpose of holding a removal hearing is not simply to reiterate the statements made in the asylum application,but rather to allow an alien to present evidence on the alien own behalf including to elaborate on the generalized claims made in the application itself.b b.therefore,because the statements in the application were not inconsistent with the litis subsequent testimony of the specific events at their removal hearing,we conclude the bia adverse credibility finding is unsupported by the evidence,and therefore we are compelled to conclude to the contrary.
changed country conditions and the absence of corroboration 
the second issue raised in the petition is that the bia erred by concluding that even if the litis were credible,they were not entitled to relief in light of the fundamentally changed conditions in albania and the absence of reasonably available corroborating evidence.upon review of the record,we hold that the bia decision is supported by substantial evidence.
because the litis were granted asylum in germany in,the government stipulated to the fact that the litis suffered past persecution based on a statutorily protected ground,which entitles them to a presumption of a fear of future persecution.b.where an albanian asylum applicant has demonstrated past persecution based on the applicant activities,the collapse of the communist regime may be a sufficient change in country conditions to rebut that
