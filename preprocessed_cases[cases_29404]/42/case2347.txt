on june,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against bakarian by filing a notice to appear in immigration court,charging him with removability under a a ii,as an alien convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.the notice alleged that bakarian was a native and citizen of ukraine who was admitted to the united states on or about may,as an immigrant.the notice continued to list four separate convictions for forgery,intimidation of a victim,and two thefts of property,noting that those crimes did not arise out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.
bakarian appeared before the ij on september,and admitted,while under oath,the allegations set forth in the notice.bakarian stated that he first came to the united states in,then went back to moscow to study,and received his permanent resident visa in.the ij then went through each of the four convictions listed on the notice.the first was a forgery conviction from a wisconsin state court on november,and bakarian explained that this offense involved a stolen check.the second was a november,wisconsin state court conviction for the offense of intimidate reporting,which bakarian stated occurred while he was out on bond on the forgery charge.he violated one of the conditions of his bond,which was not to have contact with the victims.the third conviction was a september,conviction from the municipal court in los angeles county,california for theft on september.the final conviction was also a los angeles county theft conviction for a theft on august.regarding the first of these thefts,bakarian stated that he had left his father house and was hungry so he stole some meat,and the second theft he stole vodka.in an attempt to ascertain whether bakarian was eligible for cancellation of removal as a permanent resident,the ij questioned bakarian about when he entered the country.the ij gave bakarian an application to file for cancellation of removal and directed bakarian to fill out the application and bring it back to the ij on september.the ij also requested from dhs a copy of bakarian immigrant visas,evidence showing that bakarian was first here in,and the government position on whether bakarian was eligible for cancellation of removal.the ij continued the hearing until september.
on september,bakarian again appeared before the ij,and this time he submitted an application for cancellation of removal.according to his application for cancellation of removal,bakarian entered the united states on november,as a visitor,and left that same year to return to the soviet union.bakarian also stated on his application that he came back to the united states on august,as a lawful permanent resident.however,documentary evidence from dhs established that he did not come back into this country until march.in response to the ij inquiry,the government stated that it had no record of bakarian obtaining residency in.despite the date on his immigrant visa and no documentation of an entry into the united states in,bakarian insisted to the ij that his first entry into the united states as a lawful permanent resident took place in.at some point after attaining lawful permanent residence status,bakarian testified that he returned to moscow,where his passport had been stolen.bakarian testified that he got his replacement green card in and returned to the united states in.towards the end of the hearing,bakarian requested that his case be transferred to los angeles,california,where he stated his father was in the hospital,paralyzed after a heart attack.the ij responded 
sir,here the difficulty you face.in order to be eligible for cancellation of removal,you have to have resided in the united states for seven years after a lawful admission and prior to committing any deportable offenses.now,if you got your resident status in,you would have to show that you have a clean record for seven years after that even to apply for cancellation of removal.the government attorney is contending that you did get your resident status until,and your conviction records show that you were convicted of theft in august of and september of,and you would not have accumulated the seven years necessary to apply for cancellation of removal.so it very critical to try to come up with some evidence to show whether you really got your visa in or was it the year,because the government records that they have submitted to the court today show that you got your residence in.
the ij had found that bakarian was deportable because of his criminal record,and told bakarian that he thought you might be eligible to apply for cancellation of your removal,and that why i provided you that application,but if you do have seven years in the united states prior to commission of your criminal offense,then you would not be eligible for cancellation of removal,and the record shows that you do not have seven years.the ij asked bakarian if he had an attorney,and bakarian responded that he did not and was not eligible for representation from legal aid.the ij then stated,
what i going to do is find that you not eligible to apply for cancellation of removal,because you ca meet the requirements for that benefit.and what i do is i just dictate a decision.i going to have the officer fax your application to your court.and then you will decide whether or not you want to appeal my decision or not.now,you get to designate to which country you would be deported to,but if that country wo accept you,then alternatively you will be deported to the ukraine.
the ij then notified bakarian of various options that he might pursue to seek a waiver of removal.the ij set the next hearing for september,on bakarian application to transfer his case to los angeles,his eligibility for waiver of removal under section c of the ina,and whether his eligibility for cancellation of removal is going to be held.
on september,the ij reconvened bakarian hearing.the ij noted that the government had presented two immigrant visas for bakarian one dated march,and a second dated may.bakarian stated that he got a stamp in his passport from the united states embassy in moscow in august and that passport had been stolen.in response to the ij query,bakarian stated that he did not remember when he came into the united states.bakarian did acknowledge that the document stating that the first time he entered the united states in was right,but stated that he came as a visitor in staying for six or seven months.bakarian testified that he then went back to the soviet union to finish some business there for two months and then returned to the united states as a visitor for another six months.he had not testified to these departures at the prior hearing nor listed them on his application for cancellation of removal.bakarian stated that he left the united states again in to go back the soviet union for a month and while he was there he got a permanent resident visa after his father,who was living in the united states,applied for one for him.
bakarian stated that from,he stayed in the united states until,at which time he returned to russia for his grandmother funeral.bakarian then came back to the united states in may.the ij noted that on his application bakarian did not list the various departures about which he testified at the hearings.when the ij inquired about their absence from the form,bakarian stated that his english was not so good,and the ij rescheduled the hearing for a time when a russian interpreter could be present to assist bakarian.
bakarian again appeared before the ij on november,and this time an interpreter was present.the ij reviewed the documentary evidence with bakarian,which included documents relating to his four criminal convictions,two immigrant visas,his application for removal,and an affidavit from his father.bakarian father affidavit stated that bakarian is in fact a permanent resident of the united states of america since.there was a visa issued on january,which was stamped on march,designating that bakarian was a permanent resident.the ij rejected bakarian contention that a separate faxed form indicated that bakarian entered the united states as a permanent resident in,particularly in light of the january,application date of immigrant visa.bakarian stated that he entered this country five to six times,including in and in was the last time he entered the united states before removal proceedings commenced.bakarian testified that he first came to the united states in and his later returns were in,or,and.while he was in russia in when bakarian contends that his documents were stolen,his father filed a document on april,which listed bakarian address as odessa,ukraine.
at the hearing,the ij concluded that there was no evidence to substantiate bakarian claim that he had entered the united states as permanent resident in,but found that bakarian assumed that status in.moreover,the ij noted that bakarian had some significant absences from the united states since a year from to,a month and a half in,several months in,and several months in.the ij noted that bakarian had been a permanent resident for more than five years and continued,you also have to establish that you have been continuously physically present in the united states for seven years after a lawful admission to the united states and that date that that ends would be the date that you committed an offense which would subject you to being removed from the united states.after reviewing his los angeles convictions,the latest being september,the ij determined that was the date of his permanent residence period.because he found that bakarian status as a permanent resident did not commence until march,the ij concluded that bakarian could not establish seven years continuous physical presence,and therefore,can not establish that he was statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal.
the ij proceeded to explain other forms of relief that might be available to bakarian after he indicated that his father was going to file a visa petition on his behalf.the ij scheduled another hearing which was held on december.when bakarian appeared for the december hearing,his father had not yet filed a subsequent visa petition,and the ij closed the hearing.
on april,the ij issued a written decision and order.in his order,the ij stated,in the instant case,the respondent would satisfy the continuous residence requirement if he establishes that he resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status.the ij noted that he previously found that bakarian three theft convictions in constituted crimes involving moral turpitude,thereby ending bakarian continuous residence on august,the date of the second theft.the ij continued,i f the offense was committed within years of respondent admission to the united states,the respondent can not establish the required continuous residence.
in his order,the ij rejected bakarian position that his continuous residence began in when he first visited,stating a ccording to his testimony,respondent went back and forth to the ussr several times for months at a time and did not come to reside in the united states until.the ij also rejected bakarian contention that he became a lawful permanent resident in because the documentary evidence listed the date as march,and bakarian father visa application for him was dated november.the ij ultimately found that bakarian continuous residence did not begin until because bakarian resided in russia in and.however,even crediting bakarian with his continuous residence commencing in march,the ij concluded that bakarian failed to meet the continuous residence requirement because the period ended on august.
the ij also concluded that bakarian was not eligible for a waiver of removal pursuant to section c of the ina because he had entered a guilty plea after section c had been repealed.the ij also addressed bakarian application for waiver of removal pursuant to h of the ina as a son of a united states citizen who can establish that his removal would result in extreme hardship to his father and that the relief is warranted as a matter of discretion.the ij denied the waiver because bakarian did not have the requisite approved visa petition,even after the ij had granted bakarian a continuance and gave him specific instructions on what he needed to do in order to be eligible for a waiver under h.
bakarian appealed to the bia arguing that his convictions did not constitute crimes involving moral turpitude,and that he had resided in the united states in excess of seven years,thereby qualifying him for cancellation of his convictions as well as waiver of his convictions.the bia rejected bakarian arguments.it found that his convictions were crimes involving moral turpitude and agreed with the ij that bakarian had failed to establish continual residence for seven years.bakarian also asserted that the ij violated his right to due process of law.in response,the bia concluded that bakarian did not show that his hearing was not fairly conducted.accordingly,the bia dismissed bakarian appeal,and bakarian now petitions this court for review.
on appeal,bakarian contends that the ij erred in applying the continuous physical presence standard to his case and failing to consider bakarian entry as a in in calculating his period of continuous residence.when the bia adopts and supplements the ij reasoning,we review the ij decision as supplemented by the bia.binrashed gonzales,cir citation omitted.we will affirm the bia decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.citation omitted.we may not reverse simply because we would have decided the case differently.margos gonzales,cir citations omitted.instead,we will reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.youkhana gonzales,cir citation omitted.this court may review a discretionary as the denial of a request for an adjustment of status or a denial of a waiver of where the petition raises constitutional claims or questions of law.khan mukasey,cir citation omitted.
pursuant to a,it is within the attorney general discretion to 
cancel removal in the case of an alien who is admissible or deportable from the united states if the alien has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
the bia has interpreted the plain meaning of the statutory language to mean that the respondent period of residence after his admission as a nonimmigrant may be considered in calculating the period of continuous residence for purposes of this section.in re,bia.a period of continuous residence is deemed to end either when the alien receives notice to appear or commits an offense that would make him inadmissible or removable under certain sections of the immigration code.d.offenses that render an alien removable include crimes of moral turpitude id.the attorney general also has discretion to cancel removal for a resident,but only if,among other things,that individual has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period.b a see also d an alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain continual physical presence in the united states if the alien has departed from the united states for any period in excess of days or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding days.because bakarian had permanent residence status as of,which was more than five years,it was his burden to establish that he had continuously resided in the united states for seven years after his first admission in order to establish eligibility for relief fro
