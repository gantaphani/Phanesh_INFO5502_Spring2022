facts and procedural history 
romero was born in mexico in july.in february,when romero was ten years old,he accompanied his mother into the united states.at that time,his mother possessed a valid border crossing card,which permitted them to remain in the united states for no more than hours.romero has continuously resided in this country since his entry.both romero parents are now lawful permanent residents.
in,when romero was twenty years old,he was arrested for possession of a controlled substance in violation of california health and safety code a.romero was allowed to participate in california drug rehabilitation program under california penal code.
pursuant to the rehabilitation program,in april,romero pled guilty to one count of simple possession of a controlled substance,and the judge deferred entry of judgment for eighteen months.when a defendant successfully completes the deferred judgment program,the criminal charges against him or her are dismissed.code stating that i f the defendant has performed satisfactorily during the period in which deferred entry of judgment was granted,at the end of that period,the criminal charge or charges shall be dismissed.furthermore,following successful completion of the program,california penal code section d provides that the plea of guilty shall not constitute a conviction for any purpose 
if romero successfully completed the program,the criminal charge against him was scheduled to be dismissed in october.following romero appearance in state court on the drug charge,however,immigration officials detained romero and initiated removal proceedings against him,charging him as being removable for overstaying his visa in immigration court,romero admitted the allegations and conceded his removability,and in october,he filed an application for cancellation of removal pursuant to b.
to be eligible for cancellation of removal under section b,romero needed to satisfy four requirements that he had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than ten years immediately preceding the date of application,that he had been a person of good moral character during that period,that he had not been convicted of an offense under a and certain other offenses not relevant here,and that removal would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to romero lawful permanent resident parents.b.
in considering whether romero was eligible for cancellation of removal,the ij considered two potential effects concerning romero controlled substance offense,which had not yet been expunged.to satisfy the second eligibility requirement for cancellation of removal,romero had to show that he was a person of good moral character for a period of ten years preceding the date of his application for cancellation.but a person can not be considered one of good moral character if he or she was convicted of,or admits having committed,or admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of an offense under a a or b.f emphases added.the ij determined that if romero state court guilty plea were classified as an admission that he had committed a controlled substance offense,romero would be statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because under b b he would not be considered to be a person of good moral character.
on the other hand,if romero controlled substance offense were classified as a conviction,he could not satisfy the third eligibility requirement for cancellation of removal because he would be a person convicted of a controlled substance offense under.a a i ii.b.the ij held hearings to determine whether romero charged controlled substance offense should be treated as a conviction under congress definition of that term under a a,even though the state court deferred judgment for eighteen months.
in february,the ij issued her decision.the ij found that romero could not show good moral character,the second requirement for cancellation of removal under b.the ij found that romero admitted he had committed a controlled substance offense by pleading guilty in state court.accordingly,the ij found that romero could not be considered a person of good moral character under f,even though entry of judgment on the controlled substance offense had not been entered but deferred by the state court.
the ij found that romero drug offense failed to meet congress new definition of a conviction as defined by a a.specifically,the new definition of conviction requires that a judge order some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the alien liberty to be imposed.a a ii.the ij found that the requirement that romero enroll in a deferred judgment aids education program for three months was not a form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on liberty to be imposed within the meaning of section a a.accordingly,the ij found that romero satisfied the third requirement for eligibility for cancellation of removal because he was not convicted of a controlled substance offense under.but because romero could not satisfy section b second eligibility requirement by showing good moral character,the ij ruled that romero was not statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed.
in june,romero timely appealed to the bia.while romero appeal was pending before the bia,we issued our opinion in ins,cir.in,we held that a,simple possession drug conviction expunged under the federal first offender act ffoa could not be used for immigration purposes,nor could a state conviction expunged under a state rehabilitative statute be used for immigration purposes,where the defendant in the state action would have been eligible for relief under the ffoa.at.
in february,the bia dismissed romero appeal.the bia concluded that the ij determination that romero state court guilty plea was not a conviction was in accordance with ninth circuit law as articulated in.accordingly,romero satisfied the third cancellation of removal requirement,because he was not convicted of a controlled substance offense.b c.
the bia agreed with the ij,however,that romero guilty plea constituted an admission of a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance which made him unable to demonstrate that he was a person of good moral character under f.the bia agreed with the ij that romero was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal and dismissed the appeal.
in april,romero timely filed a motion to reopen before the bia.romero submitted new evidence with the motion,showing that on april,nunc pro tunc to october,the state court set aside romero guilty plea and dismissed the charge against him after he successfully completed the drug rehabilitation program.romero argued that controverted the bia finding that romero guilty plea constituted an admission rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal.because the charge against romero had been dismissed,romero argued that under,the offense could not be used against him for any purpose.with the motion,romero submitted copies of the relevant state court documents and requested that the case be remanded to the ij for consideration of the new evidence and in light of.the government opposed the motion.
in august the bia denied romero motion to reopen.the bia found that while the court documents relating to romero conviction were not previ
