the petitioner,zhong guang sun,seeks review of the denial by the board of immigration appeals bia of his motion to reconsider its dismissal of his appeal from the decision of an immigration judge ij denying his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.the petition presents the issue whether the bia abused its discretion when it denied sun motion to reconsider its dismissal of his appeal on the grounds that the notice was untimely,where the petitioner had sent the notice of appeal from new york city to the bia in falls church,virginia,by airborne express overnight delivery to arrive on the date of the deadline,and where the petitioner submitted a receipt and a letter from airborne that airborne express had guaranteed delivery of the notice on the date of the deadline,but as a result of its error,had delivered the notice five days late.
because we conclude that the bia erred in indicating that it was unable under any circumstance including these to hear an untimely appeal,we grant the petition,vacate the order,and remand sun case to the bia for further proceedings.in doing so,we imply no view as to the merits of the petitioner application for asylum.
background 
zhong guang sun,a citizen of china,entered the united states unlawfully in april.several months thereafter,he applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief pursuant to the cat based on his opposition to china coercive family planning policies.at the close of a hearing on march,an ij denied the petitioner application and notified him that,should he choose to appeal,the deadline for filing his notice of appeal was thirty days thereafter april.
on april,the day before the deadline,the petitioner lawyer sent the petitioner notice of appeal for overnight delivery via airborne express from new york city to falls church,virginia,to arrive by noon on april,as the result of an acknowledged error by airborne express,however,the notice of appeal did not arrive at the offices of the bia until april,five days late 
on may,the bia,in a per curiam order,dismissed the petitioner appeal.
the appeal is untimely.a notice of appeal must be filed within calendar days of an immigration judge oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday,in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day.see b,c.in the instant case,the immigration judge decision was rendered orally on march.the appeal was accordingly due on or before april.the record reflects,however,that the notice of appeal was filed with the board of immigration appeals on april.we find that the appeal is untimely.
in re zhong guang sun,no,slip op.at may,per curiam 
on june,the petitioner filed with the bia a timely motion to reconsider.on october,in another per curiam order,the agency acknowledged the petitioner request that the bia not penalize him for the airborne error which caused the delay in the submission of his appeal.in re zhong guang sun,no,slip op.at,per curiam.it denied the motion,however,stating 
we note that a notice of appeal must be received at the board within days from the date of the immigration judge decision or mailing date of the decision if later.see b.a is placed on all filings received at the clerk office,and is controlling in the computation of timely filing.we note also,that the regulations set strict deadlines for the filing of an appeal,and the board does not have the authority to extend the time in which to file a notice of appeal.see b.
accordingly,the motion to reconsider is denied.
id.emphasis added.
sun petitions this court for review of the bia october order.although he also asserts in his petition that he established a fear of persecution entitling him to asylum and withholding of removal,our review of the bia order is limited to the question whether the bia abused its discretion in denying,as barred by applicable regulations containing time limitations,sun motion to reconsider its dismissal of his appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review for abuse of discretion the bia denial of a motion to reconsider.see salta ins,cir mardones mcelroy,cir applying the abuse of discretion standard to a motion to reopen.in doing so,w e review the bia underlying conclusions of law de novo,with the caveat that the bia interpretations of ambiguous provisions of the immigration and nationality act are owed substantial deference unless arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d other citations omitted.thus,we will uphold the decision if it is not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law,ins,cir per curiam quoting vargas ins,cir.
ii.untimely bia appeals 
the petitioner first argues that his notice of appeal was timely filed by reference to federal rule of appellate procedure c,which provides that s ervice by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on mailing or delivery to the carrier.fed.c.but this rule simply does not apply to the bia.even if it did,the rule also makes clear that filing as opposed to papers other than briefs and appendices,see fed.a b,is not timely unless the clerk receives the papers within the time fixed for filing,fed.a a emphasis added.the bia regulations mirror rule a,stating that the filing date for an appeal to the bia is the date the notice is received by the bia.c emphasis added the petitioner argument on this score is thus entirely without merit.
the petitioner also argues that courts have granted petitions for review where a delay in an appeal to the bia arose as a result of unique circumstances beyond the petitioner control.this,he says,is such a case.we find this approach more persuasive.we think that while under normal circumstances the bia can not hear appeals,it may hear such appeals in unique or extraordinary circumstances.
although courts that have considered the time limit within which a person is required to file a notice of appeal with the bia have generally described the requirement as mandatory and jurisdictional,see,ins,cir atiqullah ins,cir per curiam ins,cir,those courts have nonetheless recognized that there may be exceptions to that rule in unique or extraordinary cases,see,at atiqullah,at,at.in,for example,the ninth circuit concluded that d espite the note of finality sounded by the mandatory and jurisdictional principle,the deadline for bia appeals is not inflexible and u nder certain unique circumstances,an appellate tribunal may have jurisdiction to hear an appeal that was not filed within the prescribed time limits.id.at.
the government points out,though,that these cases involve some form of official misleading of the filer leading to the delay.in,the ij himself inadvertently misled the petitioner into thinking that the ij could grant a extension for his appeal.id.at.the ninth circuit noted that i n such unique circumstances,where there has been official misleading as to the time within which to file a notice of appeal,the late notice may be deemed to have been constructively filed within the jurisdictional time limits.id.at.similarly,in vlaicu ins,cir per curiam,the ninth circuit concluded that the bia may have jurisdiction to hear an untimely appeal where the appellant was misled by the words or conduct of the court,id.at quoting,at see also shamsi ins,cir per curiam.
the eighth circuit in atiqullah also noted that g enerally,the time limit for filing a notice of appeal to the bia is mandatory and jurisdictional.atiqullah,at.it concluded,however,that because the regulation defining the appeals deadline was ambiguous,unique circumstances existed such that the petitioner late filing should be excused.id.such imprecise draftsmanship may,as the government suggests,be viewed as a form of official misleading.resp t br.at.
the government contends that t hose cases that have crafted an exception to the regulations to require the bia to accept notices of appeal have done so only where government action has prevented timely filing.resp t br.at.but while the case law has indeed largely been decided in that context,we do not read
