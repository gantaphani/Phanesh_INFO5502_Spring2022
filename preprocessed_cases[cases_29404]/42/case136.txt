petitioner li sheng wu wu,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,challenges the board of immigration appeals bia order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings.specifically,wu disputes the bia finding that he failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief.after careful consideration,we deny wu petition for review.
background 
wu entered the united states without inspection on or before february.on that day,the department of homeland security apprehended wu in texas and served him with a notice to appear before the immigration court.the notice charged wu with being subject to removal pursuant to a a i.wu appeared before an immigration judge ij on april,and the ij found that wu had admitted the allegations against him and conceded removability.
on june,wu submitted an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief pursuant to the convention against torture cat.wu claimed that he feared persecution due to china population control policies.the ij heard wu testimony and subsequently denied his applications on april,ordering wu removal to china.wu appealed the ij decision to the bia,which affirmed the denial of relief on july.
wu timely moved to reopen his case on september,citing changed country conditions.wu claimed that he had become a christian and that the persecution of christians in china had worsened since the ij denied his asylum application in april.wu motion and accompanying affidavit generally described the chinese government restrictions on the practice of religion,including the requirement that christians worship in registered churches rather than unregistered house churches.wu also submitted a certificate of baptism,several online newspaper articles,a march report from chinaaid,and a may report from the commission on international religious freedom.the reports described the ongoing harassment of christians in china,and the articles described a number of topics,including a government crackdown against an unregistered church in beijing,political unrest in china,and the arrests of human rights advocates.
on june,the bia denied wu motion to reopen removal proceedings,finding that the evidence wu provided was insufficient to establish his prima facie eligibility for any form of relief.the bia found that wu had proffered only evidence that described the conditions for christians in china generally.he failed to provide any evidence that the chinese government was aware or was likely to become aware of his religious activities in the united states.the bia concluded that,based on the proffered evidence,wu had not shown a reasonable likelihood that he would be targeted for persecution on account of his religion.wu timely petition for review followed.
ii.analysis 
motions to reopen removal proceedings are generally disfavored because they run counter to the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.hang chen holder,cir quoting guerrero santana gonzales,cir.therefore,a bia decision on a motion to reopen is accorded deference,and we review it only for abuse of discretion.le bin zhu holder,cir carter,cir.this means that we will uphold the bia decision unless the complaining party can show that the bia committed an error of law or exercised its judgment in an arbitrary,capricious,or irrational way.le bin zhu,at quoting raza gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in conducting this review,we accept the bia findings of fact as long as they are supported by substantial evidence,and we review legal conclusions de novo.smith holder,cir.
because motions to reopen are governed by a number of statutory and regulatory provisions,we pause here to briefly describe the relevant legal landscape before proceeding.by statute,a n alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings.c.such motions must meet two threshold requirements they must establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought and they must introduce previously unavailable,material evidence.fesseha ashcroft,cir quoting ins abudu,internal quotation marks omitted.a petitioner who seeks to establish a prima facie case for asylum must show that he is unwilling or unable to return to his country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on the account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a 
of importance here,the fear requirement may be satisfied with evidence of a reasonable likelihood of future persecution,smith,at,so long as the fear is genuine and objectively reasonable.aguilar sol√≠s,cir.typically,to show that his fear is objectively reasonable,a petitioner must produce credible,direct,and specific evidence supporting a fear of individualized persecution in the future.decky holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also kho keisler,cir proving a future threat to life or freedom generally requires individualized evidence that the applicant will be singled out for persecution upon return to his home country.
applicants seeking withholding of removal or cat relief face even greater hurdles than those seeking asylum see santosa mukasey,cir the standard for withholding is more stringent than that for asylum.the cat standard,in turn,is more stringent than that for withholding of removal.internal citation omitted.for this reason,and because each argument wu presses applies equally to each petition,we focus our analysis only on wu asylum claim.if wu can not establish prima facie eligibility for asylum,his requests for withholding of removal and cat relief with their heightened requirements must also fail.we therefore turn now to wu claim that the bia abused its discretion by finding that he failed to establish prima facie eligibility for asylum.
according to wu,the bia abused its discretion by ignoring material evidence.specifically,wu claims that the bia ignored assertions in his affidavit that he would continue to practice his faith in china by joining an unregistered church and openly preaching the gospel.the bia ignored this evidence,wu claims,because it only considered the likelihood that wu religious activities in the united states would be discovered,and it failed to consider whether chinese authorities were likely to persecute wu if he continued his religious activities in china.to support this claim,wu points to the bia observation that the evidence does not indicate that chinese authorities are aware,or are likely to become aware,of his practice of christianity in the united states.wu reasons that because the bia made no similar statement regarding the possible discovery of his practice of christianity in china,it must have erroneously limited the scope of its analysis.finally,wu claims that the bia failure to explain why it chose to so restrict its analysis makes the decision inadequately reasoned such that it constitutes an abuse of discretion.see aponte holder,cir holding a denial of a motion to reopen based on failure to make out a prima facie case requires an adequate explanation to enable review.we disagree.
to begin,we note that the bia is not required to dissect in minute detail every contention that a complaining party advances,raza,at,or to discuss each piece of evidence proffered,morales,cir.the bia need only fairly consider the petitioner claims and state its decision in terms adequate to allow a reviewing court to conclude that the agency has thought about the evidence and the issues and reached a reasoned conclusion.raza,at.in this case,the bia complied with these requirements.it accurately described wu proffered evidence,which it acknowledged reflected the longstanding and ongoing problem of repression of religious freedom in china,before noting that such evidence was insufficient to merit relief because it only describes conditions generally for christians in china.the bia thus concluded that wu failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief because the evidence did not show a reasonable likelihood that he would be targeted based upon his religion.
although wu would have us find that the bia ignored evidence that he would be persecuted in china,in actuality,the record is devoid of evidence conn
