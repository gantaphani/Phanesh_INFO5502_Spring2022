ricardo cisneros resendiz cisneros challenges his conviction for illegal reentry after removal,in violation of,on the ground that the removal order on which the conviction was based was invalid.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
cisneros is a native and citizen of mexico.he was brought to the united states by his parents at the age of ten and spent much of his youth in the san diego area.
on january,cisneros attempted to enter the united states at the san ysidro port of entry,falsely claiming he was a citizen.because a san diego county warrant for cisneros arrest was outstanding,the department of homeland security dhs turned him over to state officials.cisneros was subsequently convicted of possession of methamphetamine.after completing his state jail sentence,cisneros was returned to dhs custody.
on february,dhs issued a notice to appear nta alleging that cisneros was inadmissible and subject to removal because he was an arriving alien who had applied for admission to the united states by an oral false claim to united states citizenship and had been convicted of a drug offense.on the basis of these allegations,the nta charged cisneros with being inadmissible under a a i ii a c ii and a a i i at a removal hearing on february,cisneros admitted the charges in the nta,and the immigration judge ij ordered him removed to mexico.cisneros was removed to mexico on the same day.
cisneros criminal history establishes that he was found in the united states at least four times following his february,removal.he was convicted of reckless driving on july,and was returned to mexico on september.on july,he was convicted of several violations of the california vehicle code,including driving on a suspended or revoked license,and sentenced to probation the next day he was returned to mexico.on january,he was convicted of possession of methamphetamine.a little over a month later,on february,he was again returned to mexico.finally,on september,cisneros was arrested by the carlsbad,california police for possessing grams of methamphetamine.he pleaded guilty to this offense and was sentenced to days in jail and years probation.
in february,cisneros was indicted by a federal grand jury for illegal reentry after removal,in violation of the government based its prosecution on cisneros february,removal order.before trial,cisneros moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the removal order was invalid because the removal proceedings were fundamentally unfair specifically,cisneros argued that the ij had failed to inform him that he could withdraw his application for admission into the united states,and he had been prejudiced as a result.the district court denied cisneros motion to dismiss the indictment.cisneros then entered into a plea agreement,which preserved his right to appeal the court denial after judgment was entered,cisneros filed this timely appeal.
on appeal,cisneros argues that the february,removal order was invalid,and therefore the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the count of the superseding indictment.we review this claim de novo.united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.
an alien commits the crime of illegal reentry after removal if the alien has been denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed or has departed the united states while an order of exclusion,deportation,or removal is outstanding,and thereafter enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in,the united states without the attorney general prior consent to the alien reapplication for admission or proof that the alien was not required to obtain such advance consent.a.thus,a predicate removal order is a necessary element of a prosecution.
an alien has a limited right to make a collateral attack on the validity of the removal order that is the predicate to the action.under d,an alien criminal defendant may challenge the validity of such a removal order if the alien demonstrates that the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d.the entry of a removal order is fundamentally unfair for purposes of d only if the removal proceeding violated the alien due process rights and the alien suffered prejudice as a result.united states arias ordonez,cir if the alien alleges that the ij failure to provide information about a form of potentially available discretionary relief caused a due process violation,the alien must show prejudice by establishing that it was plausible that the ij would have granted such relief.see united states barajas alvarado,wl,at cir,citing united states arce hernandez,cir.this requires the alien to demonstrate that,in light of the factors relevant to the form of relief being sought,and based on the unique circumstances of the alien own case,it was plausible not merely conceivable that the ij would have exercised his discretion in the alien favor.id.alteration in original quoting united states corrales beltran,cir.
in this case,cisneros argues that the ij failure to advise him of the possibility of withdrawing his application for admission at the time of the february,hearing was a violation of his due process rights.further,he argues,this violation prejudiced him because absent the error,he would have asked for permission to withdraw his application and plausibly would have received such relief.because determining whether cisneros has established a due process violation would require us to address an issue of first impression in our circuit we assume for present purposes that cisneros has established that his due process rights were violated,and begin our analysis with the question whether cisneros can show prejudice,whether he has demonstrated that it was plausible that the ij would have granted his request to withdraw his application for admission.
in order to evaluate cisneros claim of prejudice,we must review the framework authorizing ijs to permit aliens to withdraw their applications for admission.despite statutory and regulatory changes,the basic framework has remained consistent over time.
before the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,both ijs and immigration officers exercised their discretion to permit aliens to withdraw their applications for admission based on case law and internal practices.see barajas alvarado,wl,at.the bia precedential opinion,in re gutierrez,bia,provided guidance to ijs in exercising this discretion.gutierrez involved an alien who attempted to enter the united states at san francisco international airport by means of a fraudulent document.id.at.the ij determined that the alien was excludable,but permitted him to withdraw his application for admission,citing as positive considerations the facts that the applicant was married to a lawful permanent resident who would become eligible for citizenship in one year,had a united states citizen child and was expecting a second,had no arrest or welfare record,and had been gainfully employed and was supporting his family.id.at.
the bia reversed,holding that a balancing of the equities test is not an appropriate method by which to determine whether an alien merits permission to withdraw an application for admission.id.at.rather,the bia determined that a n immigration judge should not allow withdrawal unless an alien,in addition to demonstrating that he possesses both the intent and the means to depart immediately from the united states,establishes that factors directly relating to the issue of his admissibility indicate that granting withdrawal would be in the interest of justice,that justice would be ill served if an order of exclusion was entered.id.at.further,the bia ruled that once an ij has determined that an alien is excludable,permission to withdraw should ordinarily only be granted with the concurrence of the service.id.at.applying these principles to the case before it,the bia held that even if we were to disregard the applicant attempted fraudulent entry,we can discern no fact
