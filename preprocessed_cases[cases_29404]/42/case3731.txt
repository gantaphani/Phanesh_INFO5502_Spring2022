harpal singh cheema and his wife rajwinder kaur appeal from the board of immigration appeals bia decision denying cheema asylum and withholding of deportation and denying kaur asylum.we dismiss cheema appeal as moot.we reverse the bia denial of asylum for kaur and remand for further proceedings.
kaur found herself in a fundamentally unfair posture on her second trip to the bia.the board relied on classified evidence without giving her the barest summary notice required by the regulations,and the board overrode the immigration judge ij affirmative credibility finding by sanctioning the ij passing,unspecified reference to lack of candor.these errors go to the heart of the asylum ruling and require a remand to the board.
background 
the petitioners were before this court in cheema ashcroft,cir,which describes the lengthy immigration proceedings involving this couple and the government allegations that they engaged in terrorist activity.we held that the board erred in determining whether cheema was a danger to the security of the united states,and we remanded for determination under the correct legal standard.id.at.we affirmed denial of cheema claim under the convention against torture cat.because we were compelled to conclude that there is no evidence that kaur engaged in terrorist activity,her case was remanded for the attorney general to exercise his discretion as to her asylum claim.we granted kaur petitions for withholding of deportation and relief under cat.
on remand,the bia took into account evidence classified as secret that was presented to the ij in the original that the bia had set aside in its first decision.the bia held cheema to be a danger to the security of the united states and kaur to be unworthy of a discretionary grant of asylum.
both cheema and kaur petitioned for review.cheema also filed a petition of habeas corpus in the northern district of california,challenging his detention by the department of homeland security dhs in various county jails for the past eight years the petition was granted but,on the government motion,stayed.in february,cheema told the ij that it would be better to die in a real jail in front of his people than to continue his confinement in this country.at his request,deferral of removal was terminated and he was deported on april.
in india,cheema was promptly prosecuted before a designated court under the terrorist and disruptive activities act tada,the explosive substances act of,and the explosive substances act of for offenses committed in.he was acquitted of offenses under tada and the explosive substances act of,but was convicted in under the explosive substances act of.on appeal,the supreme court of india noted that a prosecution in a designated court a species of special tribunal set up under tada required the authorization of the inspector general of police or the commissioner of police.because the required authorization had not been given,the designated court had tried cheema without jurisdiction.cheema conviction was set aside in december.harpal singh state of punjab,india.no further proceedings affecting him in india are known to this court.
cheema.now that cheema has been determined to be a danger to the security of the united states and has been deported,the question is whether his claim for withholding of deportation is moot.we agree with the government that we can not give cheema any relief with respect to withholding because he has already been deported and he suffers no collateral consequence from the withholding decision.there is simply no live controversy.see abdala ins,cir holding that for a habeas petition to continue to present a live controversy after the petitioner release or deportation there must be some remaining collateral consequence that may be redressed by success on the petition.
cheema urges us that he falls under the collateral consequences exception to mootness.see spencer kemna,d holding that an exception to mootness arises where a petitioner would suffer collateral legal consequences from the challenged ruling.citing a third circuit case,chong ins,cheema argues that he suffers a collateral consequence of the bia denial of his application for withholding he can not return to the united states for ten years,a consequence sufficient to keep his case alive.see chong ins,cir.cheema reliance on chong,in which the only bar to reentry was the temporal bar,is flawed.cheema inadmissibility to the united states is not a collateral consequence of the bia denial of withholding of deportation rather,it is a collateral consequence of the board unchallenged determination under a b i i that cheema is an alien who engaged in terrorist activities.see abdala,at holding that a petitioner subject to the collateral consequence of a bar to reentry did not present a cognizable claim where the petitioner was also permanently barred from reentry on a wholly separate ground.with the board holding as to terrorist activities undisturbed,the alleged collateral consequence of inadmissibility does not arise from the withholding decision.cheema case is moot and should be dismissed.
kaur.following our remand in,the bia found that kaur had not been completely candid in her testimony and that she had engaged in conspiracy to commit immigration fraud.the bia found these two negative factors outweighed the positive factors favoring the exercise of discretion to grant asylum.we conclude that the bia abused its discretion on two fronts by using secret evidence without giving kaur sufficient notice about the parameters of that evidence to allow her to defend against it and by holding,in the absence of an adverse credibility finding,that kaur was not candid.
kaur petition comes to us in an unusual posture.when the ij issued her decision in,she granted relief to kaur on all of her,withholding of deportation,and withholding of removal under the cat.the government appeal to the bia focused primarily on the allegations regarding terrorist activity,although it mentioned immigration fraud in passing.specifically,the government brief to the bia claimed that since kaur admits attempting to smuggle her daughter,roopi,into the united states,and also admits paying a friend to get her nephew into the united states,she should be denied relief even though the ij found that the hardships she has already endured and her fear of future persecution outweigh these negative factors.
in its first decision,dated may,the bia relied solely on unclassified information and focused exclusively on kaur engagement in terrorist activity since entering the united states and the fact that she was a danger to the security of the united states.the bia made no reference to immigration fraud,and it accepted the ij determination that kaur was a credible witness.
on appeal to this court,we determined that kaur had not engaged in terrorist activity,granted her petitions for withholding of deportation and relief under cat,and remanded for the bia to exercise its discretion in determining whether to grant asylum to kaur.cheema,at.the issues of immigration fraud and candor were not before us in the first appeal.id.
after remand,the bia issued an unclassified decision and a classified attachment to that decision in the unclassified decision,the bia stated that as argued by the dhs,the unclassified summary of classified evidence relating to the female applicant states that reliable confidential sources have reported that kaur has conspired to engage in alien smuggling has attempted to obtain fraudulent documents and has engaged in immigration fraud by conspiring to supply false documents for others.this statement,coupled with a reference to lack of candor,was the only basis for denial of asylum,at least as articulated by the bia.
in this second appeal to our court,in addition to challenging the dhs weighing of hardship factors,kaur challenges the proceeding as unfair because of the use of secret evidence and argues that the bia abused its discretion in finding that she had not been completely candid.
