opinion of the court 
we are asked to decide if a state misdemeanor conviction for vehicular homicide is a crime of violence within the meaning of.robert francis was convicted of two counts of homicide by vehicle in pennsylvania.thereafter,the immigration and nationalization service charged francis with removability based upon its assertion that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina.a a iii.
the immigration judge ruled that homicide by vehicle as defined in pennsylvania is not an aggravated felony under the ina,and the ins appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia disagreed.the board ruled that homicide by vehicle is a crime of violence under,thus it is an aggravated felony under the ina,and thus francis is removable.the board therefore entered a final order of removal against francis.this petition for review followed.for the reasons that follow,we will grant francis petition and remand to the bia with instructions to vacate its order of removal.
background facts and procedure 
robert francis is,has lived in the united states for over years,and is married to a united states citizen.administrative record ar at.however,francis is a citizen of jamaica.he entered the united states in as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure.in,he adjusted his immigration status to conditional resident,a legal resident status.
in may of,francis caused a tragic traffic accident wherein two people were killed on interstate in philadelphia.he was thereafter convicted in state court of two counts of homicide by vehicle in violation of.which provided at the time of francis offenses that 
a ny person who unintentionally causes the death of another person while engaged in the violation of any law of this commonwealth or municipal ordinance applying to the operation or use of a vehicle or to the regulation of traffic except section relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance is guilty of homicide by vehicle,a misdemeanor of the first degree,when the violation is the cause of death.
francis was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of eighteen to sixty months in prison for the conviction.at the conclusion of that sentence,he was held on an ins detainer.the ins then initiated removal proceedings based upon its assertion that his state court conviction made him removable as an aggravated felon under the bia.as noted above,the immigration judge terminated the proceedings in francis favor,but the ins reversed and ordered his removal.that order of removal is now before us based upon francis petition for review.
ii.jurisdiction 
the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira divests this court of jurisdiction over a final order of removal against an alien convicted of certain delineated offenses.a c liang ins,cir.however,jurisdiction is only removed under the iirira if the petitioner is an alien who is deportable by reason of having been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses.drakes zimski,cir therefore,we must initially determine whether these two statutory prerequisites to the limitation of our jurisdiction are satisfied.id.
there is no dispute that francis is an alien.thus,the jurisdictional question that we must address is whether francis by vehicle in violation of.one of the enumerated offenses under the iirira.we hold that it is not.
iii.discussion 
a a iii states that any alien convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable.a f defines aggravated felony under the ina to include any crime of violence.the ina does not directly define crime of violence.instead,it incorporates the definitions set forth in the crimes code at.see a f crime of violence is defined therein as 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
the bia concluded that subsection a is not applicable to francis state conviction,but held that his offense fell within the confines of subsection b.we agree that francis state conviction does not fall under a.however,we disagree with the bia conclusion that it is included under b.
in order for a conviction to be a crime of violence under subsection b,the offense must first be a felony and second,it must be an offense that by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.
francis argues that vehicular homicide under pennsylvania law fails to meet either requirement.he argues that the offense is a misdemeanor under pennsylvania law and therefore can not qualify as a felony for purposes of the ina.he also argues that it is not an offense that by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.finally,francis argues that b requires specific intent and that homicide by vehicle involves a much lower level of culpability under pennsylvania law.
whether a misdemeanor can be a felony under b 
francis claims that inasmuch as he was convicted of a misdemeanor under pennsylvania law,he is not a felon much less an aggravated one.francis br.at.in united states graham,cir,we held that a crime can be regarded as an aggravated felony even if it is categorized as a misdemeanor.there,graham pled guilty to illegally reentering this country following deportation in violation of.at sentencing,an issue arose as to whether he should be classified as an aggravated felon under b b.a defendant who is classified as an aggravated felon faces a increase in offense level under the sentencing guidelines the district court sentenced graham as an aggravated felon based upon the court conclusion that his prior state misdemeanor conviction for petit larceny qualified as an aggravated felony even though the state where he committed the offense defined it as a misdemeanor.the aggravated felony classification changed graham guideline sentence range from months to months.at.
on appeal,we framed the issue as follows 
whether a misdemeanor can be an aggravated felony under a provision of federal law even if it is not,technically speaking a felony at all.the particular question is whether petit larceny,a class a misdemeanor under new york law that carries a maximum sentence of one year,can subject a federal defendant to the extreme sanctions imposed by the aggravated felon classification contained in a.
at.we answered in the affirmative.in resolving the issue,we focused on an amendment to a g,which lowered the imprisonment threshold from five years to one year.we explained that felonies had historically been defined as those crimes that are punishable by at least a year in prison.those offenses punishable by less time in prison had historically been defined as misdemeanors.however,we concluded that the term aggravated felony is a term of art which can include certain misdemeanants who receive a sentence of one year,id.at,even though the underlying crime has been labeled a misdemeanor under state law.
our analysis in graham does not,however,answer the question presented here.graham was an aggravated felon pursuant to a g.that subsection specifically defined theft crimes as aggravated felonies so long as the term of imprisonment is at least one year.id.at graham had clearly been convicted of a state theft offense,and that offense,though categorized by new york as a class a misdemeanor,had a maximum of a year imprisonment under new york law.id.at.that is all subsection g required.francis is charged with an aggravated felony under subsection f.as stated above,that provision of the ina requires a crime of violence under.we must therefore determine if b,which specifically refers only to felonies,includes offenses that have been categorized as misdemeanors by the state that has defined the underlying conduct as criminal.thus,although graham may be instructive,it does not control our determination of congress intent in adopting.
the bia concluded that it is irrelevant that pennsylvania labels the offense as a misdemeanor.the bia used the federal default definition of felony found in to conclude that,irrespective of the state classification,francis conviction was a felony under federal law.defines felony as an offense that is not otherwise classified where the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is less than five years but more than one year.the bia reasoned it is both fair and logical to rely on the federal statutory definition of felony when that term appears in a federal statute that is applicable in the respondent case.ar at.
the government argues that the bia analysis is entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.under chevron 
w hen a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
chevron,d emphasis added.however,in sandoval reno,cir citing ins,d,we noted that pure questions of statutory construction must be resolved by courts.there,we explained that chevron deference will only apply to an inquiry that implicates agency expertise in a meaningful way.id.more recently,in drakes zimski,at,we intimated that chevron deference might not apply in the context of defining forgery within the meaning of a r,because the bia did not utilize any specific expertise in interpreting that provision of the ina.federal courts regularly interpret such terms.id.at.
clearly,the bia did not rely upon any expertise in interpreting the meaning of felony within a general criminal statute.moreover,chevron instructs that we accord deference only to the bia construction of the statute which it administers.chevron,at.the bia is not charged with administering,and that statute is not transformed into an immigration law merely because it is incorporated into the ina by a f.we therefore conclude that the bia interpretation of is not entitled to deference under chevron 
congress did not use the term felony in a.rather,a is narrowly drawn to include only crimes whose elements require the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force.although b is specifically limited to felonies,it does not include all felonies.it is limited to those felonies that by their nature involve s a substantial risk that force may be used.clearly,congress intended to include felonies and misdemeanors under subsection a,but only intended certain felonies to be included under subsection b.the senate report for the comprehensive crime control act of makes this clear.
the term crime of violence is defined,for purposes of all of title in section of the bill the first section of part a of title x the term means an a felony or a has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or any felony that,by its nature,involves the substantial risk that physical force against person or property may be used in the course of its commission.
reprinted in emphasis added.congress was obviously aware that the definition of a felony varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,and it could certainly have defined an aggravated felony under the ina to include any state offense that would be classified as a felony under federal law.it did not do so.
francis crime is only arguably a felony because of the application of.however,was intended as a last resort that would be employed only if a n offense that is not specifically classified in the section defining it,provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of less than five years but more than one year.such crimes are,by default,categorized under federal law as class e felonies.a emphasis added.in united states donley,we explained that 
title assigns letter grades to offenses that previously had none on the basis of the maximum terms of imprisonment authorized by statutes describing the offenses.one letter grade comprises offenses that carry different statutory penalties in the underlying statutes describing them.for example,first and second degree murder are both classified as class a felonies under.
cir emphasis added.labeling a particular offense as a misdemeanor should end the matter for the purposes of b.after all,francis did not violate federal law,he violated state law.doe hartz,cir explaining in the context of the violence against women act,that a state misdemeanor is not a crime of violence within the meaning of b because we can not simply borrow the federal classification of a felony and apply it to conduct that could not constitute a crime under federal law.
at oral argument,the ins contended that the adoption of the federal definition for the term felony provides a federal objective standard in treating all resident aliens alike regardless of the states classification of the crime.the ins argued that another state could charge the very same conduct as a felony,and therefore,adopting a federal classification affords equal treatment to all petitioners regardless of the place of conviction.we reject this policy argument for several reasons.first,as we have already explained,a includes misdemeanors and felonies.under a,similar conduct is included in the definition of aggravated felony regardless of the state label.
moreover,the government argument for uniformity ignores that maximum penalties will also vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.see the unconstitutionality of nonuniform immigration consequences of aggravated felony convictions.therefore,relying upon the maximum penalty prescribed by a given state to determine if an offense is a felony using does not eliminate nonuniform treatment of offenders from state to state.the disparity merely shifts to the differing maximum sentences prescribed,rather than a state classification.
in addition,the ins equality argument fails to give effect to the language of a f.section a f defines aggravated felony as a crime of violence as defined in section of title for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f emphasis added.it would create a redundancy to define felony in b as an offense involving a substantial risk of force for which the maximum sentence is more than one year,see a,when a f already defines an aggravated felony to include crime s of violence as defined in section title for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year section a f has already captured those offenses.in this context,we think it is incongruous to read felony in b as being defined by the applicable term of imprisonment set by the underlying state offense.the board is already applying a federal objective standard to all resident aliens,one that has been expressly dictated by congress use of the words for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.since this phrase already includes or excludes aliens based on the length of the sentence,we see no reason why we should read the term felony in section b as contingent upon the term of imprisonment rather than a state categorization.
reading the statute without importing the default classifications in eliminates this redundancy.if a state has categorized an offense as a misdemeanor or a felony,subsection a will define the offense as an aggravated felony if the elements include the use,attempted use,or threatened use of force.a.certain offenses categorized as felonies under state law,having a maximum of at least one year,as required by a f,are also aggravated felonies.this captures those instances where a state may define felonies to include offenses that have a shorter maximum than one year imprisonment.however,where as here,the offense is categorized as a misdemeanor under state law,it is excluded unless it involves force and falls under subsection a.thus,by relying upon state law to provide the categorization,we eliminate the redundancy that would otherwise result from including both a maximum of one year imprisonment under a f and the condition precedent of felony in b that is expressly incorporated into a f 
this interpretation is also consistent with the rule of lenity as embodied in the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien.ins cyr,d quoting ins,d this is no small consideration given the changes in immigration law effectuated by the iirira.for all the reasons set forth above,we conclude that francis state court conviction was not an aggravated felony under the ina.
whether homicide by vehicle can otherwise fall under b 
moreover,even if we assume arguendo that francis misdemeanor conviction of vehicular homicide can somehow be converted into a felony for b purposes,we would still conclude that his conviction is not an aggravated felony.as noted above,b also requires that he be convicted of a crime that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.homicide by vehicle in pennsylvania is not such an offense.
a brief review of the procedural history places our discussion in its proper context.francis was convicted of two counts of homicide by vehicle following a trial,and he appealed to the superior court of pennsylvania.he argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction.the superior court rejected this argument.commonwealth francis.in doing so,the court held that francis was guilty of criminal negligence rather than recklessness.the court reasoned 
the commonwealth established beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant violated,which prohibits any backing up on a limited access highway such as.the commonwealth also proved beyond a reasonable doubt,through expert and eyewitness testimony,that appellant act of backing up his vehicle into traffic directly caused rutter to lose control of his vehicle,which precipitated the multiple vehicle accident in which the rutters were killed.finally,we find that appellant conduct was criminally negligent,as the backing up of a vehicle into oncoming traffic traveling miles per hour is a gross deviation from the standard of care observed by a reasonable person.see heck,at,at criminal negligence requires gross deviation from standard of care reasonable person would observe in the interest of hyduke,criminal negligence established where appellant drove miles per hour,lost control of his vehicle,and crossed the center line cheatham.at,at epileptic was criminally negligent for driving while knowing he was subject to seizures.accordingly,we find that appellant sufficiency claim has no merit.
under taylor united states,d,we use the categorical approach to determine if francis conviction for vehicular homicide comes within the meaning of the second part of b.drakes zimski,cir citing taylor united states,d and in re alcantar.therefore,we must look to pennsylvania definition of homicide by vehicle.as noted previously.provides 
any person who unintentionally causes the death of another person while engaged in the violation of any law of this commonwealth or municipal ordinance applying to the operation or use of a vehicle or to the regulation of traffic except section relating to driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance is guilty of homicide by vehicle,a misdemeanor of the first degree,when the violation is the cause of death.
on its face,homicide by vehicle is certainly not an offense that by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.the bia acknowledged that involves a range of behavior that may or may not fall under b.
the categorical approach does permit the sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of the relevant generic offense.taylor,at.here,the criminal complaint stated 
southbound on route in the vicinity of comly street the defendant unintentionally caused the death of the decedent harry rutter,driver of vehicle,by operating a chevrolet caprice.license adb,while his operating privilege was suspended,and in such a manner as to cause a eight vehicle accident between four cars,one van,and three tractor trailers and a near miss by a tanker truck carrying gallons of gasoline,causing the deaths of two people and injuring a third.
ar at emphasis added.
francis was therefore charged with the unintentional conduct,of operating an automobile in such a manner as to cause a car accident resulting in two deaths.the phrase while his operating privilege was suspended is the attendant circumstance that furnishes the violation of law that is the condition precedent to criminal culpability.the bia,however,reviewed the criminal complaint and found that driving with a suspended license,could in and of itself,present a substantial risk that physical force would be used against the person or property of another.id.at.relying on united states,cir and matter of magallanes,interim decision at bia,the bia reasoned that a motor vehicle in the wrong hands has enormous potential to cause damage to the vehicle and other property,as well as personal injuries and death to innocent people.ar at.further,the bia reasoned that the precise risk created by francis conduct was actually realized in the present case with devastating consequences.ar at.however,nothing on this record establishes that driving with a suspended license,in and of itself,involves a substantial risk of physical force.
there are undoubtedly many reasons why a state would suspend a person driving privileges,some of which may have no relation to a person fitness to drive or the likelihood that he or she will use physical force.see commonwealth of transportation empfield,setting forth numerous infractions of the pennsylvania vehicle code that justify suspension of a driver license including the ministerial act of failing to renew a valid license.moreover,we find both and matter of magallanes distinguishable.
involved the state offense of unauthorized use of an automobile a crime that is similar to car theft with all of the attendant dangers of high speed chases,speeding,and recklessness endemic in car theft.clearly,one who steals a car will be far more likely to operate it recklessly than the car owner.matter of magallanes involved the state offense of aggravated driving under the influence.the dangers of operating an automobile while one faculties are impaired by drugs or alcohol are all too obvious,and too common to require further elaboration.significantly,homicide by vehicle is specifically defined to exclude the traffic violation of driving under the influence under.homicide by vehicle,as the superior court noted in affirming francis conviction,arises from criminally negligent behavior.
in commonwealth heck,at,the pennsylvania supreme court held that ordinary negligence is not sufficient to sustain a conviction of homicide by vehicle under.the court found that the government must establish recklessness or criminal negligence.id.in pennsylvania,criminal negligence is defined as follows 
a person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.the risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor failure to perceive it,considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him,involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor situation.
