fatjon sterkaj and his wife amemona seek review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirming the immigration judge ij decision to deny their application for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act ina.sterkaj challenges the ij and findings and asserts that the bia denied him due process by relying on an inaccurate transcript to review his case and by affirming the ij decision without opinion.concluding that substantial evidence supports the ij findings and discerning no due process violation,we deny the petition for review.
background 
fatjon sterkaj and his wife amemona,albanian citizens,fled albania in september and entered the united states without valid entry documents.the immigration and nationalization service ins sought their removal on two grounds they attempted to procure admission by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact under a c i and they did not have valid entry documents as required by a a i i.the sterkajs admitted that they entered the united states without valid entry documents,but denied that they sought to procure admission by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.they applied for asylum and withholding of removal on the grounds that sterkaj suffered past political persecution in albania and had a fear of future persecution should he return.at the removal hearing,sterkaj described the following events to support his claim.
sterkaj attended the democratic party dp rallies in albania but was not a member.during a february rally,special forces police interrupted the rally,hitting and arresting dp supporters,including sterkaj.the police detained him at the police station for three days,beating him repeatedly and denying him food and water.after the three days,they released sterkaj,and he sought medical treatment at a hospital.
a month later police went to his parents house late at night looking for him,but sterkaj was at his wife house.the police broke down the door to his parents home and hit his father head with a gun butt.upon learning what happened to his father,sterkaj fled to his uncle house.
as sterkaj drove to his uncle house,police pursued him and shot at his car,injuring him and forcing him off the road.he then ran from his car to a nearby forest where he hid from police and eventually arrived at his uncle house.soon thereafter,sterkaj and his wife fled to the united states.
the ij conducted a hearing on the merits of sterkaj application.sterkaj testified about two documents he submitted to support his summons from the shkodra,albania district attorney office summons and a document declaring that albanian authorities wanted sterkaj wanted document.sterkaj initially testified that his troubles with the albanian authorities began on february.but on,the government pointed out to sterkaj that the wanted document was dated february,and proclaimed that albanian authorities had pursued sterkaj since september.in light of this discrepancy,the government questioned both documents authenticity,and the ij agreed to adjourn the hearing so that the government could verify the documents.
three years later,the ij reconvened the hearing and reported that an investigation by ceci of the embassy in tirana,albania revealed that the summons was invalid.the government apparently did not submit the wanted document for verification.the ij concluded that sterkaj failed to establish a credible claim for relief,citing the embassy report,sterkaj discrepant testimony regarding the wanted document,his claim general implausibility,and his claim inconsistency with state department reports on conditions in albania.the ij also concluded that sterkaj application was frivolous.
this petition for review followed the decision by a single member of the bia summarily affirming the ij decision.thus we review the ij decision as the final agency decision.denko ins,cir.
ii.discussion 
adverse credibility determination 
sterkaj challenges the ij finding that his testimony of past persecution lacked credibility.we apply the usual substantial evidence standard to the ij credibility determination,ensuring that specific reasons going to the heart of the applicant claim support an adverse credibility finding.sylla ins,cir.applying this standard to the sterkajs case,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ij adverse credibility determination.
first,the ij found it implausible that the police detained sterkaj,attacked his father,and destroyed his home when he was a mere dp supporter.second,the ij noted that sterkaj testimony conflicted with state department profiles of asylum claims and country conditions for albania,which indicated that there is no post communist tradition of retribution against opposition party members,and that i individuals are rarely targeted on political grounds.third,the ij found the summons and wanted document submitted by sterkaj unreliable.we discuss sterkaj arguments as to each of these three findings.
implausibility of sterkaj claim 
first,the ij found it implausible that albanian law enforcement authorities would detain and beat sterkaj for merely supporting as opposed to being a member of the dp.although the reports do not contradict sterkaj claim of political persecution,they expressly state that there has been little to no political persecution in albania since the collapse of the communist regime in and note that even during the dark days of all parties were able to participate in politics without mistreatment.sulollari gonzales,at,wl,at cir.viewing sterkaj claim in light of these reports,we find the ij skepticism about the arrest and beatings reasonable the record evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion.
state department reports 
sterkaj also challenges the ij finding that his claim of political persecution conflicts with albania country conditions as described in the and state department profiles of asylum claims and country conditions for albania.he first contends that the ij erred in relying on the report,because he testified to,and based his claim on,events that occurred in.assuming the ij erred in relying on the report,the country report on human rights practices for albania,upon which the ij also relied,nonetheless provides substantial evidence to support the ij finding.
that report relayed that although opposition political leaders frequently charged that the government arbitrarily arrested and detained its supporters on political grounds,t here is little solid evidence to back up these claims,and most international observers believe they are baseless.it adds that despite a november incident when police arrested three dp supporters,t here were no clear cases of detainees being held for strictly political reasons.state department reports,which are generally the best source of information on conditions in foreign nations,mullai ashcroft,cir quotation omitted,provide context about albania so that the fact finder may assess sterkaj credibility.see duarte de guinac ins,cir.though,as sterkaj points out,the reports do not rule out the existence of political persecution in albania,we do not quarrel with the ij assessment that they are inconsistent with,and thus undermine,sterkaj claim.no evidence compels us to reach a factual conclusion contrary to that reached by the ij.
fraudulent documents 
sterkaj next protests the ij finding that his submission of the summons and wanted document impaired his credibility.an applicant presentation of a fraudulent document to prove a central element of the claim in an asylum adjudication in the absence of an explanation regarding such presentation creates serious doubts regarding the applicant overall credibility.selami gonzales,cir quoting in re,bia.s uch fraud tarnishes the applicant veracity and diminishes the reliability of his other evidence.id.
sterkaj first urges the court to disregard as unreliable the investigation that reported the summons to be fraudulent because ceci,the embassy investigator in albania was reporting what was told to him by an employee of the shkoder district attorney office did not sign the telegram forwarding his findings to the ins and graduated fr
