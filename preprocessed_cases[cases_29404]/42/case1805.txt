arturo appeals from a district court dismissal of his suit seeking a declaratory judgment that he is a citizen of the united states.we affirm.
rios was born in in mexico.he claims that his mother was unmarried to his father,and an american citizen at the time,hence she needed only to have been present in the united states for one continuous year for him to be a citizen the government contends that rios parents were married mexican citizens when he was born.
in,the ins granted an application for a green card for rios filed by his mother,and he moved to the united states.in,the government deported rios to mexico because of his conviction for a drug crime.
in october,rios reentered the united states by claiming to be an american citizen.on january,the government issued a notice to appear,placing rios in removal proceedings.the next day,the government charged him with criminal illegal reentry.rios claims that it was only during this period that he realized his claim to citizenship consequently,on may,while the removal proceeding was pending,rios filed a form,application for citizenship,with united states citizenship and immigration services uscis.on august,the district director of uscis in el paso denied the application.rios appealed to the administrative appeals unit aau.on september,the government dropped the criminal charges.
on january,while the appeal from the first denial of the was pending,rios filed another with the same district director.the immigration judge presiding over the removal proceedings held a hearing on march.rios defended against removal in the proceedings by submitting evidence of his citizenship.the immigration judge terminated the removal proceedings without prejudice.
on april,the aau rejected rios appeal.on august,a service officer at the uscis el paso district processing the second application interviewed rios and explained the need for evidence of his mother presence in the united states,giving him twelve weeks to provide such evidence.
on october,rios filed the instant case in district court,seeking a declaratory judgment that he is a citizen,having exhausted his administration remedies by filing the first and appealing its denial.rios claimed he was in legal limbo because he was allowed to remain in the country but refused proof of citizenship.later,on november,the district director denied rios second application as abandoned because rios had produced no evidence to the uscis.
in district court,the government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.the court granted the motion,and rios appealed.
subsequent to oral argument,the government issued a new notice to appear,removal proceedings against rios.according to rios,he has asserted his citizenship as a defense to removal and filed a motion to terminate or,in the alternative,a motion to administratively close removal proceedings.a final merits hearing has not yet been held.
as we are reviewing a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,our review is de novo 
a person generally may pursue a citizenship claim in two ways.first,if the person is in removal proceedings he can claim citizenship as a defense.if the immigration judge rejects the defense and orders removal,the person can,after properly exhausting administrative channels,petition this court under b for review of the final order of removal,including for review of the citizenship claim.however,if the immigration judge accepts the citizenship defense,she terminates the removal proceedings without deciding citizenship 
second,a person can affirmatively seek proof of citizenship by filing with uscis a form,application for citizenship,under a.if the application is denied,he can appeal to the aau under,a.if the aau affirms the person can seek a judicial declaration of citizenship under a,which provides 
if any person who is within the united states claims a right or privilege as a national of the united states and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency,or official thereof,upon the ground that he is not a national of the united states,such person may institute an action under the provisions of section of title against the head of such department or independent agency for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the united states,except that no such action may be instituted in any case if the issue of such person status as a national of the united states arose by reason of,or in connection with any removal proceeding under the provisions of this chapter or any other act,or is in issue in any such removal proceeding.
when rios initially appealed,the issue before the court was whether a deprived the district court of jurisdiction.however,the government has initiated another round of removal proceedings,raising the issue of whether a bars jurisdiction over rios claim.the government argues in a letter brief filed at this court request that,if rios raises his citizenship as a defense in the new removal proceedings,then the provisions of a clearly deprives the district court of jurisdiction over plaintiff claims.in his letter brief,rios indicates that he has raised citizenship as a defense.
section a provides that no declaratory judgment action may be instituted in any case if the issue of such person status as a national of the united states is in issue in any such removal proceeding.rios contends that the exception does not deprive the courts of jurisdiction because there were no removal proceedings pending when he filed his declaratory judgment action.we agree.the statute states that a a claim may not be instituted when the claimant citizenship is in issue in a removal proceeding.the exception does not say that a purported citizen may not maintain or continue an already filed declaratory judgment action when the government subsequently begins removal proceedings and citizenship there comes into issue.rather,we read institute in this context to mean t o initiate begin.the purported citizen citizenship can not,logically,be in issue in a removal proceeding unless there is a removal proceeding pending.in other words,a purported citizen may not initiate or begin a declaratory judgment action to establish his citizenship if it is already being litigated in a removal proceeding.this reading of the exception does not run afoul of the concern that persons will use a to circumvent the administrative removal process if there are no removal proceedings pending when a declaratory judgment action is brought,there is nothing for the claimant to circumvent.
we turn our attention to a.the district court noted that rios did not file his application before the commencement of removal,a situation where this court would have jurisdiction.it noted further,a s a challenge to his removal,during those removal proceedings rios claimed that he was a united states citizen.thus,the court concluded,
it is beyond dispute that questions as to rios citizenship arose after the initiation of removal proceeding and rios can not obviate congressional intent limiting the manner in which claims of nationality may be raised following the initiation of removal proceedings pursuant to b by also pursuing an alternative claim of citizenship,where his claim to citizenship also arose by reason of or in connection with his removal proceedings.
consequently,the court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the issue of rios citizenship arose by reason of,or in connection with his removal proceeding.
rios argues that the district court interpretation of a as barring jurisdiction over any claim based on the denial of citizenship simply because the claim was made after the initiation of removal proceedings expands the statute beyond its plain meaning.the government agrees that timing of the application alone does not control.what matters,the government argues,is that the issue of citizenship arose in connection with rios removal proceeding.
the text of the statute supports the government t he exception applies to claims of nationality raised in removal proceedings.it is the context of how the particular issue of citizenship arose rather than the mere timing of events that determines the applicability of a.the exc
