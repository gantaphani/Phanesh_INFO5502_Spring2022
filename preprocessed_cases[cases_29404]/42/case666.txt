luis ramon morales santana asks us to review a march,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings relating to his claim of derivative citizenship.under the statute in effect when morales santana was born the immigration and nationality act of the act a child born abroad to an unwed citizen mother and father has citizenship at birth so long as the mother was present in the united states or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of at least one year at some point prior to the child birth.see act,c,stat,codified at c by contrast,a child born abroad to an unwed citizen father and mother has citizenship at birth only if the father was present in the united states or one of its outlying possessions prior to the child birth for a period or periods totaling at least ten years,with at least five of those years occurring after the age of fourteen.see id.a codified at a see also id.a codified at a morales santana father satisfied the requirements for transmitting citizenship applicable to unwed mothers but not the more stringent requirements applicable to unwed fathers.on appeal,morales santana argues principally that this difference violates the fifth amendment guarantee of equal protection and that the proper remedy is to extend to unwed fathers the benefits unwed mothers receive under c.we agree and hold that morales santana derived citizenship at birth through his father.we accordingly reverse the bia decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the following undisputed facts are drawn from the record on appeal.morales santana father,jose dolores morales,was born in puerto rico on march,and acquired united states citizenship in pursuant to the jones act.see jones act of puerto rico,ch,stat.codified at.he was physically present in puerto rico until february,days before his nineteenth birthday,when he left puerto rico to work in the dominican republic for the south porto rico sugar company.
in morales santana was born in the dominican republic to his father and his dominican mother.morales santana was what is statutorily described as legitimat ed by his father upon his parents marriage in and admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.a.morales santana father died in.
ii.statutory framework 
unlike citizenship by naturalization,derivative citizenship exists as of a child birth or not at all.see a,c id.a.the law in effect at the time of birth governs whether a child obtained derivative citizenship as of his or her birth.see ashton gonzales,cir.accordingly,the act provides the statutory framework applicable to morales santana nationality claim.
as noted,the act limits the ability of an unwed citizen father to confer citizenship on his child born abroad where the child mother is not a citizen at the time of the child birth more stringently than it limits the ability of a similarly situated unwed citizen mother to do the same.compare a,with id.c we note that this difference in treatment of unwed citizen fathers and unwed citizen mothers,though diminished,persists in the current statute.compare a applying to unwed citizen fathers g,which requires five years of physical presence,two of which must be after age fourteen,with id.c maintaining the act conferral of derivative citizenship based on an unwed mother continuous physical presence for one year at any time prior to the child birth.
iii.procedural history 
in morales santana was placed in removal proceedings after having been convicted of various felonies.he applied for withholding of removal on the basis of derivative citizenship obtained through his father.an immigration judge denied the application.in morales santana filed a motion to reopen based on a violation of equal protection and newly obtained evidence relating to his father.the bia rejected morales santana arguments for derivative citizenship and denied his motion to reopen.
discussion 
morales santana makes four arguments for derivative citizenship that his father physical absence from the united states during the days directly prior to his father nineteenth birthday constituted a de minimis gap in physical presence,and that such gaps should not count against a finding of physical presence for purposes of a that the south porto rico sugar company,which employed his father after his father moved to the dominican republic,was a united company and therefore effectively part of the united states government or an international organization as defined in,see act to amend the immigration and nationality act the act,stat.codified at a counting periods of employment for certain organizations toward the statute physical presence requirements that at the time his father moved to the dominican republic it was an outlying possession of the united states and as noted,that the different physical presence requirements applicable to unwed fathers and unwed mothers under the act violate equal protection.
consistent with our obligation to avoid constitutional questions if possible,we first address morales santana three statutory arguments for derivative citizenship.see escambia,mcmillan,per curiam.
as to both his statutory and constitutional arguments,we review de novo the question of morales santana derivative citizenship.see phong thanh nguyen chertoff,cir.if the petitioner claims to be a national of the united states and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented,the court shall decide the nationality claim.b a.no material facts are disputed.
statutory arguments 
morales santana contends that his father absence from the united states during the days prior to his father nineteenth birthday constitutes a de minimis gap in his father physical presence and that such gaps should not be held against someone who claims to have satisfied the act physical presence requirement.in support,morales santana points to continuous physical presence requirements under the immigration laws that explicitly excuse de minimis absences.see,id.b a,d absences of continuous days or fewer do not break continuity of physical presence for purposes of cancellation of removal for a lawful permanent resident.id.l,a b.by its plain terms,a had no similar exception.in any event,because morales santana father left the united states and its outlying possessions days prior to his nineteenth birthday and never returned,there was no gap in his father physical presence that bridged two periods of physical presence.so even if we recognized an exception to the physical presence requirement in for de minimis gaps,we would reject morales santana claim on this basis.
relying on the act,morales santana next argues that his father employment with the south porto rico sugar company in the dominican republic immediately after leaving puerto rico satisfied the statute physical presence requirement by effectively continuing his physical presence through the requisite period.it is true that the act provided that employment with the united states government or with an international organization,as defined in,satisfied the physical presence requirement.see a.but morales santana argument lacks merit because his father employment with the south porto rico sugar company,a multinational company,did not constitute employment with the united states government.see drozd ins,cir.nor did it constitute employment with an international organization as defined in,since the south porto rico sugar company was neither a public international organization in which the united states participates pursuant to any treaty or under the authority of any act of congress authorizing such participation or making an appropriation for such participation,nor designated by the president as such.
as his final statutory argument,morales santana contends that the dominican republic was an outlying possession of the united states for purposes of the act when morales santana father was there in.two factors convince us that congress did not intend to include the dominican republic within the scope of the term outlying possession in 
first,there is no treaty or lease pursuant to which the dominican republic was acquired.this stands in contrast to the philippines,guam,puerto rico,and the virgin islands,all of which were acquired by the united states by treaty,see treaty of peace between the united states and the kingdom of spain,stat.convention between the united states and denmark,stat,and all of which were outlying possessions when the united states exercised sovereignty over them,see matter of v,matter of y.the case of guantanamo bay,cuba is a little different in that it involves both a lease and a treaty,but it yields the same result the dominican republic.in boumediene bush,the supreme court determined that the complete jurisdiction and control by the united states over guantanamo bay constituted de facto sovereignty over it.id.at quotation marks omitted.the court added,though,that in a lease agreement between cuba and the united states,the former granted the latter complete jurisdiction and control over guantanamo bay and that u nder the terms of a t reaty,cuba effectively has no rights as a sovereign until the parties agree to modification of the lease agreement or the united states abandons guantanamo bay.id.at.by contrast,there is no lease or treaty that conferred to the united states de facto or de jure sovereignty over the dominican republic.
second,we acknowledge the historical fact that the united states exercised significant control during its military occupation of the dominican republic from to.see ingenio porvenir por united states.cl.but that control did not extinguish the sovereignty of the dominican republic.indeed,the proclamation of the military occupation of santo domingo by the united states specifically declared that the purpose of the temporary military occupation was to give aid to the dominican republic in returning to a condition of internal order without destroying the sovereignty of the dominican republic.supp.am.int l,proclamation see also bruce calder,the impact of intervention the dominican republic during the occupation of xxvii,ed.
having rejected morales santana statutory arguments for derivative citizenship,we now consider his constitutional equal protection argument.
ii.equal protection 
morales santana argues principally that the act treatment of derivative citizenship conferral rights violates the fifth amendment guarantee of equal protection as we have explained,under the act,an unwed citizen mother confers her citizenship on her child born abroad to a biological father so long as she has satisfied the continuous presence requirement prior to the child birth.the single year of presence by the mother can occur at any time prior to the child birth including,for example,from the mother first birthday until her second birthday.an unwed citizen father,by contrast,faces much more stringent requirements under a,which incorporates a.he is prevented from transmitting his citizenship to his child born abroad to a mother unless he was physically present in the united states or an outlying possession prior to the child birth for a total of at least ten years because five of those years must follow the father fourteenth birthday,an unwed citizen father can not transmit his citizenship to his child born abroad to a mother before the father nineteenth birthday.citizen fathers and their children are out of luck.
as both parties agree,had morales santana mother,rather than his father,been a citizen continuously present in puerto rico until days prior to her nineteenth birthday,she would have satisfied the requirements to confer derivative citizenship on her child.it is this difference in treatment that morales santana claims violated his father right to equal protection.
the government asserts that the difference is justified by two interests ensuring a sufficient connection between citizen children and the united states,and avoiding statelessness.in what follows,we apply intermediate scrutiny to assess these asserted interests,and we conclude that neither interest is advanced by the statute physical presence requirements.after determining that these physical presence requirements violate equal protection,we apply the statute severance clause and determine that morales santana,under the statute stripped of its constitutional defect,has citizenship as of his birth.
level of scrutiny 
we apply intermediate,heightened scrutiny to laws that discriminate on the basis of gender.united states virginia.under intermediate scrutiny,the government classification must serve actual and important governmental objectives,and the discriminatory means employed must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.nguyen ins,virginia,at.furthermore,the justification for the challenged classification must be genuine,not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.and it must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents,capacities,or preferences of males and females.virginia,at.
in urging us to apply rational basis scrutiny instead,the government relies on fiallo bell.in fiallo,the supreme court applied rational basis scrutiny to a section of the act that gave special preference for admission into the united states to born out of wedlock seeking entry by virtue of a relationship with their citizen mothers,but not to similarly situated seeking entry by virtue of a relationship with their citizen fathers.see id.at.the court reasoned that rational basis scrutiny was warranted because over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens,and o ur cases have long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the government political departments.id.at emphases added quotation marks omitted see also kleindienst mandel,congress has plenary power to make rules for the admission and exclusion of.quotation marks omitted.
but fiallo is distinguishable.in fiallo,the children alienage implicated congress exceptionally broad power to admit or remove.fiallo,at.here,by contrast,there is no similar issue of alienage that would trigger special deference.because morales santana instead claims citizenship at birth,his challenge does not implicate congress power to admit or exclude foreigners,id.at,and therefore is not governed by fiallo.
our view of fiallo limited scope is grounded in supreme court and circuit caselaw.as an initial matter,we note that the supreme court has never applied the deferential fiallo standard to issues of gender discrimination under,despite being asked to do so on at least three occasions.see miller albright,declining to apply fiallo nguyen ins,applying heightened scrutiny united states.flores villar.per curiam affirming without opinion by divided vote.justice stevens opinion in miller succinctly described fiallo limitation it is of significance that the petitioner in this case,unlike the petitioners in fiallo,is not challenging the denial of an application for special immigration status.she is contesting the government refusal to treat her as a citizen.if she were to prevail,the judgment would confirm her citizenship.miller,at opinion of stevens,see also id.at fiallo involved the claims of aliens to a special immigration preference,whereas here petitioner claims that she is,and for years has been,an american citizen.
although no opinion in miller received a majority of votes,we observed in lake reno that seven justices in miller would have applied heightened scrutiny to ina section a,cir,vacated sub nom.ashcroft lake,citing nguyen,abrogated on other grounds by lake ashcroft,app x,cir.later,in lewis thompson,we explained lake holding in a way that makes it clear that heightened scrutiny,rather than fiallo more deferential standard of review,should apply to morales santana claim w e have already held in lake,drawing an inference from the various opinions of the justices in miller,that citizen claimants with an equal protection claim deserving of heightened scrutiny do not lose that favorable form of review simply because the case arises in the context of immigration,cir see also id.at as we recognized in lake,fiallo itself made clear that the reduced threshold of justification for governmental action that applied to immigrants did not apply to citizens.emphasis added quotation marks omitted.our sister circuits that have considered fiallo application to claims similar to morales santana are in accord.see nguyen ins,cir noting that the statute in fiallo dealt with the claims of aliens for special immigration preferences for aliens,whereas the petitioner claim in this case is that he is a citizen,aff,breyer meissner,cir applying heightened scrutiny to of the revised statutes of,a predecessor to,because it created a gender classification with respect to petitioner mother ability to pass her citizenship to her child at his birth united states ahumada aguilar,cir applying miller to f i nd a unconstitutional by applying heightened scrutiny,vacated,citing nguyen,abrogated on other grounds by cir united states flores villar,cir like the supreme court in nguyen,we will assume that intermediate scrutiny applies,aff by an equally divided court.
for these reasons,we conclude that the scheme in and can be upheld only if the government shows that it is substantially related to an actual and important governmental objective.see virginia,at.for women hogan.in assessing the validity of the classification,moreover,classification.see,wengler druggists mut.ins,orr orr,weinberger wiesenfeld.
governmental interests and tailoring 
having determined that intermediate scrutiny applies,we examine the two interests that the government claims support the statute distinction.
ensuring a sufficient connection between the child and the united states 
the government asserts that congress passed the act physical presence requirements in order to ensur e that children of parents of different nationalities have a sufficient connection to the united states to warrant citizenship.respondent br.as both parties agree,this interest is important,and congress actually had it in mind when requiring some period of physical presence before a citizen parent could confer citizenship on his or her child born abroad.see petitioner br.citing weedin chin bow.
the government invokes this important interest but fails to justify the act different treatment of mothers and fathers by reference to it.it offers no reason,and we see no reason,that unwed fathers need more time than unwed mothers in the united states prior to their child birth in order to assimilate the values that the statute seeks to ensure are passed on to citizen children born abroad.
we recognize that our determination conflicts with the decision of the ninth circuit in flores villar,which addressed the same statutory provisions and discussed the same governmental interest in ensuring a connection between child and country.the ninth circuit concluded that in addition to preventing or reducing statelessness an objective we address below t he residence differential furthers the objective of developing a tie between the child,his or her father,and this country.flores villar,at.the ninth circuit provided no explanation for its conclusion,and the government provides none here.
instead,the government relies on nguyen to explain why the different physical presence requirements for unwed men and women reflect a concern with ensuring an adequate connection between the child and the united states.we are not persuaded.in nguyen,the court upheld the immigration and nationality act requirement that a citizen father seeking to confer derivative citizenship on his child take the affirmative step of either legitimating the child,declaring paternity under oath,or obtaining a court order of paternity see nguyen,at u.a.the nguyen court determined that two interests supported the legitimation requirement for citizen fathers of children born abroad.
the first interest,assuring that a biological relationship exists,nguyen,at see miller,at,is irrelevant to the act physical presence requirements because derivative citizenship separately requires unwed citizen fathers to have legitimated their children.here,morales santana father established his biological tie to morales santana by legitimating him.his physical presence in puerto rico for ten years as opposed to one year prior to morales santana birth would have provided no additional assurance that a biological tie existed.
the nguyen court identified a second interest in ensuring that the child and the citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop a real,meaningful relationship.nguyen,at.the court explained that a biological mother,by virtue of giving birth to the child,knows that the child is in being and is hers,but that an unwed biological father might in some cases not even know that a child was conceived,nor is it always clear that even the mother will be sure of the father identity.id.at.rather than requiring a analysis of whether a father or a mother has a real,meaningful relationship with a child born abroad,congress enacted an easily administered scheme to promote the different but still substantial interest of ensuring at least an opportunity for a relationship to develop.id.at.this interest in ensuring the opportunity for a real,meaningful relationship between parent and child is likewise not relevant to the act physical presence requirements.by legitimating his son,morales santana father took the affirmative step of demonstrating that an opportunity for a meaningful relationship existed.and again,requiring that morales santana father be physically present in puerto rico prior to morales santana birth for ten years instead of one year would have done nothing to further ensure that an opportunity for such a relationship existed.
so we agree that unwed mothers and fathers are not similarly situated with respect to the two types of ties justifying the legitimation requirement at issue in nguyen.but unwed mothers and fathers are similarly situated with respect to how long they should be present in the united states or an outlying possession prior to the child birth in order to have assimilated values to transmit to the child.therefore,the statute distinction is not substantially related to the goal of ensuring a sufficient connection between citizen children and the united states.
preventing statelessness 
having concluded that the government interest in establishing a connection between the child and the united states does not explain or justify the distinction in the act physical presence requirements,we now turn to the government other asserted interest.the government argues that congress enacted different physical presence requirements in a incorporating a and c to reduce the level of statelessness among newborns.for example,a child born out of wedlock abroad may be stateless if he is born inside a country that does not confer citizenship based on place of birth and neither of the child parents conferred derivative citizenship on him.
the avoidance of statelessness is clearly an important governmental interest.see kennedy mendoza martinez,trop dulles,plurality opinion.contrary to the government claim,though,avoidance of statelessness does not appear to have been congress actual purpose in establishing the physical presence requirements in the act,see virginia,at,and in any event the distinctions in the act physical presence requirements are not substantially related to that objective.
actual purpose 
some historical background is useful to understand congress purpose in establishing the act physical presence requirements.until,a citizen father whose child was born abroad transmitted his citizenship to that child if the father had resided in the united states for any period of time prior to the child birth.see rogers bellei,discussing the act of march,stat,and successive statutes act of may,ch,stat.nationality act of the act,ch,g,stat.consistent with common law notions of coverture,and with the notion that the husband determined the political and cultural character of his dependents wife and children included,prior to married women had no statutory right to confer their own citizenship see brief of amici curiae of professors of history,political science,and law in support of petitioner at,flores villar united states,wl candice lewis bredbenner,a nationality of her own women,marriage,and the law of citizenship.but for unmarried citizen mothers,the state department practice since at least was to grant citizenship to their children on the theory that an unmarried mother stands in the place of the father and is in any event bound to maintain the child as its natural guardian.to revise and codify the nationality laws of the united states into a comprehensive nationality code hearing before the comm.on immigration and naturalization,cong.quotation marks omitted.
in congress for the first time explicitly addressed the situation of children born out of wedlock.it enacted section of the act,stat.at,which provided that citizen fathers and married citizen mothers could transmit citizenship to their child born abroad only after satisfying an physical presence requirement,but that unmarried citizen mothers could confer citizenship if they had resided in the united states at any point prior to the child birth.the act retained this basic statutory structure,though it imposed a somewhat more stringent requirement that unmarried mothers have been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of one year in order to confer citizenship.c.
neither the congressional hearings nor the relevant congressional reports concerning the act contain any reference to the problem of statelessness for children born abroad the congressional hearings concerning the act are similarly silent about statelessness as a driving concern notwithstanding the absence of relevant discussion concerning the problem of statelessness for children born abroad in the legislative history,the government points to the executive branch explanatory comments to section of the proposed nationality code that congress would ultimately enact as the act.see cong.these comments refer to a law review article entitled a comparative study of laws relating to nationality at birth and to loss of nationality,am.int l,by durward sandifer according to the article,in approximately thirty countries had statutes assigning children born out of wedlock the citizenship of their mother.id.at.from the comments and the article,the government urges us to infer that congress was aware there existed a substantial risk that a child born to an unwed citizen mother in a country employing laws determining citizenship based on lineage,rather than place of birth would be stateless at birth unless the mother could pass her citizenship to her child,and that this risk was unique to the children of unwed citizen mothers.respondent may,supp.br,
based on our review of the executive branch explanatory comments and the sandifer article,we decline the government invitation.the explanatory comments do not mention statelessness and do not refer to the sandifer article discussion of statelessness.in any event,the sandifer article itself does not support the government argument that the children of unwed citizen mothers faced a greater risk of statelessness than the children of unwed citizen fathers.
while the executive branch comments ignore the problem of statelessness,they arguably reflect generalizations concerning who would care for and be associated with a child born out of wedlock other contemporary administrative memoranda similarly ignore the risk of statelessness for children born out of wedlock abroad to citizen mothers 
in sum,we discern no evidence that congress enacted the act physical presence requirements out of a concern for statelessness,that the problem of statelessness was in fact greater for children of unwed citizen mothers than for children of unwed citizen fathers,or that congress believed that the problem of statelessness was greater for children of unwed citizen mothers than for children of unwed citizen fathers.we conclude that neither reason nor history supports the government contention that the act physical presence requirements were motivated by a concern for statelessness,as opposed to impermissible stereotyping.
substantial relationship between ends and means 
even assuming for the sake of argument that preventing statelessness was congress actual motivating concern when it enacted the physical presence requirements,we are persuaded by the availability of effective alternatives that the distinction between a incorporating a and c can not survive intermediate scrutiny.see wengler,at invalidating a classification where a approach would serve the needs of both classes orr,at a classification which,as compared to a one,generates additional benefits only for those it has no reason to prefer can not survive equal protection scrutiny.as far back as,secretary of state cordell hull proposed just such a alternative in a letter to the chairman of the house committee on immigration and naturalization.secretary hull suggested that the immigration laws be revised to obtain the objective of parity between the sexes in nationality matters by remov ing discrimination between mothers and fathers with regard to the transmission of citizenship to children born abroad.hull proposed the following language 
proposed amendment 
d a child hereafter born out of wedlock beyond the limits and jurisdiction of the united states and its outlying possessions to an american parent who has resided in the united states and its outlying possessions,there being no other legal parent under the law of the place of birth,shall have the nationality of such american parent.
letter from sec y hull to chairman dickstein,respondent may,supp.br.ex.b 
and unlike the legitimation requirement at issue in nguyen,which could be satisfied by,for example,a written acknowledgment of paternity under oath,the physical presence requirement that morales santana challenges imposes more than a minimal burden on unwed citizen fathers.see nguyen,at.it adds to the legitimation requirement ten years of physical presence in the united states,five of which must be after the age of fourteen.in our view,this burden on a citizen father right to confer citizenship on his child is substantial 
for these reasons,the distinction at the heart of the act physical presence requirements is not substantially related to the achievement of a permissible,objective 
we now turn to the most vexing problem in this case.here,two statutory provisions c and a combine to violate equal protection.what is the remedy for this violation of equal protection,where citizenship is at stake ordinarily,when the right invoked is that to equal treatment,the appropriate remedy is a mandate of equal treatment,a result that can be accomplished by withdrawal of benefits from the favored class as well as by extension of benefits to the excluded class.heckler mathews,emphasis omitted quoting iowa des moines bank bennett,accord califano westcott.
as we see it,equal treatment might be achieved in any one of three ways striking both c and a entirely severing the continuous presence provision in c and requiring every unwed citizen parent to satisfy the more onerous requirement if the other parent lacks citizenship or severing the requirement in a and a and requiring every unwed citizen parent to satisfy the less onerous continuous presence requirement if the other parent lacks citizenship.in selecting among these three options,we look to the intent of congress in enacting the act.see cal.fed.sav.loan ass guerra,t he court must look to the intent of the legislature to determine whether to extend benefits or nullify the statute.for reasons we explain below,we conclude that the third option is most consistent with congressional intent.
we eliminate the first option with ease.the act contains a severance clause that provides if any particular provision of this act,or the application thereof to any person or circumstance,is held invalid,the remainder of the act shall not be affected thereby.act nguyen,at s everance is based on the assumption that congress would have intended the result.the clause makes clear that only one of the provisions in,rather than both,should be severed as constitutionally infirm.it also means t
