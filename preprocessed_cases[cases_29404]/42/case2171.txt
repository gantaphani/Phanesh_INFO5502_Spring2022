petitioner,sead pilica,is a native and citizen of yugoslavia.he seeks reversal of the october,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or the board affirming the denial of his asylum application and denying his motion to remand.petitioner argues that the bia abused its discretion by denying the motion to remand in a summary decision that the bia erred by applying the current standard of review to his appeal rather than the standard in effect when his case commenced and that the denial of asylum by the immigration judge ij was not supported by substantial evidence.respondent,john ashcroft,in addition to contesting petitioner arguments,contends that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the bia denial of the motion to remand.
based on the following analysis,the court finds jurisdiction over the denial of the motion to remand to be proper.in its exercise of that jurisdiction,the court remands this case to the board to provide an explanation for that denial.the bia decision on petitioner asylum and withholding of removal claims is affirmed.
background 
petitioner entered the united states without inspection on august.on february,the immigration and naturalization service served pilica with a notice to appear charging him with removability under a a i of the immigration and nationality act ina,codified at a a i.at a hearing before the ij,pilica,through counsel,admitted the factual allegations of the notice to appear,conceded removability,and requested a continuance to apply for asylum.pilica requested the following relief asylum pursuant to ina a,a withholding of removal pursuant to ina b a,b a withholding of removal under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the convention against torture pursuant to c,et and in the alternative,voluntary departure pursuant to ina.a hearing on the merits of pilica claims was held on april.
petitioner and his brother,nedin pilica,were the only two witnesses at the hearing.documentary evidence presented included pilica written asylum applications a hospital report confirming that pilica had suffered a head injury and numerous documents relating to country conditions in yugoslavia.petitioner testified that he is an ethnic albanian who had been politically active with the albanian democratic party in montenegro,the yugoslavian republic in which he lived.he testified that he had twice been arrested as a result of his participation in albanian democratic party demonstrations.he was detained for a week in conjunction with each arrest pilica testified that during a third demonstration,he was beaten by policemen,resulting in head injuries and hospitalization for a week 
at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij orally denied pilica applications for asylum,withholding of removal,convention against torture relief,and voluntary departure.the ij found that pilica lacked credibility and had failed to establish statutory eligibility for relief.the ij based his adverse credibility finding on inconsistencies between the testimony of pilica and his brother,internal inconsistencies in pilica testimony,inconsistencies between the written asylum applications and pilica testimony at the hearing,and pilica failure to corroborate his testimony.the ij ultimately found that pilica had not established by credible evidence that he had suffered any prior torture or persecution.in the alternative,the ij found that,even assuming pilica credibility,he had not demonstrated past persecution,a fear of future persecution,or that it was more likely than not that he would be subject to torture if he returned to montenegro.the ij based this finding on country condition evidence relating to montenegro and on the fact that pilica political involvement was sparse,consisting only of having attended a few demonstrations at which he held up a sign,clapped,and yelled.
pilica filed a timely notice of appeal with the bia.while his appeal was pending,pilica filed a motion for remand,requesting that the case be remanded to allow him to seek relief,in the form of adjustment of status,that was not available to him at the time of his original hearing.on october,the board affirmed without opinion the decision of the ij.in the same decision,the board also denied,again without opinion,the motion to remand.pilica seeks review of the board decision.
ii.analysis 
motion to.jurisdiction 
as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,the following provision was enacted notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section of this title a b,ina a b.section,in turn,is entitled,adjustment of status of nonimmigrant to that of person admitted for permanent residence,and states that adjustment of status may be granted in the discretion of the attorney general,ina.based upon the language of a b,it is clear that this court lacks jurisdiction over the attorney general discretionary determination of whether an alien should be granted adjustment of status.here,however,petitioner does not appeal from a discretionary determination denying him an adjustment in status.rather,he appeals from the bia denial of his motion in which he sought a remand in order to permit him to apply for an adjustment of status the question is whether the denial of the motion to remand was a judgment regarding the granting of relief under.a b.
the sixth circuit has not addressed this precise issue however,two cases from other circuits are instructive.in prado reno,cir,the first circuit held that ina a b did not preclude review of the petitioner claim that the bia erred in failing to reopen her case.the petitioner had sought a reopening so that she could request an adjustment of status under ina same relief as ultimately was desired by pilica.prado at.while finding plausible the ins reading of the statute as precluding review of any decision related to relief under an enumerated section,the court ultimately found that the language of the statute should be narrowly read so as only to preclude review of a decision that actually granted or denied relief under an enumerated section 
the decision as to which prado seeks review is not a bia judgment on whether to adjust prado status,which would be a judgment regarding the granting of relief under an enumerated section,but is rather a decision not to reopen under 
why,it might be asked,should review of a decision under ina not to grant an adjustment of status be precluded,while judicial review of the denial of a motion to reopen to petition for adjustment of status is permitted as explained below,the window for review is narrow because of other doctrines of jurisdiction and judicial restraint,not all denials of motions to reopen are reviewable.but as to those denials of motions to reopen that are otherwise reviewable,there are several reasons supporting this distinction in our reading of ina a b.the ins has established procedures governing motions to reopen an alien case when new material information becomes available.in cases,the denial of a motion to reopen was reviewed for abuse of discretion.the language chosen by congress in ina a b does not evidence an intent to eliminate this entirely rational,small safety review that ensures that the agency at least considers new information,even if its ultimate and unreviewable judgment denies the relief sought.it may also be that congress wished the agency to live by its rules.congress may have desired court review to provide a minimal control on administrative arbitrariness such as where a motion to reopen is timely filed but the agency denies it on grounds of untimeliness.the space left open for judicial review is quite narrow,but it is not irrational for the window to be open a crack,if not wide open.
id.at citations omitted.
in ashcroft,cir,the ninth circuit provided less extensive reasoning,but ultimately reached the same result 
this case does not involve a judgment regarding the granting of voluntary departure addressed in one of the enumerated sections.it involves a decision regarding the denial of a motion to reopen 
because we are not asked to review the discretionary denial or granting of voluntary departure,a b i does not prevent us from exercising jurisdiction.
several courts,in addressing the transitional rules of iirira,have held that,pursuant to those rules,a court lacks jurisdiction only to review an order that addresses the merits of an alien request for relief under one of the enumerated sections,mickeviciute ins,cir luis ins,cir stewart ins,cir arrozal ins,cir.the transitional rule has slightly different language than the permanent rule t here shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under section c,h,i,or of the immigration and nationality act iirira,c e.the language of the permanent provision is broader than that of the transitional rule.see,prado,at noting the distinction between the permanent rule,which states,any judgment regarding the granting of relief under,and the transitional rule,which states,discretionary decisions under.the question is whether this distinction is determinative of a congressional intent to decrease the appellate relief available under the permanent rule as compared to the transitional rule.
the reasoning of cases like stewart seems equally applicable to cases involving the permanent rules.the court in stewart recognized that the statute could be interpreted either way,but decided it was logical to distinguish between the end result sought and the basis for the actual decision to be reviewed 
the bia decision denying stewart motion to reopen could logically be interpreted for the purposes of c e either as a decision under because the end result is a denial of stewart motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status pursuant to or as a decision under e a the specific reason for the bia denial of stewart motion to reopen w e believe that the better interpretation of c e is that it divests courts of jurisdiction only over bia decisions that address the merits of an alien request for relief pursuant to those sections.a reviewing court,therefore,must examine the basis for the bia decision rather than the end result of the bia decision 
stewart,at.
the court is aware of no cases holding that an appeals court does not have jurisdiction to review a motion to reopen when the ultimate relief sought is based on one of the provisions enumerated in a b i.there are,however,some apparent wrinkles in the courts unanimity.in rodriguez ashcroft,cir,the fifth circuit interpreted the transitional rules to preclude it from exercising jurisdiction over a motion to reopen.the court explained as follows 
it is axiomatic that if we are divested of jurisdiction to review an original determination by the board that an alien has failed to establish that he would suffer extreme hardship if deported,we must also be divested of jurisdiction to review the board denial of a motion to reopen on the ground that the alien has still failed to establish such hardship.to hold otherwise would create a loophole that would thwart the clear intent of congress that the courts not review the discretionary decisions of the bia.
rodriguez,at.
rodriguez,however,does not represent a departure from the cases already cited.indeed,the rodriguez court recognized the correctness of stewart and arrozal it merely distinguished the facts before it from the facts in those cases.id.the motion to reopen in rodriguez was akin to a motion for bia actually considered the sufficiency of the evidence of extreme hardship in denying the motion.id.at.applying the stewart test,the court found that the board,in reaching its decision to deny the motion to reopen,addressed the merits of an alien request for relief pursuant to a provision of the ina established as discretionary by c e.id.at quoting stewart,at 
the case law supports a decision that a motion to reopen that does not involve the consideration of relief on the merits should not be treated as regarding the granting of relief under.the only cases squarely to have considered the issue,prado and,have so held,and the cases under the iirira transitional rule provide further support for this conclusion.while the language of the permanent rule is broader than the language of the transitional rule,the court agrees with prado that the difference in language is not determinative.the court further agrees with the reasoning in prado regarding the importance of a small safety valve in the form of court review to ensure that the bia lives by its rules and at least considers new information.there is no indication that congress intended to eliminate this safeguard.absent clear language to the contrary,this court will not assume that congress meant to do so.jurisdiction over this claim therefore is proper.
denial without opinion 
petitioner contends that the bia abused its discretion by denying his motion to remand without providing a rational explanation.he asks that this court remand his case to the board with instructions to provide an explanation for the denial.
the bia denial of a motion to remand is reviewed for abuse of discretion.fieran ins,cir citing ashki ins,cir.in determining whether the board abused its discretion,this court must decide whether the denial of petitioner motion to reopen deportation proceedings was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination balani ins,cir see daneshvar ashcroft,cir see also zhao doj,cir reversing and remanding decision denying motion to reopen where bia failed to explain decision adequately.
since the board failed to provide any explanation whatsoever to accompany its decision on petitioner motion to remand,it unquestionably failed to supply a rational explanation.the court therefore remands this case to the bia for provision of a rational explanation for its decision on the motion to remand.
asylum decision 
standard applied by the bia 
pilica appeal was filed with the board on april.effective september,a regulatory reform expanded the board system of streamlining the appeals process and changed the standard of review applied by the board to findings of fact.procedural reforms to improve case management.prior to,all appeals were heard by a panel of the board.id.at.in,the attorney general instituted a streamlining process that allowed a single board member summarily to affirm an ij decision without opinion id.the regulations expand ed the process to be the dominant method of adjudication for the large majority of cases before the board.id.
prior to the regulations,the board conducted a de novo review of the cases appealed to it.id.at.pursuant to the new regulations,however,the board is instructed to review an ij findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous all other questions continue to be reviewed de novo.id.at d the regulations were to apply to all cases and motions pending on september,with the exception that the new clearly erroneous standard of review would not be used in appeals filed before that date.f.the review of petitioner case thus should have been conducted de novo,without reference to the clearly erroneous standard.
petitioner contends that the bia erred by applying the new standard of review to his appeal and argues that his case should be remanded to the bia for de novo review,conducted by a three judge panel in accordance with the scope of review standard that existed prior to september.respondent maintains that,absent any evidence that the board ignored the regulatory provision requiring it to apply the old standard of review,this court,based on the presumption of administrative regularity,must accept that the board applied the correct standard.
a single member of the board,pursuant to e currently e,on october,affirmed without opinion the decision of the ij in this case.the board decision tracks the prescribed language for an affirmance without opinion and,also in accordance with the regulation,does not provide further explanation or reasoning.e ii absent evidence to the contrary,this court presumes that the bia applied the correct standard of review.see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d administrative decision entitled to presumption of regularity,overruled on other grounds,califano sanders,d yuk ashcroft,cir in view of the presumption of regularity attaching to administrative procedures,we will not assume,without any evidence,that bia members do not follow the regulations or do not perform their jobs properly.citation omitted abdulai ashcroft,cir because of presumption of regularity,petitioner bears burden of proving that bia did not review record when it considered appeal makonnen ins,cir bia entitled to presumption of regularity kaczmarczyk ins,cir bia is entitled to a presumption of regularity,and petitioner has burden to prove bia gave short shrift to evidence presented see also albathani ins,cir bia summary affirmance does not establish that the required review is not taking place.because pilica has presented no evidence that the board failed to apply the correct standard,the court declines to reverse the board decision on this basis.
the ij decision 
standard of review and burden of proof 
the attorney general has discretion under the act to grant asylum to a refugee.ina b,b.a refugee is defined as a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.disposition of an application for asylum requires a inquiry first,whether the petitioner is a refugee within the meaning of the statute,and second,whether the petitioner merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the attorney general.perkovic ins,cir citing ins,d.the alien has the burden of proof at both stages.klawitter ins,cir.
in order to demonstrate that he qualifies as a refugee,an alien must establish either that he has suffered actual past persecution or that he has a fear of future persecution.mikhailevitch ins,cir b.this court has held that persecution within the meaning of a a requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,unaccompanied by any physical punishment,infliction of harm,or significant deprivation of liberty.mikhailevitch,at see also in re kasinga,bia defining persecution as the infliction of harm or suffering by the government,or persons a government is unwilling or unable to control,to overcome a characteristic of the victim.an applicant who establishes past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.mikhailevitch,at b.that presumption may be rebutted,however,if the government establishes,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there has been a fundamental change in country conditions such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution.mikhailevitch at b i.
an alien may establish a fear of future persecution by demonstrating that he has a fear of persecution in his home country on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he were to return to that country and that he is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of such fear.mikhailevitch at b i.a fear of persecution thus has both a subjective and an objective component an alien must actually fear that he will be persecuted upon return to his country,and he must present evidence establishing an objective situation under which his fear can be deemed reasonable.perkovic,at.a fear of persecution does not require the applicant to show that he probably will be persecuted if he is deported o ne can certainly have a fear of an event happening when there is less than a chance of the occurrence taking place.id.at quoting,at.
in addition to requesting asylum,petitioner also has requested withholding of removal pursuant to ina b.withholding of removal is mandatory if an alien establishes that his life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b klawitter,at.an applicant seeking withholding of removal faces a more stringent burden than what is required on a claim for asylum.mikhailevitch,at citing,at.in order to be entitled to relief,an alien must establish that there is a clear probability that he will be subject to persecution if forced to return to the country of removal.ins stevic,d mikhailevitch,at.
as his third claim for relief,petitioner seeks withholding of removal under the convention against torture.in order to obtain such relief,an alien has the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.
iirira provides the following guidelines for this court to use in reviewing the board decisions 
a t he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based,
b the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,
c a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the united states is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law,and 
d the attorney general discretionary judgment whether to grant relief under section a governing applications for asylum shall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.

credibility 
the ij found that respondent is an inherently incredible witness and respondent story was not to be believed by the court.the ij then went on to detail various inconsistencies between pilica testimony and his brother testimony,internal inconsistencies in pilica testimony,and inconsistencies between pilica testimony and his applications for asylum.the ij also based his credibility determination on pilica failure to corroborate his testimony by calling his father and his mother as witnesses,even though both lived in the area and both had personal knowledge of pilica circumstances.the ij appears to have misremembered certain elements of the testimony,and he drew all possible inferences against pilica.the ij adverse credibility findings,however,are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.based on the administrative record,a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to find pilica credible.
the ij found pilica brother testimony to have destroyed pilica credibility due to the following inconsistencies pilica testified that the family name had been serbianized,whereas his brother testified that no such change had occurred pilica brother testified that when pilica was beaten by the police he was injured in the legs,while neither pilica nor the hospital record indicated that there had been any injury to pilica legs pilica testified that he was beaten up by the cetnici,which he defined as civilians who wanted to exclude albanians,whereas pilica brother testified that cetnici was a name for the secret police pilica stated that his father was not present to testify because his father had arthritis and was not working and pilica did not want to ask him to come,whereas pilica brother testified that their father was at work and could have come to the hearing and pilica brother testified that pilica told him that something bad had happened to him in each of the years from to,whereas pilica testified that things had simply happened throughout the course of this year group,and that there was not necessarily a specific occurrence in each year.
the transcript before this court does not contain any testimony that the pilica name had been serbianized the transcript also does not contain any statement by pilica brother that pilica was injured in the legs pilica and his brother do appear to have defined cetnici differently,though the inconsistency is not significant.the ij seems to have accurately recalled the testimony regarding the whereabouts of pilica father the ij finding regarding the differing testimony about occurrences in different years likewise seems supported by the record,though the testimony on this subject generally was ambiguous
