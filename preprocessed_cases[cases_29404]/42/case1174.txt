opinion of the court 
carlton baptiste petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia ordering his removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to a a iii,which is defined as,inter alia,a crime of violence,and two or more crimes involving moral turpitude cimts pursuant to a a ii.
baptiste petition requires us to decide whether the definition of a crime of violence provided in b is void for vagueness under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.section b and similarly worded statutes have come under attack in federal courts across the country after the supreme court decision in johnson united states,which invalidated the residual clause of the armed career criminal act acca,e b ii,as unconstitutionally vague.
although we initially conclude that baptiste new jersey aggravated assault conviction was for a crime of violence pursuant to b,we are persuaded that the definition of a crime of violence in b is unconstitutionally vague after johnson.we therefore invalidate b and hold that baptiste was not convicted of an aggravated felony.however,we conclude that baptiste is nonetheless removable because he was convicted of two or more cimts.
accordingly,we will grant the petition in part as it relates to the bia aggravated felony determination,deny the petition in part as it relates to the bia cimt determination,and remand the case to the bia for further proceedings so that baptiste may apply for any relief from removal that was previously unavailable to him as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.
factual background and procedural history 
factual background 
petitioner carlton baptiste is a native of trinidad and tobago who was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.on december,baptiste was convicted of atrocious assault and battery pursuant to former stat.ann.west the conviction.there is no indication from the administrative record as to the facts underlying this conviction.baptiste was sentenced to a suspended twelvemonth term of imprisonment and placed on probation for one year.
over thirty years later,on april,baptiste was convicted of aggravated assault pursuant to stat.ann.b west the conviction that statute provides that a person is guilty of aggravated assault if he a ttempts to cause serious bodily injury to another,or causes such injury purposely or knowingly or under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life recklessly causes such injury.stat.ann.b west.as with his earlier conviction,there is no indication from the administrative record as to the facts underlying baptiste conviction.there is also no indication from the administrative record as to whether baptiste pleaded guilty to the attempt crime in the statute,or,if he pleaded guilty to the completed crime,to which mental state in the statute baptiste pleaded guilty to possessing purpose,knowledge or recklessness.see.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
procedural history 
in june,the department of homeland security dhs instituted removal proceedings against baptiste.dhs asserted that,based on his conviction,baptiste was removable as an alien convicted of a crime of violence pursuant to and,therefore,an aggravated felony pursuant to a a iii.dhs later asserted that baptiste was also removable,based on both his conviction and his conviction,as an alien convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude,not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct pursuant to a a ii.on october,the immigration judge ij sustained both charges of removability.baptiste appealed the ij determinations to the bia.
the bia agreed with the ij determination that the conviction was for a crime of violence.it reasoned that,in order to qualify as a crime of violence under b,the nature of a crime must be such that its commission ordinarily would present a risk that physical force would be used against the person of another,irrespective of whether the risk develops or harm actually occurs.accordingly,the bia determined that the relevant question is whether the offense whatever its mens rea may be is one that inherently involves a person acting in conscious disregard of the risk that,in the course of its commission,he may use physical force against the person of another.under these principles,the bia concluded that 
a n individual who undertakes to cause serious bodily injury to another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life necessarily disregards the substantial risk that in the course of committing that offense he will use physical force against another,either to effect the serious bodily injury that the statute requires or to overcome the victim resistance or both.
the bia also agreed with the ij determination that the conviction was for a cimt it examined the manner in which new jersey courts have construed the recklessness crime in baptiste statute of conviction and observed that 
new jersey courts hold that an individual acts under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life if he acts with conscious awareness of the fact that his conduct bears a substantial risk that he will kill another and he conducts himself with no regard to that risk.
based on that observation,the bia concluded that an individual can not form the culpable mental state and commit the culpable acts required for conviction without acting in a base,vile or depraved manner and without consciously disregarding a substantial risk that he will kill another.
accordingly,the bia dismissed baptiste appeal.baptiste filed a timely petition for review with this court on november.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the bia had appellate jurisdiction over the ij order of removal pursuant to b.we have jurisdiction over baptiste petition for review of the bia dismissal of his appeal pursuant to a.
where,as here,the bia issues a written decision on the merits,we review its decision and not the decision of the ij.bautista att y of the,cir.because an assessment of whether a crime constitutes a crime of violence pursuant to b implicates the criminal provisions of the code,we exercise de novo review over the bia determination that the conviction was for a crime of violence and,therefore,an aggravated felony.aguilar att y of the,cir.similarly,we review baptiste due process challenge to the definition of a crime of violence in b de novo.abdulrahman ashcroft,cir.
since the bia determination that the conviction was for a cimt was made in an unpublished,decision issued by a single bia member,we do not accord that determination any deference,and it is a t most persuasive authority.mahn att y of the,cir.we therefore review the bia cimt determination de novo as well.
iii.analysis 
baptiste conviction was for a crime of violence under b 
an alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony after his admission to the united states is removable pursuant to a a iii.the term aggravated felony is defined as,inter alia,a crime of violence as defined in,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f.thus,in order to determine whether baptiste conviction was for an aggravated felony,we must first examine the definition of a crime of violence in.aguilar,at.after having ascertain ed the definition of a crime of violence,we must then compare that definition to the statute of conviction to determine whether the applicable crime defined in the statute of conviction is categorically a crime of violence an inquiry known as the categorical approach.id.
definition of a crime of violence 
a crime of violence is defined,in relevant part,as an offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b emphasis added that definition requires specific intent to use force or,in other words,the intentional employment of force,generally to obtain some end.tran gonzales,cir.see leocal ashcroft,u se requires active employment.emphasis added.thus,a crime of violence under b is one that involves a substantial risk that force will be actively employ ed in the furtherance of the offense.tran,at.
within this framework,we have distinguished between those types of recklessness crimes that may be considered crimes of violence under b and those that may not be so considered.on the one hand,we have held that pure recklessness crimes are generally not crimes of violence under b.aguilar,at.pure recklessness exists when the perpetrator runs no risk of intentionally using force in committing his crime.id.at quoting tran,at.for example,reckless burning is not a crime of violence under b because the risk is that the fire started by the offender will spread and damage the property of another,which can not be said to involve the intentional use of force.tran,at.similarly,crimes that only raise a substantial risk that accidental,not intentional,force will be used,such as reckless vehicular homicide,are not crimes of violence under b.aguilar,at.the idea of purposeful action,of actively employing a means to achieve an end,is an essential component of both use and intent,and is absent from the concept of recklessness.tran,at 
however,in contrast to those types of recklessness crimes,we have recognized that some recklessness crimes raise a substantial risk that the perpetrator will resort to intentional physical force in the course of committing the crime and so are crimes of violence under b.aguilar,at.in aguilar attorney general,we held that the pennsylvania crime of reckless sexual assault is a crime of violence under b.id.at.although a defendant may act with a reckless state of mind in committing the offense,we observed that the defendant actions create a substantial risk that the offender will intentionally use force to overcome the victim natural resistance against participating in unwanted intercourse.id.at.
the categorical approach 
in determining whether baptiste conviction was for a crime of violence under the foregoing principles,we must use the categorical approach set forth by the supreme court in taylor united states.the categorical approach is used in a variety of contexts to determine whether a criminal conviction meets the requirements of a federal statute triggering some form of sentencing or immigration consequence.see rojas att y of the,cir.en banc see,united states tucker,cir.serious drug offense requirement in the acca triggering sentencing enhancement restrepo att y of the,cir.sexual abuse of a minor requirement in the ina triggering removability.under this approach,we do not consider the facts underlying baptiste conviction,the conduct giving rise to his conviction.see aguilar,at.instead,we compare the federal definition of a crime of violence to the statute of conviction itself to determine whether the applicable crime defined in the statute of conviction is categorically a crime of violence.id.
the statute of conviction at issue here provides that a person is guilty of aggravated assault if he a ttempts to cause serious bodily injury to another,or causes such injury purposely or knowingly or under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life recklessly causes such injury.stat.ann.b west.the parties agree that,since the administrative record does not reveal to which crime in the statute of conviction baptiste pleaded guilty,we should look to the recklessness crime in the statute recklessly causing serious bodily injury to another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.thus,the question we must answer is whether recklessly causing serious bodily injury to another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life is categorically a crime of violence under b.
however,the foregoing formulation begs the question what does it mean to say that a crime defined in a statute of conviction is categorically a crime of violence under b 
baptiste and the attorney general advocate opposing approaches to this question.baptiste points us to our decision in aguilar,in which we observed without further exposition that only if the least culpable conduct necessary to sustain conviction under a statute constitutes a crime of violence can the applicable crime defined in the statute be deemed categorically a crime of violence under b.aguilar,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted quoting denis att y of the,cir.baptiste argues that the least culpable conduct for which there is a possibility of conviction for reckless aggravated assault is drunk driving manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life and resulting in serious bodily injury to another.see,state kromphold,state sweeney,wl,at super.app.div.thus,under baptiste view,only if that least culpable conduct meets the definition of a crime of violence in b can the recklessness crime in his statute of conviction be deemed categorically a crime of violence pursuant to b.
the attorney general counters that we must instead look to the conduct associated with the ordinary case of reckless aggravated assault not the least culpable conduct.the ordinary case inquiry finds its roots in the supreme court opinion in james united states,which addressed the operation of the categorical approach in the related acca residual clause context.in james,the court examined whether a defendant conviction in florida for attempted burglary fell within the acca residual clause definition of a violent felony.the residual clause defines violent felony in relation to a list of enumerated offenses,such as burglary and extortion,as a crime that otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.e b ii.the defendant argued that,under the categorical approach,all cases of attempted burglary under his statute of conviction had to present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another before attempted burglary could be deemed categorically a violent felony.james,at.
the court concluded that the defendant argument misapprehend ed taylor categorical approach.id.at.e very conceivable factual offense covered by a statute need not necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.id.rather,the court concluded that the proper inquiry under the categorical approach is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense,in the ordinary case,presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.id.emphasis added see united states stinson,cir.
although james was decided several years before our opinion in aguilar,we did not consider in aguilar whether the james ordinary case inquiry from the acca residual clause context should displace the least culpable conduct inquiry in the b context however,since james,nearly all of our sister circuits have adopted the ordinary case inquiry in the b context.see united states,cir.united states keelan,cir.united states avila,cir.united states fish,cir.holder,cir.united states,cir.per curiam van don nguyen holder,cir.united states,cir.additionally,the bia reached the same conclusion last year.see in re mario.
we are persuaded that the ordinary case inquiry is the correct analytical approach in the b context.section b requires courts to ask whether a crime by its nature presents a substantial risk of the use of force.accordingly,in leocal ashcroft the supreme court only b case the court stated that b covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.at emphasis added.as a matter of plain language,asking whether the least culpable conduct sufficient to support a conviction for a crime presents a certain risk is inconsistent with asking whether that crime by its nature or naturally presents that risk.see keisler,cir.noting that every violation of a state criminal statute need not be violent for the crime to be a crime of violence by its nature emphasis added united states,cir.we do not take the phrase by its nature as an invitation to search for exceptional cases.
by contrast to the least culpable conduct inquiry,the supreme court ordinary case inquiry is aligned with the by its nature inquiry that the text of b requires.asking whether the ordinary case of a crime presents a certain risk is the equivalent of asking whether that crime by its nature presents that same risk.the court description of the ordinary case inquiry as asking whether an offense is of a type that,by its nature presents a certain risk demonstrates the equivalence of the two inquiries james,at emphasis added.accordingly,we adopt the ordinary case inquiry as part of the categorical approach in b cases.
application of the categorical approach 
given our adoption of the ordinary case inquiry in the b context,we now must determine how to ascertain the ordinary case of reckless aggravated assault.the first step in making this determination is defining the term ordinary.black law dictionary defines ordinary as o ccuring in the regular course of events,normal,and usual.black law dictionary ed.other circuits have defined the ordinary case in a way consistent with this definition.see,at looking to the usual violation of a statute united states sonnenberg,cir.looking to the typical case van don nguyen,at looking to the mainstream of prosecutions brought under the statute see also sykes united states,kagan,dissenting defining the ordinary case of a crime as the most common form of that crime.therefore,in ascertaining the ordinary case of reckless aggravated assault,we will look to the conduct associated with the normal or usual commission of the crime.
there is little guidance as to how we should go about identifying that conduct.see johnson,at.indeed,during oral argument,neither advocate was able to articulate the ordinary case of reckless aggravated assault.how does one go about deciding what kind of conduct the ordinary case of a crime involves a statistical analysis of the state reporter a survey expert evidence google gut instinct id.quoting united states mayer,cir.kozinski,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.although we ultimately conclude that the indeterminate nature of the ordinary case inquiry contributes to b unconstitutionality,we must first undertake the analysis as best we can to determine whether baptiste conviction was for a crime of violence.see egolf witmer,cir.we have a longstanding practice of avoiding constitutional questions in cases where we can reach a decision upon other grounds.
in the absence of any empirical analysis of convictions for reckless aggravated assault,we are limited to examining new jersey case law to determine what conduct is associated with the ordinary case of the crime.our review of case law is complicated in this case because the statute of conviction at issue includes several crimes an attempt crime and a completed crime phrased with several disjunctive mental states and the conviction documents of defendants prosecuted under the statute often do not specify which crime in the statute the defendant was convicted of committing.see united states,cir.see,state watkins,wl,at super.app.div,verdict sheet for aggravated assault did not differentiate mental states.this lack of specificity makes it impossible in many cases to determine whether a defendant was convicted of the crime at issue in this case reckless aggravated assault or the other crimes specified in the statute 
however,based on our review of pertinent case law,we observe that there is a wide array of conduct for which a defendant can be convicted for reckless aggravated assault.for purposes of our analysis,we group this conduct into three categories conduct that itself constitutes an intentional use of force conduct that presents a substantial risk of the intentional use of force and conduct that presents no risk of the intentional use of force.
a intentional use of force 
a defendant can be convicted for reckless aggravated assault if he intentionally uses force against a victim and is reckless as to whether that force will cause serious bodily injury.see state jaramillo,wl,at super.app.div,per curiam noting that a jury was entitled to find the defendant guilty of reckless aggravated assault for punching the victim state battle,super.app.div.observing that a thief forceful snatching of a victim purse,which leads to her serious bodily injury,could constitute reckless aggravated assault.a recent case from the new jersey courts addressing the crime of reckless aggravated assault is illustrative.
in state steffen,wl,at super.app.div,per curiam,the defendant was convicted of reckless aggravated assault after using a choke slam to subdue the victim.as a result of the choke slam,the victim suffered a hematoma and temporary loss of sight.id.at.the trial court determined that the defendant had acted recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,id.at,and the reviewing court affirmed the trial court verdict,id.at.
such conduct,which involved choke slamming the victim,itself involves the intentional use of force and so clearly meets the requirements of b see jimenez gonzalez mukasey,cir.examining cases holding that recklessness crimes are crimes of violence under b as involving intentional conduct exhibiting a reckless disregard to the likelihood of injury blake gonzales,cir.finding a crime to be a crime of violence under b where,under one theory of violation,the perpetrator intends the conduct,and recklessness is the mens rea with respect to the likelihood of physical harm alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
b substantial risk of intentional use of force 
a defendant can also be convicted for conduct that,while itself not constituting an intentional use of force,presents a substantial risk that he will intentionally use force.for example,in state colon,super.app.div,the defendant friend was being battered by a group of men outside a bar.the bar bouncer testified that he had grabbed hold of one of the men and was pulling him off of the defendant friend when that man was shot.id.at.the jury found that the defendant had shot the victim,but acquitted him of purposeful or knowing aggravated assault instead,it convicted him only of reckless aggravated assault.id.at.although several theories of the crime could have supported the jury verdict,relevant for our purposes is the court comment that the verdict could have been the result of a jury finding that the defendant recklessly fired his weapon.id.at.
as we explained above,we determined in aguilar that a reckless sexual assault is a crime of violence because there is a substantial risk that the defendant will encounter resistance from the victim and then decide to intentionally use force to overcome the victim.see aguilar,at.similarly,in colon,once the defendant recklessly fired his weapon and hit the victim,there was a substantial risk that the victim would fight back and that the defendant would then decide to intentionally fire his weapon,intentionally use force against the victim.although not a certainty,the reckless firing of the weapon created a substantial risk of that result,which is all that b requires 
c no risk of intentional use of force 
finally,a defendant can be convicted for conduct that presents no risk that he will intentionally use force.specifically,in accordance with baptiste suggested least culpable conduct,a defendant can be convicted for reckless aggravated assault for drunk driving manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life and resulting in serious bodily injury to another.see,kromphold,at sweeney,wl,at.common to such drunk driving cases is that the defendant did not intend to cause harm to the victim and so is not actively employ ing force in committing the crime.leocal,at see oyebanji gonzales,cir.moreover,such conduct does not present a risk that the reckless offender will step in and commit an intentional act of violence.tran,at.
our task is to determine,based on the foregoing review of case law,what conduct is associated with the ordinary case of reckless aggravated assault.unsurprisingly,the attorney general urges us to focus on conduct in the first two categories and baptiste urges us to focus on conduct in the third category.in the absence of any concrete guidance as to how to make this determination,see johnson,at,we must rely on our common sense and judicial experience,see sonnenberg,at,at.
we recognize that it is impossible in this case to determine with precision what specific conduct is associated with the ordinary case of the crime.the crime at issue in this case covers a wide array of conduct more than,say,burglary.a defendant can be convicted of the crime for conduct as dissimilar as an intentional act of physical violence first category of conduct and drunk driving causing accidental injury third category of conduct.with a crime that covers such a wide array of conduct,we begin with the common sense proposition that the conduct associated with the ordinary case of a conviction presumptively lies at or near the middle of the culpability spectrum here,the second category of conduct we have identified.
baptiste single factual scenario to the contrary in which there is no risk of the intentional use of force a drunk driver is not enough to overcome this presumption.we have seen nothing in our foregoing review of case law that persuades us that the normal or usual commission of the crime involves the actions of a drunk driver third category of conduct.rather,we view such conduct as being associated with a narrow subset of convictions and thus insufficient to render the crime categorically not a crime of violence under the ordinary case inquiry.van don nguyen,at a n unsubstantiated risk of physical force in some small subset of cases is in sufficient to classify an offense as a crime of violence.we reach the same conclusion with respect to the first category of conduct we have identified.
we therefore conclude that the conduct associated with the ordinary case of reckless aggravated assault lies somewhere within the second category of conduct we have identified,which falls within the definition of a crime of violence in b see johnson,at referring to the ordinary case as a abstraction.because we conclude that reckless aggravated assault does,in the ordinary case,present a substantial risk of the intentional use of force,reckless aggravated assault in new jersey is categorically a crime of violence pursuant to b.
given our conclusion that baptiste was convicted of a crime of violence pursuant to b,we now turn to the constitutional question presented in this case is b void for vagueness under the due process clause of the fifth amendment 
section b is void for vagueness under the due process clause of the fifth amendment 
the due process clause precludes the government from taking away a person life,liberty,or property under a statute so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes,or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.johnson,at.baptiste argues that his conviction was not for an aggravated felony because the incorporated definition of a crime of violence in b is unconstitutionally vague baptiste bases his argument on the supreme court recent decision in johnson united states,which invalidated the residual clause of the acca.
the acca provides for a sentence enhancement for certain defendants who have three or more prior convictions for a violent felony.id.at.the act defines violent felony as,inter alia,a crime that is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.e b ii emphasis added.the emphasized language is known as the residual clause.as we explained above,prior to johnson holding that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague,courts assessing whether a crime fell within the residual clause were required to use the same categorical approach that courts use in the b context.see supra section.thus,in d eciding whether the residual clause covers a crime,a court had to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in the ordinary case,and judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.johnson,at quoting james,at.
the majority in johnson observed that two features of the residual clause conspire d to make it unconstitutionally vague the ordinary case inquiry and the serious potential risk inquiry.id.at.first,the majority observed that there are many different conceptions of what the ordinary case of a crime involves.id.for example,does the ordinary instance of witness tampering involve offering a witness a bribe or threatening a witness with violence id.at.the majority concluded that t he residual clause offers no reliable way to choose between competing accounts of what an ordinary case involves.id.at.second,the majority observed that the clause left uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.id.thus,the majority concluded that the combination of indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony produces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the due process clause tolerates.id.
after reaching this conclusion,the majority examined the residual clause precedents of both the supreme court and the courts of appeals and determined that repeated failures to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause confirm its hopeless indeterminacy.id.it then addressed several arguments penned by the dissent.first,it rejected as inconsistent with the court precedents the dissent view that a statute is void for vagueness only if it is vague in all its applications.id.at.second,the majority dismissed the dissent concern that the invalidation of the residual clause for vagueness would cast constitutional doubt over laws similar to the residual clause that use terms such as substantial risk.id.the majority reasoned that such laws do not link the phrase substantial risk to a confusing list of examples,and,m ore importantly require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages on a particular occasion.id.finally,the majority rejected the dissent invitation to abandon the ordinary case inquiry and interpret the residual clause to refer to the risk posed by the particular conduct in which the defendant engaged.id.at.
in addressing whether johnson compels the invalidation of b,we do not write on a blank slate.the sixth,seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits have considered the question and concluded that johnson does render b void for vagueness.see shuti lynch,cir.united states,cir.dimaya lynch,cir,cert.granted,wl,golicov lynch,wl cir.by contrast,the en banc fifth circuit has concluded that b is not unconstitutionally vague after johnson,and the second and eighth circuits have concluded that c b,which contains nearly identical language to b survives johnson.see united states prickett,wl cir,united states,cir.en banc united states hill,cir.we enter the fray with the benefit of these considered opinions on b constitutionality.
the two features of the residual clause that the supreme court concluded conspire d to make the residual clause unconstitutionally vague were the ordinary case inquiry and the serious potential risk inquiry.johnson,at see united states calabretta,cir.given that the ordinary case inquiry,as used in the b context,is derived from the residual clause context,we can be certain that the ordinary case inquiry is identical in both contexts.as we described above,in the b context,a court must ask whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense,in the ordinary case,presents a substantial risk of the intentional use of force.james,at emphasis added.because b offers no reliable way to choose between competing accounts of what that abstraction of the crime involves,johnson,at,the ordinary case inquiry is as indeterminate in the b context as it was in the residual clause context.see golicov,wl,at shuti,at,at dimaya,at.
this conclusion holds true for the second feature of each statute as well the risk inquiry.whereas the residual clause asks how much risk it takes for a crime to present a serious potential risk of physical injury,b asks how much risk it takes for a crime to present a substantial risk of the intentional use of force.the phrases have two linguistic differences b replaces the residual clause serious with the word substantial and replaces the residual clause potential risk with risk.
a serious risk is equally as vague as a substantial risk.see golicov,wl,at.to be sure,a potential risk encompasses more conduct than a simple risk.see james,at t he combination of the two terms suggests that congress intended to encompass possibilities even more contingent or remote than a simple risk.however,in our view,this minor linguistic distinction is insufficient to bring b outside of the reasoning of johnson.see,at dimaya,at.the critical feature of the serious potential risk inquiry that rendered it indeterminate in johnson was not that the risk was potential,but that the residual clause required the use of a vague serious risk inquiry.the majority confirmed as much when,in response to the dissent suggestion that the majority opinion would cast constitutional doubt on statutes using a substantial risk inquiry,it did not draw any vagueness distinction between the phrases based on the word potential.see johnson,at.
the attorney general directs our attention to an additional linguistic distinction between the statutes that she views as meaningful.she argues that the scope of crimes that present a substantial risk of the use of force is narrower than the scope of crimes that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.see prickett,wl,at,at hill,at.this is so because there is undoubtedly a class of conduct that presents a risk that a victim will be injured without presenting a risk that force will intentionally be used against that victim.see leocal,at noting that b plainly does not encompass all offenses which create a substantial risk that injury will result from a person conduct.one example of such conduct is arson with intent to destroy a building,which runs the risk of a victim being injured without any risk of the arsonist using intentional force against that victim.the attorney general argues that the b inquiry therefore falls short of the thought experiment previously required by the residual clause.resp t br.internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states doe,supp.
while the attorney general is correct that fewer crimes fall within b than within the residual clause,we do not view the scope of crimes covered by each provision as integral to the vagueness analysis.the attorney general can not point us to any language in johnson that suggests otherwise because the court vagueness holding in johnson was focused on the serious potential risk inquiry required by the residual clause.see johnson,at t he residual clause leaves uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.it is one thing to apply an imprecise serious potential risk standard to facts it is quite another to apply it to a abstraction.emphasis added welch united states,the residual clause failed not because it adopted a serious potential risk standard but because applying that standard under the categorical approach required courts to assess the hypothetical risk posed by an abstract generic version of the offense.emphasis added.as such,we focus here in our vagueness analysis on the substantial risk inquiry required by b.
in applying those indeterminate risk inquiries,whether fewer or more cases fall within each respective statutory provision because of the modifiers physical injury and use of force does not affect the indeterminacy of the serious potential risk or substantial risk inquiries themselves.see welch,at thomas,dissenting observing that the residual clause was held to be vague because it requires courts to judge whether the ordinary case of a crime presents a serious potential risk of some result emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.in short,the distinction the attorney general draws between the two statutes is a distinction without a difference within the reasoning of johnson see shuti,at.
the attorney general next asserts that b does not fall within the reasoning in johnson because,unlike the list of exemplar crimes preceding the residual clause,b do es not rely on a unique list of enumerated crimes to complicate the assessment of risk.resp t br.e b ii defining violent felony as a crime that is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another emphasis added see prickett,wl,at,at hill,at.it is true that the majority in johnson commented on the confusion engendered by the list of exemplar crimes preceding the residual clause.see johnson,at.in responding to the dissent argument that holding the residual clause unconstitutional would place numerous provisions of federal and state law that use terms like substantial risk in constitutional doubt,the majority retorted 
almost none of the cited laws links a phrase such as substantial risk to a confusing list of examples.the phrase shades of red,standing alone,does not generate confusion or unpredictability but the phrase red,light pink,maroon,navy blue,or colors that otherwise involve shades of red assuredly does so.
id.at quoting james,at scalia,dissenting.
however,in the very next sentence of the opinion,in response to the dissent same argument,the majority stated 
more importantly,almost all of the cited laws require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages on a particular occasion.as a general matter,we do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as substantial risk to conduct the law is full of instances where a man fate depends on his estimating rightly some matter of degree.the residual clause,however,requires application of the serious potential risk standard to an idealized ordinary case of the crime.
id.first alteration in original first emphasis added internal citation omitted quoting nash united states,see welch,at.
we read johnson to mean that the confusing list of examples preceding the residual clause only added to the residual clause vagueness.indeed,the language in johnson by no means suggests that the list of examples was an integral component of the court finding that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague.see golicov,wl,at shuti,at dimaya,at.rather,as the supreme court made clear,the vagueness was the product of t wo features of the residual clause the ordinary case inquiry and the risk inquiry which,as we explained above,are present in the b analysis as well johnson,at see,at.
in fact,the lack of examples in b introduces at least as much vagueness into the provision as the presence of confusing examples introduced into the residual clause.see dimaya,at.the specific offenses preceding the residual clause provide a baseline from which to measure whether other similar conduct otherwise presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.james,at third alteration in original.this baseline provide s at least some guidance as to the sort of offenses congress intended for the residual clause to cover.dimaya,at.such guidance is absent from b,which contains no example offenses.as a result,courts are left to undertake the b analysis guided by nothing more than other judicial decisions that can lay no better claim to making sense of the indeterminacy of the analysis in a principled way than we have today.see supra section.
seemingly lost in these nuanced arguments about the scope and import of johnson is the fact that the supreme court expressly anticipated the effect its holding would have on statutes with the language contained in b.in addressing the applicability of its holding to those statutes,the court stated as a general matter,we do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as substantial risk to conduct.johnson,at emphasis added see welch,at.section b is not such a law.rather,b calls for the exact analysis that the court implied was unconstitutionally vague the application of the substantial risk inquiry to the idealized ordinary case of a crime.johnson,at emphasis added.
thus,because the two inquiries under the residual clause that the supreme court found to be indeterminate the ordinary case inquiry and the serious potential risk inquiry are materially the same as the inquiries under b,b is unconstitutionally vague.see golicov,wl,at shuti,at,at dimaya,at.by combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a crime of violence,b produces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the due process clause tolerates.johnson,at.
because b is invalid,baptiste conviction was not for an aggravated felony pursuant to a a iii.however,since baptiste does not contest that his conviction was for a cimt,he is still removable if his conviction was for a cimt.we now turn to that question.
baptiste conviction was for a cimt 
an alien who is convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude,not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct after his admission to the united states is removable pursuant to a a ii.baptiste argues that the bia erred in concluding that his conviction was for a cimt.in determining whether that conviction was for a cimt,we must again follow the categorical approach.mehboob att y of the,cir.as with our crime of violence determination,the parties agree that,in undertaking the categorical approach,we should look to the recklessness crime in the statute of conviction.thus,the question we must answer is whether recklessly causing serious bodily injury to another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life is categorically a cimt.
in the cimt context,our cases make clear that we look to the elements of the statutory offense to ascertain the least culpable conduct hypothetically necessary to sustain a conviction under the statute.mahn,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting,at.thus,the possibility of conviction for conduct,however remote,is sufficient to avoid removal.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting,at.under these dictates,if there is any conduct that could sustain a conviction for reckless aggravated assault,then that crime is categorically not a cimt.
we have in the past defined morally turpitudinous conduct as inherently base,vile,or depraved,contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed other persons.att y of the,cir.internal quotation marks omitted quoting knapik ashcroft,cir.such conduct can inhere in serious crimes committed recklessly,with a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that serious injury or death would follow.partyka att y of the,cir.specifically,a recklessness crime can constitute a cimt if certain statutory aggravating factors are present.knapik,at see idy holder,cir.recklessness coupled with serious bodily injury aggravating factor.
in knapik,the bia concluded that reckless endangerment under new york law was a cimt.at.new york law provided that a person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the first degree when,under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person.id.at quoting penal law mckinney.we concluded that the bia had acted reasonably in concluding that the new york crime constituted a cimt.id.at.
in so concluding,we observed that the new york statute at issue defined a recklessness crime that contain ed aggravating factors,requiring that a defendant create a grave risk of death to another person under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life.id.we went on to observe that the bia could reasonably conclude that the elements of depravity,recklessness and grave risk of death,when considered together,implicate accepted rules of morality and the duties owed to society.id.although the recklessness crime defined in the statute of conviction in this case uses nominally different wording,it is in all material respects the same as the new york crime in knapik that we found the bia reasonably classified as morally turpitudinous.
first,both crimes are recklessness crimes and the mental state of recklessness is virtually identical under new york and new jersey law.in new york,a person acts recklessly when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that is of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.penal law mckinney.in new jersey,a person acts recklessly when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that is of such a nature and degree that its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor situation.stat.ann.b west.
second,the aggravating factors in both crimes are virtually identical.as to the first aggravating factor,the new york crime required that the defendant act under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,penal law mckinney,whereas the new jersey crime at issue here requires that the defendant act under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,stat.ann.b west.there is no meaningful difference between those two phrases.
as to the second aggravating factor,the new york crime required that the defendant engage in conduct that creates a grave risk of death to another person.penal law mckinney.similarly,the new jersey crime at issue here requires conduct that results in serious bodily injury.stat.ann.b west.and the new jersey courts have required that the defendant be aware that his conduct bears a substantial risk that he will kill or seriously injure others.colon,at alteration in original.this risk must be so great that it constitutes a probability as opposed to the mere possibility of serious bodily injury.state pigueiras,super.app.div.see mahn,at concluding pennsylvania reckless endangerment crime is not a cimt because it only requires conduct that may put a person in danger.again,the aggravating factor in each crime is materially the same.
thus,the new jersey crime of reckless aggravated assault,which requires recklessly causing serious bodily injury to another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,falls squarely within our opinion in knapik as a recklessness crime with two aggravating factors.reckless aggravated assault is a cimt 
because baptiste conviction was for a cimt the bia correctly determined that,together with his conviction,baptiste is removable as an alien convicted of two or more cimts pursuant to a a ii.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will grant the petition in part as it relates to the bia aggravated felony determination,deny the petition in part as it relates to the bia cimt determination,and remand the case to the bia for further proceedings.
we use the term aggravated assault throughout this opinion to refer to the crime defined at stat.ann.b west.
baptiste did not contest before the bia,and does not contest in his petition for review before this court,the ij conclusion that his conviction was for a cimt.
baptiste does not dispute that his conviction was for a crime for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.
section a alternatively defines a crime of violence as an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.a.however,the bia did not address this alternative statutory definition and so we similarly do not address it here.see li att y of the,cir.
the supreme court recently addressed the concept of using force in the related context of g.see voisine united states.section g prohibits any person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from possessing a firearm.id.at quoting g.the phrase misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is defined to include any misdemeanor committed against a domestic relation that necessarily involves the use of physical force.id.alteration in original emphasis added quoting a a.the question before the court was whether reckless assaults fell within that definition.id.at.in answe
