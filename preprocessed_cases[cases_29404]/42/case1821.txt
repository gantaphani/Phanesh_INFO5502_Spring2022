roman and juan defendants pleaded guilty in in unrelated cases to illegal reentry after deportation,in violation of.in this consolidated appeal,they primarily contend their sentencing guidelines enhancements,imposed as a result of their prior convictions,are improper in the light of united states booker,d holding,inter alia,sixth amendment right to jury trial requires a ny fact other than a prior conviction necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.they also contend the district courts application of the version of the guidelines constituted an ex post facto violation and b provisions are unconstitutional,in the light of apprendi new jersey,d.
resentencing is required.but,under the advisory guidelines regime,the new sentences can conceivably be the same as those being vacated.convictions affirmed sentences vacated remanded for resentencing.
in separate cases before different district judges,rodarte and ramirez pleaded guilty in,without written plea agreements,to illegal reentry after deportation.rodarte had been deported in,after being convicted of transporting illegal aliens,in violation of a b ramirez,in,after being convicted,inter alia,of harboring illegal aliens,in violation of a c collectively,either prior convictions or prior offenses.
for defendants sentencing in,the presentence investigation report psr for each used the version of the guidelines and,for those prior convictions,recommended a enhancement,pursuant to b a vii applicable i f the defendant previously was deported,or unlawfully remained in the united states,after a conviction for a felony that is an alien smuggling offense.rodarte recommended guidelines sentencing range was to months ramirez,to months.
defendants filed similar objections to the psr,contending,inter alia,the enhancement was improper under the categorical approach,first articulated in taylor united states,d.that approach limits a sentencing court determination of whether a prior offense qualifies for a sentencing enhancement to the elements of the offense,rather than the facts underlying the conviction.at the time,this contention as ramirez recognized in district court was contrary to united states,cir rejecting the categorical approach for purposes of applying the enhancement under b a vii.is discussed infra.accordingly,they maintained,inter alia the version of the guidelines guidelines was in effect at the time of their offenses the guidelines restricted the enhancement only to those prior offenses committed for profit the statutes under which they received their prior convictions did not contain a committed for profit element the version guidelines,however,applied the enhancement to prior offenses,the committed for profit element having been removed and,therefore,the guidelines should apply because use of the guidelines constituted an ex post facto violation.
defendants separate sentencing hearings in were conducted prior to blakely washington,d o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt quoting apprendi,at,and booker,at.inter alia,extending blakely to the guidelines.their ex post facto objections were overruled.
at rodarte sentencing,the district judge stated the amendment to the guidelines,which removed the committed for profit element,was simply for clarification and did not change the underlying guideline.at ramirez sentencing,another district judge stated that,particularly in the light of ramirez offense reports,the increase was appropriate under either the or guidelines.at each sentencing,the district judge relied on underlying offense reports for the prior convictions to find the offenses were committed for profit.it appears the district judges made the committed for profit finding because the guidelines commentary,explaining the amendment to the guidelines,states the new definition for alien smuggling offense generally is consistent with the guideline previous terminology of alien smuggling offense committed for profit,and results in a level increase only for the most serious of such offenses.app,amend.at.
rodarte and ramirez were respectively sentenced,inter alia,to and months imprisonment for their convictions.for rodarte,an consecutive sentence for revocation of supervised release was also imposed,resulting in a total sentence.
booker was decided while these consolidated appeals were pending in our court.therefore,they were held pending a decision in united states.cir,cert.denied,d,on remand from the supreme court for further consideration in the light of booker.was decided,however,without providing guidance on whether booker abrogated our court holding in.because the parties initial briefs were filed,they were directed to submit supplemental briefs,addressing the implications of booker on.that issue is addressed before turning,inter alia,to the ex post facto issue.
before considering whether,in the light of booker,the enhancements were erroneously imposed,we must address whether such error was preserved.as discussed below,that error was not preserved.therefore,only review is accorded defendants booker issue.
in their supplemental briefs,consistent with their reliance on blakely in their initial briefs,defendants primarily contend they should be resentenced in the light of booker because the district courts finding their prior offenses were committed for profit constituted sixth amendment error.the government maintains defendants objections at sentencing were insufficient to preserve booker error.although rodarte and ramirez acknowledge their objections in district court for this issue mentioned neither the sixth amendment nor apprendi,they contend their ex post facto objections adequately preserved booker error.
in order to preserve booker error for,as here,a sentence,a defendant need not explicitly cite apprendi,blakely,or the sixth amendment.see united states akpan,cir.if a defendant voices an objection sufficient to apprise the sentencing court that he is raising a constitutional claim with respect to judicial in the sentencing process,the error is preserved.united states,cir emphasis added citing united states olis,cir.the objection,however,should be couched in terms that facts used to enhance the sentence were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.see akpan,at finding one defendant,who had objected on the ground the sentencing fact had not been proven at trial,had preserved booker error,but finding the other defendant,who did not couch his arguments in the same terms,did not preserve such error.
in objecting,rodarte claimed to look beyond evidence would not fall under the categorical approach as espoused by the fifth circuit and the supreme court and to adhere to that approach would create uniformity in the system,and avoid at sentencing.earlier,he had stated t here were no jury instructions to be available to make the determination for the prior offenses.
ramirez objection highlighted textual similarities between guidelines and the statute at issue in taylor he then maintained t he court should not authorize on conduct that is very remote absent some clear unambiguous indication from the sentencing commission.
contrary to defendants contentions,citing to taylor does not place a sentencing court on sufficient notice that the objection raises a constitutional violation.in addressing the narrow issue of whether the sentencing court in applying e must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,or whether the court may consider other evidence concerning the defendant prior crimes,at,taylor focused primarily on the statute plain language and legislative history.id.at.at the conclusion of its analysis,while discussing the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach,id.at,taylor asked whether,i f a sentencing court were to conclude,from its own review of the record,that the defendant actually committed a generic burglary,the d
