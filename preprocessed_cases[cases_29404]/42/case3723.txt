the opinion filed on february,is hereby amended.with the filing of the amended opinion,the panel has voted to grant respondent motion to amend in part.the time for filing petitions for rehearing has now expired.the mandate in shall issue forthwith.the panel retains jurisdiction over.
petitioner navin sinha and his wife,petitioner priti praveena singh,are ethnic indians and citizens of fiji.in,sinha submitted an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat for himself and,derivatively,his wife singh the immigration judge ij denied all relief,and the board of immigration appeals bia adopted and affirmed that decision.petitioners appear before this court to challenge the bia dismissal of their appeal,and also to contest the bia denial of their motion to reopen,based on changed country conditions.we grant the petition for review on the removal order and order the motion to reopen held in abeyance.
background 
sinha claims for asylum and for withholding of removal are based upon his alleged past persecution and his fear of future persecution on account of his ethnicity as an he also seeks relief under the cat because he fears being tortured if he is returned to fiji.
as sinha testimony and evidence show,over the past twenty years fiji ethnic indian minority has been treated harshly and,at times,violently by the native fijian majority.there has been longstanding tension between the two groups,exacerbated by an uneven distribution of power and wealth.the ethnic indian minority whom we call have controlled most of the country private businesses,while the native fijian majority whom we call native fijians have maintained a monopoly on landownership and have largely controlled the military and the national government.in and again in,racial tensions culminated in coups in which ethnic fijians,backed by the military,ousted sitting governments and took power.both coups occasioned widespread popular violence against individuals of ethnicity.we have recognized the severe mistreatment have suffered in a number of previous cases.see gafoor ins,cir see also narayan ashcroft,cir singh ins,cir.
sinha testified to four separate incidents of mistreatment that he personally experienced,which he claims cumulatively constitute past persecution or,in the alternative,contribute to his showing of a fear of future persecution.
first,in,when sinha was seventeen years old,a group of native fijians approached him and his friend after soccer practice.the native fijians accused sinha and his friend of cursing at them and proceeded to beat them,causing sinha face to bleed and giving him a black eye.
second,in may after the coup in which supremacist george speight deposed the country first prime minister and attempted to take power apartment was stoned by a native fijian mob.the mob also destroyed petitioners car,smashing all the windows,ripping the seats,stealing the stereo,and vandalizing the dashboard with a knife.sinha testified that the apartments of other residents on his block were also stoned.
third,at one morning in june,two native fijians broke into petitioners apartment while they were sleeping.one of the burglars held a knife to sinha throat and restrained his wife,while the other went through their drawers,ultimately stealing in cash and jewelry.as the burglars left the apartment,they shouted that petitioners should go back to india.although sinha reported the incident to the police,the police officers with whom he spoke told him that nothing was going to be done because it was just a formality to take a report.the police officers,native fijians,also told sinha that he and singh were not supposed to be in fiji anyway and that they had no legal rights.later on,when sinha went to the police station to follow up on the matter,an officer told him that the station had lost the report.
fourth and finally,in september,sinha was attacked and robbed by three native fijian men as he was walking toward a bus stop,having just left the bank where he cashed his paycheck.during the attack,the native fijians called sinha an indian dog and berated him with the slogan,fiji is for fijians only.sinha sustained injuries on his face and back from the beating,and he required medical care as a result.sinha reported the incident to the police,but,as far as he is aware,no investigation was ever conducted.
sinha also testified that,in addition to the incidents he personally experienced,his wife and several other family members and friends have been attacked and harassed by native fijians.in particular,in august,sinha wife,singh,was confronted by five native fijian youths who were members of a gang called the boys.according to sinha testimony,the boys formed their gang after the may coup,and their goal was to shine fiji by ridding it of its indian minority population.the youths yelled racial slurs at singh and chased her down the street as she was leaving the local grocery store.additionally,sinha testified that his mother and uncles have been forced out of their leaseholds by native landowners.
in october,petitioners were admitted to the united states on tourist visas.before the expiration of those visas,sinha submitted an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat,seeking derivative relief for his wife.on june,sinha and singh were served with a notice to appear,and removal proceedings commenced.at their merits hearing on june,the ij made no adverse credibility finding,but determined that sinha account of his experiences in fiji did not demonstrate past persecution or support a fear of future persecution.the ij therefore denied sinha application for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij also denied relief under the cat.on appeal,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision.petitioners timely filed a petition for review with this court.
while that petition for review was pending,in december,fiji experienced yet another coup.in january,petitioners filed a motion to reopen with the bia,contending that the coup and resulting political instability in fiji represented a material change in country conditions sufficient to merit reopening their removal proceedings under c ii.the bia denied the motion to reopen.petitioners filed a timely petition for review of that decision with this court,which we consolidated with their pending petition for review.
ii.analysis 
asylum and withholding of removal 
we consider first whether the ij and bia erred in determining that sinha was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.because the bia adopt ed and affirm ed the ij decision without adding any commentary of its own,we treat the ij decision as that of the bia.see ins,cir.in reviewing the ij findings of fact underlying his decision that sinha did not establish past persecution,we apply the substantial evidence standard.see hoque ashcroft,cir.throughout,because the ij made no adverse credibility finding,we take sinha testimony as true.see vukmirovic ashcroft,cir.
the ninth circuit has defined persecution as the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ in race,religion or political opinion in a way regarded as offensive.fisher ins,cir en banc internal quotation marks and citation omitted.persecution is an extreme concept and does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.ghaly ins,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.to establish past persecution,an applicant must show an incident,or incidents,that rise to the level of persecution that is on account of one of the grounds and is committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.navas ins,cir.
here,the ij held that sinha failed to demonstrate that the harm he suffered between may and september was persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act ina.he gave one reason for that conclusion in what we will call the nexus finding,the ij found that sinha failed to show that the harm was on account of his race.the ij made no finding as to whether the government was unable or unwilling to control sinha attackers what we will call a government inability finding,or as to the severity of the harm sinha suffered what we will call a severity finding,presumably because the nexus finding alone,if proper,would be adequate to support the ij ultimate conclusion that sinha had not demonstrated eligibility for asylum.
petitioners submit that the ij nexus finding is unsupported by substantial evidence.we agree.the record compels the conclusion that the past harm sinha suffered was on account of his race.because the ij based his denial of asylum on an erroneous finding,and because he made no specific finding as to the government inability to control the attackers or the severity of the harm sinha suffered,the denial of asylum can not stand,but must be reconsidered by the agency on remand.
the ij nexus finding 
the ij held that in terms of what happened to this respondent,and the circumstances under which it happened,this court is far from convinced that it happened necessarily because of his race,religion,nationality,or ethnic group.rather,the ij concluded,the separate incidents about which sinha four concerning him and the one concerning his better characterized as manifestations of random violence.in the ij view,w hat this respondent describes are general incidents of criminality and random violence and lawlessness which occurred during and after the coup of c onditions of political upheaval which affect the populus as a whole are insufficient to establish an alien eligibility for asylum.
the ij characterization of the record is unsupported by substantial evidence.the violence about which sinha testified did not affect the populus as a whole.rather,individuals of ethnicity were the specific targets of the widespread violence.the ij acknowledged as much in the very next sentence of his decision after the one just quoted,stating,in this particular case,the specific segment of the population affected,for the most part,is the population of fiji.
sinha testimony presented specific evidence that his and his wife attackers had racially discriminatory that the ij mentioned in the fact section of his decision but ignored in his analysis.in all five of the specific incidents about which sinha testified,petitioners were attacked by ethnic fijians.of course,this fact does not in itself demonstrate that the attackers actions were racially motivated,but it does provide some circumstantial evidence of their motivation,particularly given the high level of racial tension during and after the coup of may,when most of these incidents occurred.see ins,d stating that petitioner must produce some evidence,direct or circumstantial,of his persecutor motive second emphasis added.sinha testified that the stoning of his home and the destruction of his car in may occurred in the context of widespread looting and violence targeted at.he also stated that there were a lot of living in those blocks,and not only i,but all of us were the victim s of the stoning.the evidence he submitted confirms that such attacks on did occur during this time.
further,during the nighttime burglary that occurred in june,sinha testified that t he native fijian burglars shouted on the ir way out of the apartment about us going back to india.we have held before that the use of ethnic slurs in the course of an attack amply establishes the connection between the acts of persecution and the petitioner ethnicity.baballah ashcroft,cir.the fact that the attackers were also evidently motivated by a desire to steal petitioners money and valuables does not undercut the role that racial animus played in their motivation.persecutors can have multiple motives.in a id case such as this one,so long as the petitioner shows that his attackers were motivated,at least in part,by a protected ground,that is sufficient to establish that the action was on account of a protected ground within the meaning of a a.borja ins,cir en banc internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also gafoor,at sinha testimony amply establishes that the burglars motivation was,at least in part,racial animus.
moreover,we have held that where members of an ethnic majority view an ethnic minority as economically powerful,and where that perceived economic inequality serves as a justification for acts of hatred or violence against the minority,their acts may be cognizable as persecution on account of race under the ina.sael ashcroft,cir.here,the record shows that are popularly believed to be better educated,more successful in business,and wealthier than ethnic fijians.that sinha ethnic fijian burglars may have targeted him in part because they believed he,as an,would likely have valuables to steal,does not mean that they did not single him out on account of his race.the burglars use of ethnic slurs demonstrates that they did.
as to the incident in september,when several fijian men attacked sinha as he was walking from the bank to a bus stop,sinha testified that his attackers used racial slurs while beating him they said something like you indian dog,what are you doing here,you should go back,you should go back to india.and fiji is for fijians only.again,the ij neglected to address the significance of these slurs in his nexus analysis.a reasonable decisionmaker would have concluded,in light of sinha attackers abusive language,that they were motivated at least in part by racial animus.
in addition,as to the incident in august when a gang of youths chased singh from a grocery store,sinha testified that the gang called themselves the boys not only because they did shine shoes,but also because it was a racial slogan just like shining the shoes,they will do it,they would shine fiji without the indians.he further testified that the group emerged mostly after may,and they create havoc in the cities.the ij ignored this evidence of racial motivation in his oral decision.instead,he flippantly professed confusion about why the gang was so called as to precisely what this gang consisted of,it is difficult to determine,except that the gang was composed,for the most part,of ethnic fijians and they were in fact boys.contrary to the ij mischaracterization of sinha testimony,there was substantial evidence that sinha closest family member,his wife,was targeted for mistreatment on ethnic grounds.
we have held that,in certain cases,harm to a petitioner close family members or associates may be relevant to assessing whether the petitioner suffered past persecution.see mashiri ashcroft,cir korablina ins,cir.we have also held that a petitioner fear of future persecution is weakened,even undercut,when family members living in the petitioner home country are not harmed.hakeem ins,cir.just as these rulings recognize that the circumstance of close relatives can be informative in determining whether an individual suffered past,or will suffer future,persecution,so it stands to reason that the circumstance that sinha him,an ethnic harassed on account of her race bolsters sinha argument that the attacks directed at him during the same time period were similarly motivated by sentiment.
in sum,in light of all the evidence,the ij conclusion that the incidents about which sinha testified were merely acts of random violence is unsupportable.what the ij described is not random violence,but violence with a distinct racial slant.while it is true that the existence of widespread civil unrest,even unrest with a racial element to it,is not by itself enough for a petitioner to meet the definition of a refugee,see lolong gonzales,cir en banc,it is also true that the existence of civil unrest does not undercut an individual claim of persecution based on incidents specific to him.see ndom ashcroft,cir.to suggest,as the ij did,that the violence directed against one individual is somehow less on account of his race because many other individuals of his ethnic group are also being targeted on account of their race is entirely illogical and has no support in the case law.we therefore hold that substantial evidence does not support the ij conclusion with respect to the nexus finding.
the ij failure to make a government inability finding 
turning to the second requirement for sinha had demonstrated that the fijian government was unwilling or unable t
