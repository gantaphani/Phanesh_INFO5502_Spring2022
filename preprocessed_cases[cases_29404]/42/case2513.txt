sabrije slakovíc and natasâ djedovíc are citizens of serbia and montenegro,one of the shards into which yugoslavia fractured following the collapse of communism in eastern europe.they seek asylum in the united states on behalf of themselves and their three dependent children.slakovíc was drafted,went into hiding to avoid military service,was caught,and deserted after nine days he contends that if returned he would be persecuted because of this desertion and his opposition to the use of force against fellow muslims.djedovíc,a christian,contends that she would be persecuted because of her marriage to slakovíc many residents of pêcurice,where they lived together in montenegro,adamantly oppose marriage across religious lines.slakovíc and djedovíc sought other forms of relief,but because they proposed to enter the united states under a program only a grant of asylum would entitle them to remain.see wigglesworth ins,cir.
slakovíc was drafted in may,during the kosovo war.serbian forces were removing ethnic albanians from kosovo.the european union and the united states opposed this,and in march nato began military activities against serbia.hostilities lasted until june,when slobodan milôsevíc gave up the fight and united nations peacekeepers separated the serbian and albanian combatants.the conflict had ethnic rather than religious roots,but about of ethnic albanians are moslem,and slakovíc did not want to take up arms against his.he contends,moreover,that during his brief period of training he heard some other soldiers relish the prospect of killing moslems.he does not maintain,however,that the military deprived him of weapons or planned to use him or other moslems as cannon fodder,as serbian forces sometimes had done in the bosnian conflict.the immigration judge acknowledged that exposing adherents of one religion to greater risks of injury in combat than members of another would be a form of persecution.see,miljkovic ins,cir begzatowski ins,cir.being trained to engage in atrocities also could be persecution,see matter of,i n,bia,but slakovíc does not contend that this was his unit objective.
the immigration judge,who believed slakovíc testimony,concluded that the events he described do not amount to persecution the board of immigration appeals agreed.substantial evidence supports that decision.all slakovíc faced was military conscription,which is not a form of persecution,see tesfu ashcroft,cir mojsilovic ins,cir,and comments by other soldiers not directed against him personally.see mitev ins,cir.even if we assume that slakovíc would be imprisoned on return for his desertion,that is not persecution unless the draft and military service are persecution.slakovíc does not contend that moslem deserters are treated worse than christian deserters.indeed,slakovíc is unlikely to be punished at all.milôsevíc,who had been put on trial in an international criminal court,died earlier this month in his successors announced an amnesty that appears to cover slakovíc.mojsilovic,at.
djedovíc testified that she and her children had been disowned by her parents and shunned by their neighbors in pêcurice.people she met in the street sometimes called her ugly words and spat in her direction.again the immigration judge believed this testimony again he found that this does not amount to persecution.shunning is private activity rather than anything sponsored,approved,or enforced by the state.djedovíc does not contend that she or her children were in physical danger the family lived in pêcurice for six years without incident beyond the personal unpleasantness,and slakovíc was gainfully employed.djedovíc,who remained home to care for the children,did not testify that she was in the job market and had been unable to find work.the agency decision that these events do not justify asylum is supported by substantial evidence and does not rest on any legal error.
slakovíc and djedovíc maintain,however,that the record is incomplete,and they contend that the immigration judge violated the constitution by refusing to accept telephonic testimony by bernd fischer,professor of balkan history at indiana university.reliance on the due process clause is not only unnecessary but also inappropriate,as we pointed out in rehman gonzales,cir.statutory arguments take precedence over constitutional ones,and because every alien must have a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on the alien own behalf,b b,the only question we need consider is whether that reasonable opportunity was afforded.it is difficult to imagine how an immigration judge could provide the reasonable opportunity to present evidence required by statute,yet still violate the due process clause.
two business days before the hearing,counsel filed a motion asking the immigration judge to take fischer evidence by telephone.the judge denied this motion on the date set for the hearing,informing the parties that he preferred either live testimony or written reports from expert witnesses.the judge also declined to postpone the hearing,a step that would have inconvenienced other participants and disrupted the immigration court schedule and thus affected the hearing dates for other aliens.he invited counsel to furnish professor fischer evidence in writing after the oral testimony had been concluded.counsel did not accept this invitation.instead of filing an expert report while the record remained open,he furnished only a statement from fischer summarizing his qualifications and listing topics he would have addressed,such as t he development of modern extreme nationalism in through the milosevic years.the impact of nationalist acculturation on moslems.
counsel asserts that he was surprised when the immigration judge denied his motion other judges and this judge on other occasions had accepted evidence by phone,so why not this judge this time there is,however,an easy way to avoid surprise advance notice.regulations entitle each immigration court to establish procedures covering subjects not addressed by national rules.the immigration court branch in chicago,where this hearing occurred,requires motions to precede the hearing by at least days.see.notice gives the judge a chance to rule in advance,so that everyone can be prepared when the hearing begins or the court can rearrange its own schedule to make productive use of time should the hearing be rescheduled.the immigration court gave the aliens eight months notice of the hearing date the least they could have done in return was give two weeks notice of motions in limine.counsel for djedovíc and slakovíc does not offer any reason for ignoring this rule and therefore is in no position to complain that,when an adverse decision was made on the spot,he was unprepared.
this situation is not remotely like that in niam ashcroft,cir.the immigration judge in niam had promised to accept evidence by phone,then changed his mind during the hearing after learning that the expert witness was outside the united states.that not only surprised the alien lawyer,who had relied on the order allowing telephonic evidence,but also was arbitrary the immigration judge did not explain what difference it could have made that the other end of the line was in prague rather than hanover,new hampshire.at.nor is our situation governed by rodriguez galicia gonzales,cir,which held that a combination of errors including refusal to accept telephonic evidence made a hearing inadequate to permit reliable decision.
apart from issues of notice and surprise,there is nothing arbitrary about favoring live over remote testimony as every federal court does or favoring written reports from experts over phone connections.the norm in federal civil litigation is an expert written report plus live testimony in court,so that counsel can explore logical or empirical shortcomings in the expert analysis.expert testimony neither preceded nor followed by a written report may end up being little more than ipse dixit,which is unhelpful to the tribunal.an expert who supplies nothing but a bottom line supplies nothing of value to the judicial process.fertilizer exchange national bank,cir.see also,zenith elect
