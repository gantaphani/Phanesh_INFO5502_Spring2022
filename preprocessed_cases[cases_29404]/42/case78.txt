to borrow a phrase often attributed to a homespun philosopher,lawrence yogi berra,this case is déjà vu all over again.for a second time,fuad farouq atieh and his wife raniah appeal from a district court judgment affirming a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying raniah petition to grant fuad lawful permanent resident status.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
fuad atieh,a jordanian national,entered the united states on a visa in.he overstayed,and roughly a decade later on march,he was placed in removal proceedings by the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis.while those proceedings were pending,fuad married his first cousin,jamileh khudari a citizen,at a january ceremony in lowell,massachusetts.his new wife subsequently filed an i visa petition for an alien relative here,fuad.see a.the marriage quickly disintegrated fuad and jamileh divorced on december.not surprisingly,jamileh withdrew her i petition.
in august of,fuad married raniah,who was also a citizen.some two months later,raniah filed an i petition on fuad behalf.on march,uscis interviewed fuad and raniah in connection with that petition.fuad told the examining officer that his earlier marriage to jamileh had been arranged by the couple parents and that he had never been in love with her.he admitted,though,that he and his parents had hoped that he might acquire lawful permanent resident status through jamileh.
in may of,uscis issued a notice of intent to deny the i petition.see c.the notice cited the allegedly fraudulent nature of fuad first marriage as the impetus for uscis intended decision and invited the applicants to submit any additional evidence that they might have in support of their position.the atiehs responded by submitting several affidavits,including affidavits from jamileh,jamileh parents,fuad parents,and fuad himself.in his statement,fuad acknowledged that,prior to marrying jamileh,he had expressed a romantic interest in raniah and had contacted her parents to gain their approval,only to be rebuffed.
on december,uscis denied the i petition.it found,based on the record as a whole,that fuad marriage to jamileh was designed to evade the immigration laws.this decision was upheld by the bia,which concluded that the atiehs had failed to prove the bona fides of fuad first marriage.
the atiehs countered by attacking on two fronts.first,they sued in the federal district court,seeking to set aside the bia ukase second,they filed yet another i petition with uscis.the district court prudently held the atiehs suit in abeyance pending the agency adjudication of the new petition.
the atiehs achieved no better result the second time around.on march,they received notice of uscis intent to deny their latest petition.the notice explained that affidavits from various family members showed no compelling evidence that the marriage between fuad and jamileh was either bona fide or contracted in good faith.moreover,bank statements submitted by the atiehs showed little if any evidence of any comingling of marital funds between fuad and jamileh.although the atiehs objected to this notice,they proffered no additional evidence and uscis denied relief on may.the bia subsequently affirmed.undaunted,the atiehs filed an amended complaint in their district court suit.
the district court dissolved its earlier stay of proceedings and,in october of,granted the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted see atieh riordan,wl,at,see also.b.we vacated the order of dismissal on procedural grounds,without reaching the merits.see atieh riordan,cir.
remitted to the district court,the parties for summary judgment on the issue of whether the administrative record adequately supported the denial of i relief.the district court granted summary judgment in the government favor,thus affirming the bia final order see atieh riordan,wl,at.july.
ii.analysis 
under the apa,a reviewing court may set aside an agency decision if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law,such as if it is unsupported by substantial evidence.see river street donuts,llc napolitano,cir.this standard is quite narrow a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency,even if it disagrees with the agency conclusions.river street donuts,at.consequently,judicial review of agency decisions is highly deferential.id.if the agency decision is supported by any rational view of the record,a reviewing court must uphold it.see id.
because both the district court and this court are bound by the same standard of review,our review of the district court decision in an apa case is de novo.see royal siam chertoff,cir.thus,our review in this case is,in effect,direct review of the bia decision.
with the standard of review in place,we turn to the immigration and nationality act the act.under the act,an alien may achieve lawful permanent resident status if he qualifies as an immediate relative of a citizen.see b a i see also taing napolitano,cir.for this purpose,the term immediate relative includes children,parents,and spouses.see b a i.
to obtain the benefit of these provisions,an interested citizen must file an i petition with the attorney general on behalf of her immediate.see id.a a i.where the immediate is a spouse,the act provides for especially careful scrutiny of the petition.if the attorney general determines either that the alien entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws or that the alien attempted or conspired to do so,the alien will be rendered ineligible for lawful permanent resident status.see id.c.
here,moreover,yet another hurdle must be cleared.when an alien enters into a marriage after the government has initiated removal proceedings as fuad did the alien must carry the burden of demonstrating,by clear and convincing evidence,that he entered into the marriage in good faith.see id.e.
an agency finding regarding the bona fides of a marriage is normally regarded as a finding of fact.see agyei holder,cir krazoun ashcroft,cir.thus,such a finding is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.see agyei,at soeung holder,cir.this means that a court can not contravene the agency factfinding unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to reach a contrary conclusion.agyei,at.within this rubric,a credibility determination is a finding of fact and we will uphold such a finding so long as the agency articulate s specific and cogent reasons to support its view.ahmed holder,cir.
this brings us to the atiehs arguments on appeal.their asseverative array boils down to a plaint that the bia erred in concluding that fuad first marriage was fraudulent.specifically,they argue that the bia misconstrued certain evidence,ignored other evidence indicating that fuad first marriage was bona fide,and failed to consider the record in its entirety.we address these arguments as a seamless whole.
the bia relied heavily on the decision of uscis,which gave ample scrutiny to the record including the interviews with the atiehs and the various affidavits.several key facts led the agency to its conclusion that fuad first marriage was fraudulent.we enumerate some of those facts.
fuad married jamileh only after removal proceedings had been instituted against him.
he entered into that marriage notwithstanding a demonstrated romantic interest in raniah.
during his uscis interview in march of,fuad acknowledged not only that his parents had pressured him to marry jamileh but also that both he and his parents had hoped that the marriage would prove to be a vehicle for obtaining lawful permanent resident status.
fuad admitted that he had unsuccessfully pursued a romantic relationship with his present wife even before he married jamileh.
the bank statements and other data in the record showed little or no commingling of funds between fuad and jamileh during their marriage.
these facts,when viewed in concert,were sufficient to support uscis inference that fuad had never intended to have a lasting marriage with jamileh but,rather,had used his first marriage only as a contrivance to a
