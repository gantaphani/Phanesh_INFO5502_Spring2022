an immigration judge ij incorrectly advised george camacho garcia that his prior conviction was for an aggravated felony,and that he was therefore ineligible for relief from removal.hearing that advice,garcia waived his appeal to the board of immigration appeals bia.but the advice was wrong.as a result,garcia waiver of his right to appeal to the bia was not considered and intelligent,and the bia should have granted garcia motion for reconsideration.
garcia,a native and citizen of the philippines,became a lawful permanent resident in based on his marriage to a citizen.in,he pleaded guilty to four charges in california state court,including a violation of california penal code a,and was duly convicted.the corresponding count in the complaint alleged that george camacho garcia did willfully and unlawfully take money or personal property of a value exceeding four hundred dollars.garcia was sentenced to one year and four months in prison for that conviction.
in,the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice to appear,charging garcia with removability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony specifically a theft offense for which a sentence of at least one year was imposed.see a a iii a g.during an initial hearing,garcia heard a message explaining the removal process,his appellate rights,and his option to waive appeal.in an ensuing individual colloquy with the ij,garcia said that he wished to proceed in english,which was his best language,that he understood his rights,and that he wanted time to obtain a lawyer.the hearing was continued.at a subsequent hearing,garcia told the ij he would proceed pro se and again confirmed that english was his best language.garcia had some difficulty hearing the ij,who asked garcia to sit closer so he could hear.
at the second hearing,garcia filed written pleadings prepared with the assistance of his current counsel,arguing that he was not removable because his section a conviction was not a categorical aggravated felony.specifically,he maintained that section a was overbroad in two ways it criminalized both theft of labor and also forms of consensual but unlawful taking of property,such as false pretenses,neither of which is included in the generic definition of theft.after dhs filed copies of the abstract of judgment and complaint from his criminal case,the ij concluded that garcia section a conviction was an aggravated felony.looking to the complaint,the ij held that the conviction was for taking the money or personal property as such,rather than theft of labor,but did not address garcia argument regarding consensual but unlawful taking of property.garcia was ordered removed.
the ij then explained that garcia,who remained unrepresented,had the right to appeal but could waive that right.garcia said he understood.when asked if he waived appeal,garcia responded i would say so i am not eligible for any relief the ij told him he was not,explaining that,despite garcia marriage to a citizen,he would need a waiver to adjust his status again,but,given his conviction,he was ineligible for any waiver.the ij then again confirmed that garcia understood his options regarding appeal.garcia said he did,and then stated three times that he agreed to waive his right to appeal 
garcia nevertheless filed a pro se notice of appeal with the bia,attaching,as his statement of reasons,a copy of his previously filed written pleadings and an argument that his conviction was not an aggravated felony.the bia dismissed the appeal,noting that garcia had waived it and holding that,as garcia had made no argument that the decision to waive appeal was not a knowing and intelligent one,the ij decision was administratively final upon waiver.the case thus was not properly before it,the bia asserted.
garcia,now represented by counsel,filed a short motion to reconsider,arguing that at the time he waived appeal,he was confused,had a difficult time hearing the immigration judge,and did not make a knowing,intelligent,and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal.in an accompanying declaration,garcia stated that he was scared and confused during the hearing,english was not his first language,and he had a hard time hearing the ij.he also said that he did not believe his conviction was categorically an aggravated felony,and that he would therefore like to argue for his eligibility for cancellation of removal.
the bia issued an opinion declining to grant reconsideration.it noted that,although it ordinarily does not have jurisdiction over motions when it has not assumed initial jurisdiction over a case,it would consider the motion to reconsider because it challenge d the jurisdictional determination in this case.the bia went on to reject as inconsistent with the record the assertions in garcia declaration regarding the circumstances of the hearing,noting that he had told the ij that he wanted to proceed in english,as it was his best language that the ij had explained garcia appellate rights to him that garcia had confirmed he had listened and understood that the ij had told garcia to sit closer to address his hearing difficulty and that,at the end of the proceeding,garcia had unequivocally stated his intent to waive appeal.the upshot,the bia concluded,was this despite the respondent generalized assertions that he was in some manner confused about his proceedings,the record reflects that he understood he had a right to appeal,but made a knowing and voluntary waiver of this right.whether the ij had given proper advice when he advised garcia that he was ineligible for relief from removal because of his theft conviction was not addressed in the bia opinion.
garcia timely petitioned for review of the bia reconsideration decision.
we review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.tadevosyan holder,cir.we will reverse such a denial if it is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.yepremyan holder,cir quoting singh,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the bia has held that,once the parties waive appeal,it lacks jurisdiction if the waiver is knowingly and intelligently made.in re rodriguez diaz,bia citing united states mendoza lopez,d as dhs recognizes,it bears the burden to establish a valid waiver by clear and convincing evidence.see gomez,at.
where the record contains an inference that the petitioner is eligible for relief from deportation,but the ij fails to advise the alien of this possibility and give him the opportunity to develop the issue,we do not regard an alien waiver of his right to appeal his deportation order as considered and intelligent.united states pallares galan,cir quoting united states muro inclan,cir some internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the ij advised garcia that he was not eligible for any relief because his grand theft conviction was an aggravated felony that advice was incorrect.
as an initial matter,garcia did sufficiently exhaust this argument.we are generally barred,for lack of jurisdiction,from reaching the merits of a legal claim not presented in administrative proceedings below.barron ashcroft,cir.however,w e do not employ the exhaustion doctrine in a formalistic manner.ren holder,cir quoting figueroa mukasey,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a petitioner can not satisfy the exhaustion requirement by making a general challenge to the ij decision,but also need not raise the precise argument below.vizcarra ayala mukasey,cir quoting zara ashcroft,cir.
here,garcia brief motion to reconsider and accompanying declaration argued that garcia did not make a knowing,intelligent,and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal,reiterated the argument made before the ij and in the notice of appeal that the conviction was not an aggravated felony,and asserted that,therefore,garcia was potentially eligible for relief from removal.garcia did not spell out in so many words that his waiver should be deemed invalid because the ij incorrectly concluded that his conviction was an aggravated felony and so failed to advise him of potential relief from removal.but garcia did articulate each essential part of the contention he now raises.as a result,that issue was before the bia such that it had the opportunity to correct its error.figueroa,at.our precedent requires nothing more.id.brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
garcia declaration indicated that,absent an aggravated felony,he was potentially eligible for cancellation of removal,while on appeal garcia has argued that,absent an aggravated felony,he was potentially eligible to readjust his status with an h b waiver.but that difference is immaterial for present purposes.dhs has made no argument,apart from its contention that his conviction was an aggravated felony,as to the merits of either form of relief,nor has it suggested that the difference between them should matter for exhaustion purposes.indeed,garcia may have been eligible for both 
in sum,garcia sufficiently exhausted the issue we decide that his waiver was invalid because the ij incorrectly advised him that his conviction was an aggravated felony and that,for that reason,he was ineligible for relief from removal.
on the merits,we agree with garcia that his conviction was not an aggravated felony.in making a determination as to whether a prior conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony for federal deportation purposes,we employ the analytical model set forth in taylor united states,d.pallares galan,at.
under taylor categorical approach,the issue is not whether the actual conduct constituted an aggravated felony,but whether the full range of conduct encompassed by the state statute constitutes an aggravated felony,and we look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense to make this determination.if we determine that the statute which the defendant was found to have violated is broader in scope than the federal provision that the state statute proscribes not only conduct that would constitute an aggravated felony but also conduct that would not then the state conviction may not be used,except under a modified categorical approach.under the modified categorical approach,the conviction may be used only if the record contains documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate conviction.
id.brackets,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
as was clear at the time of garcia hearing,a conviction under california penal code a is not categorically an aggravated felony because,as garcia argues,section a is doubly overbroad first,it permits a conviction for theft of labor,while the generic definition of theft does not.see united states espinoza cano,cir.second,section a incorporates the general definition of theft,which is found at california penal code a an individual may be convicted of theft under section a,and therefore grand theft under section a,even if the victim consented to transfer his property.for example,the california statutes cover deprivation of property by false pretenses,which does not constitute theft under the generic definition.see carrillo jaime holder,cir.under that definition,theft is a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership,even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.id.at alterations in original emphasis added quoting corona sanchez,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the ij nevertheless found that the conviction was an aggravated felony,applying the modified categorical approach.in doing so,he addressed only the first type of overbreadth,not whether the conviction was for a consensual or taking.
the modified categorical approach does not establish that garcia was convicted of a taking.in the context of a guilty plea,the modified categorical approach inquires whether a guilty plea to an offense defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense.alvarado holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.nothing in the conviction documents in the record namely,the abstract of judgment and criminal complaint establishes that garcia conviction was for grand theft 
the complaint charged that garcia did willfully and unlawfully take money or personal property.as the california supreme court recently reiterated,in the california legislature consolidated the crimes previously known as larceny,false pretenses,and embezzlement,inherited from english common and statutory law,into what is now section a.people williams,cal th,d.one distinction among these crimes was that larceny required a trespassory taking,which is a taking without the property owner consent,while false pretenses,for example,involves the consensual transfer of possession as well as title of property.id.at,d,emphases omitted see also carrillo jaime,at.this change affected the wording of charging documents 
the purpose of the consolidation was to remove the technicalities that existed in the pleading and proof of these crimes at common law.indictments and informations charging the crime of theft can now simply allege an unlawful taking.juries need no longer be concerned with the technical differences between the several types of theft,and can return a general verdict of guilty if they find that an unlawful taking has been proved the elements of the several types of theft included within section have not been changed,however,and a judgment of conviction of theft,based on a general verdict of guilty,can be sustained only if the evidence discloses the elements of one of the consolidated offenses.
williams,cal th at,d,emphasis added quoting people ashley,cal d.in other words,the allegation in the complaint in this case,that garcia did unlawfully take property,charges theft in violation of section a,without further indicating which of the several types of theft is specifically charged.id.thus,the allegations in the complaint do not establish that garcia was charged and convicted of theft,namely larceny,rather than consensual but unlawful taking of property,such as by false pretenses.
united states rivera,cir,is not to the contrary.in rivera,we concluded that the defendant plea to a charge that he did unlawfully steal take and carry away personal property narrowed the conviction to the generic limits,namely a taking.id.at.although the charge in rivera did not expressly indicate that the theft was,its language closely tracked the portion of section a that reflects the crime of larceny the felonious stealing,taking,carrying,leading,or driving away of the personal property of another.williams,cal th at,d.here,by contrast,the charging language is fully consistent with theories of guilt under section a.see id.at,d.
dhs points to language in a different count of the complaint,of which garcia was not convicted,charging garcia with using the same victim personally identifying information without her authorization.the most likely reading of the complaint,dhs suggests,is that the two counts are based upon the same conduct and that,therefore,the theft was without consent.that possible inference,however,is insufficient to establish that garcia was convicted of generic theft.alvarado,at.
for one thing,the taking of different property from the same victim could be covered in a single complaint.for another,garcia was not convicted of the without authorization count,a circumstance that could indicate he was unwilling to plead guilty to taking the property without authorization or that the prosecution was not confident it could prove that element.so,although one perhaps could infer that the two counts arose from the same conduct,such an inference is in no way compelled.as we held in alvarado,at,a bare inference of this sort does not satisfy the modified categorical approach.
in sum,the ij believed,incorrectly,that garcia conviction constituted a n aggravated felony,and so erred when he told garcia that no relief was available for that reason.pallares galan,at.in light of the ij error,garcia waiver of his right to appeal was not considered and intelligent.id.internal quotation marks omitted.it follows that the bia denial of the motion to reconsider was contrary to law and so an abuse of discretion.yepremyan,at
