opinion of the court 
zeljko paripovic paripovic petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the denial by an immigration judge ij of his application for asylum and withholding of deportation.we deny the petition except as to the designation of croatia as the alternate country for deportation.in so doing,we decide what is for us an issue of first meaning of last habitually resided under a for a stateless individual.
facts and procedural history 
paripovic is an ethnic serb born in croatia in.although he holds a birth certificate naming croatia as his birthplace,paripovic conceded before the ij that he was rendered stateless by the dissolution of the former yugoslavia in,and much of the parties dispute is centered on whether his claims should be analyzed with croatia or serbia as the frame of reference 
turning first to his claims related to persecution in croatia paripovic testified before the ij that in october he was caught in a police of serbian men and boys.the police detained him in a camp for one month,where he and others were torture d,harassed,and beaten.approximately eleven months later,croatian soldiers came to paripovic village and told the serbs to leave the country.fearing that the ruling government was in the process of carrying out the objective of making the country pure croatian,paripovic and his parents fled to serbia in august.at some point during their flight,paripovic and his mother were separated from his father.they never saw nor heard from him again.
in serbia,paripovic and his mother lived in an old schoolhouse that served as part of a refugee camp.although conditions were poor,there is no indication that paripovic was beaten,tortured,or threatened.he was free to leave the camp at any time,but he had no place to go.when military police began recruiting refugees to fight in croatia,he fled serbia in december to avoid being conscripted.
paripovic entered the united states at puerto rico without inspection in january.within days he was placed in deportation proceedings.conceding deportability,paripovic filed an application for asylum and withholding of deportation.the ij denied his application,and paripovic appealed to the bia.without discussing the merits of the appeal,the bia remanded the matter to the immigration court in december because portions of the transcript were missing or never made.
on remand,paripovic case was transferred to the immigration court in newark,new jersey.at a hearing in april,the ij decided,with paripovic consent,to examine his claims anew.the ij set a hearing date for june,but on that date paripovic requested a continuance.the ij granted it and advised paripovic that if he intended to call a witness to testify about current conditions in croatia and serbia,that witness should be an expert.the case was continued several times more,ultimately being heard in january.
at that hearing,paripovic asked again for an adjournment of the proceedings because the expert witness he intended to call was in bosnia.the ij denied the request.turning to the merits,the ij found that paripovic was generally credible.the ij agreed with paripovic that the treatment of serbs in croatia was discriminatory and in many cases involved acts of persecution.this credibility finding notwithstanding,the ij determined that paripovic was not a refugee.in making this determination,because paripovic was a stateless individual,the ij inquired about the country in which he had last habitually resided to determine whether he would face persecution in that location,a a,and determined that serbia was that country.
because paripovic objection to being returned to serbia was that he might be drafted to fight in a civil war and there was no longer ongoing conflict,his objection was no longer valid to the ij,who concluded that paripovic had no legitimate fear of persecution or torture in serbia.the ij issued a deportation order designating serbia as the primary deportation country and croatia as the alternate 
the bia dismissed paripovic appeal in september.it concluded that his contention that the ij erred in not granting the continuance was without merit as the expert witness could have provided testimony in the form of an affidavit,and it otherwise adopted the ij decision.
ii.standard of review 
at the time paripovic petition for review which relates to deportation proceedings begun prior to april,was filed,our jurisdiction arose from the former immigration and nationality act ina a and was governed by the transitional rules of c of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.on may,congress enacted the real id act,which provides,inter alia,that a petition for review filed under former section a of the immigration and nationality act shall be treated as if it had been filed as a petition for review under,as amended by this section.real id act d,stat.may.thus,our jurisdiction now arises under,as amended by the real id act.elia gonzales,wl at cir.july.
in a slightly different context,we have concluded that the determination of habitual residence is a mixed question of law and fact.see delvoye lee,cir determining a child habitual residence under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction by reviewing the district court conclusion as a mixed question of law and fact.although in najjar ashcroft,cir,the court reviewed the agency last habitual residence determination based on the substantial evidence standard,no question of statutory interpretation was presented and the dispute was strictly based on the factual findings.because the last habitual residence issue can be resolved in our case only by both determining the facts of the case and deciding what the applicable law means,we review the determination under a mixed standard of review.review of the bia legal conclusions is de novo,with appropriate deference to the agency interpretation of the underlying statute in accordance with administrative law principles.abdulai ashcroft,cir regarding factual determinations,we affirm findings of fact supported by substantial evidence.abdille ashcroft,cir.we are thus bound by the administrative findings of fact unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to arrive at a contrary conclusion.b b see also abdille,at.
iii.analysis 
a.last habitual residence 
a grant of asylum allows an alien to stay in the united states.abdulai,at.subject to numerous exceptions not implicated in this case,the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien he determines to be a refugee.id.internal citation omitted.a refugee is defined as 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality or,in the case of a person having no nationality,is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided,and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
a emphasis added.paripovic argued the ij paripovic is a stateless individual.he strenuously argues that the ij should have determined that he last habitually resided in croatia.
the ij reasoned 
in this case the court determines that the respondent last habitually resided in serbia.he resided in serbia from august of to december of.the immigration and nationality act defines the concept of residence and it states the term residence means the place of general abode the place of general abode of a person means his principal,actual dwelling place in fact,without regard to intent.particularly relevant there in this definition is the issue of intent.the respondent may well not have intended to stay in a refugee camp his whole life,but the court feels that the amount of time he spent there makes it fairly clear that his last place of habitual residence was serbia.
under chevron,we must determine whether the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,and,if so,whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.see also ok
