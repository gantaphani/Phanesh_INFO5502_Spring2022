harold dinnall petitions for review of an order of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement bice,department of homeland security dhs,reinstating his prior order of deportation and ordering his removal under section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a,enacted as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira dinnall argues that the reinstatement provision is impermissibly retroactive.we agree.for the reasons that follow,we will grant the petition for review and vacate reinstatement of the deportation order.
background 
dinnall is a native and citizen of jamaica who entered the united states in the.it is unclear if he entered illegally or on a visitor visa,but the distinction is irrelevant to our resolution of the issues raised in this appeal.
after dinnall was pulled over for a traffic violation,on august,the immigration and naturalization service ins took him into custody and issued an order to show cause osc,charging him with being deportable from the united states pursuant to former section a of the ina.that section pertains to aliens who entered the united states without immigration inspection.the ins subsequently released dinnall from custody on a bond.on september,the ins sent dinnall a hearing notification letter,informing him that he was scheduled for a hearing date before an immigration judge on october.dinnall contends that he never received the letter as it was sent to the wrong address.there is record support for that contention dinnall failed to appear at his october,hearing,and the ij ordered him deported in absentia.the ins issued a warrant of deportation on november.
that warrant was not served before dinnall left the united states and went to jamaica on january.under the regulations then in effect,dinnall was considered to have.see any alien who has departed from the united states while an order of deportation is outstanding shall be considered to have been deported in pursuance of law.because dinnall left under an order of deportation,he could not legally reenter the united states for a period of five years.however,he returned to the united states two days after he left.
in,dinnall was again taken into custody by the ins,and the ins issued another osc.that osc charged him with illegally the united states following deportation.dinnall posted a bond 
in january,dinnall married a united states citizen,and he now has at least one child who is also a united states citizen in may,the bice again took dinnall into custody,and on may,the bice reinstated dinnall deportation order,pursuant to a.a warrant of removal was issued on the same date.as of the date this case was argued,dinnall remained in custody at york county prison.
dinnall filed a petition for review and a motion to stay deportation with this court on may,and on june,we ordered dinnall deportation stayed pending a decision on his petition for review to address his contention that the reinstatement provision is impermissibly retroactive as applied to him 
dinnall petition presents a legal question,and our review is therefore de novo the agency views garner no special deference.see ins cyr,d we only defer to agency interpretations of statutes that,applying the normal tools of statutory construction,are ambiguous.because a statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed under our precedent to be unambiguously prospective,there is,for chevron purposes,no ambiguity in such a statute for an agency to resolve.citations and quotations marks omitted see also arevalo ashcroft,cir explaining that courts,rather than agencies,are best equipped to make the constitutionally tinged judgment calls inherent in retroactivity determinations sarmiento cisneros united states attorney general,cir same ashcroft,cir same bejjani ins,cir same.
ii.discussion 
dinnall sole argument on appeal is that ina a may not be applied retroactively to aliens who reentered the united states prior to iirira effective date because the statute impairs certain rights that these aliens possessed prior to that time 
retroactivity 
congress may undoubtedly enact statutes that operate retroactively.see landgraf usi film,d.however,since retroactive legislation can potentially alter the consequences of actions already taken,we must presume that congress intends legislation to only act prospectively.id.at.
in landgraf,the supreme court established guidelines for determining whether a statute enacted after a particular event can alter the legal consequences of that event.the result is a inquiry that demands a commonsense,functional judgment and should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.martin hadix,d internal quotations marks omitted.
we must first determine if congress has declared whether the statute should have retroactive effect.landgraf,at.in answering this question,courts should employ the customary rules of statutory construction,assaying the language of the statute itself and then considering its structure and purpose.arevalo,at.if the statute itself does not sufficiently denote the temporal reach of its provisions,there is a presumption against statutory retroactivity,and further inquiry should follow.ponnapula ashcroft,cir.
in conducting this further inquiry,we must consider whether retroactive application of the statute would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.landgraf,at.accord cyr,at.a statute has retroactive effect when it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.if such ramifications loom,the default rule is that the statute should not be construed to regulate the past conduct.hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d.
however,the mere fact that a new statute has some retroactive effect does not automatically resolve step two of the landgraf inquiry.a new law is not impermissibly retroactive simply because it has implications for completed events.a pplication of new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations.landgraf,at.rather,the statute temporal reach becomes unacceptable only when its retroactive application would significantly impair existing rights and thereby disappoint legitimate expectations.motors romein,d.
although our inquiry considers disappointed expectations,we have not required the party opposing application of an amendment to establish actual reliance on the prior statute.see ponnapula,at.indeed,any requirement of a quantum of evidence regarding the subjective intent of the party seeking to avoid retroactive application is in tension with the language of presumption in landgraf and its progeny and incorrectly focuses attention on the particular facts and circumstances of the party before the court.id.at.the likelihood that the party before the court did or did not in fact rely on the prior state of the law is not germane to the question of retroactivity.rather,courts are to concentrate on the group to whose conduct the statute is addressed.id.at.
here,the government reinstated the in absentia deportation order against dinnall under ina a.this section states 
reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally reentering 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter,and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
a.this statute was enacted on september,as part of iirira,and had an effective date of april.
the previous reinstatement statute,f,ina f repealed,stated 
unlawful reentry 
should the attorney general find that any alien has unlawfully reentered the united states after having previously departed or been deported pursuant to an order of deportation,whether before or after june,on any ground described in any of the paragraphs enumerated in subsection e of this section covering deportation based on various enumerated reasons including commission of alien smuggling and other criminal offenses,the previous order of deportation shall be deemed to be reinstated from its original date and such alien shall be deported under such previous order at any time subsequent to such reentry.for the purposes of subsection e of this section the date on which the finding is made that such reinstatement is appropriate shall be deemed the date of the final order of deportation.
the new reinstatement statute therefore differs from its predecessor in three important ways it applies to all prior removal,deportation,and exclusion orders,not just to certain grounds of deportation such as criminal offenses it prohibits reopening or review of the prior removal order and it prohibits any applications for relief.furthermore,the prior statute did not apply to aliens such as dinnall whose basis for deportation was solely their illegal entry.rather,under the prior statute,aliens who illegally reentered were entitled to a new deportation proceeding before again being deported.under the new statute,all aliens who illegally reenter the united states following their removal or deportation have their prior deportation orders summarily reinstated without any opportunity to attack their underlying deportation orders or to seek new forms of relief from removal or deportation.
moreover,the attorney general has promulgated a new procedure to implement the new reinstatement statute,and that is codified at.the new regulations delegate the attorney general reinstatement authority to immigration officers rather than immigration judges outside the course of formal removal proceedings.under the former regulation,an alien subject to a reinstatement order was entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge,who was charged with determining the identity of the alien,whether the alien had previously been deported,and whether the alien illegally reentered the united states.repealed.at the hearing before the ij,the alien could contest the charges and the evidence,present his or her own evidence,and apply for relief from deportation.the alien also had the right to counsel,and the right to appeal an adverse decision to the board of immigration appeals.see id.under the current regulations,the government is still required to determine the identity of the alien,whether the alien has previously been deported,and whether the alien illegally reentered the united states.however,the alien is not allowed a hearing before an ij,nor does the alien have a right to counsel.a.rather,an immigration official makes the abovementioned inquiries and determines whether to issue a reinstatement order.a 
c.the parties arguments.
as noted earlier,dinnall was ordered deported on october,and he left the united states under that order of deportation on january,to reenter the united states on january.employing a landgraf analysis,dinnall first maintains that congress clearly did not intend a to apply to these events occurring before the effective date of a.he reaches this conclusion because a eliminated the retroactivity language of the prior reinstatement provision,and did not simply leave it intact or modify the date see ina f repealed specifying that reinstatement was applicable to reentries whether before or after june,congress considered and rejected new language that would have applied the new reinstatement provision to illegal reentries elsewhere in the statute,where iirira changes rules for conduct that occurred prior to its effective date,congress specifically indicated that the relevant sections would apply to conduct see,iirira modifying the definition of the term aggravated felony and providing that the new definition applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after the date of enactment and congress failed to include language explicitly making the provision retroactive.
under the second prong of the landgraf inquiry,dinnall argues that,even if congress intent is unclear,retroactive application of a would attach new legal consequences to events that occurred before enactment of the statute and impair rights that dinnall possessed at the time of his reentry.specifically,dinnall points to the fact that,under a,he can no longer attempt to reopen his prior deportation order or have it reviewed,and he can no longer apply for discretionary relief such as voluntary departure lastly,dinnall contends that he detrimentally relied on the previous reinstatement statute by paying a bond so that he would have the opportunity to have a hearing before an immigration judge and apply for relief from deportation.
the government counters by arguing that,in ashcroft,cir,we decided that a language is not sufficiently clear to determine the statute temporal reach,and the application of a does not impair any vested rights or impose any new obligations on dinnall.
the first prong of landgraf 
in,we were called upon to decide whether a was impermissibly retroactive when applied to an alien who was deported prior to the effective date of iirira,but who did not claim to have reentered prior to the effective date.at.in analyzing claim under landgraf s first prong,we rejected arguments almost identical to those put forth by dinnall and concluded,w hat is clear is that congress intent with regard to the temporal reach of section a of iirira is not clear.at emphasis in original thus,having already decided that congress did not specify a temporal reach,we need not revisit that question again here.rather,we can proceed to the second inquiry under landgraf 
the second prong of landgraf 
under the second part of our landgraf inquiry we must determine whether applying a to dinnall would have an impermissible retroactive effect.see landgraf,at.dinnall contends that,under a,not only did he lose his right to counsel,his right to develop a record and his right to have a hearing before an ij,he also lost his right to apply for discretionary relief from deportation voluntary departure before a neutral judge and to have his original in absentia deportation order reopened and reviewed so that he could argue lack of notice.
because numerous other courts have previously addressed prong two of landgraf s retroactivity analysis in the immigration context,it is helpful to first discuss these cases in some detail.
a.ins cyr,d 
any discussion of the case law in this area must begin with the supreme court decision in cyr.there,the court held that the provisions of iirira precluding aliens who were removable because of aggravated felony convictions from applying for discretionary relief from deportation did not apply to aliens who pled guilty to aggravated felonies prior to the statute enactment.at.the court reasoned that iirira elimination of section c relief had an impermissible retroactive effect on cyr and other defendants who had entered into plea agreements before iirira amendments to that section.the supreme court explained that iirira elimination of any possibility of c relief for people who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for such relief clearly attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
b.ponnapula ashcroft,cir 
in ponnapula,we also addressed c waivers,albeit in a slightly different context.there,we were faced with the question of whether the application of iirira b would have an impermissibly retroactive effect on an alien who turned down a misdemeanor plea agreement and went to trial while former c was still in effect and was convicted of a felony by the jury.at.ponnapula had gone to trial relying on his counsel advice that,even if he were found guilty,he would likely not receive a sentence that would render him ineligible for c relief because of his very minor role in the offense.id.we ultimately held that iirira repeal of discretionary relief from deportation was impermissibly retroactive with respect to aliens who turned down a plea agreement and elected to go to trial in reasonable reliance on the availability of such relief.id.at.
we also rejected the government argument that cyr rested on the existence of the quid pro quo of criminal plea agreements,and we distanced ourselves from those courts of appeals that have interpreted cyr as requiring as much.id.at.specifically,we disagreed with other courts landgraf and cyr analysis where those courts failed to note landgraf s presumption against retroactivity required actual reliance on the prior statute and imposed an evidentiary burden of proving reliance.id.at.we concluded that,not only does the supreme court favor a reasonable reliance formulation over an actual reliance one,but also,the landgraf line of cases demonstrates that courts are to concentrate on the group to whose conduct the statute is addressed rather than the party before the court.id.at.we concluded that,a change in law can be found impermissibly retroactive without establishing that some or all members of the group affected by the change in law relied on the prior state of the law.id.
c.ashcroft,cir 
in,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit held that,because a operates to impair rights possessed when he acted,namely his ability to apply for discretionary relief,a may not be applied retroactively to him.at.the petitioner had reentered the united states and applied for adjustment of status before iirira became effective.id.at the court concluded that,even though he had no guarantee of a favorable decision in his application for adjustment of status,a still constituted a new disability that did not exist prior to iirira passage.the court explained that the second step of landgraf does not address only the tak ing away or impair ing of vested rights it also asks whether retroactive application would create a new obligation,impose a new duty,or attach a new disability.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
d.sarmiento cisneros,cir 
in sarmiento cisneros,the petitioner illegally reentered the united states and applied for adjustment of status after having been deported.at.his application was based on his marriage to a united states citizen.id.that all occurred before iirira became effective.the petitioner status was adjusted.id.however,in the years that followed,the ins took a variety of adverse actions against him.in,the bice reinstated sarmiento cisneros prior deportation order and issued a warrant of removal.id.because he had applied for discretionary relief before the effective date of iirira,the court concluded that a elimination of the availability of discretionary relief attached a new disability to a completed transaction.id.at.the court rejected the argument that a elimination of relief can not be impermissibly retroactive because the relief is discretionary.id.the court explained that cyr directed a court to consider an alien reasonable reliance on the continued availability of discretionary relief from deportation when deciding whether the elimination of such relief has a retroactive effect.id.accordingly,the court held that a would have an impermissible retroactive effect if applied to the petitioner.id.at.
e.arevalo ashcroft,cir 
in arevalo,the petitioner illegally reentered the united states in.at.in august,the petitioner father,a legal permanent resident,filed a visa petition on her behalf and it was later approved.id.in march,arevalo applied for an adjustment of status.six years later,the ins notified arevalo that it would not entertain her application.id.the ins subsequently invoked a to resurrect her prior deportation order and detained arevalo pending removal.id.the court of appeals for the first circuit concluded that applying a would have an impermissible retroactive effect because arevalo already had filed for relief when congress amended the statute.discarding her application now would deprive her both of a right that she once had and of the reasonable expectation that she would have the opportunity to convince the attorney general to grant her relief.id.at.
f.lattab ashcroft,cir 
in lattab,however,the court of appeals for the first circuit held that application of a to deprive an alien who illegally reentered the country before iirira effective date of the ability to apply for relief for which the alien did not theretofore qualify is not impermissibly retroactive.at.while lattab had illegally reentered the united states prior to iirira effective date,he did not marry a united states citizen until,and it was until that he sought to have his status adjusted.id.at.lattab does not further our inquiry here,however,because the court noted that it was not deciding the retroactive application of a to all aliens who reentered illegally before april,nor was it deciding the case of an alien illegally present in the united states who had a potential defense to deportation before iirira took effect but had not yet applied for relief when iirira eliminated that defense.id.
g.ashcroft,cir 
the court of appeals for the eighth circuit has decided two cases on this issue.in,the court concluded that,under the second prong of the landgraf inquiry,the majority of the reinstatement statute may be applied retroactively to aliens illegally reentering the country prior to the statute effective date however,the provision of the statute precluding an alien subject to reinstatement from applying for any relief under this chapter may not.the petitioner there illegally entered the united states in.he was subsequently deported,but reentered illegally days later.id.at.in,he and his wife visited an ins district office to apply for an adjustment of his status to permanent resident alien,and the ins reinstated his deportation order.
the court explained 
who was deported and illegally reentered in late,married a united states citizen in,prior to the effective date of a.at that time,ins practice created a reasonable expectation that he could defend against later deportation or removal by seeking a discretionary adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.
id.at.the court expressly rejected the contention that a had no impermissible retroactive effect because the illegal reentrant could have applied for adjustment of status before iirira enactment.instead,the court concluded that a may not apply for any relief under this chapter clause attaches new legal consequences to prior actions.id.under the prior law could have filed for a discretionary adjustment of status or sought the adjustment as a defense to a subsequent deportation proceeding.he chose to wait,and a as applied by the ins has now deprived him of that defense.id.
h.of homeland security,cir 
in,the petitioner had illegally reentered the united states prior to iirira enactment and in filed an application for work authorization with his sponsoring employer.congress enacted iirira and a while that application was pending.the ins ultimately approved work petition,but refused to adjust his status.instead,it reinstated the prior order of deportation.id.at.
on appeal,the government argued that the case was distinguishable from because obtaining an visa is a much more complicated and lengthy process than receiving an immediate relative visa.the court rejected that distinction because it has no bearing on the reasonableness of expectation that the opportunity to pursue such a defense would be available to him in later instituted deportation.id.at.the court continued h ad respondents shown that application for adjustment of status was utterly without merit or that such relief was unavailable to him as a matter of law prior to the enactment of a,we would conclude that any retroactive application of a was harmless error.id.the court ultimately concluded that had the right to renew his application for adjustment of status in a subsequent deportation proceeding.id.at.
the court in held that the reinstatement statute applies retroactively to aliens who illegally reentered the country prior to iirira effective date.the petitioner there had not applied for,nor had he argued that he was eligible to apply for,any form of discretionary relief.relying substantially on cyr,the court determined that he therefore had no reasonable expectation of having a hearing before an immigration judge rather than an ins official when he illegally reentered the united states in.id.at.
j.crocetti,cir 
in,the court also concluded that a did not operate in an impermissibly retroactive manner when applied to an alien who illegally reentered the united states prior to the effective date of the statute.petitioner wife filed a petition on his behalf and petitioner filed an application to adjust his status based on his marriage to a citizen seven months after iirira took effect and months after his marriage to a citizen.at.the ins denied petitioner application and reinstated his prior order of deportation pursuant to a.id.
the court relied heavily on cyr.the court first rejected the government contention that could not prevail because the relief he was seeking was discretionary.id.at.next,the court explained that in cyr,the supreme court heavily relied on two factors not present here aliens like cyr had a significant likelihood of receiving the relief they sought under the old law and they almost certainly relied upon that likelihood to their detriment.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court determined that had not shown either a reasonable likelihood of success under law,nor a detrimental reliance on law.id.at.the court noted that sole reliance argument was that he and his wife relied on his ability to adjust his status in the united states when they got married.id.at.
citing hughes aircraft,d,the court noted that the fact that petitioner did not detrimentally rely on prior law may not,however,foreclose a claim that a nonetheless operates retroactively.id.however,the court concluded that it need not decide that question because there was a far simpler reason compelling the court conclusion that the application of a is not impermissibly retroactive in this case not until well after a took effect did petitioner apply to adjust his status or did his wife file for a visa petition on his behalf.id.
dinnall claim.
as previously noted,dinnall maintains that a is impermissibly retroactive because retroactive application of the statute would impair rights he possessed when he acted.specifically,he argues that his prior deportation order can no longer be reopened or reviewed,and he can no longer apply for discretionary relief such as voluntary departure.
we need not spend much time analyzing dinnall first contention because,as dinnall counsel conceded at argument,prior to iirira effective date,dinnall could not reopen the deportation order either.indeed,the regulations in effect when dinnall illegally reentered the united states unequivocally prohibited dinnall from moving to reopen his deportation proceedings.those regulations provided,in relevant part 
a motion to reopen shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings subsequent to his departure from the united states.
dinnall second a impairs his right to apply for discretionary relief such as voluntary more troubling.we note at the outset that it is clear under cyr that our analysis is not altered because voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief rather than a defense to removal.as the court noted there,we must consider an alien reasonable reliance on the continued availability of discretionary relief from deportation when deciding whether the elimination of such relief has a retroactive effect,since t here is a clear difference,for the purposes of retroactivity analysis,between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation.cyr,at.accord sarmiento cisneros,at,at.
dinnall would have to leave the united states whether he was deported or granted voluntary departure.therefore,the distinction in cyr between facing possible deportation and certain deportation may at first seem inapplicable here.there is,however,a crucial distinction that our analysis can not ignore.voluntary departure is not tantamount to deportation.rather,it is a form of relief granted in lieu of deportation.see.accordingly,the consequences for dinnall if deported differ substantially from the consequences that he would face if granted voluntary departure.the law when dinnall illegally reentered the country barred aliens such as dinnall who departed the united states under an order of deportation from returning to the united states for five years.bill ong hing,handling immigration cases,at.however,no such time bar was erected against aliens who were granted voluntary departure.such an alien could return to the united states at any time so long as he or she was otherwise eligible to enter as an immigrant or nonimmigrant.steel on immigration law,at.if a applies retroactively to dinnall,he would forever be precluded from applying for this discretionary relief.that sanction attaches a new disability to dinnall with respect to transactions or considerations already past.see cyr,at.accord,at.
moreover,the government concedes that dinnall illegal reentry would not render him completely ineligible for this form of discretionary relief.rather,the government maintains that his illegal reentry would constitute an adverse factor in the immigration judge discretionary determination.government brief at see,at had respondents shown that application for adjustment of status was utterly without merit or that such relief was unavailable to him as a matter of law prior to the enactment of a,we would conclude that any retroactive application of a was harmless error.although dinnall has no guarantee of a favorable decision on his voluntary departure application,because a constitutes a new disability that did not exist prior to iirira passage,he nevertheless had a reasonable expectation of an avenue of relief before iirira was enacted that he no longer has.see,at.
the government argues that cyr is premised on a reliance theory,since t he supreme court found that application of the statutory bars had a retroactive effect only as to those aliens who actually pled guilty to their disqualifying crimes and who were otherwise eligible for such relief at the time of their plea.government brief at emphasis in original.citing to several post cyr decisions,the government explains that,in those cases,the courts found ineligible for section c relief those aliens who were convicted of their crimes prior to enactment of the bars but who did not fall within cyr holding because they did not plead guilty,and therefore did not rely on the availability of immigration relief.id.emphasis in original.
however,as dinnall points out,the government argument improperly implies that dinnall must demonstrate actual reliance on law to show the impermissible retroactive effect of a.that is inconsistent with our decision in ponnapula see ponnapula,at in ponnapula we found that a requirement of actual reliance erects too high a barrier to triggering the presumption against retroactivity and has the effect of treating landgraf as establishing a presumption in favor of retroactive application.id.at.emphasis in original.rather surprisingly,the government fails to even mention ponnapula in its brief.thus,the government does not mention that in ponnapula we rejected almost all of the.cyr precedent it relies upon to counter dinnall landgraf analysis see ponnapula,at our interpretation of landgraf and its progeny differs somewhat from these courts we believe that other courts of appeals have perhaps misapplied landgraf in this area.
ponnapula also instructs us not to focus attention on the particular facts and circumstances of the party before the court because that was not the focus in cyr.id.at.instead,in cyr,t he discussion of the quid pro quo in criminal plea agreements is directed at establishing,as a general matter,the reasonable reliance of this class of aliens,irrespective of the course of cyr own plea negotiations.id.accordingly,as we focused our attention in ponnapula on the class of aliens who decided to proceed to trial and were convicted prior to the effective date of iirira repeal of c,id.at,here,we focus our attention on the class of aliens who chose to illegally reenter the united states prior to the enactment of a,and who at the time of their reentry,would have been eligible for voluntary departure.it is not unreasonable to assume that many of these aliens may well have reentered the country with the understanding that they might be eligible for some form of discretionary relief.see,at after illegal reentry alien sought discretionary relief of adjustment of status due to approved work visa application arevalo,at after illegal reentry alien sought discretionary relief of adjustment of status based on grant of family visa petition,at after illegal reentry alien sought discretionary relief of adjustment of status due to marriage to a citizen.section a can be found impermissibly retroactive without establishing that some or all members of the group affected by the change in law relied on the prior state of the law ponnapula,at,therefore,our inquiry is not resolved by focusing on whether dinnall reentered with the possibility of this relief in mind.moreover,even if we were to conclude that dinnall interest in obtaining voluntary departure at the time of illegal reentry was attenuated,the fact that an interest may have been attenuated has had little salience in the supreme court analysis of other retroactivity questions.id.at.
we therefore hold that applying a to dinnall has an impermissibly retroactive effect.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we will grant dinnall petition for review and vacate the bice order reinstating dinnall order of deportation.
for the sake of uniformity,we will cite to the ina section numbers throughout with an initial to their section numbers in title of the united states code.accordingly,we will cite a as ina a however opinions cited herein may also refer to this provision as iirira a.

in may,dinnall wife filed a fiancé visa application on his behalf.
because an order reinstating a prior removal order is the functional equivalent of a final order of removal,arevalo ashcroft,cir,we have jurisdiction to hear dinnall petition.see ina a,a ashcroft,cir.
we will discuss the legislative background of iirira in more detail below.
for all relevant purposes in this appeal,the terms deportation and removal are used interchangeably.see,at.
this new regulation was found unconstitutional in ashcroft,cir.the court found that was ultra vires,as it conflicted with the clear and unambiguous provision of section a of the ina,which specifies that immigration judges must conduct all proceedings for deciding inadmissibility or deportability of aliens.id.at.dinnall has not raised this issue in his petition for review.
the house and senate reports indicate that the language of the statute,prior to being amended,stated should the attorney general find that any alien has unlawfully reentered the united states after having previously departed or been deported pursuant to an order of deportation,whether before or after the date of enactment of this act,on any ground described in any of the paragraphs enumerated in subsection e.i at,wl emphasis added.at,wl emphasis added.
the regulations in effect at the time of dinnall illegal reentry provided the following as to voluntary departure i f the alien establishes that is willing and has the immediate means with which to depart promptly from the united states,an immigration judge may authorize the alien to depart voluntarily from the united states in lieu of deportation within such time as may be specified by the immigration judge when first authorizing voluntary departure,and under such conditions as the district director shall direct.
the courts of appeals for the sixth and ninth circuits have reached a different result under the first prong of the landgraf analysis.in bejjani,at,and ins,cir,those courts concluded that congress did not intend a to apply retroactively.in reaching this result,both courts relied primarily on congress elimination of the explicit retroactive language contained in former f,the legislative history of a,and congress silence on the retroactivity of this,every other circuit court of appeals that has considered the retroactivity of a has held,as we held in,that there is no clear indication of congress intent regarding the provision retroactive effect.see ashcroft,cir sarmiento cisneros,at arevalo,at,at ashcroft,cir crocetti,cir.in light of their analysis under prong one,these courts proceeded to analyze the retroactivity of a under the second prong of the landgraf test.these cases are discussed in more detail below.
in analyzing claim under the second prong of landgraf,we stated,a pplying iirira to an alien who was deported prior to iirira effective date,but who reentered not have an impermissible retroactive effect because the consequences of an illegal reentry at the time that reentered are the consequences he faces now.id.emphasis added.because dinnall,unlike,reentered the united states prior to iirira effective date,does not advance our landgraf analysis here.indeed,we stated in ashcroft.cir that,had the petitioner reentered the united states before iirira effective date,he could at least plausibly argue that he did so believing that he would be entitled to a hearing at which he could contest the legality of his underlying deportation order and that he would be entitled to apply for discretionary relief.id.at.
the court reserved judgment on whether its retroactivity analysis would differ if the petitioner had applied for discretionary relief prior to iirira effective date.at.in a subsequent opinion the seventh circuit resolved this issue.the court held that a is not impermissibly retroactive when applied to an alien who reentered the united states before iirira effective date but did not apply for adjustment of status until after the act became effective.labojewski gonzales,cir accord ashcroft,cir,cert.denied,d,wl.
during oral argument,the government asserted that ponnapula was wrongly decided and should not be followed because it is not consistent with landgraf.we are,however,bound by ponnapula and its interpretation of supreme court precedent.see auguste ridge,cir citing third circuit internal operating procedure.
in olatunji ashcroft,cir,the court also concluded that subjective reliance on prior law did not factor into its retroactivity analysis whether the particular petitioner did or did not subjectively rely upon the prior statute or scheme has nothing whatever to do with congress intent it is one thing to indulge the supportable presumption that congress intends its enactments not to operate retroactively it is another altogether to indulge the quite different,and unsupported and unsupportable,presumption that congress so intends,but only where the particular petitioning party can prove that he subjectively relied on the prior statute to his detriment.in other words,where congress has apparently given no thought to the question of retroactivity whatever,there is no basis for inferring that congress intent was any more nuanced than that statutes should not be held to apply retroactively.anything more,in the face of complete congressional silence,is nothing but judicial legislation.
the cases the government cites to,whose application of landgraf we disavowed in ponnapula,include rankine reno,cir chambers reno,cir sonchik,cir and
