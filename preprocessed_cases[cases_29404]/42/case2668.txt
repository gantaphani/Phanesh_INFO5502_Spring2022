tahir useinovic,a yugoslavian,seeks asylum in the united states.an immigration judge ij and the board of immigration appeals bia both have found that useinovic is ineligible for asylum because he can show neither past persecution nor a fear of future persecution.he petitions us to reverse the bia findings or to remand his case to the ij so that he can seek suspension of deportation under the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara.we affirm the decision of the bia.
tahir useinovic is a albanian muslim native of the city of bar,in the republic of montenegro portion of the federal republic of yugoslavia yugoslavia he entered the united states legally as a visitor on may.useinovic wife,ismeta useinovic,to whom he has been married since,joined him on may.they had a child born in the united states in.
useinovic applied for asylum to the immigration and naturalization service ins and was interviewed by the ins on april,in his application for asylum,useinovic claimed that he was mistreated every time he practiced his religion,and that b ecause he was involved in demonstrations against the government of communist yugoslavia,he was detain sic,jailed,beaten and then fired from his farm job.finally,he asserted that if he were forced to return to yugoslavia,he will definitely be detained and either go to jail or be forced into the yugoslavian serbian war.administrative record at.useinovic was issued a notice of intent to deny his application noid on february,and was ultimately denied asylum on april.
the ins issued an order to show cause to useinovic on march,charging him with deportability under a c i of the immigration and nationality act ina,for having overstayed his nonimmigrant tourist visa.see a c i,transferred to a c i.at his hearing before the ij on march,useinovic conceded his deportability and renewed his request for asylum under.he claimed refugee status under section a of the ina as grounds for eligibility for asylum,asserting past persecution and a fear of future persecution based on his albanian ethnicity,islamic religious faith and political opinions and actions 
useinovic was the only witness at his hearing before the ij.based on his testimony and the few documents supporting his two applications for asylum,it is very difficult for this court to construct a seamless,accurate and consistent timeline of useinovic experiences in yugoslavia that accounts for the events he claims support his fear of persecution.what we can determine from his testimony and documentation is as follows.sometime before or around,useinovic undertook his compulsory service in the military.because he was an only child supporting his mother since his father death,he was supposed to be eligible for shortened service of only months.instead,he served months.useinovic testified generally that this extension of time was punishment for his islamic beliefs.he also claimed specifically that during his time in the army,in,an officer approached him about joining the communist party.useinovic testified that upon his refusal,the officer told him he would have a lot of problems afterwards,and that useinovic believe d in something that did not exist.at.presumably the officer was referring to useinovic religious beliefs.
useinovic also claimed that difficulties in his work were relevant to his request for asylum at some time after his military service,working either as a crane operator,or on a farm,useinovic was again asked to join the communist party and again refused,but he did not claim any adverse consequences from this refusal.in and,useinovic participated in the organization of five labor strikes during his testimony,useinovic recounted that he and some colleagues learned that two of their friends had been suspended from work for refusing a transfer to work that they never done before.at.useinovic and colleagues on his shift felt they would also be asked to transfer between jobs in a similar fashion,and decided to start a strike.ultimately,five days of strikes resulted,with the last one involving workers.at.useinovic testified that these demonstrations which he organized resulted in his eventually being fired from his position.he claimed that he was told to take a leave of absence because there was less work to be done at his job site.useinovic came to the united states shortly thereafter just for a visit,but received notice within a month that he had been fired.at.
useinovic also testified that he faced persecution based on his islamic beliefs.in addition to the comments of the military officer and to the extended military service noted above,he claimed that he generally faced problems because his cousin was a hadja,a leader within the islamic circumstance which caused changes in the attitudes of friends and coworkers.although useinovic admitted that he had never been arrested or mistreated by the police,he did testify that sometime around he had a fight over his islamic faith with a coworker,which had scared him sufficiently that he did not go to work for a couple of days.at.
finally,useinovic also testified that he feared persecution if he returned to yugoslavia based on a home invasion suffered by his mother in june of.a translation of a police report indicates that during the night of june,two or more men broke into useinovic mother house,tied her up and blindfolded her and stole money and jewelry.at.in his testimony,useinovic claimed the invaders asked his mother,w here is your son when is he going to come back at.they told her that if he returned,they would harm him,and if she tried to escape her restraints,they would do the same things they did in bosnia.at.useinovic claimed that he later learned from a neighbor that the robbers had been sent by the local police.at.
in an oral decision at the hearing,the ij denied useinovic request for asylum and granted him voluntary departure in lieu of deportation.useinovic,the ij found,was a credible witness.however,even taking as true the events described by useinovic,he had not met his burden of proof to show eligibility for asylum.at.the judge found that useinovic had presented no specific evidence that he had been denied any opportunity to practice his religion,and the specific remarks aimed at him did not rise to the level of persecution.nothing about useinovic protest activities was political,religious or ethnic in nature they were and they could not support a claim of past persecution.the ij further found that his refusal to join the communist party on the two occasions he had been asked to do so had had no serious repercussions.finally,the judge found that the home invasion of his mother house,four years after useinovic left yugoslavia,was a criminally motivated act,not a political or religious one.
useinovic appealed to the bia.the bia denied his appeal on august.the bia found that the events described by useinovic did not rise to the level of persecution under the ina.further,taking judicial notice of the changed country conditions in yugoslavia along with its findings concerning the alleged past events,the bia found that useinovic could not demonstrate an objectively reasonable,fear of persecution.at.this petition for review timely followed.
the bia findings regarding asylum eligibility are factual findings that we review under the substantial evidence standard.ambati reno,cir.we are required to affirm the bia decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.karapetian ins,cir quotations omitted.we will reject the bia findings only if the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.id.quoting ins,d.
useinovic was placed in deportation proceedings by the ins march,order to show cause.because deportation proceedings began before april,the amendments to the ina under the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.iirira,which substantially altered deportation procedures and associated descriptive terminology,do not apply to useinovic action.see,buzdygan ins,cir.instead,the transitional rules in section c of the iirira and the sections of the ina apply,and,as a result,this case continues to be characterized as a deportation proceeding and request for asylum.id.
the ina gives to the attorney general the discretionary power to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee under a.b.under a a person becomes eligible for refugee status by showing either past persecution or a fear of future persecution if returned to her prior country of residence.useinovic does not appeal the bia finding that the events he alleges do not rise to the level of past persecution.instead,he claims on appeal that he has a fear of persecution if returned to yugoslavia on account of his albanian ethnicity,islamic religion and political opinions.a fear of persecution requires specific,detailed facts showing a genuine subjective fear of persecution upon return to the petitioner home country,and that the petitioner fear is objectively reasonable.toptchev ins,cir cuevas ins,cir requiring that a reasonable person in the applicant circumstances would fear persecution if returned.
we first must dispose of useinovic claim that the bia improperly took administrative notice of changed country conditions as reported by the state department in yugoslavia in making its determination.our precedents make clear that the bia may take administrative notice of changed country conditions in its determinations of eligibility for asylum.petrovic ins,cir affirming the bia administrative notice of changed country conditions in yugoslavia and croatia kaczmarczyk ins,cir validating the bia administrative notice of the change of government in poland,rendering unlikely the possibility that solidarity members would be persecuted upon return to poland.however,the bia can not blindly apply a noticed fact to deny automatically the asylum applications of that country citizens.kaczmarczyk,at.the bia must still engage in an individualized review of the applicant case.petrovic,at.
the bia did engage in an individualized review of useinovic case.first,the situation recognized by the bia notice shows that the government useinovic lived under in yugoslavia,as well as the one he claimed to fear in his applications for asylum,was no longer in fact the character of the government was completely different with both the overthrow of communism and the removal of the milosevic regime.second,the remainder of the bia opinion is replete with individualized analysis of useinovic claims based on the hearing before,and the decision of,the ij.the bia carefully and succinctly contrasts the claims of useinovic with his resulting testimony.for example,useinovic claimed threats,verbal abuse,physical abuse and arrest based on his ethnicity and religion,but his testimony was that he had never been physically abused,arrested or jailed by the police or anyone else.at.this,and the analysis that follows,was highly particularized to useinovic individual circumstances.the bia use of administrative notice was proper.
useinovic next claims that both the ij and the bia considered only the issue of past persecution and failed to consider a fear of future persecution as grounds for asylum eligibility.because a fear of persecution was alleged and argued by useinovic,and is a statutory ground for refugee status and eligibility for asylum,useinovic argues that the failure of the ij and bia to consider such grounds requires reversal.even if the ij and bia decisions can be read as reflecting consideration of a fear of future persecution,useinovic further argues that their decisions cursorily concluded that such a fear was not objectively reasonable without adequate discussion of the factors leading to this conclusion.pet.br.at.
even a cursory examination of the record makes clear that the ij did render a decision on useinovic alleged fear of future persecution and found it to be unreasonable.at.the ij,after outlining the reasonable person standard for establishing a fear of persecution,describes useinovic claim of a fear of persecution,and details the past racial and religious incidents useinovic alleged to support this claim.further,the ij goes on to describe how useinovic fears that he will face persecution for his organization of strikes and opposition to the government,evidenced,according to useinovic,by the attack on his mother.at.therefore,as an initial matter it is clear that the ij did,in fact,make a determination with respect to useinovic claim of a fear of future persecution.similarly,even useinovic own brief ultimately acknowledges that the bia did,in fact,make a determination on both persecution and a fear of persecution.pet.br.at while the bia cursorily concluded that the appellant did not demonstrate a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution.
in the alternative,useinovic claims that the bia did not adequately explain its conclusion that he lacked an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.the bia,claims useinovic,merely recounted the past incidents alleged by useinovic.this claim fails as well.useinovic appears to be trying to avoid the deferential substantial evidence standard of review by characterizing the bia conclusion as one of legal error,that is,incorrectly interpreting the ina.but he is,in reality,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the bia findings with respect to his fear of appeal which actually invokes the substantial evidence standard.to that end,we must first examine the bia use of past incidents in its determination that there was no reasonable fear of future persecution.then,after evaluating the bia mode of decision,we will examine the remaining challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the bia determination.
first,the use of past incidents to frame a determination of a fear of future persecution is not only routine,but highly probative.this approach is one of the principal ways of demonstrating the existence of a fear of persecution,because the existence of past incidents of persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.see ins,cir.however,past events forming the central basis for a petitioner claim of a fear of future persecution may,in some circumstances,be found insufficient or irrelevant and unable to support eligibility for asylum.see ambati,at examining alleged incidents of past persecution in determining whether petitioner had an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution petrovic,at finding no fear of persecution based on examination of evidence of past incidents and consideration of changed country conditions.
during his hearing before the ij,useinovic,when originally asked why he feared persecution,began recounting the list of alleged acts of past persecution that we have detailed.at the end of his testimony,useinovic was asked again what he thought would happen if he went back to yugoslavia.at.he responded,judging by all that has happened in the past,which i described here in the c ourtroom,i do believe anything good could happen to me there.id.useinovic claim of a fear of future persecution centered around the incidents he alleged from the past.the bia analysis of his claim of a fear of persecution was,therefore,inevitably centered around an examination of these past incidents.
however,even given the focus of useinovic claim upon past incidents in his life,the bia did not,as useinovic claims,limit its examination only to those past incidents.as already explained,very early in its opinion the bia took administrative notice that yugoslavia had undergone significant change in the eleven years since useinovic left.at.not only was the communist regime that ruled when useinovic emigrated no longer in power,but the dictatorial regime of slobodan milosevic had been replaced.id.therefore,the bia analysis of useinovic fear of persecution involved a consideration both of past incidents of alleged persecution and of changed country conditions within yugoslavia.this was a sound and proper procedure for adjudicating useinovic claim.
so,ultimately we are left with a simple attack on the substantiality of the evidence considered by the bia,which fails as well.there is substantial evidence supporting the bia decision,and a reasonable factfinder could find that there is n
