antonina and oksana averianova,citizens of uzbekistan,petition for review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision affirming the immigration judge ij denial of the averianovas applications for asylum and for withholding of removal for the reasons discussed below,we deny the averianovas petitions.
background 
antonina and oksana averianova are a mother and daughter seeking asylum in the united states because of alleged persecution on account of their jewish ethnicity and religious beliefs.
antonina was born in russia in.her family moved to uzbekistan shortly after her birth.she has two children,oleg and oksana.antonina claims that her father was jewish and her mother russian,but her mother adopted her father ethnicity upon marriage.antonina does not practice judaism regularly and only began practicing in the late.she cites various incidents of past persecution in uzbekistan,allegedly because of her jewish background.she testified that she was once attacked on a bus because she was not muslim.on another occasion a man yelling about jews hit her and split her lip.her son was beaten for not being muslim and having jewish roots.she did not report any of these incidents to the police.in,antonina arrived as a visitor to the united states.she applied for asylum in.
oksana testified to various problems she encountered in uzbekistan because of her alleged jewish ethnicity.in school,she faced frequent taunting.a group of girls once threatened her and pushed her head in a toilet.she recalled incidents of muslim men harassing her,slapping her in the face,calling her a jewish whore,and threatening to cut her legs for wearing a short skirt.she reported that her professors at night college prevented her from participating in class and that she had difficulty finding employment in tashkent,the capital of uzbekistan.oksana did not report any of these incidents to the police.she arrived in the united states in and applied for asylum shortly thereafter.she does not practice judaism in the united states.the ij consolidated her case with antonina.
during the asylum proceedings,the averianovas submitted several birth certificates to prove their jewish ethnicity.in the former soviet union,the government considered jewish an ethnicity and listed it on birth certificates as a nationality.none were original documents,and the averianovas testified that any original documents,such as original birth certificates,internal passports,travel passports or marriage certificates,had been lost or stolen.the immigration and naturalization service ins in conjunction with the american embassy in tashkent,investigated the birth certificates submitted by the averianovas and identified specific discrepancies that called into question their authenticity.
the averianovas presented a translated copy of oksana birth certificate,notarized in russia in,which stated that antonina was jewish.in may,the ins gave the copy of oksana birth certificate to american embassy personnel in tashkent.embassy staff then asked the local register of tashkent to access oksana birth record.the embassy personnel discovered that the official record of oksana birth listed antonina nationality as russian.oksana contended that the embassy report was an unreliable,copy,and that it erroneously listed her birth date.american embassy officials subsequently obtained two digital photographs of her birth record.the photographs showed antonina nationality as russian.the register also corrected the birth date error after embassy staff identified it.the ij found that the two documents were identical with one exception the nationality of russian in the original record had been changed to jewish in oksana copy.
after the ins original inquiry into oksana birth certificate,the averianovas initiated a court proceeding in tashkent on march,to amend antonina father birth record to state that he was jewish.antonina father original birth certificate indicated that he was russian.the court changed the record on may.the averianovas submitted the amended birth certificate and the record of the tashkent court hearing to the ij.
once the ins discovered that oksana birth record actually stated that antonina was russian,not jewish,the averianovas submitted several more copies of birth certificates to the ij.first,a copy of antonina brother victor birth certificate dated august,reflected that his and antonina father was jewish.the ins obtained digital photographs of the original birth record bearing the serial number reflected on the copy submitted by the averianovas and determined that the serial number reflected on the copy actually was contained on a birth certificate issued to someone other than victor.second,a birth certificate submitted for oleg stated that his mother antonina was jewish.the ins obtained two digital photographs of his actual birth record in tashkent that listed antonina nationality as russian.third,antonina submitted a copy of her birth certificate issued in that listed her father nationality as jewish.the ins found that the serial number on this birth certificate also was issued to someone else and obtained a copy of that person birth record.
the ij rejected the averianovas asylum claims.the ij focused on their claims of persecution based upon their jewish ethnicity because that was the overwhelming thrust of their claims,and they had not provided sufficient testimony regarding claims of persecution on account of their ethnicity.the ij determined that the photographs of uzbek records were trustworthy and persuasive evidence.the ij found that the averianovas had submitted fraudulent documents,which adversely affected their credibility.he also found that they offered no explanation for the discrepancies.he held that without credible proof of their jewish ethnicity,their asylum claims failed.the ij refused to extend comity to the tashkent court proceeding of march.he also found a lack of any objective corroborating evidence regarding the averianovas alleged persecution.on account of the lack of credible testimony and lack of corroborating evidence,the ij also rejected their claims for withholding of removal.
in attempting to verify the birth certificates the averianovas submitted,the ins sent them to the american embassy in tashkent.embassy staff checked records and made inquiries to local uzbek officials.the averianovas contended that confidential information had been revealed in the course of the investigation in violation of,which generally prohibits disclosing information submitted in an asylum application unless the applicant gives written consent.the averianovas argued that the disclosures gave rise to an inference that they had applied for asylum,which they claimed created a separate basis for asylum.the ij found no proof that the ins had revealed confidential information to uzbek authorities.he determined that the ins merely investigated a vital statistic,their ethnicity,which could relate to any number of ordinary government investigations.additionally,because the averianovas went to an uzbek tribunal to alter family birth records regarding their jewish ethnicity,the ij doubted that the averianovas had any real concern over a release of that information to the uzbek government.therefore,the ij refused to grant relief on this basis as well and denied their applications.
the bia adopted and affirmed the ij determination.it first agreed that the averianovas had offered only conjecture to explain why the false documents differed from the official uzbek records.it also determined that it would not grant comity to the decision of a foreign tribunal where fraud and manipulation of the immigration laws were present.additionally,the bia held that this adverse credibility determination tainted the overall credibility of the averianovas,which affected both the jewish claims and the claims.the bia also agreed that the ins did not breach the averianovas confidentiality.
ii.discussion 
when the bia adopts the ij decision,but adds reasoning of its own,we review both decisions.setiadi gonzales,cir.we affirm the decisions if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.singh gonzales,cir.we review questions of law de novo,and we will reverse findings of fact only if the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find in favor of the petitioner.turay ashcroft,cir.
the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to a refugee,defined as an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.onsongo gonzales,cir see a a,b.the applicant must establish that one of the five protected grounds was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.b b i.an applicant can establish a fear of future persecution by showing that she has a subjective fear of persecution and that credible,direct,and specific evidence establishes that a reasonable person in the applicant situation would fear persecution.mamana gonzales,cir.
adverse credibility finding 
an applicant bears the burden of satisfying the ij that her testimony is credible,is persuasive,and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.b b ii.a credibility determination is a finding of fact,and b b provides that it should be accepted unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.singh,at quoting b b.the combination of an adverse credibility finding and a lack of corroborating evidence for the claim of persecution means that the applicant claim fails,regardless of the reason for the alleged persecution.sivakaran ashcroft,cir.in this case,we find that the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the ij and bia because the averianovas submitted fraudulent documents,could not explain the numerous discrepancies,and failed to provide evidence otherwise corroborating their claim of persecution on the basis of their jewish ethnicity.
the ij found that the averianovas lacked credibility because they submitted fraudulent documents.the ins investigation provided strong evidence that the averianovas actual birth records consistently contradicted the nationality listed in the birth certificates that they submitted.the averianovas supplied additional false birth certificates after the birth certificate presented by oksana had been proven false by photographic evidence.the birth certificates purporting to be oksana and oleg indicated antonina nationality as jewish,but the ins presented photographs showing that the actual birth certificates stated antonina nationality as russian.antonina jewish birth certificate was generated in,around the time the averianovas intended to enter the united states.the birth certificates purporting to be antonina and her brother contained serial numbers of birth certificates issued to other individuals,not the averianovas.while minor inconsistencies and omissions will not support an adverse credibility determination,inconsistencies or omissions that relate to the basis of persecution are not minor but are at the heart of the asylum claim.kondakova ashcroft,cir internal quotation omitted.
the averianovas on appeal claim that they had no knowledge that the documents were fraudulent,and,therefore,they should not be subject to an adverse credibility determination.they rely on kourski ashcroft,cir,which requires the ij to find that the applicant knew or had reason to know about the fraudulent nature of submitted documents.id.at.in kourski,the applicant claimed that he received the documents from his mother and that the forgery was subtle,which undermined the notion that the applicant knew or had reason to know about the fraud.id.we have held that a n ij may base an adverse credibility determination upon submission of fraudulent documents if the petitioner fails to offer a legitimate explanation for the suspected fraud.onsongo,at.in ignatova gonzales,cir,for example,we reviewed an ij determination that the applicant submitted a frivolous asylum claim,in part because she submitted a fraudulent document.we distinguished kourski because the ij explicitly found that the document submitted by ignatova was fraudulent,and the applicant never provided any explanation about the discrepancy.id.at.in this case,the ij explicitly made both findings,and he did so regarding not just one,but four documents.
the averianovas attempt to explain the discrepancies between the submitted documents and the official records by attacking the ins investigation.they argue that the ij should not have trusted the ins investigation because uzbek officials may have altered or provided incorrect documents and because the averianovas expert witnesses identified possible errors systemic to the former soviet union.the ij weighed this evidence and determined that the ins investigation was trustworthy,particularly because of photographic proof submitted by the ins.therefore,the ij found that these circumstances resulted in an adverse credibility finding.we are not convinced that a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find the contrary.
in light of the adverse credibility finding,the averianovas attempted to present evidence corroborating their jewish ethnicity and of their past persecution or fear of future persecution on account of it.the only corroborating evidence the averianovas offer in regard to their jewish ethnicity was the tashkent tribunal decision amending their father ethnicity from russian to jewish on a birth certificate issued in chelyabinsk,russia,which they urge deserves comity it is questionable whether comity should be extended to an ex parte,proceeding initiated ten years after filing the original asylum claim in the united states.the proceeding began only after the averianovas received word from the ins that their original documentation was false,calling into question their claims regarding their ethnicity.the bia pointed out that retroactive foreign judgments regarding marital status are not granted comity where fraud,misrepresentation,or manipulation of the immigration law are present.matter of magana.the bia concluded that,similarly,comity would not be extended to the decision of the uzbek court in a proceeding regarding birth certificate information initiated after asylum proceedings began because of the presence of fraud and manipulation.under the circumstances of this case,where an applicant initiates a foreign court proceeding after an asylum case has begun and in light of the evidence of fraud and manipulation,we agree and refuse to find that the tashkent court actions constitute sufficient corroborating evidence such that a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find the averianovas testimony credible.
even assuming arguendo that the tashkent court order provides sufficient corroborating evidence that the averianovas are jewish,the averianovas still do not offer sufficient corroborating evidence that they suffered past persecution or that they have a fear of future persecution.they reported no incidents of abuse to the police.their only corroborating evidence comes in the form of expert witness testimony regarding conditions in uzbekistan.those experts could not testify to the averianovas past persecution.the experts could only attest to the country conditions regarding the reasonableness of their fear of future persecution.on the other hand,the ij cited the ins country condition reports regarding civil liberties and human rights in uzbekistan,which indicated that jews enjoy religious freedom and that no pattern of discrimination against jews exists.these country condition reports constitute substantial evidence supporting the ij and bia decisions.see kondakova,at finding the reliance upon country condition reports constitutes substantial evidence to support a determination that petitioner failed to provide corroborating evidence to overcome an adverse credibility finding 
confidentiality 
the averianovas also claim that the ins breached their confidentiality in its investigation of the authenticity of the birth certificates they submitted and that this breach provides them a new and independent basis for an asylum claim.courts generally accord government records and
