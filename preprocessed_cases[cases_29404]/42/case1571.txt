the sentencing guidelines advise district courts to increase by twelve or sixteen the offense level for a defendant convicted of unlawfully entering or remaining in the united states if the defendant has a prior felony conviction for a crime of violence.b a.sexual abuse of a minor is listed as a qualifying crime of violence.cmt.b iii.the issue in this case is whether carlos perez perez prior north carolina conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor.a constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,and therefore a crime of violence within the meaning of the reentry guideline.we are constrained by our precedent,united states diaz ibarra,cir,to hold that it does.
having previously entered this country unlawfully,perez perez,a mexican citizen,who was then years old,had sex with a year old girl in he was charged in north carolina with statutory rape.a a,but he pled guilty to taking indecent liberties with a minor.id.he was soon after deported to mexico.perez perez unlawfully reentered the united states and was convicted in federal district court in texas of reentry by an alien after deportation following an aggravated felony conviction.he was again deported to mexico in.
after unlawfully entering the united states yet again,perez perez pled guilty in federal district court in north carolina to illegal reentry after deportation by an aggravated felon.a and b.over his objection,the district court concluded that perez perez prior north carolina conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor constituted a crime of violence,and the court applied the concomitant enhancement,b a,raising perez perez sentencing range to to months from a range of one to seven months.the district court sentenced perez perez to an imprisonment term of months.he filed a timely notice of appeal.
perez perez raises a single challenge on appeal he argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior north carolina conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor.a,qualifies categorically as sexual abuse of a minor,and thus as a crime of violence within the meaning of the reentry guideline.b a.because his contention raises a question of law,we review the district court ruling de novo.diaz ibarra,at.
at base,the categorical approach requires that we look only to the statutory definition of the state crime and the fact of conviction to determine whether the conduct criminalized by the statute,including the most innocent conduct,qualifies as a crime of violence.id.at.application of this approach generally involves a process.first,we identify which of the listed crimes in the commentary to the guideline the guideline crime most closely approximates the prior state crime united states cabrera umanzor,cir.second,we identify the generic definition of the guideline crime.united states bonilla,cir.third,we compare the elements of the prior state crime to those in the generic definition of the guideline crime.id.if the elements of the prior state crime correspond in substance to those of the guideline crime,then the prior state crime is a crime of violence and our inquiry comes to an end.cabrera umanzor,at citations and modifications omitted.if,however,the elements do not correspond in substance,then we proceed to the fourth step,which involves an assessment of whether the scope of conduct criminalized by the prior state crime is categorically overbroad when compared to the generic definition of the guideline crime.united states rangel castaneda,cir citation omitted.a prior state offense whose elements criminalize a broader scope of conduct than the guideline crime is not categorically a crime of violence.
the paradigmatic exemplar of this structured approach that proceeded through to step four is rangel castaneda,in which we held that a tennessee statutory rape law that made the age of consent eighteen was categorically broader than the generic definitions of statutory rape,forcible sex offense,and sexual abuse of a minor.id.at.accordingly,the defendant federal sentence for unlawful reentry could not be increased by sixteen offense levels under b a on the basis of his prior conviction under the tennessee law.id.at.
applying the above analytical framework to the case at hand,we conclude that perez perez conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor qualifies categorically,at step three of the above framework,as sexual abuse of a minor,and therefore as a crime of violence within the meaning of the reentry guideline.the listed guideline crime that most closely approximates the north carolina crime of taking indecent liberties with a minor is sexual abuse of a minor,a term that we have previously construed to mean a perpetrator physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.diaz ibarra,at quotations and citation omitted.although the north carolina statute appears to encompass two distinct categories of conduct,it has been construed by north carolina courts as one crime having five elements 
the defendant was at least years of age he was five years older than his victim he willfully took or attempted to take an indecent liberty with the victim the victim was under years of age at the time the alleged act or attempted act occurred and the action by the defendant was for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire.
state coleman,
comparing our generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor with the elements of the north carolina indecent liberties crime reveals both that the elements of the latter correspond in substance with our definition,and that each offense therefore contemplates criminalization of the same conduct both target conduct directed towards minors,both require a mental element focused on sexual gratification,and both cast a broad net in capturing physical or nonphysical conduct.specifically,we are unable to say that the statutory element of willfully t aking or attempt ing to take an indecent liberty exceeds the scope of what we have required misuse or maltreatment of a minor 
perez perez makes two arguments in contending that his conviction does not constitute sexual abuse of a minor.first,he argues that the north carolina crime is broader than diaz ibarra definition of sexual abuse of a minor because the statute does not require that the victim even be aware of the perpetrator presence,much less that the act occur within the physical presence of the child.app.br.second,he argues that our decision in united states vann,cir en banc per curiam,establishes that his conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor is not a crime of violence.these contentions are unpersuasive.
perez perez first argument,that the legal sufficiency of constructive presence under the north carolina statute renders it broader than sexual abuse of a minor,state every,is unavailing because it elides the extraordinary breadth of our definition of the guideline crime.in diaz ibarra,we agreed with the eleventh circuit that a perpetrator can engage in conduct that constitutes sexual abuse when he is in the actual or constructive presence of the minor.at.thus,with respect to the elements of a perpetrator presence or,what is closely related thereto,a victim awareness or knowledge of his presence,our definition of the guideline crime and the elements of the north carolina indecent liberties offense are effectively coterminous in that neither requires the defendant actual presence or the victim awareness or knowledge of the defendant presence.
perez perez second argument,that vann militates in favor of concluding that taking an indecent liberty with a minor is not a crime of violence,ultimately fails because accepting it would require us to set aside our precedent in diaz ibarra,which we can not do.see mcmellon united states,cir en banc recognizing the basic principle that one panel can not overrule a decision issued by another panel.it is true that in vann we held,proceeding on an assumption that the modified categorical approach applied,that the government had failed to prove that the specific defendant north carolina conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor was a violent felony within the meaning of the armed career criminal act at.but vann does not dictate reversal in this case,as the per curiam opinion of the en banc court did not purport to disturb diaz ibarra prior definition of the generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor.moreover,unlike the reentry guideline,the armed career criminal act has no list of enumerated crimes and contains only the residual and force clauses,neither of which expressly contemplate sexual offenses involving minors.given these distinguishing characteristics,we are constrained to agree with the government that vann does not control,and that there is no interpretation of the north carolina indecent liberties statute that does not fit within diaz ibarra extraordinarily broad generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor.
in short,diaz ibarra mandates the result here.it would be difficult,if not impossible,to conceptualize a situation in which a perpetrator willfully took or attempted to take an immoral,improper,or indecent liberty with a minor that did not involve his physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of that minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.even if we could come up with such a case,it would likely run counter to the supreme court admonishment that the categorical analysis requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute language.gonzales duenas alvarez,d regarding the immigration and nationality act.we are tasked instead with assessing whether there is a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that north carolina would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.id.accordingly,we hold that a conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor qualifies categorically as sexual abuse of a minor under diaz ibarra and is therefore a crime of violence within the meaning of the reentry guideline and its commentary.cmt.b iii.the judgment is 
today decision is compelled by united states diaz ibarra,cir,the case in which we described sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of identifying a crime of violence under sentencing guideline b a ii the reentry guideline,to mean a perpetrator physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.quotations and citation omitted.i use the term describe rather than define quite purposefully.this is because in diaz ibarra,rather than undertake to define a generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor by setting out a list of elements of such a hypothetical generic crime,we simply engaged in dictionary surfing to arrive at an expansive description of what we think such a crime might cover.today decision demonstrates the limitlessness of our circuit conception of sexual abuse of a minor accordingly,i respectfully submit that the time has come to reconsider diaz ibarra.
there are several discrete problems with diaz ibarra construction of sexual abuse of a minor.
first,it is untethered from the very term it is ultimately intended to define crime of violence.b a ii emphasis added.nonphysical misuse or maltreatment certainly includes conduct that does not involve physical force with the intent to cause harm,and therefore the definition effectively renounces violence,the very word it seeks to define.see black law dictionary ed defining violence as t he use of physical force,usu.accompanied by fury,vehemence,or outrage,physical force unlawfully exercised with the intent to harm.there is no more probative evidence of this than a sample of cases involving north carolina indecent liberties statute.a.a defendant who secretly videotapes a minor undressing when they are not in the same room,state mcclees,or who has a sexually explicit conversation with a minor over the phone,state every,or who hands a sexually explicit note to a minor soliciting her unsuccessfully to have sex with him for,state mcclary,is not guilty of a crime of violence or indeed,even engaged in conduct in which violence against a victim is imminently likely hereafter,however,convictions for all of these acts will be treated categorically as sexual abuse of a minor and thus as a crime of violence under our application of diaz ibarra to today case 
we declined in diaz ibarra to derive a definition of sexual abuse of a minor from a concern about violence and physical force because the sentencing commission had earlier amended the commentary to make clear that the absence of physical violent force did not preclude sexual abuse of a minor from qualifying as a crime of violence.diaz ibarra,at.presumably,the reason for this was to give adjudicative power to the guideline force clause separate and apart from the listed guideline crimes the resulting inference was that sexual abuse of a minor does not require use of physical force against the person of another to qualify as a crime of violence.id.similarly,and equally without controversy,one can agree that sexual abuse of minor does not require that the victim suffer an identifiable injury.id.at.
surely,however,there must actually be a victim of some crime of violence,and that victim must suffer maltreatment of a sort that is something more than the shock resulting from a telephone conversation.see state brown,our holding in every,at stands for the proposition that repeated,graphic,and explicit sexual conversations over the phone concurrent with indicia of masturbation is sufficient to allow a jury to conclude such actions amount to taking indecent liberties.
thus,even if in diaz ibarra we were correct in our assessment of the sentencing commission intent,we are precluded from defining sexual abuse of a minor in a way wholly untethered from the guideline text and that is so even if the commentary mandates such a result.see united states peterson,cir noting that commentary inconsistent with the guideline text would be rendered.
post diaz ibarra case law from the supreme court sheds some light on the interpretive limits that the word violence places on our construction of these listed guideline crimes.in johnson united states,d,the court,in defining the term physical force as employed in the force clause of the armed career criminal act rejected the government contention that physical force should be interpreted to include de minimis force as required by the common law of battery the court stated that h ere we are interpreting the phrase physical force as used in defining not the crime of battery,but rather the statutory category of violent felon ies.id.at.it concluded that in the context of a statutory definition of violent felony,the phrase physical force means violent force that is,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.id.see also leocal ashcroft,d w e can not forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term crime of violence.the ordinary meaning of this term suggests a category of violent,active crimes.james united states,d.in other words,johnson should be understood as standing for a principle of statutory construction that the supreme court has made particularly salient in federal sentencing cases specific terms that qualify the more general are still cabined by the plain meaning of the general term.applied here,johnson teaching buttresses the point that sexual abuse of a minor qualifies the term crime of violence,and therefore must be cabined by the operative term violence.
second,diaz ibarra description of sexual abuse of a minor captures conduct that is not sexual abuse.diaz ibarra reduces sexual abuse of a minor into a crime entirely focused on the defendant intent,at,and thereby erases from the analysis factors that are typically understood as critical to defining sexual abuse of minors,such as the severity of the conduct,the defendant presence,the degree of the child involvement and awareness,coercion,the absence of consent,and the existence of an injury to the victim.see david finkelhor,current information on the scope and nature of child sexual abuse,the future of children,vol,at david finkelhor,the prevention of childhood sexual abuse,the future of children,vol,at fall.see also making a sexual act an element of the federal crime of sexual abuse of a mino
