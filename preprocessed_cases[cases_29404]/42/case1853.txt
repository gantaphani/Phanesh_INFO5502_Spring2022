the six appellants in this case appeal their convictions and sentences for hostage taking,a,and smuggling of illegal aliens.all of the appellants appeal on various sufficiency of the evidence grounds,and some of them appeal on additional grounds,ranging from challenges to sentencing,improper denials of motions to suppress,and improper voir dire and jury instructions.for the following reasons,we affirm the convictions,modify elbin sentence on counts two and three,and otherwise affirm the appellants sentences.
factual and procedural history 
in march of,a group of illegal immigrants arrived at an apartment in houston,texas,with a group of coyotes who the aliens and their friends and relatives paid to help smuggle them into the united states.on march,jose marlon,jose efrain,marvin arturo,henry,edy,and elbin arrived at the apartment where the aliens were all six of the men were armed.they announced that they wanted of the male aliens whose fees had not yet been paid.
the appellants then began motioning at particular aliens with the guns,indicating which ones they would take with them.and went into another room in the apartment,still armed,threatened the aliens in that room,and selected a few of the aliens to go with them.the appellants then split the aliens into groups and loaded them into cars.while on the way to their destination,gave his cell phone to the aliens in his car and told them to call their family members and tell them not to send the money to the original coyotes.no specific amount of money was mentioned as the appellants new fee at this time.
about fourteen aliens were brought from the first apartment to a new one,also in houston,with the appellants.they arrived at about on march.all of the appellants were armed at all times in the new apartment and took turns guarding the aliens.while all the aliens and all the appellants were in a room together,while armed,told the aliens not to screw up,because otherwise they end up lying there.in addition to the aliens and the appellants,griselda and her daughter,among others,were also in the apartment for at least some of the time the aliens were there.
the appellants then gave the aliens food,clothing,and alcohol.took one of the aliens,miguel,to to buy some clothes.followed around the store and asked him where he was going.was armed and at one point told to behave or he could hurt him.they paid for the clothes and then returned to the apartment.
while at the apartment,and told the aliens to call their families to arrange for money to be sent to them instead of the initial coyotes.spoke to one of the alien relatives and made calls about monetary arrangements for some of the other illegal aliens as well.and also made one alien call a friend of his to ask for more money despite the fact that the friend had already paid to the initial coyotes.all of the appellants were present when told the alien to call his friend for more money.
at around on march,houston police dispatch received a call about a hostage situation with weapons at the apartment where the aliens and the appellants were staying.uniformed officers arrived on the scene at around.they saw four people exit the apartment and get into a car with an expired registration.they stopped the car based on the traffic violation.
when none of the occupants of the car were able to produce valid identification,the officers began an investigatory detention.the driver was,and the passengers were,and.when none of the men could produce valid id,they were placed in the patrol car.stated that she had id back at her apartment.an officer asked her if she wanted to go get it and if he could come with her,and she said yes.
as they approached her apartment,stated that there were a few people in her apartment and knocked on the door.no one answered,and stated that she did have keys to the apartment.the officer heard people moving inside the apartment while they were waiting.inside the apartment,was moving the aliens from one room to another,directing them with his pistol.told the aliens to tell the police they were at a party.
the door was opened three to five minutes later,and the officer saw three men fleeing the apartment via the balcony.there were many people in the living room.the officer then entered the apartment and began a sweep of the premises.he stated that he was worried about being set up and that safety was a concern.he found many people in various rooms in the apartment and moved them all into the living room.he then asked if he could search the apartment for weapons,and she told him that he could.no weapons were found at this point.
the officers then called immigration officials and were told it would be a few hours before they could get there.the officers began noticing that at least one of the appellants was constantly in one of the apartment two bathrooms.they also noticed that the appellants would run their hands up and down and her daughter whenever they walked by.there was a second bathroom in the apartment that was to the appellants.however,asked to take her daughter to that bathroom,and the officers let her,although they did not let her close the door.an officer heard the daughter tell her mother no he then entered the bathroom to find pulling her daughter shirt up.he noticed the lid of the toilet was crooked,and when he looked in the tank,he found three loaded handguns.the officers at this point inspected the first bathroom as well and noticed that it looked like someone had tried to push through the wall separating the two bathrooms.
when this was discovered,an officer went to handcuff.and began to move toward the officer guarding the door of the apartment,and all the officers drew their weapons.the appellants were ordered to move against the wall,and they complied.after this,the appellants were moved to patrol cars,and immigration officials arrived a short time later.
based on these events,the appellants were charged with alien smuggling and hostage taking.at a jury trial,they were found guilty of all counts and sentenced by the judge to various terms of imprisonment.the six appellants timely filed the current appeal alleging various grounds of error discussed below.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
all six of the appellants appeal their convictions under the hostage taking act hta,a,on various sufficiency of the evidence grounds.in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,this court views all evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.united states,cir.in conducting this review,we accept all credibility choices and reasonable inferences made by the jury,and the standard remains the same whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial.united states nixon,cir.
to prove the offense of participating in a hostage taking under the hta,the government must establish that the appellants seized or detained another person,and threatened to kill,injure,or continue to detain that person,with the purpose of compelling a third person or entity to act in some way as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the person detained.a see also,at.
the appellants in this case were charged with a hostage taking conspiracy and with aiding and abetting hostage taking.conspiracy requires direct or indirect agreement to commit hostage taking,knowledge that the purpose of the agreement was unlawful,and joinder in the agreement to further its unlawful purpose.united states de,cir,cert.denied,d.to aid and abet a crime,a defendant must associate with the criminal venture,participate in it,and seek by his actions to make the venture succeed.united states peters,cir.the evidence supporting a conspiracy conviction is generally sufficient to support an aiding and abetting conviction as well.united states gonzales,cir.
first,argues that the evidence that he seized or detained another person against his or her will is insufficient.he argues that none of the aliens testified that he harmed or threatened them.the government did present evidence,however,that was present at the apartment where the aliens were kept by the original coyotes,that he was armed at this apartment,and that he participated in moving the aliens from one apartment to another.this is enough evidence to sustain conviction under the first prong of the hta.there is no need for physical force or violence or even the threat of it to support this conviction,at.all that is required is that frighten or deceive the aliens into staying with him when they would have preferred to join their families or even remain with the first set of coyotes.id.at.
and challenge their convictions under the second prong of the hta,that they threatened to kill,injure,or continue to detain the aliens.again contends that because he did directly use or threaten physical harm,his conviction can not be sustained.contends that he never threatened anyone or told them they were free to leave.he also argues that his goal was to transport the aliens to their final destinations for a fee,not to hold them for a ransom.he states that to the extent there was a conspiracy under the hta,there was no evidence at trial that he was aware of its illegal purpose.
actions at both the first and second apartments,including being armed and telling at least one alien to call his family to get money for his transport,is enough to support his conviction under the hta.the evidence of actions,including brandishing a firearm and knowing of the requests made of the aliens families for money,is sufficient to sustain his conviction as well.based on the evidence presented at trial,a reasonable jury could have drawn an inference that implicit in the appellants request that the aliens families send money was the threat that the aliens would not be released if money was not sent.even in the absence of this inference,the presence of guns at the second apartment was an implicit threat of continued detention to the aliens.
all of the appellants contend that the evidence presented by the government at trial was insufficient to prove the third element of the hta,that they intended to compel a third party to act in some way.the appellants argue that no threat of harm to the aliens or continued seizure was ever communicated to a third party.a variant of this argument is that the appellants did intend to compel a third party to act but merely to collect money for the aliens transport to their families.they also argue that because there was no increase in the amount of money requested from the aliens relatives and friends,there can be no conviction under the hta.
first,there is no requirement under the hta that there be communication of the threat to a third party.instead,the requirement is that the appellants actions be intended to compel a third party to act.this language does require that the appellants be able to directly communicate that threat.secondly,here the evidence shows that the appellants did attempt to communicate their demand for money both by having at least one alien call his relatives to tell them to send the money promised to the initial coyotes somewhere else and by calling at least one of the alien relatives themselves and asking for money in addition to what was given to the initial coyotes.
even if the appellants did not increase the amount of money requested by the original coyotes,they can still be convicted under the hta.just because the aliens were willingly with the first set of coyotes does mean they were willingly with the appellants.there is no requirement under the hta that there be an increase in the amount of money requested for criminal liability to attach instead,the test is when the relationship becomes as it did here when the appellants abducted the aliens from the apartment where they were initially.united states,cir there was a seizure within the meaning of a from the time the defendants began to hold the aliens in a manner that was not contemplated in the alien smuggling agreement.at that point,the aliens were no longer consensually in the custody of the smuggling defendants.the fact that they did demand more money than the initial coyotes did is irrelevant to the third prong of the hta.the government presented enough evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find all of the appellants guilty of violating the hostage taking act.
suppression of evidence 
and raise and,and adopt an argument that the district court erred in not suppressing the evidence of aliens and weapons found in the apartment because they were the product of an illegal search.as to appeal of the denial of his motion to suppress,this court reviews legal questions de novo and factual findings for clear error.de,at.and the other appellants who attempt to adopt this argument have waived their suppression arguments because they did not move to suppress any evidence in the district court.see united states,cir.
the police search of apartment rose out of the police stop of who agreed to return to her apartment to get her id after the other people in the car were handcuffed and detained.an officer testified that told him she did mind if he returned to her apartment with her,although she testified that the police threatened to arrest her if she did not return to get her id.the district court believed police testimony that this statement was never made to,and we do not find clear error with this factual finding.
the district court found that the initial stop was legitimate under terry ohio,d,and that during this stop,consented to take the police to her apartment.alternatively,the police accompaniment of to her apartment was part of the terry stop.while the police entry into the apartment was not consensual,the search was a valid protective sweep justified by exigent circumstances.later,after the police noticed suspicious behavior on the part of the appellants,the search in which the guns were found in the toilet tank was justified by probable cause.
argues that the district court determination that consent to an officer accompanying her to the apartment was voluntary was clearly erroneous.based on the factors that this circuit uses to determine voluntariness,united states tompkins,cir,contends it was error for the district court to find that no incriminating evidence would be found in the apartment and that there were no coercive police procedures used at the sight of the traffic stop.because of these errors,he argues,consent for the officers to accompany her to get her id was not voluntarily given.
first,we do not find clear error in the district court determination that the police treatment of at the traffic stop was not coercive.based on the district court credibility findings,was not told she would be arrested if she did not return to her apartment to get her id,nor was she handcuffed or threatened.secondly,we do not find fault with the district court finding that did not believe that incriminating evidence would be found.while it is clear that knew there were illegal aliens in her apartment,the district court found that did not know of a conspiracy to keep them as hostages and also heard testimony that the aliens in the apartment were told to say that they were at a party.therefore,the officer accompanying to her apartment was valid based on her voluntary consent.
at the time the officer entered the apartment with,we find that the search of the apartment was justified by exigent circumstances.the district court finding of exigent circumstances is a factual finding reviewed for clear error.de,at.there is particular deference to the judgment of experienced law enforcement officers concerning the risks of a particular situation.id.at quoting united states blount,cir en banc.
as in de,the circumstances in apartment made it necessary for the officer to search the premises to determine what safety risks there were to himself and his fellow officers.while waiting outside,the officer could hear multiple people moving around inside the apartment.the door was opened three to five minutes after first knocked,and the officer observed several people fleeing the apartment via the balcony at that time.because he was worried about a possible ambush or other danger to his fellow officers and any victims within the apart
