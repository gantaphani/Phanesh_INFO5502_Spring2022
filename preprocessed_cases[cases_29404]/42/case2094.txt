this is an appeal from a judgment dismissing claims challenging tennessee driver license law as violative of certain aliens right to equal protection and right to travel.on due consideration of plaintiffs complaint in light of the parties appellate arguments,we affirm the district court judgment that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
background 
for purposes of this appeal,plaintiffs in the action below include the league of united latin american citizens lulac,a organization dedicated to the advancement of the interests of the hispanic population in the united states yolanda lewis,a citizen of mexico and resident of tennessee,proceeding on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor son,sergio chavez and alex siguenza,a citizen of nicaragua and resident of tennessee.defendants,sued in their official capacities,are phil bredesen,governor of tennessee and fred phillips,commissioner of the tennessee department of safety.
in june,plaintiff alex siguenza attempted to renew his tennessee driver license in nashville.when he admitted that he was neither a united states citizen nor a lawful permanent resident,he was advised that he could not be issued a new driver license,but only a certificate for driving.on july,plaintiff yolanda lewis attempted to obtain a tennessee identification card for her old son,sergio chavez,in nashville.when she disclosed that sergio was neither a united states citizen nor a lawful permanent resident,she was told that he was not entitled to any identification document.as a permanent resident,plaintiff lewis,too,is not eligible for a driver license under tennessee law.
plaintiffs commenced this putative class action in the middle district of tennessee on july.plaintiff lulac proceeds on behalf of its members over throughout the united states lewis proceeds on behalf of herself and her minor son and all others similarly situated and siguenza proceeds on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated.the first amended complaint contains nine counts.only two are relevant to this appeal.both challenge provisions of public acts chapter,amending tennessee driver license law,which became effective july.in count i,plaintiffs proceed under and allege that ann.c c,conditioning issuance of a driver license upon proof of united states citizenship or lawful permanent resident status,is a classification based on alienage that denies them equal protection of the law.in count vi,plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment to the effect that ann.c c,by denying a driver license to some aliens,impermissibly burdens aliens fundamental right to travel.that lawful temporary resident aliens may obtain a certificate for driving instead,pursuant to ann.g,is said not to be an adequate substitute,because the certificate for driving,unlike a driver license,is explicitly not valid for identification.ann.plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin implementation of chapter and enjoin issuance of certificates for driving to aliens in lieu of driver licenses.plaintiffs also asked the court to require defendants to convert all certificates for driving already issued during into driver licenses.
in an opinion and order dated september,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction.league of united latin american citizens bredesen,wl.this ruling has not been appealed.on november,the court granted the state defendants motion to dismiss,thereby dismissing the claims contained in counts i and vi,which are the subject of this appeal.incorporating by reference the reasoning set forth in its opinion denying preliminary injunction,the district court held that neither the equal protection claim nor the right to travel claim stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.the court concluded that issuance of a certificate for driving instead of a driver license does not infringe aliens right to travel.id.at.the court also concluded that the classification,treating illegal aliens and lawful temporary resident aliens differently than lawful permanent resident aliens,does not discriminate against a suspect class and does not burden a fundamental right.the court therefore held that the classification is subject to rational basis scrutiny.applying rational basis scrutiny,the court went on to hold that the classification is rationally related to legitimate governmental purposes and is therefore not violative of equal protection.id.at.the district court dismissed the claims under.b.a final judgment order was entered on january,and this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
whether the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs claims under rule b is a question of law subject to de novo review.kottmyer maas,cir.the court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,accept all factual allegations as true and determine whether plaintiffs undoubtedly can prove no set of facts consistent with their allegations that would entitle them to relief.id.though decidedly liberal,this standard does require more than bare assertions of legal conclusions.bovee coopers lybrand,cir.plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of their entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of the cause of action.bell atlantic twombly,d.the factual allegations,assumed to be true,must do more than create speculation or suspicion of a legally cognizable cause of action they must show entitlement to relief.id.at.to state a valid claim,a complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain recovery under some viable legal theory.id.at.
in granting the state defendants motion to dismiss,the district court rejected their arguments that plaintiffs lacked standing to prosecute their claims.lulac,wl at.accepting the allegations of plaintiffs complaint at face value,the district court was satisfied that lulac met the requirements of organizational standing as defined in american civil liberties union of ohio foundation,ashbrook,cir 
the district court was similarly unpersuaded by the state defendants contention that only illegal aliens,who are not members of a suspect class and are therefore entitled only to minimal protection under the equal protection clause,would even arguably suffer the sort of harm that would confer standing to bring these claims,because only illegal aliens are denied both a driver license and a certificate for driving under the new tennessee law the court took note of plaintiffs allegations that lawful temporary resident aliens,as a result of being issued a not valid for identification certificate for driving in lieu of a driver license,could experience difficulties in producing satisfactory evidence of identification.see first amended complaint.this satisfactory evidence of identification is required under various provisions of tennessee law in order to render a person charged with a misdemeanor offense or traffic rule violation eligible for issuance of a citation in lieu of arrest.see,ann.c hence,plaintiffs impliedly allege that the denial of a driver license a makes it necessary for a lawful temporary resident alien to carry his or her passport other immigration documents for personal identification purposes and b increases the risk that he or she will be subject to arrest for any suspected minor infraction simply because a law enforcement officer may find his or her proof of identification unfamiliar and therefore unsatisfactory.the district court was satisfied that such alleged potential difficulties are sufficient to make out the requisite injury to confer standing on lawful temporary resident aliens who reside in tennessee.
on appeal,the state defendants do not challenge this latter ruling and we find no error in it as to lulac organizational standing,however,the state defendants renew their challenge,with a different twist.they contend,with reference to the standards set forth in aclu of ohio,that the complaint does not allege that any of the individually named plaintiffs is a lulac member or that any lulac member is a resident of tennessee otherwise eligible for a tennessee driver license or certificate for driving.absent such allegations,that a member is subject to an actual or threatened injury,defendants contend lulac can not satisfy the requirements of organizational standing.
plaintiffs respond first that this particular standing argument,having not been raised in the district court,has been effectively waived.indeed,the general rule is that the court of appeals will not review issues raised for the first time on appeal.barner pilkington,cir.however,inasmuch as standing is a threshold requirement,it must be addressed,even in the first instance on appeal,because the court of appeals is obliged to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits of the appeal.children healthcare is a legal duty,deters,cir batchelder,concurring collecting cases steel citizens for a better environment,d standing to sue is part of the common understanding of what it takes to make a justiciable case.
secondly,notwithstanding any technical deficiency in their complaint,plaintiffs insist the record establishes that both individually named plaintiffs,yolanda lewis and alex siguenza,who have alleged that they are residents of tennessee,see first amended complaint,are also members of lulac.indeed,their respective affidavits,filed in support of plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction,state that they are members of lulac.the affidavits also state that each is lawfully present in the united states and at least imply,consistent with the allegations of their complaint,that each is indeed a resident of tennessee.accepted at face value,the unrefuted affidavits appear to satisfactorily answer defendants reformulated standing challenge,demonstrating that lulac members are affected by the chapter changes to tennessee driver license law and that lulac therefore has organizational standing.
defendants argue that their standing challenge was made in their motion to dismiss under rule b and that the sufficiency of plaintiffs complaint should be tested based solely on the strength of its allegations,without assistance from matters outside the pleadings,like affidavits.yet,this precise argument,regarding the complaint failure to expressly allege that lulac members were harmed by chapter,was not made below,at a time when plaintiffs could have moved for and been freely granted leave to amend their complaint to cure the defect.see.a leave to amend shall be freely granted when justice so requires.now,as the argument is raised first on appeal,it would not serve justice to dismiss the appeal at this point because of a technical pleading deficiency,in the face of undisputed record facts confirming that plaintiffs actually do have standing and did have standing to prosecute their claims when the complaint was filed.see cleveland branch,naacp city of parma,ohio,cir standing is to be assessed under the facts existing when the complaint was filed.considering the present record in light of defendants particular standing challenge,we conclude that plaintiffs have adequately cleared this qualifying hurdle.see children healthcare,at.
we therefore find no error in the district court holding that plaintiffs have standing to proceed with their claims 
equal protection claim 
rational basis or heightened scrutiny a suspect class 
the district court dismissal of plaintiffs equal protection claim is based on the conclusion that the classification drawn by chapter,treating illegal aliens and lawful temporary resident aliens differently than lawful permanent resident aliens,is subject to rational basis scrutiny.ordinarily a state law classification that neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class will be upheld so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.vacco quill,d.plaintiffs contend the district court erred in applying rational basis scrutiny.they argue that issuance of certificates for driving instead of driver licenses to aliens who are not lawful permanent residents represents a classification that discriminates against a suspect class,aliens,and infringes their fundamental right to travel.these effects of tennessee driver license law are said to demand heightened scrutiny,requiring the court to carefully examine the governmental interest claimed to justify the discrimination and determine whether that interest is legitimate and substantial and whether the means adopted to achieve the goal are necessary and precisely drawn.nyquist mauclet,d quoting examining board flores de otero,d.
the district court recognized that aliens are persons and are protected under the equal protection clause.lulac,wl at.the court further recognized that a classification based on alienage is suspect,citing city of cleburne,texas cleburne living center,d.id.at.however,in reasoning clear and succinct,the court concluded that chapter does not discriminate based on alienage 
this case is not about citizens versus aliens.plaintiffs argue that classifications based on alienage are inherently suspect.but the statute at issue does not classify persons based on alienage.the statutory classification in this case is between citizens and lawful permanent resident aliens on the one hand,and illegal aliens and those aliens who are not permanent lawful residents,on the other hand.thus,the classification created by the drivers license legislation is not between aliens and citizens.the drivers license law does not distinguish among persons because of a protected classification.for instance,aliens can qualify for either a drivers license or a drivers certificate based on legitimate criteria other than alienage.instead,the classification is based on the legality of the alien presence in the country under federal law lawful permanent resident aliens illegal aliens the length of time the federal government has authorized the alien to stay in this country permanent temporary.thus,the court is not persuaded that the legislation burdens a suspect class,and should be subjected to strict scrutiny analysis.
id.footnote omitted.the district court went on to hold that illegal aliens are not a suspect class,citing plyler doe,d,and that the subclass of aliens legally admitted on a temporary basis is not a suspect class.id.at.
on appeal,plaintiffs neither argue nor cite authority for the proposition that illegal aliens are a suspect class.they assert only the interests of a distinct subclass of aliens those who are lawful temporary residents,aliens who are not lawful permanent residents aliens whose authorized presence is tied to a specific purpose or defined period of time they argue that a classification which affects only some but not all aliens,must still be scrutinized strictly.in support,they rely primarily on nyquist mauclet,where close judicial scrutiny was applied to strike down a state law that prevented some but not all resident aliens from receiving state financial assistance for higher education.at.indeed,the nyquist court held that the fact that the challenged statute discriminated against only a subclass of aliens did not obviate the need to apply heightened scrutiny.what was important to the nyquist court was that the state law classification was directed at aliens and that only aliens were harmed by it.id.at.
the district court distinguished nyquist on three bases the harm flowing from the classification the fact that the nyquist classification affected not just temporary,but also permanent resident aliens and the gravity of the state interest justifying the classification.lulac,wl at.we conclude that all three distinctions are material and we agree with the district court that they compel a different outcome here than in nyquist.
in nyquist,a subclass of aliens,including permanent resident aliens,was denied a significant privilege under new york law,state financial assistance for higher education.the nyquist court noted the unfairness implicit in disallowing permanent resident aliens,who were required to pay their full share of the taxes that supported the financial aid programs,from equal participation in those programs.at.under tennessee driver license law,in contrast,lawful temporary resident aliens are not denied driving privileges or any other privilege.inasmuch as a certificate for driving issued to a lawful temporary resident alien undisputedly affords him or her the same driving privileges that a driver license affords a citizen or lawful permanent resident alien,the instant subclass of aliens hardly suffers any cognizable harm as a direct result of the classification.
in fact,plaintiffs complaint is devoid of any allegation of actual harm suffered by a plaintiff.their claims are premised rather on the threat of harm stemming from the possibility that the passport or other personal identification document a lawful temporary resident alien may carry in lieu of a driver license may not be accepted by a law enforcement officer or other third party as satisfactory evidence of identification,to the alien detriment.this could lawfully occur only if there were objectively reasonable grounds to question the accuracy of the alien passport or other identification paper.see,supra.while such potential difficulties stemming from the classification may represent an injury within the zone of interests protected by the equal protection clause sufficient to confer standing,the fact that the claimed harm is so indirect and conjectural is not insignificant in determining whether heightened scrutiny of the state law classification is appropriate.the harm flowing from the denial of financial aid in nyquist was clearly more substantial than the hypothetical inconvenience or hardship posed by tennessee issuance of certificates for driving,instead of driver licenses,to lawful temporary residents.
the district court also distinguished nyquist on the ground that tennessee interests in maintaining highway safety and public safety are more compelling than were new york interests in limiting higher education financial aid to persons who were or would become eligible to vote.the district court deemed the issuance of certificates for driving to represent a reasonable exercise of traditional police power,allowing temporary resident aliens to operate motor vehicles without requiring the state to vouch for their identity.lulac,wl at noting state legitimate interest in preventing use of its governmental machinery to facilitate concealment of illegal aliens and other foreign nationals who may be involved in terrorist activities.
the district court observation that tennessee public safety interest is stronger than the interest presented in nyquist is plainly accurate.see nyquist,at.exposing weaknesses of new york asserted interests.of course,the strength of the governmental interest supporting the classification is most appropriately considered if and after the classification is found to result in discriminatory harm to members of a suspect class.yet,the governmental purpose is not entirely immaterial in determining the appropriate level of scrutiny.that the harm complained of is practically de minimis and results from the exercise of traditional police power are factors that distinguish this case from nyquist and counsel in favor of deferential review of the classification.
still,it is the district court third basis for distinguishing nyquist that is most important.in nyquist,the plaintiffs were lawful permanent resident aliens who were subject to discriminatory harm and were treated as members of a suspect class.the reason this is critical is well explained in leclerc webb,cir.in leclerc,the fifth circuit noted that,although classifications based on alienage are inherently suspect,the supreme court has employed strict scrutiny with respect to only one subclass of aliens lawful permanent residents.id.at.the state laws presented in cases such as nyquist were deemed to warrant close judicial scrutiny because they took positions seemingly inconsistent with the congressional determination to admit the alien to permanent residence.id.at quoting foley connelie,d emphasis added in leclerc.
the leclerc court explained at length why lawful temporary resident aliens,or nonimmigrant aliens,are not entitled to the same protection as lawful permanent resident aliens.id.at.in short,the court recognized that permanent resident aliens are virtual citizens who are legally entrenched in society but who lack the ability to participate in the political process.id.at.this inability renders them a prime example of a discrete and insular minority for whom heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.id.quoting in re griffiths,d.permanent resident aliens are similarly situated to citizens in economic,social,and civic conditions as well.like citizens,they pay taxes,support the economy,serve in the armed forces,and are entitled to reside permanently in the united states.id.at.
temporary resident aliens,on the other hand,are admitted to the united states only for the duration of their authorized status,are not permitted to serve in the military,are subject to strict employment restrictions,incur differential tax treatment,and may be denied federal welfare benefits.id.at.because of these aggregate factual and legal differences,the leclerc court declined to hold that nonimmigrant lawful temporary resident aliens comprise a suspect class entitled to the extraordinary protection of strict scrutiny we decline to extend the supreme court decisions concerning permanent resident aliens to different alien categories when the court itself has shied away from such expansion.id.at.the court went on to hold that rational basis review is the appropriate standard for evaluating state law classifications affecting nonimmigrant aliens.id.at.
we find the analysis set forth in leclerc to be persuasive.there are abundant good reasons,both legal and pragmatic,why lawful permanent residents are the only subclass of aliens who have been treated as a suspect class.this case presents no compelling reason why the special protection afforded by recognition should be extended to lawful temporary resident aliens.because the instant classification does not result in discriminatory harm to members of a suspect class,it is subject only to rational basis scrutiny.
the appropriateness of this conclusion is underscored by the fact that the classification drawn by tennessee law,unlike that presented in nyquist,is in no way inconsistent with federal law,but rather mirrors it.as the district court observed,chapter does not deny any benefit of state law to lawful temporary resident aliens.it merely serves to deny proof of identification to any alien whose presence the federal government has refrained from permanently authorizing,so as to avoid the appearance that the state of tennessee is vouching for his or her identity.the alien issued a certificate for driving is free to drive on the highways of tennessee and free to use his or her own passport or other identification papers as needed.despite plaintiffs efforts to depict chapter as reflective of invidious discrimination against aliens warranting close judicial scrutiny,the classification drawn is,on its face,sensible and directly derivative of aliens status under immigration law 
b fundamental right to travel 
plaintiffs correctly argue that even in the absence of a suspect class,a classification warrants strict scrutiny if it burdens the exercise of a fundamental right.they argue that denial of a driver license that may be used for identification purposes burdens their fundamental right to travel.the district court recognized that the supreme court has recognized a protected right to interstate travel,saenz roe,d,and the sixth circuit has recognized a protected right to intrastate travel,a right to travel locally through public spaces and roadways,johnson city of cincinnati,cir.lulac,wl at.yet,the district court held the protected right to travel does not embody a right to a driver license or a right to a particular mode of transportation,citing duncan cone,wl cir.unpublished holding there is no fundamental right to drive a motor vehicle.john doe georgia dep t of public safety,d,observing that the circuit courts have uniformly held that burdens on a single mode of transportation do not implicate the right to interstate travel,and collecting cases.further,the district court held that the right to travel,whatever its contours,is not infringed by chapter because a person who receives a certificate for driving is able to operate a motor vehicle just like a person who receives a driver license.lulac,wl at.potential difficulties that may be experienced by one who does not have a driver license to use for identification purposes were held not to implicate the right to travel.
in saenz,the supreme court identified three components of the right to travel it protects the right of a citizen of one state to enter and to leave another state,the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second state,and,for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents,the right to be treated like other citizens in that state.at.plaintiffs have not identified,nor have we uncovered,any authority for the proposition that lawful temporary resident aliens enjoy the same fundamental right to travel that citizens do.yet,even assuming temporary resident aliens right to travel is constitutionally protected,the question remains whether such right is impermissibly burdened by chapter.
a state law implicates the right to travel when it actually deters travel,when impeding travel is its primary objective,or when it uses a classification that serves to penalize the exercise of the right.attorney general of new york,d.tennessee issuance of certificates for driving,which confer all the same driving privileges as driver licenses,is clearly not designed primarily to impede travel and can hardly be said to deter or penalize travel.the state denial of photograph identification to temporary resident aliens may arguably result in inconvenience,requiring the bearer of a certificate for driving to carry other personal identification papers,but this inconvenience can hardly be said to deter or penalize travel.to the extent this inconvenience burdens exercise of the right to travel at all,the burden is incidental and negligible,insufficient to implicate denial of the right to travel.see town of southold town of east hampton,cir collecting cases recognizing that even citizens do not have a constitutional right to the most convenient form of travel.something more than a negligible or minimal impact on the right to travel is required before strict scrutiny is applied.state of kansas united states.
plaintiffs contend it is conceivable that they could prove the certificate for driving might not be accepted by an insurance company as satisfactory evidence of identification.if they could not obtain automobile insurance,they argue,they would be prevented from driving legally in tennessee.while the argument is conceivable,it is hardly plausible.plaintiffs offer no reason to believe any insurance company would find a passport or other personal identification document,presented in conjunction with a certificate for driving,inadequate for issuance of automobile insurance even if such an eventuality were deemed plausible,its occurrence and the resulting incidental burden on travel would hardly be attributable to chapter,but rather to a private entity exercise of business discretion.plaintiffs argument is simply too speculative,factually and legally,to justify the conclusion that their right to travel is impermissibly burdened by issuance of a certificate for driving that is not valid for identification.
accordingly,we find no error in the district court determination that rational basis scrutiny applies,because chapter implicates neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right.
rational relationship to legitimate government purpose 
under traditional rational basis scrutiny,a state law classification will be upheld so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.vacco,at.the reason for such deferential review is explained as follows 
the initial discretion to determine what is different and what is the same resides in the legislatures of the states.a legislature must have substantial latitude to establish classifications that roughly approximate the nature of the problem perceived,that accommodate competing concerns both public and private,and that account for limitations on the practical ability of the state to remedy every ill.in applying the equal protection clause to most forms of state action,we thus seek only the assurance that the classification at issue bears some fair relationship to a legitimate public purpose.
leclerc,at quoting plyler,at.
the district court accepted that chapter classification was designed to serve homeland security interests by indicating to third parties that the state of tennessee does not vouch for the identity of the person holding a certificate for driving while at the same time allowing the holder of the certificate to validly operate a motor vehicle in tennessee.the court concluded that the balancing of interests achieved by issuing certificates for driving to aliens who are not lawful permanent residents is rationally related to this purpose.
plaintiffs do not directly challenge this aspect of the district court ruling.they argue that,irrespective of the level of scrutiny employed,the classification must be carefully examined to ensure that it rationally furthers some legitimate,articulated purpose.this careful examination can hardly be conducted,they contend,based on the pleadings alone pursuant to rule b.
in urging this careful or stringent examination,plaintiffs rely on cases that addressed discriminatory treatment of suspect classes,cases that employed heightened scrutiny.see examining board,at.griffiths,at.however,a classification such as chapter,subject to rational basis review,is accorded a strong presumption of validity.heller doe by doe,d.the state has no obligation to produce evidence sustaining the rationality of the classification.id.at.to overcome this strong presumption of validity,a challenger has the burden of negating all possible rational justifications for the classification.gean hattaway,cir.
plaintiffs have not carried this burden either in their pleadings or in their appellate arguments.the district court conclusion that the state refraining from vouching for the identity of aliens who have not been granted permanent resident status by the federal government but whose permission to stay here is tied to a specific purpose or period of legitimate and rationally served by chapter has not been shown to be erroneous.for the reasons set forth above,it is apparent that,even upon viewing the allegations of plaintiffs complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,they fail to set forth a factual basis upon which relief can be granted under the equal protection clause.that the classification might ultimately be shown to have been drawn unnecessarily broadly and to result in differential treatment and even inconvenience is of no consequence where the classification is subject only to deferential rational basis scrutiny.see heller,at.observing that a classification does not fail rational basis review simply because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because it results in some inequality.this is because,under rational basis review,the court is obliged to accept a legislature generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends.id.
accordingly,plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the challenged classification is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.the district court dismissal of their equal protection claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted must therefore be affirmed.
right to travel claim 
plaintiffs have asserted their constitutionally protected right to travel in two contexts first,in support of their argument in support of their count i equal protection claim that chapter should be subjected to strict scrutiny and second,in support of their separate count vi claim for infringement of their fundamental right to travel.as outlined above,the district court determined that plaintiffs claims fail to adequately allege that their right to travel is actually burdened by chapter.for the same reasons that the district court properly concluded that the asserted infringement of the right to travel does not warrant strict scrutiny of chapter,it also properly concluded that count vi fails to state a proper claim.we therefore uphold the district court dismissal of the count vi.
iii.conclusion 
plaintiffs arguments for heightened scrutiny of chapter are based on allegations too conclusory and conjectural to justify the inferences required to satisfy the essential elements of their claims.their claims do not,therefore,withstand scrutiny even under the decidedly liberal standard of rule b.accordingly,the judgment of the district court,dismissing plaintiffs count i claim for denial of equal protection as well as their count vi claim for violation of their right to travel,is affirmed.
the majority concludes that the district court properly applied review to a tennessee law that differentiates between temporary resident legal aliens alternately referred to as nonimmigrant aliens and permanent resident legal aliens alternately referred to as immigrant aliens.because i believe that this classification discriminates against a suspect class,i dissent on the ground that the district court should have applied strict scrutiny instead of review.see graham richardson,d c lassifications based on alienage,like those based on nationality or race,are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.
a key consequence of applying strict scrutiny is that the burden of proof shifts from the plaintiffs to the defendants.compare midkiff adams county reg l water,cir under rational basis review,a plaintiff faces a severe burden and must negate all possible rational justifications for the distinction.quotation marks omitted,with middleton city of flint,cir under strict scrutiny,the defendant must prove that it had a compelling state interest when it enacted its plan,and that the plan is narrowly tailored to further that compelling state interest.i therefore believe that we should remand the case to the district court for a more complete development of the record under the proper standard of review.
lulac challenges a tennessee state law that precludes temporary resident legal aliens from obtaining a full driver license.they can instead obtain only a driver certificate,which entitles them to the same driving privileges as both permanent resident legal aliens and citizens,but denies them the benefit of official state identification.in fact,the certificates state in bold letters not valid for identification,or some substantially similar phrase.the principal issue in this case is whether the tennessee law differentiation between permanent and temporary resident legal aliens implicates a suspect class so as to warrant strict scrutiny.the majority concludes that it does not,and that review is accordingly the proper standard.to support this conclusion,the majority relies on the majority opinion in the only other case to have decided this precise issue leclerc webb,cir.curiously,neither party cited leclerc in their briefing.
in leclerc,the principal reason that the fifth circuit declined to extend strict scrutiny to laws discriminating against nonimmigrant aliens was that the supreme court itself has shied away from such expansion.at.the majority finds this reasoning persuasive.op.at.to be sure,the supreme court has never specifically held that temporary resident legal aliens,as a subset of all aliens,are a suspect class for purposes.but this silence alone proves little.as an initial matter,equal protection is not one of those substantive areas of the law where,as in the case of qualified immunity under or federal habeas corpus under aedpa,the degree to which supreme court precedent is clearly established determines the likelihood of relief.
in addition,the supreme court has addressed classifications in state laws only a handful of times since inordinately small sample size from which to conclude with certainty either that the classifications addressed in those cases collectively constitute an exhaustive list or that an classification would necessarily receive different treatment from the court.a closer look at three of those cases strongly suggests that a classification of the kind at issue here would receive the same strict scrutiny that each of the classifications in those cases received.
the first case is takahashi fish game comm n,where the supreme court applied strict scrutiny to,and ultimately held unconstitutional,a california law that prohibited only those lawful aliens who were not eligible for federal group that,at the time,included all japanese fishing in the ocean off of the state shores.even though the classification was only,as opposed to all aliens versus citizens,the court found strict scrutiny to be appropriate.the court noted in relevant part that 
a ll of the foregoing emphasizes the tenuousness of the state claim that it has power to single out and ban its lawful alien inhabitants,and particularly certain racial and color groups within this class of inhabitants,from following a vocation simply because congress has put some such groups in special classifications in exercise of its broad and wholly distinguishable powers over immigration and naturalization.
id.at.similarly,the court determined that california justification for the law was inadequate to justify california in excluding any or all aliens who are lawful residents of the state from making a living by fishing in the ocean off its shores while permitting all others to do so.id.at.
lulac persuasively argues that the classification at issue in the present case is in effect the same as that at issue in is,between citizens and those aliens eligible for citizenship,on the one hand,and all other aliens,on the only permanent resident legal aliens are eligible for citizenship under federal law.the majority,however,does not address this argument in its opinion.
graham richardson,d,is the second case on point.the supreme court,citing takahashi,again applied strict scrutiny to,and ultimately held unconstitutional,an arizona law that denied welfare benefits to those aliens who failed to meet a durational residency requirement.all other aliens,as well as citizens,were exempt.id.at.the court reiterated its prior precedent that whatever may be the scope of the constitutional right of interstate travel,aliens lawfully within this country have a right to enter and abide in any state in the union on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under nondiscriminatory laws.id.at.quoting takahashi,at.emphasis added.most importantly,graham made explicit what the analysis in takahashi and the rest of the court alienage jurisprudence had necessarily,that classifications based on alienage,like those based on nationality or race,are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny because a liens as a class are a prime example of a discrete and insular minority for whom such heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.id.at.citing united states carolene prods.footnotes omitted.
the third and final case on point is nyquist mauclet,d,where the supreme court,citing graham,applied strict scrutiny to,and ultimately held unconstitutional,a new york law barring only certain resident aliens from receiving financial assistance from the state for higher education.those resident legal aliens who had applied for citizenship,as well as those who were not yet qualified for citizenship but had filed statements indicating an intent to qualify and apply,were exempt from the prohibition and allowed to participate in the assistance program.id.at.most pertinently,the court stated that t he fact that the challenged statute is not an absolute bar against all aliens does not mean that it does not discriminate against the class.id.at.instead,t he important points are that the challenged statute is directed at aliens and that only aliens are harmed by it.id.
the majority adopts virtually the entirety of the leclerc majority analysis to distinguish the supreme court precedents discussed above,but it does so without even mentioning the numerous criticisms to which that analysis has been subject.in so doing,it also overlooks many of the plaintiffs related arguments on appeal.a brief review of the procedural history in leclerc reveals the considerable those criticisms.
leclerc was a consolidated appeal from two diametrically opposed opinions from the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana.in leclerc webb,d,the district court determined that a louisiana law precluding nonimmigrant aliens from sitting for the state bar exam was subject to only review.in contrast,a different judge on the same court in wallace calogero,d,held that the law triggered strict scrutiny because nonimmigrant aliens were part of the general resident alien suspect class.this difference in the applicable standard of review,moreover,proved dispositive the district court in leclerc upheld the law,d at,whereas the court in wallace declared it unenforceable,d at.
the debate continued once the cases had been consolidated for appeal before the fifth circuit.judge stewart issued a lengthy and detailed dissent to judge jones majority opinion.in his dissent,judge stewart vigorously disputed the majority conclusion that nonimmigrant aliens were not a suspect class and that laws discriminating against them were therefore subject to only review.as an initial matter,judge stewart dismissed as unfounded the majority wariness about expanding strict scrutiny review to nonimmigrant aliens as a distinctive suspect class in the absence of a black letter holding by the supreme court to that effect.leclerc,at stewart,dissenting.he instead emphasized that the supreme court statement in graham that alienage is a suspect class by definition includes nonimmigrant aliens as part of that class.id.the court caselaw has only reinforced that literal meaning,in judge stewart opinion,because the court has still spoken of a general alien suspect class d espite the court familiarity with the distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant aliens.id.at.
judge stewart especially took exception to the majority heavy reliance on the statement in application of griffiths,d,that r esident aliens,like citizens,pay taxes,support the economy,serve in the armed forces,and contribute in myriad other ways to our society.first,he noted that nonimmigrant aliens,as a matter of fact,do pay taxes,support the economy and contribute in other ways to our society.leclerc,at stewart,dissenting.in addition,he argued that a focus on an aliens sic ability to serve in the armed forces or pay taxes is misplaced because,as a matter of law,the basis for aliens suspect class designation seems to be premised on aliens inability to vote,and thus their impotence in the political process,and the long history of invidious discrimination against them.id.at citing plyler doe,d,erwin chemerinsky,constitutional law,and takahashi.
the supreme court caselaw directly supports judge stewart criticism.see,regents of the of bakke,d noting that,although the court has never held that discreteness and insularity constitute necessary preconditions to a holding that a particular classification is invidious,these elements have been relied upon in recognizing a suspect class in only one group of cases,those involving aliens citing graham,at.foley connelie,d clarifying that the graham court rationale for subjecting classifications to heightened judicial solicitude was that their eligibility for no direct voice in the political processes citing carolene,at.see also recent cases,fifth circuit holds that louisiana can prevent nonimmigrant aliens from sitting for the bar,harv,that nonimmigrant aliens work under a different tax structure,can not serve in the military,and face mandatory departure from the united states,for example,does not justify offering them less constitutional protection if anything,these restrictions render them more powerless and vulnerable to state discrete and insular.citing carolene,at.emphasis added.
judge stewart dissent was not the fifth circuit final word on leclerc.following the decision of the panel,the plaintiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc.the court denied the petition by the narrowest possible vote of to.leclerc webb,cir.two of the seven judges who would have reheard the case en banc filed dissenting opinions from the denial of the petition.in addition to judge stewart,who effectively reprised his original dissent,judge higginbotham used pointed language to highlight both the weaknesses and the consequential dangers in the majority analysis.he described the majority decision to exclude nonimmigrant aliens from designation as a bold step not sanctioned by supreme court precedent.id.at higginbotham,dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.judge higginbotham also criticized the majority for its puzzling silence in ignoring the doctrine of federal preemption,or what he referred to as the trumping constitutional power of the federal government in controlling the nation borders,including matters of immigration and naturalization.id.specifically,he found that the majority decision to relax scrutiny of state regulation of aliens as the federal regulation of them is increased is too ambitious for me.id.at see also id.at calling the leclerc majority reasoning perverse and exactly backwards because,in draw ing distinctions between different classes of aliens,it shifts responsibility over aliens from the congress to the states.
commentators have also questioned the analysis in leclerc.one has referred to the majority opinion as a and bureaucratic decision that misconstrues precedent and misapplies equal protection analysis.recent cases,harv.at.most counterintuitive,in that commentator opinion,was the majority insistence on nonimmigrant aliens temporariness given that the supreme court has never differentiated equal protection review based on status as an immigrant or a nonimmigrant alien and that the governing cases also appear to downplay the relevance of aliens transience.id.at see also leclerc,at stewart,dissenting despite the court familiarity with the distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant aliens,the court has still spoken of a general alien suspect class.this nondifferentiation,moreover,could be,and has been,read as implying that the precise status is not the supreme court focus,as long as it is a legal status.kathleen ann harrison,leclerc webb rational scrutiny analysis of equal protection claims by nonimmigrant aliens.indeed,as discussed in greater detail below,the only exception to the graham rule that aliens are a suspect class is in regard to illegal aliens.see plyler,at.we reject the claim that illegal aliens are a suspect class.
no matter the specific nature of their respective criticisms,the commentators have shared judge higginbotham overarching concern about leclerc bold step and its significance for the future.that is,the exclusion of nonimmigrant aliens from designation may be setting a dangerous precedent that could serve to erode the rights of nonimmigrants in other contexts.harrison.at see also recent cases,harv.rev at p ermitting state governments to single out nonimmigrant aliens in this manner could promote employment discrimination based on seemingly neutral qualities like transience.those other contexts,of course,could be significantly more harmful to nonimmigrants as a class than the exclusion from a state bar exam,as in leclerc,or the inability to obtain a regular state driver license,as in the present case.
the majority here,however,fails to address any of these criticisms and,in fact,never acknowledges that there was a dissent in leclerc at all.even the majority in leclerc itself recognized the closeness of the issue,conceding that the relevant supreme court precedent contained some ambiguity.at.although my specific reasons for dissenting largely mirror those already expressed by judges stewart and higginbotham,and in turn are echoed by the commentators,i believe that a larger jurisprudential principle is driving the debate.
at its most basic level,my disagreement with the majority here and in leclerc is a fundamental difference of opinion regarding the proper role of the federal circuit courts in addressing issues that the supreme court itself has never specifically resolved.the majority appears to adopt the cautionary approach of th
