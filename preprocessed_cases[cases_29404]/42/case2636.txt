besem selimi and his wife aisha on her own behalf and that of their three,kujtesa,and separate motions to reopen their exclusion proceedings in order to obtain asylum,withholding of deportation,or protection under article of the united nations convention against torture of cat,pub,stat.the board of immigration appeals denied their motions and they appealed.the appeals raise essentially the same issues and have been consolidated for our consideration.
besem selimi is an ethnic albanian citizen of macedonia.he was granted lawful permanent residence in the united states in.at that time,his wife and daughters,also ethnic albanian citizens of macedonia,remained behind in that country.two years later,in may,selimi traveled to macedonia to bring his wife,his daughters,and a cousin back with him to this country.selimi,her daughters,and the cousin traveled with falsified yugoslavian passports.
as is recounted in an earlier case,selimi ins,cir,when they arrived in new york they were detained by the immigration and naturalization service ins.selimi admitted to purchasing falsified passports for his family,and the ins proceeded to charge him with excludability for alien smuggling pursuant to a e i,the immigration and naturalization act ina.selimi conceded excludability and,following an evidentiary hearing,an immigration judge ij found him ineligible for a waiver.he appealed to the board of immigration appeals,which affirmed the ij decision.we dismissed a petition for review of that decision.
the ins also placed selimi and her daughters in exclusion proceedings,charging them with immigration violations in that they fraudulently procured a visa or other documentation and sought to procure entry into the united states by willfully misrepresenting a material fact were not in possession of valid nonimmigrant visas were not in possession of valid travel documents and were not in possession of valid immigrant visas.they eventually conceded excludability and indicated an intent to seek asylum.however,they did not actually apply for asylum at that time,despite having their case continued for that purpose.
following a hearing in,the ij ordered selimi and her daughters excluded.they did not appeal that decision.neither did they depart this country.as a consequence,they were ordered to present themselves for deportation on april.
as we said,all of the selimis filed motions to reopen the proceedings against them.on june,selimi wanted to reopen his exclusion proceedings to enable him to present evidence of a change in country conditions in macedonia.he contended that the conflict between albanian separatists and the macedonian military,which began in january,constituted a change in country conditions relevant to his previously filed applications for asylum and withholding of deportation,as well as a potential basis for protection under cat.his request was summarily dismissed for failure to satisfy the requirements of c.the board noted that selimi had never been arrested or otherwise bothered by macedonian authorities,except on one occasion when his house was searched,and that he did not meet the essential statutory or regulatory requirements that the new evidence sought to be offered was material and not available at the former hearing.
selimi and her daughters also sought to reopen their exclusion proceedings in order to allow them to apply for asylum,withholding of exclusion,and for protection under cat.they argued that country conditions in macedonia had changed to such an extent since their last hearing that they had a fear of future persecution and that it was more likely than not that they would be tortured if they returned to macedonia.along with the motion,selimi presented,on her own behalf and that of her daughters,an application for asylum and withholding of deportation,dated april.
on july,the ij denied selimi motion to reopen proceedings,finding that the motion did not fall within the regulatory exception for untimely reopening and that she had offered insufficient evidence to warrant reopening.the ij found that she did not allege that she was ever harmed in the past or tortured in macedonia because of her albanian nationality,nor did she present documents or evidence that she supported any albanian separatist group,which would make her a target for harm.finally,the ij found that selimi case should not be reopened as a matter of discretion because she did not provide any reason why she failed to depart when she was originally ordered to leave in.the board dismissed her appeal on january,finding,in part,that she failed to show prima facie eligibility for relief.
the issue before us is whether the board denial of the motions to reopen the proceedings constituted an abuse of discretion.it is undisputed that the cases arise under former a of the ina,a,as modified by the transitional rules for judicial review of deportation orders in c of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,a.these provisions govern review of all final orders of deportation issued after october,in cases commenced before april,the effective date of iirira.
the board has broad discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a motion to reopen,see ins abudu,d,and,in fact,a motion to reopen is strongly disfavored.ins doherty,d.as the supreme court has emphasized,there is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases.abudu,at.
under the regulations applicable to these proceedings,motions to reopen must be filed within days after the date on which the final administrative decision was made or on or before september.c.the selimis motions are far outside the time limits.however,the time limits do not apply to a motion to reopen the proceedings t o apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.c ii.similarly,even a timely motion to reopen can not be granted unless it appears to the board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing c.
the supreme court has set out at least three independent grounds on which the board may deny a motion to reopen.first,it may determine that the applicant has not established a prima facie case for the underlying relief.secondly,it may determine that the applicant has not introduced previously unavailable,material evidence or,in the case of an asylum application,that the applicant has not reasonably explained his failure to apply for asylum initially.finally,if the relief requested is discretionary,the board may simply determine that the applicant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief.abudu,at.
the decisions on both and selimi motions are somewhat muddled and therefore a bit difficult to review.there is an indication in both decisions that the motions were denied for a failure to meet the exception to the time limitation for filing a motion.particularly in selimi application,we find the statement that w e agree with the immigration judge that the applicants have failed to establish that they have been targeted for persecution or torture in the past or that they will be in the future as required for the regulatory exception for timely filing of a motion.emphasis added.it is certainly arguable that the selimis rely on events in macedonia occurring in early,evidence about which was,of course,not available at the time of their original proceedings or,indeed,within days thereafter.
the most clearly stated basis for the administrative decisions,however,is that the selimis failed to make out a prima facie claim for asylum,withholding of exclusion,or protection under cat.it is on this basis that the decisions must be upheld unless they constitute an abuse of discretion.
under the ina,an alien is eligible for a discretionary grant of asylum if he is a refugee.a refugee is one wh
