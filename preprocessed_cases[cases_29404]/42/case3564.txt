background 
valadez first entered the united states without inspection in december of at the age of sixteen,and resided in the united states thereafter,although he visited his family in mexico for about four months in,three weeks in,and a month in.in,his brother gave him a state of texas birth certificate for robert louis moreno.valadez used that birth certificate to obtain a california driver license in the name of robert moreno so that he could more easily obtain and maintain employment.
in january of,valadez again left the country for mexico he traveled by airplane to mexico so that his then fiancée could meet his family.following his return flight to the houston,texas airport on february,he attempted to use the false texas birth certificate and the driver license to reenter the united states under the name of robert moreno.he was asked a few questions by the primary immigration inspector,who,unsatisfied with the responses,sent him to a secondary inspection officer for intensified inspection.
the secondary inspector asked valadez questions about his family based on the birth certificate.after valadez gave contradictory answers,the inspector left to gather more information about robert moreno.when the inspector returned,valadez continued to assert that he was robert moreno.it was not until the secondary inspector confronted valadez with biographical information about the real robert moreno height,weight,presence of tattoos,which was inconsistent with valadez appearance,that he confessed his true identity.the officer found that he was an excludable alien and gave him the option of either seeing an ij or withdrawing his application for admission and voluntarily returning to mexico.valadez chose the latter option and signed a document which stated,among other things,a lthough i understand i may choose to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing in exclusion proceedings,i request that i be permitted to withdraw my application for admission and return abroad.that request was granted,and he returned to mexico that same day,but a few days later he reentered the united states without inspection.
valadez married his current wife,a united states citizen,on july.the couple first child,a united states citizen,was born on september.their second child,also a united states citizen,was born on february.valadez applied for adjustment of status in december of,but his application was denied on november,on the basis that he was ineligible due to his false claim of united states citizenship.see a.
on february,removal proceedings were initiated against valadez.the notice to appear charged that he was subject to removal under a a i as an alien present in the united states without being admitted,and under a c ii as an alien who has falsely represented himself to be a united states citizen.following a hearing on august,in which valadez testified regarding the alleged false claim to citizenship incident,the ij found that he was removable under a c ii.the ij found that valadez had made a false claim of citizenship in when attempting to gain entry,and that he did not timely retract that false claim.
in november of,valadez submitted an application for cancellation of removal based upon hardship to his wife and children.at the hearing on february,the department of homeland security argued that valadez was ineligible for cancellation of removal because his withdrawal of his application for admission at the houston airport and subsequent immediate voluntary return to mexico interrupted his continuous physical presence in the united states,as a result of which he had not been here for ten years immediately preceding the date of his application for cancellation of removal.see b a.following the hearing,the ij determined that the february rejection of his application for admission,followed by his immediate departure from the united states while under custodial control,disrupted the continuity of his required years of domicile in the united states.as a result,the ij denied the application for cancellation of removal.
the bia dismissed valadez appeal.in so doing,it independently reviewed the ij findings and agreed that valadez was not entitled to adjustment of status.see a.it held that valadez presentation of a texas birth certificate to immigration officers constituted a false claim of united states citizenship.it also held that valadez did not timely retract his claim of citizenship because he failed to correct his misrepresentation prior to its exposure as a falsity.it finally held that his withdrawal of his application for admission and return to mexico broke his physical presence in the united states.that precluded him from obtaining cancellation of removal relief.valadez timely petitioned this court for review.
jurisdiction and standards of review 
we have jurisdiction to entertain valadez petition for review.see.
when,as here,the bia conducts an independent review of the ij findings,this court reviews the bia decision and not that of the ij.poblete mendoza holder,cir.we review findings of fact for substantial evidence.see blanco mukasey,cir see also ins,d.we apply the principles of deference described in chevron,natural resources defense council,d when we confront questions implicating the bia construction of the statute which it administers.ins,d.
discussion 
valadez complains of the bia determination that he was not eligible for adjustment of status,and that he was not eligible for cancellation of removal.we will consider each of those complaints in turn.
adjustment of status false claim of citizenship 
the parties do not dispute that valadez can not obtain adjustment of status if he is inadmissible.see a.as we will explain,because of his actions at the border on february,when he applied to reenter,he is inadmissible.
there can be no doubt that an alien who falsely represents,or has falsely represented,himself or herself to be a citizen of the united states for any purpose or benefit under this chapter or any other federal or state law is inadmissible.a c ii i.moreover,an alien has the burden of establishing clearly and beyond doubt that he is entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section.c a see also pichardo ins,cir same.beyond that,a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the united states is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.b c pichardo,at same.
the citizenship claim 
there is no dispute that when valadez tried to enter the country with his fiancé,he knew that he was not legally entitled to do so,but presented robert moreno birth certificate so that he could enter without difficulty.of course,he had previously assumed moreno identity in order to obtain a driver license and,thus,obtain work in the united states.he saw use of the birth certificate as a means of obtaining entry into the united states when he had no other means available.the evidence of his claim of citizenship is not quite as strong as it would have been if valadez had actually signed a statement admitting that he had falsely claimed citizenship or pled guilty to the crime of so doing nevertheless,it can not be said that the bia determination that valadez intended to and did make a false claim of united states citizenship at that time was so unfounded that no reasonable factfinder could so determine,at.at.indeed,in this civil proceeding we are almost asked to take a flight of fancy when we are asked to believe that valadez was not asserting citizenship at that time we are not that gormless about life in the real world.that would seem to be an end to valadez claim,but,he correctly asserts,we have taken a somewhat different approach in a series of cases dealing with for violating a criminal statute 
the cases upon which valadez relies are largely distinguishable on their facts.in karaouni,at,for example,the actual defect was that karaouni only stated that he was a citizen or national of the united states,and,therefore,did not state that he was a citizen.and in smiley,at,the defendant once stated that he was a citizen,but did not say of which country.we found that to be insufficient.another time,smiley told a police officer that he was born in new york,but in circumstances where citizenship may well have been the farthest thing from his mind.id.that,too,was insufficient.on the other hand,garcia,at,applied smiley in quite different statement in this country to a border patrol agent.that case would have more force in our consideration of this case were garcia not a criminal prosecution.that,however,leads to the most salient and determinative distinguishing mark.
the strongest riposte to valadez thrust is the very fact that the cases cited were criminal prosecutions where the defendant had to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and we,therefore,were very concerned about the quality of the evidence here,on the other hand,the burden of persuasion is reversed for,again,the alien has the burden of proving that he is not inadmissible clearly and beyond doubt.c a.that makes all the difference in the world.valadez was required to clearly show that he was not inadmissible,and he did not offset the strong inference that his activities at the border constituted a claim of united states citizenship.
in fine,the bia did not improperly determine that valadez had falsely represented himself to be a citizen of the united states.id.a c ii i.
recantation 
valadez next asserts that if he did initially make a false claim,he retracted it and,therefore,should not have been found inadmissible.we disagree.
the doctrine of timely recantation is of long standing and ameliorates what would otherwise be an unduly harsh result for some individuals,who,despite a momentary lapse,simply have humanity usual failings,but are being truthful for all practical purposes.see united states,cir.the bia has recognized the virtue of applying that principle when an alien voluntarily and prior to any exposure of the attempted fraud corrected his testimony that he was an alien lawfully residing in the united states.matter of m,bia see also matter of,bia.
valadez attempt to wrap himself in that cloak of goodness fails because he overlooks the important limitation on the principle.as we have pointed out,when a person supposedly recants only when confronted with evidence of his prevarication,the amelioration is not available.see,at.not surprisingly,the bia has taken the same position for immigration cases it has pointed out,recantation must be voluntary and without delay.matter of namio,bia.and,when the retraction was not made until it appeared that the disclosure of the falsity of the statements was imminent,it is evident that the recantation was neither voluntary nor timely.id.
here valadez did not recant until he knew that his false representations would not succeed in getting him admitted into the country it is pellucid that the bia did not err when it determined that valadez could not take advantage of the timely recantation doctrine.
cancellation of removal 
valadez asserts that because he made his illegal entry into the united states in december,and has left for short periods only,he was present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding his application for cancellation of removal relief.b a see also gutierrez mukasey,cir same.of course,the period was interrupted when he was placed in removal proceedings in february of.see gonzales,cir.he is correct that not every brief departure will interrupt the period of continuous physical presence.see d.gonzales,cir.however,some absences will interrupt the alien physical presence,even if those absences are brief.see tapia gonzales,cir.
the bia has held that when an alien applies for entrance to this country and that is denied at the point of entry,the rule is 
a n immigration official refusal to admit an alien at a land border port of entry will not constitute a break in the alien continuous physical presence,unless there is evidence that the alien was formally excluded or made subject to an order of expedited removal,was offered and accepted the opportunity to withdraw his or her application for admission,or was subjected to any other formal,documented process pursuant to which the alien was determined to be inadmissible to the united states.
in re,bia en banc.valadez was turned away at a border port of entry,but he argues that the cases provide for considerably broader protection than that set forth by the bia.he essentially asserts that continuous physical presence may be broken if an alien is caught within the country and voluntarily departs in lieu of proceedings pursuant to a formal agreement,but it is not broken if,as in this case,he is stopped at the border and ultimately turned away.however,his formulation is far too simplistic because the mere occurrence of a border stop is insufficient to answer the continuous physical presence issue.as explained in further detail below,what the bia and this court have actually held is that a knowing and voluntary departure in lieu of more formal proceedings will interrupt continuous physical presence.
on the one hand,the bia has declared that when t he alien leaves with the knowledge that he does so in lieu of being placed in proceedings,he can have no legitimate expectation that he could illegally reenter and resume a period of continuous physical presence.in re,bia en banc.we have declared that to be a reasonable approach,and have agreed that physical presence is broken when an alien is found within the country,requests administrative voluntary departure,and is escorted to the border.see ashcroft,cir per curiam see also gutierrez,at holding that where alien was caught within the country and voluntary left in lieu of facing removal proceedings,the period of physical presence was broken.as the third circuit court of appeals has held,the mere fact that the departure occurred when a person was stopped at the border while attempting reentry does not change the alchemy.attorney of the,cir holding that when an alien withdrew his application for admission in lieu of formal determination of admissibility and departed,and signed a document to that effect,his period of physical presence terminated.of course,as we have noted above,the bia has taken the same position.see,at.
on the other hand,all agree that continuous physical presence is not interrupted if a person is merely stopped at the border and turned away without any more formality.thus,in,at,an alien presented herself at the border without entry documents,was taken to a room where a man explained that she could not enter and was then escorted to a door back across the border without further ado.that,said the bia,did not interrupt her continuous physical presence.id.at.we have also concluded that where a person is merely stopped,turned around,and sent back to mexico,that will not suffice to break his continuous physical presence.tapia,at.we also added that merely fingerprinting or photographing the alien would not constitute sufficient formality to break his continuous physical presence.id.at see also,at same.the bia agrees that some formality is required.see,at.we have further,and logically,held that continuous physical presence would not be interrupted,despite a formal agreement to depart voluntarily,where misrepresentations might have been made to the alien and he,at the very least,might not have known what he was signing.see gonzales,cir.in that instance,it could not be said that he did knowingly and voluntarily accept administrative voluntary departure.id.at.in other words,nothing was legally added to a simple turn around.nevertheless,it is important to note that we did not declare that the use of procedures at the border where a person departs in lieu of more extended proceedings were not sufficient to break his period of physical presence.
therefore,it can not be said t
