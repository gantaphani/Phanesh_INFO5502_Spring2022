proceedings 
vargas is a native and citizen of mexico who became a lawful permanent resident on february.in,vargas pleaded nolo contendere and was convicted of violating california penal code a inflicting corporal injury on a person in certain specified relationships and threatening to commit a crime resulting in death or great bodily injury.he served sixty days imprisonment.
in,the department of homeland security served vargas with a notice to appear,charging that he was under.a a i i because both convictions were for cimts.vargas denied the factual allegations relating to the criminal convictions and argued that he qualified for either the petty offense exception set forth in immigration and nationality act ina a a ii,or a waiver under ina h.vargas later admitted that he ha d to concede regarding the h issue.
in an oral decision,the immigration judge ij held that vargas was inadmissible because both of his convictions were for cimts.because vargas freely admit ted that the victim of these crimes was in fact his spouse,the ij decided that the conviction under a was for a cimt.the ij then decided that a violation of is a cimt because the threat of death or great bodily injury causes a victim sustained fear.finally,the ij held that vargas was not eligible for a waiver under h because he had not lawfully resided continuously in the united states for seven years before the government initiated removal proceedings.see rotimi.
the bia affirmed the ij decision and dismissed vargas appeal.it recognized that although a violation of a is not categorically a cimt,a a conviction is a cimt if the victim was the perpetrator spouse.because vargas admitted that the victim was his wife,the bia concluded that vargas a conviction was for a cimt.the bia also agreed with the ij that is a cimt because it previously had found that threatening behavior can be an element of a crime involving moral turpitude.in re ajami,bia.because vargas was convicted of more than one cimt,the bia concluded that he did not qualify for the petty offense exception described in a a ii.finally,although the bia held that vargas waived his h argument before the ij,the bia decided that,in any event,vargas was not eligible for h relief because he had not resided lawfully in the united states for seven years prior to his removal proceedings.
vargas timely petitioned for this court review.
ii.standard of review 
although a c generally precludes judicial review of orders against aliens removable on criminal grounds,we have jurisdiction to review questions of law arising from removal orders.id.a d.whether a crime involves moral turpitude is such a question of law.mendoza holder,f d,cir.we therefore have jurisdiction to review vargas petition,and we conduct our review de novo.fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir.
iii.inadmissibility 
vargas was charged under a a i i,which makes inadmissible any alien convicted of,or who admits having committed,or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of a crime involving moral turpitude.that inadmissibility provision is subject,however,to a petty offense exception.under the exception,a a i i shall not apply if the alien committed only one crime,the maximum penalty possible for the predicate cimt did not exceed imprisonment for one year,and if the alien was convicted of such crime,the alien was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of months.id.a a ii ii.
vargas argues that the bia erred in deciding that his convictions under california penal code a and were for cimts and that,even if his conviction was for a cimt,he qualifies for the petty offense exception.
california penal code a 
vargas first argues that the bia erred in determining that his conviction under california penal code a was for a cimt.section a provides that a ny person who willfully inflicts corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a victim described in subdivision b is guilty of a felony.in turn,subdivision b describes a victim as t he offender spouse or former spouse,t he offender cohabitant or former cohabitant,someone with whom the offender has,or previously had,an engagement or dating relationship,or t he mother or father of the offender child.
our precedents make clear that although a is not categorically a cimt,it is a divisible statute for which a conviction under one portion of the statute corporal injury against a spouse will qualify as a cimt,while conviction under other subsections for example,corporal injury against a cohabitant will not.compare grageda ins,cir holding that spousal abuse under section a is a crime of moral turpitude emphasis added,with morales garcia holder,cir holding that corporal injury against a cohabitant under a is not a crime involving moral turpitude it is thus necessary to apply the modified categorical approach.under that approach,we consider whether the judicially noticeable facts in the record indicate that the alien was convicted of the elements of the generically defined crime.huerta guevara ashcroft,cir.
in applying the modified categorical approach here,the bia agreed with the ij that vargas a conviction was for a cimt because vargas admitted before the ij that the victim of that crime was his wife.in so doing,the bia relied upon the attorney general decision in in re silva trevino,which ruled that an ij may consult evidence outside the record of conviction in determining whether an alien has been convicted of a cimt.see id.at.
although vargas admission may have been appropriate for consideration under the framework outlined in silva trevino,we have recently rejected silva trevino.see olivas motta holder,cir holding that silva trevino was not entitled to deference because t here is nothing in the substantive definition of a cimt that allows courts to look to conduct that an alien committed to determine the acts he has been convicted of.thus,in this circuit,an ij is limited to the record of conviction in determining whether an alien has been convicted of a cimt.id.at.
here,the bia permissibly employed the modified categorical approach to the extent it considered the conviction document in an effort to identify vargas victim.but its inquiry should have ended with the conviction document,which did not specify vargas relationship with the victim.although judicial admissions ordinarily bind a party,an alien description of his crimes is not an acceptable source of evidence under the modified categorical approach.see sandoval lua gonzales,cir u nder the modified categorical approach we may not consider testimony about the alien criminal conduct,abrogated on other grounds by young holder,cir en banc.we therefore hold that the bia erred in concluding that vargas was convicted of spousal abuse under a 
california penal code 
vargas also argues that the bia erred in determining that his conviction under was for a cimt.he is mistaken.section is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude.latter singh holder,cir.the bia thus correctly determined that vargas is inadmissible under a a i i based on his conviction.

vargas argues that,in any event,he is not inadmissible under a a i i because
