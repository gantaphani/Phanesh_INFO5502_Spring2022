love korean church the church appeals an order of the district court affirming the bureau of citizenship and immigration services cis revocation of a visa petition filed by the church on behalf its choir director.the church had sought to have its choir director,a korean citizen,classified as a special immigrant religious worker within the meaning of a c.because the revocation of the visa petition was predicated on legal error and findings of fact unsupported by substantial evidence,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case for further consideration by the agency.
background 
love korean church is a religious organization affiliated with the korean presbyterian denomination.the church was originally established in the to meet the spiritual needs of the growing community in the los angeles area.the church views religious music as a form of worship and an integral component of its ritual celebrations.
since,the church has benefitted from the work of dae song park,a native and citizen of the republic of korea.park was originally admitted to the united states as a temporary visitor in january.shortly after his arrival,he became a member of the church and began serving as its choir director on a volunteer basis.in,park successfully adjusted his immigration status to that of a student,so that he could attend english language courses at a local school.in january,park transferred to california union university,where he enrolled in music classes and began pursuing a master degree in music.throughout this time and until september,park continued serving as the church volunteer choir director.in october of,when park application for adjustment of status to religious worker was pending and permitted employment,the church hired him as a salaried choir director.
during the period from march to november,the church filed on park behalf three petitions for a religious worker visa.this appeal concerns only the third petition,which the cis initially approved in september,cis issued a notice of intent to revoke the approved petition,stating that park duties do not relate to a traditional religious function.the tenets of a particular religious denomination should have significance on the performance of the duties of the position being offered.
cis subsequently revoked the approved third petition.cis found that park was a student during the period from november to november,and he therefore could not have been carrying on salaried work as choir director for the church.it also concluded that the duties listed in the church petition could be performed by a volunteer and did not reflect a position.
the church filed an administrative appeal of the decision revoking the third petition which the administrative appeals office aao dismissed.first,the aao pointed out some discrepancies between two documents submitted by the church in support of its weekly work schedule and a diagram summarizing park duties between november and november noted that the church had submitted no evidence to explain the inconsistencies.the aao next concluded that the position as described in the church weekly work schedule did not qualify as a religious occupation under the statute and regulations because the church failed to establish that all the duties listed in the weekly work schedule were related to the position of choir director and were not primarily secular in nature and the position had not been shown to be a directly related to the church religious creed,b recognized by the governing body of its denomination,and c traditionally a permanent,salaried occupation within the denomination.finally,the aao concluded that the evidence did not establish that park was continuously engaged as choir director during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the visa petition,because the work schedule indicated that park served at most thirteen hours per week in activities 
park and the church filed an action for declaratory relief in the district court,claiming that the revocation of the third petition was not supported by sufficient and good cause.the district court granted summary judgment for the government.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the district court jurisdiction to review cis revocation of the church visa petition is predicated on and reinforced by the enactment of the administrative procedure act apa,a.ana int l,way,cir holding that visa revocations pursuant to are not made unreviewable by either a b ii or a.our appellate jurisdiction arises under,and we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.spencer,united states,cir.under the apa,we will reverse an agency action if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,or if its factual findings are unsupported by substantial evidence,mester ins,cir.to the extent the agency interpret ed its own regulation,even if through an informal process,its interpretation of an ambiguous regulation is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bassiri xerox,cir quoting auer robbins,d 
as a threshold matter,we consider whether the existence of some discrepancies in the materials submitted by the church in support of its petition requires us to affirm the district court judgment without reaching the merits of this appeal.the church carried the burden of proof throughout the proceedings to revoke the previously granted visa petition.tongatapu woodcraft,feldman,cir.moreover,we defer to the bia reasonable interpretation of,which makes it incumbent upon the petitioner to resolve the inconsistencies by independent objective evidence.attempts to explain or reconcile the conflicting accounts,absent competent objective evidence pointing to where the truth,in fact,lies,will not suffice.matter of ho,bia.under appropriate circumstances,d oubt cast on any aspect of the petitioner proof may lead to a reevaluation of the reliability and sufficiency of the remaining evidence offered in support of the visa petition.id.at emphasis added.
the aao decision in this case did not rest,however,on an adverse credibility finding based on the inconsistent records that caused it to reject the church other evidence.it true that the aao noted unresolved discrepancies between the duties of the church choir director as listed in its weekly work schedule and the summary of those duties contained in the diagram.the aao apparently and properly resolved these discrepancies against the church,which had the burden of proof.the aao did not state,however,that the discrepancies tainted the credibility of the other evidence,and it reached the merits of the church visa petition in light of that other evidence because our review of an agency decision is limited to the reasoning articulated by the agency,sec chenery,we may not now reject the entirety of the evidence submitted by the church when the agency did not do so.we therefore reach the merits of the church petition and review the legal and factual sufficiency of the agency reasoning,mindful that any inconsistency must be resolved against the petitioner.see matter of ho,at.
turning to the merits of this appeal,we first consider whether the position of choir director as defined in the church petition and supporting materials qualifies as a religious occupation within the meaning of the statute.by statute,up to permanent resident visas are set aside every year for special immigrant religious workers other than ministers.b.a special immigrant,as that classification pertains to ministers and other religious workers,is defined as 
a n immigrant,and the immigrant spouse and children if accompanying or following to join the immigrant,who 
i for at least years immediately preceding the time of application for admission,has been a member of a religious denomination having a bona fide nonprofit,religious organization in the united states 
ii seeks to enter the united states 
i solely for the purpose of carrying on the vocation of a minister of that religious denomination,
ii before october,in order to work for the organization at the request of the organization in a professional capacity in a religious vocation or occupation,or 
iii before october,in order to work for the organization or for a bona fide organization which is affiliated with the religious denomination and is exempt from taxation as an organization described in section c of title at the request of the organization in a religious vocation or occupation and,
iii has been carrying on such vocation,professional work,or other work continuously for at least the period described in clause i 
a c.the implementing regulation defines the key term religious occupation as follows 
religious occupation means an activity which relates to a traditional religious function.examples of individuals in religious occupations include,but are not limited to,liturgical workers,religious instructors,religious counselors,cantors,catechists,workers in religious hospitals or religious health care facilities,missionaries,religious translators,or religious broadcasters.this group does not include janitors,maintenance workers,clerks,fund raisers,or persons solely involved in the solicitation of donations.
m.following cis interpretation of the term religious occupation,the aao required that all duties proposed by the church be related to the position of choir director and not be primarily secular in nature.it also required a showing that the position of choir director must have been traditionally a permanent,salaried occupation within the denomination.emphasis added we consider and reject each ruling in turn.
we first address whether the aao decision can be affirmed because the weekly work schedule does not establish that all the duties listed therein are related to the position of choir director and are not primarily secular in nature.emphasis added.we conclude that the standard imposed by the,that all the duties of a proposed position must be not primarily secular in nature and must be related to religious inconsistent with the definition of religious occupation set forth in the regulation,m.
although the agency interpretation of m presents a question of first impression in this circuit,we find guidance in the approach adopted by the third circuit in a similar case,soltane of justice,cir.in soltane,alito explained that the regulation specific exclusion of certain workers who perform wholly secular functions does not mean that a person can not qualify as having a religious occupation if the worker job includes both secular and religious aspects.id.at.the court noted that the commentary to the regulation supported the exclusion of some occupations on the ground that i f a job has no religious significance,then the fact that a person is a member of a religious denomination working in a facility run by the denomination would not by itself make that person a religious worker.id.quoting,emphasis added.it concluded,however,that t o the extent that the aao read s m as requiring that a religious occupation involve only religious functions,its interpretation is inconsistent with the text of the regulation and other indications of the agency intent and is accordingly not entitled to deference.id.
we join the third circuit in rejecting an interpretation of m that would require each discrete duty of a qualifying religious occupation to be primarily and directly related to core religious activity.the regulation provides illustrative e xamples of several qualifying positions liturgical workers,religious instructors,religious counselors,cantors,catechists,workers in religious hospitals or religious health care facilities,missionaries,religious translators,or religious broadcasters as well as some that do not qualify janitors,maintenance workers,clerks,fund raisers,or persons solely involved in the solicitation of donations.m emphasis added.the feature that distinguishes the first group from the second is not that each discrete duty in a qualifying worker daily routine is religious,not primarily secular or directly related to an exclusively religious activity,as the aao required in this case.it is difficult to imagine any position with any religious organization that would not involve a small amount of administrative duties.perez ashcroft,d.rather,the unifying feature of the enumerated qualifying occupations is that they carry a quantum of religious significance.soltane,at.we therefore can not affirm the aao decision simply because not all the duties of choir director as described in the work schedule are primarily and related to core religious activities.
having rejected the aao interpretation of m,we decline to adopt in the first instance our own characterization of the quantum of religious activity that a proposed position must include to qualify under m.the regulation defines the key phrase religious occupation as an activity which relates to a traditional religious function.id.although the aao current interpretation of this phrase is impermissibly restrictive,we recognize that the regulation language is sufficiently broad to admit of more than one interpretation.moreover,we are fully cognizant that no more than aliens may be admitted each year as permanent residents pursuant to the religious worker special immigrant classification b.we accordingly leave it to the agency to decide,in the first instance and on the basis of its expertise,see ins ventura,d,whether an occupation that has merely some religious significance suffices under the statute,soltane,at,or whether some greater level is required for example,that the occupation must be substantially or even primarily comprised of religious duties.
we next consider whether the aao decision can be affirmed because the position of choir director had not traditionally been a permanent,salaried occupation within the denomination.we conclude that,by requiring the church to show that it has traditionally employed a permanent,and salaried choir director,the aao imposed a standard that is inconsistent with the controlling regulation.
the implementing regulation,m,adopts the term traditional religious function to define the type of employment that may qualify as a religious occupation under the statute.it does not,however,shed light on what constitutes such a traditional religious function it merely provides a few examples of qualifying and positions.accordingly,we recognize that there is a threshold ambiguity as to the correct interpretation of the term.see bassiri,at.
in filling this vacuum,however,the agency has imposed a standard that is inconsistent with the regulation it purported to interpret.see id.in illustrating what may constitute a qualifying traditional religious function,m provides examples of distinct roles and activities performed by workers within certain religious denominations.it does not,however,impose any requirement that such positions have been filled in the same manner for any durational period.cis has unduly focused on the labor history of the institution filing the petition as opposed to the type of work described in the petition.this focus is irreconcilable with the meaning and structure of m.that a growing church has moved from a volunteer to a paid worker for a traditional religious function does not change the traditional religious nature of the work as set forth in the regulatory examples.
this is not an instance in which the regulations are drawn in broad terms and implicitly delegate authority to develop additional requirements to the adjudicative body.although m is itself ambiguous,the following subsections,m,spell out in detail what a petitioner must disclose about the proposed religious occupation 
initial evidence.unless otherwise specified,each petition for a religious worker must be accompanied by e vidence that the organization qualifies as a nonprofit organization and a letter from an authorized official of the religious organization in the united states which establishes t hat,if the alien is to work in another religious vocation or occupation,he or she is qualified in the religious vocation or occupation.evidence of such qualifications may include,but need not be limited to,evidence establishing that the alien is a nun,monk,or religious brother,or that the type of work to be done relates to a traditional religious function.
