jacob,catherine and two of their children cameroon a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming a departure order issued by the immigration court.jurisdiction is proper under a,because the proceedings commenced before april,with the bia decision issued after october.see,stat,repealing.the bia is affirmed.
jacob entered the united states with a student visa on september,to attend the university of minnesota.his wife catherine and children followed on a derivative visa.on august,deportation proceedings commenced with an order to show cause.the order alleged jacob violated his status by failing to attend the university after september,making the family deportable.the admitted the factual allegations,including deportability,but renewed a previous application for asylum or withholding of deportation 
claims he,his father,and his uncle were members of the socialist democratic front sdf,an opposition party to the ruling party,the cameroon peoples democratic movement.asserts that his family is a social group within the meaning of asylum laws,and he has a political opinion imputed from family associations.thus,he argues his own political opinion and membership in a particular social group an family subjected him to past persecution,and makes him a target for future persecution.
at the first formal deportation hearing,testified that between and,while living in cameroon,he participated in mobilizing people and other grassroots work for the sdf.during this time,his home was subjected to midnight searches by cameroon looking for sdf he was detained for over three hours of questioning,after being shoved to the ground and kicked by cameroon officials.
also testified that,in,his uncle was murdered because of his sdf affiliation shortly after the murder his father received death threats his father business mysteriously burned down and,ultimately,his father and two brothers fled to nigeria.
catherine testified that the government ended her husband,without explanation,and refused to reinstate it,after her request.she suspected it was due to her husband sdf affiliation.she admitted that her mother and father,and a number of not directly involved in any political peaceably in cameroon.both jacob and catherine also testified to having no trouble renewing their passports.
milton henry krieger,an expert on cameroon politics,also testified at the first deportation hearing.he described the sdf as the most effective opposition group in cameroon,and noted shootings,arrests,and other adverse action by the government against sdf members.according to krieger,sdf activists are well known throughout the county,and a murder of a known activist would be exactly the sort of thing that the independent press,the herald in particular reporting from manfe would pick up krieger further explained that the sdf is a recognized,established political party with fairly substantial membership records,which would be able to verify membership of,his father,and uncle.he did note,however,membership may not be available from some remote areas,although he could not speak for home base,mamfe.
krieger noted that mamfe is a particularly dangerous area for the sdf,although he admitted that a mere sdf member is probably safe in cameroon today.he further testified that while he has no personal knowledge,the uncle death occurred in an area where such episodes infrequently come to light and could likely be due to sdf affiliation.
at the close of the testimony,the immigration judge ij requested confirmation from the sdf of activities,documentation of the uncle death,and the burning of his father business.in response,submitted two letters to the ij,both typed,allegedly from sdf letter from professor tonyi,of mamfe,dated march,and a second letter from ndi christopher,of bambili,dated march.also submitted letters from his father,brothers,and cousin also a cameroon magistrate supporting his allegations a police report about his uncle murder and a letter from the local cameroon police officer who sent the report to eta ndu.
when the hearing reconvened,over two months later,the ij admitted the letters and the police report into evidence.the letter from the father living in nigeria first raised suspicion,because it was mailed from new york city,new york.the ij also noticed that the letters from the sdf were typed on plain paper,without official letters confirming sdf membership for this ij in other cases.the ij further noted that the sdf letters were apparently typed on the same typewriter,mailed from the same place yaounde on the same day.the ij requested forensic analysis of the sdf letters,which concluded they came from the same typewriter.
offered several explanations.as to his father letter,he testified that his father found a person in nigeria who was traveling to the united states to mail the letter,because mail is so slow in nigeria.submitted a letter from his father confirming this fact.as to the sdf letters,testified he had no knowledge of how the letters were prepared.did submit a letter from christopher,explaining that he had no access to a typewriter in his office,requiring that all letters be typed by the secretary at the sdf provincial office in bamenda.christopher speculated that the second letter from professor was sent to the same place for typing,since he also likely lacked access to a typewriter.finally,explained that the same postmarks were likely due to the fact that residents in bamenda and mamfe often mail letters close to an international airport,like yaounde,because mail is also slow in their hometowns.krieger,in an affidavit,stated he had heard about haphazard mail service and inaccurate postmarking in cameroon,but had no personal experience to confirm this.
ii.agency decisions 
reviewing the evidence,the ij concluded that did not present sufficient proof of past persecution.as for future persecution,the ij found implausible explanations about the sdf letters.the ij also expressed concerns with the evidence of the uncle murder,in light of krieger testimony that it would be exactly the sort of thing the independent press would pick up.although the ij did not make a specific adverse credibility finding,he found credibility seriously shaken and concluded that because did not present objective,corroborating evidence he failed his burden of proof.
on appeal,the bia affirmed the ij ruling that experiences in cameroon do not rise to a level of past persecution.the bia then affirmed the ij as to future persecution,focusing on the two disputed letters 
the forensic analysis reveals that two letters were typed on the same typewriter,although allegedly sent by two different branches of the sdf located in different provinces of cameroon.submitted a letter from the author of one of the letters stating that his office sends letters to a typing school to be typed.the immigration judge found that the explanation was unconvincing.we are not persuaded that the immigration judge conclusion is unreasonable.did not supply a statement from the author of the other letter,or from anyone in the location where that letter originated,to confirm that the other branch also uses the same typing school.in addition,we note that has not supplied a statement from the typing school to confirm that the school receives correspondence from both branches,types the correspondence,and returns the documents to the branches for a signature.
the bia also declined to review additional evidence submitted by after the ij decision.
iii.asylum and withholding of deportation 
contends that the bia erred as a matter of law in affirming the ij decision that failed to establish a fear of persecution on account of his political opinion or social group membership.because the bia essentially adopted the ij opinion while adding some of its own reasoning,we review both decisions.krasnopivtsev ashcroft,cir,citing siong ins,cir chand ins,cir.
both the ij and the bia denied asylum and withholding of deportation,finding did not meet his burden of proof.this denial must be upheld if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d,quoting a.this standard is a deferential one,requiring a reviewing court to uphold a denial of asylum unless an alien demonstrates that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.nyama ashcroft,cir,quoting,at.credibility determinations are upheld if supported by specific,cogent reasons for disbelief.perinpanathan ins,cir quotation omitted.
however,this court is not at liberty to reweigh the evidence.hasalla ashcroft,cir,citing feleke ins,cir.nor may this court reverse even a decision that we find to be clearly erroneous.rather,we must affirm the bia factual decisions unless,after having reviewed the record as a whole,we determine that it would not be possible for a reasonable to adopt the bia position.eusebio ashcroft,cir,citing ashcroft,cir citation omitted.see dia ashcroft,cir en banc if a reasonable fact finder could make a particular finding on the administrative record,then the finding is supported by substantial evidence.conversely,if no reasonable fact finder could make that finding on the administrative record,the finding is not supported by substantial evidence.
the attorney general may,in his discretion,grant asylum to a refugee.b.a refugee is any person who is outside any country of such person nationality who is unable or unwilling to return because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.persecution involves a threat to one life or freedom on account of one of these five protected grounds.fisher ins,cir,citing a a.
to establish a fear of persecution,the applicant must demonstrate the fear is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.shoaira ashcroft,cir.the subjective element may be proven by credible testimony that the applicant genuinely fears persecution,citing ghasemimehr ins,cir.the objective element requires credible,direct,and specific evidence that a reasonable person in the applicant position would fear persecution if returned to his country of origin.id.
asserts persecution claims based upon membership in a particular social group,the family.this requires a showing of a pattern and practice of persecution against his family on account of their social group status.see b iii makonnen ins,cir defining a pattern and practice of discrimination as requiring organized or systematic or pervasive persecution.even assuming that allegations regarding his uncle and father were true,the evidence demonstrates they were persecuted due to their political beliefs,not their membership in the family.see nyonzele ins,cir.thus,the issue is whether has a fear of persecution based upon his own political beliefs.
past persecution 
there is a rebuttable presumption of future persecution,once an applicant proves past persecution.see b tawm ashcroft,cir,citing eusebio,at.although testified to an attack by cameroon officials,and detention for nearly three hours,this does not constitute past persecution as a matter of law.see tawm,at brief periods of detention do not necessarily constitute persecution.this court has denied asylum despite evidence of even more serious abuse.see,citing eusebio,at brief detention and beating during political rallies and destruction of home insufficient to prove persecution,and dandan ashcroft,cir,imprisonment insufficient to prove persecution.
future persecution 
as set forth above,the applicant must establish a fear of persecution with credible,direct,and specific evidence.shoaira,at.evidence at the first hearing demonstrated that in cameroon,the sdf is a prominent opposition party,whose members have a history of persecution.as to specifically,he testified that he,his father,and uncle actively participated in sdf activities,although neither he,his wife,or children were ever seriously harmed while living in cameroon,nor did they have trouble obtaining travel documents.further,although testified to his uncle murder and the burning of his father business,he admitted he did not know who was responsible for either incident.
analyzing the evidence,the ij divided allegations into three categories active membership in the sdf,his father significant role as a local sdf leader,and the murder of his uncle.the ij required objective evidence corroborating these three key factors in the case.
claims his testimony,standing alone,is credible and sufficient to meet his burden of proving persecution.he thus argues that the ij and the bia erred as a matter of law by requiring corroboration.to the contrary,the ij and the bia may require corroborative evidence where it is reasonable to expect corroborat ion.ashcroft,cir,quoting matter of,i n,bia en banc.however,a denial of asylum based upon 
the absence of corroborating evidence can not be sustained if the bia or the ij failed to rule explicitly on the credibility of the applicant testimony explain why it was reasonable to expect additional corroboration or assess the sufficiency of the applicant explanations for the absence of corroborating evidence.
id.at,quoting diallo ins,cir,and rejecting ladha ins,cir the ninth circuit does not require corroborative evidence from applicants who have testified credibly.
the ij did not explicitly find the testimony of not credible.this court does not require an explicit ruling on credibility before the ij can expect additional corroboration.see,at.however,the ij must,in such a case,explain why it is reasonable to expect additional corroboration.id.
in this case,the ij fully explained why it was reasonable to expect additional corroboration of central claims.see,at.the ij noted that according to krieger,evidence of membership is easily available from the sdf.krieger also stated that a murder of an sdf activist would be reported in the local press in cameroon.based upon this testimony,a request for documentary support of sdf participation and the uncle murder was not unreasonable.see id.at,quoting,i n at an asylum applicant should provide documentary support for material facts which are central to his claim and easily subject to verification.
the ij then assessed explanations of his attempted corroboration of alleged sdf activities.see,at.submitted two letters to corroborate his sdf participation.however,the ij reasonably doubted their authenticity.both letters lacked the official letterhead expected from an organized,established party like the sdf.more importantly,the analyst confirmed that the letters were typed on the same machine,despite having allegedly been sent from two separate officials,with offices located miles apart.
the ij determined that explanations lacked any sort of credible basis.although one author explained that he sent his letters to a central typing school,failed to obtain a letter from the second author,or from the typing school,as the bia noted.also failed to explain the practice of the school returning the documents back to the remote branches for the author signature.this additional step would require another of the letters to and from two remote regions of cameroon,with coincidental arrival back to the same postal office for postmark on the same day.the ij concluded that without further corroboration from the sdf,the ij could not overlook the questionable circumstances under which the two letters originated.see diallo,at noting that petitioners may meet their burden of proof by offering a believable and sufficient explanation as to why such corroborating evidence was not presented emphasis added.
in addition to the sdf letters,presented corroborating evidence in support of sdf involvement and his family persecution letters from his father,brothers,and supporting his allegations a police report about his uncle murder and a letter from the local cameroon police officer who sent the report to.the officer letter referenced father fleeing to nigeria and his uncle murder due to dirty politics.the officer acknowledged,however,that his assistance was personally solicited by cousin magistrate.because this evidence essentially consisted of letters from family and close friends,the ij found the evidence lacking objectivity.therefore,the only objective evidence before the ij were the two letters.
the ij and bia explained that implausible explanations for the suspicious letters coupled with a lack of objective corroboration undermined case.see nyonzele,at.although the ij did not specifically find not credible,the ij determined that the provided documents lacked credibility.the ij and the bia gave specific,cogent reasons for not accepting explanations and finding the documents not credible.perinpanathan,at.because this court must give the immigration judge credibility finding much weight,this determination is upheld.id.at,quoting ins,cir.based upon the unbelievable documents and attempted justifications,the ij and the bia found failed to meet his burden of proof.
the ij and the bia correctly addressed corroboration and explanations,concluding he failed to meet his burden of proof.based upon the record,denial of asylum to the is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence,at.this court does not find the evidence so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could find as the bia and ij did.see,at.
withholding of deportation 
also seeks withholding of deportation.the standard of proof for withholding of deportation is more stringent than asylum.krasnopivtsev,at,citing b.the alien must show a clear probability that he or she will face persecution in the country to which he or she will be deported,quoting hasalla,at.because failed to prove eligibility for asylum,he also fails the higher burden of proof required for withholding of deportation.see id.
iv.due process 
claims that the bia violated his due process rights by not reopening and remanding his case for new evidence for an asylum applicant to prevail on a due process challenge,he must show prejudice.shoaira,at.prejudice is found where defects in the deportation proceedings may well have resulted in a deportation that would not otherwise have occurred.united states,cir citation omitted.therefore,this court first ascertains whether a defect occurred,and then determines whether the applicant adequately proves prejudice.
the bia denial of a motion to reopen and remand is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see ins doherty,d patel ashcroft,cir,citing ashcroft,cir under bia procedure,a motion to remand must meet all the requirements of a motion to reopen and the two are treated the same.this court affirms the bia denial of a motion to reopen if the movants have failed to establish a prima facie case for the substantive relief they seek or if the movants have failed to introduce material evidence that was previously unavailable.strato ashcroft,cir,citing ins abudu,d.
the bia denied motion because he did not present new evidence.failed to adequately explain why the proffered evidence was unavailable at the time of the hearing before the ij.see c.he did not show why such evidence was unavailable either in or before the close of evidence on november.
gave two explanations for failing to present the evidence earlier.first,he believed the record was closed on october,deadline for documents confirming sdf activity and the uncle murder.nearly two years passed between the time believed the record was closed and the final deportation hearing.during this time,he made no attempt to submit further evidence,or request a reopening of the record.at the final hearing,the ij said that the record was to be closed stated that he had no objection.
alternatively,explained that only after the ij issued the decision on november,did he know that the ij required sdf documentation on official letterhead,however,misinterprets the ij decision.the ij noted the overall suspicious nature of the documents,which tainted his credibility,not just their failure to appear official.the ij adequately notified that he was to produce documentation from the sdf in cameroon confirming his activities.was even given time to explain the suspicious letters,yet failed to submit objective,reliable documentation of his sdf membership.
neither explanation proves the evidence was unavailable to prior to the april or the november hearings,nor do the explanations prove prejudice to.he was given an adequate directive and sufficient time to present any objective,reliable evidence.he made no objection to the closing of the record at the final hearing.accordingly,the bia did not abuse its discretion by denying motion to reopen and remand.thus,does not prove a defect prejudicial enough to maintain a due process claim.
accordingly,the decision of the bia is affirmed.
i strongly disagree with the majority decision to affirm the bia denial of asylum application based on future persecution this decision will ultimately result in certain persecution and probable ensuing death in cameroon.the majority has not fulfilled its duty to consider fairly the record as a whole because it disregards critical and uncontroverted expert testimony proving that faces a serious possibility of persecution in cameroon.the majority also contradicts the governing record and misapplies the applicable legal standard by affirming the ij decision on the basis of speculation,not substantial evidence.
i.the substantial evidence standard of review 
when the bia denies asylum to an applicant under a,this court reviews the bia decision under the substantial evidence test.see united states dep t of justice,cir behzadpour united states,cir.although this standard of review seems straightforward,it actually encompasses two tests.
we will affirm the bia denial of asylum if the bia decision was supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d emphasis added see also a.a denial of asylum can not be based on speculation which is what occurred here.in order to reverse the bia denial of asylum,however,an appellate court must be able to state that the evidence presented by the asylum applicant was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed,at.emphasis added.
the requisite fear of persecution for asylum,however,is just a fear of persecution.our precedents have defined a fear of persecution on account of political opinion as having a subjective and objective component a subjective fear of persecution and a reasonable possibility of persecution.see ins,d emphasis added see also,at.citing with approval,at.obviously,most asylum cases hinge on the objective component.
the majority does not fully set forth the of the standard of review,see supra majority opinion at,but doing so is important in this case because the government offers an erroneous interpretation of it claims that in order to overturn the bia denial of asylum,the asylum applicant must have presented substantial evidence below,and then the government defines substantial evidence as 
enough to justify,if the trial were to a jury,a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.thus,the full import of teaching is that a court can reverse a board determination that asylum was not established only if the applicant evidence would have entitled him,were his eligibility a matter for a jury to decide,to a directed verdict taking the issue away from the jury.
brief for respondent at first and last emphasis added.this articulation of the rule is incorrect and confusing on several levels.it is not worthwhile to point out every error inherent in the government articulation,but two points warrant attention.
first,the applicant does not have to offer substantial evidence in support of his or her claim.the substantial evidence requirement in no way relates to the applicant burden of proof that standard only applies to the bia decision.second,the applicant does not have to prove that he or she faces a probability of persecution,which is what the government proposed standard requires,it effectively requires the panel to be certain that the applicant will be persecuted.probabilities relate to the likelihood that an event will occur,but the fact that an asylum applicant 
fear must be does not alter the obvious focus on the individual subjective beliefs,nor does it transform the standard into a more likely than not one.one can certainly have a fear of an event happening when there is less than a chance of the occurrence taking place.
at.accordingly,one can not conclude that because an applicant only has a chance of being shot,tortured,or otherwise persecuted,he or she has no fear of the event happening.id.at.
the bottom line is this when the record as a whole lacks substantial evidence supporting the ij decision,this panel may overturn the bia if the applicant evidence is sufficient to compel the conclusion that there is a reasonable possibility he or she will be persecuted.in the instant case,the record lacks substantial evidence because a the government produced no evidence rebutting case and b the ij and the bia denied asylum based solely on their speculations about a single portion of corroborating evidence.all other evidence in the record as a whole compels the conclusion that has more than a reasonable possibility of being persecuted upon his return to cameroon.accordingly,i dissent.
ii.future persecution 
the ij and bia were not justified in rejecting fear of future persecution in cameroon because a reasonable factfinder looking at the record as a whole would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed,at.contrary to the majority assertions,the ij and the bia did not give specific,cogent reasons for rejecting explanations.majority opinion at.the ij and bia found that testimony was credible,yet they rejected his asylum claim based solely on speculation about two counterfeit documents.the record shows clearly that the supposed inconsistencies afflicting the two documents were subsequently and reasonably explained by.unfortunately,these explanations were never acknowledged.thus,denial of asylum was not supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.
expert testimony 
expert witness milton krieger delivered highly probative testimony that not only provided objective corroboration for fear of future persecution,but also provided objective corroboration of the two sdf letters confirming sdf membership.the ij,the bia,and the majority all failed to come to terms with krieger poignant testimony.
for instance,contrary to the majority flawed review of the record,supra majority opinion at,krieger did testify to the direct risk of persecution faced by.he stated 
o ne of the most striking features in and his wife testimony here is what happened in his home village of manfe in.this is a particularly dangerous area for the opposition because the local political leader role as political boss is to hold the regime authority there,to hold the line against any defections from the region into the opposition.
now,i think there is very striking testimony in affidavit which recounts what happened to the family in early when it had been known for a while that the family was an sdf family t here is a sequence in early when the local representative of the regime and this is basically the internal security ministry in cameroon,began to visit the family to warn him father sic and other family members that the family opposition was not going unnoticed.this culminates in march of with the shooting death of uncle and the subsequent flight of the father and two other brothers to nigeria.
now,this is the kind of local intimidation and direct repression that i think speaks to the dangers that rank and file sdf opposition have in these little back country episodes that come to light infrequently,but really do represent what has happened to the rank and file cameroonians i think that a very striking run of events leading to the death of the uncle whose body was found with personal possessions and everything else intact but party documentation removed and i believe this is a very very strong indicator of what this person and his family face should they return to cameroon.
at emphasis added.
later,the ij asked krieger to quantify the likelihood that would be subject to arrest or torture if deported to cameroon,even though did not need to demonstrate a likelihood of persecution under the law.krieger responded 
well he has a fairly high profile.he known for having gone abroad to the for school,he known from his family as a sdf work er in manfe,and i believe that there is a substantial high risk that going home would be a a challenge to his livelihood and his safety given his uncle fate i think that there is a substantial risk he would be persecuted directly.it very hard to say this,it an arbitrary government and in quantifying the risk would more than i would want do.but it a high risk that this man is known well enough and of interest to the authorities and in such a way as to endanger him should he and his family return.
at emphasis added.
krieger added that it is probably safe to be a mere sdf member not an activist in cameroon today.however,he testified that since has been out of the country i not sure it so true in his case.at.krieger explained 
a t the most recent hearing on april,the court raised a question about whether the danger to the applicant and his family has passed since the sdf is now a legal political party.however,the legalization of the sdf is in large part a cosmetic change,made in response to cameroon concerns for world opinion.in reality the cpdm the ruling party still abuses its power to keep the upper hand and to minimize the threat posed by the sdf.as i testified during the first hearing in this case,the abuses of power threats,imprisonment,intimidation,torture,and illegal detention are initiated and carried out at the local level,beyond virtually all scrutiny,by cpdm officials anxious to retain their fiefdoms and curry favor among those higher up in the organization.the legalization of the sdf has done nothing to constrain the acts of these local cpdm officials.the applicant in this case continues to be a target of his former boss,for the applicant previous political affronts,having the audacity to serve as an sdf organizer a law on the books legalizing the sdf does not institutionalize democracy,depersonalize politics,or eliminate ability to make good on his threats.
affidavit of krieger located in petitioners appendix at underline in the original other emphasis added at krieger testimony regarding same see also at statement by court accepting krieger affidavit into evidence.
when the government asked krieger whether he attributed the death of uncle to anyone in particular,the following exchange occurred 
answer i think my tenure on the ground of cameroon and the sources of information i rely on for my book and other writings that i done make it to my mind unmistakably clear that it was the division officer in manfe division of southwest province whose authority and responsibility it would be to supervise politics it would be the particular responsibility of the division officer in manfe to keep track of political opposition locally and to execute the government will in these cases 
question by government so it basically just your own opinion that who you think may have killed him 
answer i almost certain.i think well informed as i am i certain that whoever killed him,the direction of the division officer was behind the act.
question okay.but you do know that for sure,do you 
answer no,but it not the first thing that gets to a court in cameroon.
at emphasis added.
contrary to statements made in the ij and majority opinions that reports of the uncle death would be expected to be reported in the local press,see oral decision at,majority opinion at,krieger testified specifically about the nature of the uncle murder,explaining it was representative of back country episodes that come to light infrequently at.krieger could identify only a single newspaper,called the herald,that would likely report the death of a politically motivated murder,but he stated that the herald would only publish such information if it involved a known activist and if that information is public.at majority opinion,supra,at,suggesting krieger testified the uncle death would have been reported in the press,which is not what krieger actually said.no evidence established whether uncle was widely regarded as an activist by the cameroonian public,or that his death was public information.krieger also testified that the press is sometimes subject to repression regarding news of political opponents both pre and.see at.he noted that manfe,the region in which the uncle was murdered,is quite remote,at,making reporting from that area even more difficult.
although an ij may request corroborative materials if they are easily available,documentation from overseas is almost never easily available.kaur ashcroft,cir citation omitted.even if a herald article documenting the uncle death did exist,testified that he could not obtain this paper in the united states.see at.no one testified that united states libraries,cameroonian libraries,the cameroon government,or any entity whatsoever stockpiles old copies of this obscure periodical.it remains baffling to me why the ij expected to obtain such a source.no evidence supported the ij unreasonable expectation that had a means to obtain a article.the credibility of case should not have been doubted on this basis.
contrary to statements made in the ij and majority opinions that krieger told them confirmation of sdf membership should be easily available,krieger actually testified that although the sdf generally kept good records at the precinct level,evidence of particular membership might not be available 
it might depend on which were the precinct and which town.in bamenda which is the heartland of sdf activity i think that information there and if the sdf wish to provide it could do so.i could speak for manfe which i presume might be home base.this would not be part of a public record 
at emphasis added oral decision at majority opinion,supra,at,once again mischaracterizing the record by attributing to krieger the statement that would be able to verify membership in the sdf or could easily obtain verification.there was no testimony in this case establishing that,local grassroots activist,could easily obtain verification documents from the sdf.
in sum,krieger expert testimony established that hails from a particularly dangerous region for sdf opposition members that the uncle death was almost certainly orchestrated by the existing government that the uncle death was a very strong indicator of what and his family face should they return to cameroon that back country episodes of political persecution,such as the uncle murder,come to light infrequently despite the fact that the herald publishes such events that there is a very high risk that is to the government due to his international schooling,his family political activism,and his own political activism that is still a target for persecution by his former boss because of political beliefs and that faces a very substantial risk that he would be persecuted directly.krieger also testified that one might have difficulty obtaining evidence of sdf membership from home base because it was a very remote area.in the face of all this,the majority insists krieger did not corroborate claims.see majority opinion,supra,at.this is an irrational conclusion.
the substance of krieger testimony was uncontested and his expertise was likewise unchallenged.his testimony indicated that faced a reasonable possibility of future persecution indeed,it actually showed that faced a very high likelihood of being singled out for persecution on account of his political beliefs should he be deported to cameroon.
any reasonable factfinder listening to krieger testimony would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed in this case.his testimony clearly qualifies as credible,direct,and specific evidence of a reasonable fear of persecution.in comparison,the government produced no evidence whatsoever to rebut the overwhelming proof presented by.the bia summarily dismissed proof relying only on speculation of the ij concerning the corroborating evidence.the majority commits the same error.
additional corroborating evidence 
the two letters from sdf officials 
the key pieces of evidence establishing political affiliation with the sdf were the two typed letters from sdf officials,christopher and professor.christopher letter explained why his initial letter lacked letterhead or other official markings 
my letter was typed by a secretary at the bamenda sdf provincial office.we do not have a typewriter in bambui,neither do we have any building that serves as an office.we hold party meeting sic in the homes of members who have enough space to accommodate all the members.members rotate in playing the role of hosts for party meetings.
our local correspondence is done by hand written memos.we generally have official mail destined for other regions typed in typing schools in bamenda town or in our provincial office 
you also expected that i write the affidavit in an sdf letterhead t here are no sdf letterheads beyond the level of a division.letterheads and official stamps are available at the party head quaters sic and provincial office.as a matter of fact,some divisions do not have letterheads.the party is operating on a shoestring budget 
at.this is more than sufficient explanation as to why the sdf letters lacked official markings in this case.
there was also a sound explanation as to why the two sdf letters appeared to be mailed from the same place,despite the geographic distance between the authors.prior testimony by explained it is common for cameroonians to ask a passerby traveling from bamenda to yaounde to carry international mail on their behalf,and to mail it upon reaching the post office in yaounde.see at.also stated that correspondence is a popular custom because official mail is so slow,it is actually quicker to mail international correspondence from yaounde,which is close to the airport.id.
krieger affidavit corroborated and bolstered explanation about the custom of letters to yaounde for mailing,and explained why christopher and professor letters were postmarked on the same day.
mail service in cameroon is haphazard,and the preferred way to send mail overseas is to get a letter to yaounde or douala,where the two international airports are located,for mailing.thus,any mail considered urgent would be carried in person or by courier from mamfe,bamenda,or any place to those cities 
in addition,i have heard that mail in cameroon,even in yaounde,is not necessarily postmarked on the day that it is mailed.sometimes the post office will hold mail for several days and will postmark all mail in a batch on the day it leaves the post office,regardless of what day it was received 
affidavit of krieger located in petitioners appendix at emphasis added.given the remote,rural,and impoverished nature of cameroon,it makes sense that two letters from two sdf officials located in remote regions would be,carried to and typed at the same central office on the same typewriter,and then held in batches at the same major post office to be postmarked on the same day.
the majority found this explanation unsatisfactory,even though the government presented no evidence to the contrary,but solely because 
failed to obtain a letter from the second author,or from the typing school,as the bia noted.also failed to explain the practice of the school returning the documents back to the remote branches for the author signature.this additional step would require another of the letters to and from two remote regions of cameroon,with coincidental arrival back to the same postal office for postmark on the same day.
majority opinion,supra,at.this passage is an example of how the majority has failed to consider fairly the record as a whole.
first,an ij subjective believe that documents are unreliable or forged is an insufficient basis to support an adverse credibility finding.see shah ins,cir.neither the government nor the ij asked to explain whether the school had a practice of returning the documents back to the remote branches for the author signature.there is not a single question in this record about how the signatures were obtained.although it is true that the ij cited his concern over the signatures as a major reason that he doubted the authenticity of the letters,this was speculation never articulated before the oral decision.never received any notice that th
