gomez challenges each component of these findings.he urges us to reverse his sentence because the district court erred by finding that his conviction under california health safety code section was a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded months his california conviction for vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence,code c,was a felony crime of violence and he was lawfully deported or unlawfully remained in the country following either of those convictions

gomez argues that even if we hold that one of his convictions was a predicate offense under b,he was never lawfully deported after either of those convictions because his,and that occurred after one of the predicate authorized by an immigration officer,not an immigration judge.during the pendency of gomez appeal,this argument has been foreclosed.in gonzales,cir en banc,we held that removal by an immigration officer pursuant to a prior removal order is lawful.gomez initial removal occurred in,following a hearing before an immigration judge.he returned to the united states,committed the crimes of conviction,and was then removed three additional times,the latest removal occurring in july,following his most recent california conviction for vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated without gross negligence.this removal was performed by an immigration officer,but pursuant to the prior removal order.consequently,the district court committed no legal error in relying upon the removal for purposes of the b enhancement.
gomez argues that his conviction under california health safety code section a is not a predicate offense because it was not for a drug trafficking offense and the sentence imposed for the conviction did not exceed thirteen months.
in order to determine if gomez california conviction was for a drug trafficking offense,we must apply the taylor categorical approach,taylor united states,d,wherein we compare the statutory definition of the underlying offense to the guidelines definition of a drug trafficking offense.id.at.united states,cir.the commentary to of the guidelines defines a drug trafficking offense as an offense under federal,state,or local law that prohibits the manufacture,import,export,distribution,or dispensing of a controlled substance or the possession of a controlled substance with intent to manufacture,import,export,distribute,or dispense.cmt.b iv.we have held that the california offense under section a is broader than the guidelines definition of a drug trafficking offense because the california offense criminalizes simple transportation of a drug without intent to distribute it,at united states,cir.consequently,we can not say that all convictions under section a qualify for the enhancement.
under the taylor modified categorical approach,when we encounter a statute that is categorically overbroad as compared to the guidelines definition,we may make a limited inquiry into the facts of the underlying conviction to determine whether the conviction was based on all of the elements of a qualifying predicate offense,at.our inquiry under the modified categorical approach is limited to the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented to determine if a prior conviction qualifies for an enhancement,at internal quotation marks omitted.while we may not rely solely upon the charging papers,we may rely upon them in conjunction with a defendant written plea agreement or a transcript of the plea to show that the defendant pled guilty to facts covered by the guidelines offense,united states,cir en banc.
in this case,the district court relied upon the criminal complaint and the defendant written plea of guilty.according to the written plea agreement,gomez pled guilty to count two of the written complaint,which alleged that he did unlawfully sell,furnish,administer,give away,or offer to sell,furnish,administer,and give away controlled substances.in other words,gomez distributed a controlled substance or attempted to distribute one by offering to do so.both distribution and attempted distribution of a controlled substance are drug trafficking offenses.see b a cmts.b iv.consequently,the district court did not err in finding that gomez conviction under california health safety code section a was a drug trafficking offense.
the more difficult question presented by using the section a conviction to support the enhancement is whether a sentence of greater than thirteen months was imposed.we conclude that it was not.for purposes of b,a sentence imposed does not include any part of a sentence that has been suspended.united states,cir interpreting cmt.a iv,having materially the same text as current b,which is incorporated by reference into current,see cmt.b vii.it does include both a sentence originally imposed,but not suspended,and any additional sentence of incarceration ordered as a result of a probation violation.id.it also includes a term of incarceration imposed as a condition of probation.united states,cir also interpreting prior version of the guidelines.moreover,we ignore any good behavior credits or other adjustments earned by the defendant.united states,cir.
according to court documents,gomez sentence was suspended and he was given three years of probation,which included as a term of probation a sentence in the custody of the county sheriff.at the time the conditions of probation were imposed,gomez had already earned days of credit for time served and good behavior awaiting trial.he was therefore released on may.sometime thereafter,gomez violated a condition of his probation.on march,he appeared in the california trial court the trial court revoked gomez probation and then reinstated it with an added condition,a term in the custody of the county sheriff.
gomez argues that the district court erred by adding the jail term to the jail term because the longer sentence included the shorter one.the state trial court records provided on appeal are unclear on this point,but they do not contradict gomez contention.see code providing that a california trial court can not impose jail time greater than days in the custody of the county sheriff as a term of probation but see people johnson,d,providing that a california trial court can impose up to days of jail time after a probation violation,if the defendant consents,even if the jail time imposed as an original condition of probation was days.the record contains no evidence that gomez consented to receiving a total period of jail time in excess of days.without such consent,the days would have had to include the prior days.
under the modified categorical approach,the government bears the burden to demonstrate that the prior conviction was a qualifying,that the sentence exceeded thirteen months.see united states kelly,cir under the modified categorical approach,the government has the burden to establish clearly and unequivocally the conviction was based on all of the elements of a qualifying predicate offense.internal quotation marks omitted.because the record does not demonstrate that gomez sentence exceeded thirteen months,the district court clearly erred in applying the enhancement under b a i on the basis of gomez drug trafficking offense.
alternatively,the district court found that gomez california conviction for vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated without gross negligence,code c,was also a predicate offense under b a ii because the conviction was a crime of violence.the statute under which gomez was convicted prior to its revision,see supra note punished voluntary,involuntary,and vehicular manslaughter,according to the california legislature wording.code.the district court found that gomez was convicted under subsection c,which defined the crime as 
driving a vehicle in violation of section,or,driving while intoxicated,of the vehicle code and in the commission of an unlawful act,not amounting to felony,but without gross negligence or driving a vehicle in violation of section,or of the vehicle code and in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death,in an unlawful manner,but without gross negligence.
id.the current version of the statute,code b,refers to this crime as vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated,without gross negligence.conviction under former section c or current section requires proof of four elements driving a vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol in violation of the california vehicle code while also committing another misdemeanor or infraction or an otherwise lawful act that might cause death in a negligent manner,where the negligent conduct causes the death of another person.see judicial council of california criminal jury instructions,interpreting revised version of offense found in code california criminal defense practice.the negligence requirement is met if the defendant commits ordinary tort negligence.see people bussel,d,app.dep t super.phrase without gross negligence means that only ordinary negligence is required cal.criminal jury.
gomez argues that because code section c requires proof of only ordinary negligence,it can not be a crime of violence for purposes of the enhancement.this question requires us to delve once again into the murky waters of what is meant by a crime of violence.
confusingly,the phrase crime of violence is used to identify predicate offenses in a wide variety of contexts but there are at least four different ways to determine whether an offense constitutes a crime of violence.see cmt.b iii.what may be a predicate offense under one approach is not necessarily a predicate offense under another approach.generally,the statute or guideline provision being applied specifies which approach should be used in the context of that statute or guideline provision.when the phrase is used in a statutory context,the statutory definition adopted as part of the comprehensive crime control act of generally applies.
section uses a approach,defining the phrase in two ways,disjunctively.thus,a crime of violence is 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
we will refer to the a approach as the element test because it focuses on whether use of force is an element of the offense.section b focuses on the risk that the offense will involve the use of force.see also leocal ashcroft,d explaining that b sweeps more broadly than the element test because it encompasses offenses where a person merely disregards a risk that physical force will be used in commission of the offense.therefore,we will refer to b as the substantial of force test.both tests require that force be used against the person or property of another.in leocal,the supreme court reasoned that the words used against the person or property of another mean the infliction of force must be volitional in order to qualify as a predicate offense,requiring proof of a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.at.holding that alien dui conviction was not a crime of violence under because commission of the crime did not require volitional use of force or risk of volitional use of force.we interpreted leocal in gonzales,cir en banc,to further exclude from a offenses that may be committed through the reckless,or grossly negligent,use of force.see,at holding that arizona assault statute that may be committed by recklessly causing injury to a person was not a crime of violence.as a result,only those offenses that involve the intentional use of force against the person or property of another become predicate offenses under the element test.id.we later held that the same requirement applies to crimes of violence captured by the substantial of force test.gonzales,cir.the effect of our holdings is that in order to be a predicate offense under either approach,the underlying offense must require proof of an intentional use of force or a substantial risk that force will be intentionally used during its commission.
the applicable context in this case,section b a ii of the united states sentencing guidelines,contains its own approach to defining a crime of violence that is only partly similar to the definition.under b,a crime of violence 
means any of the following murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses,statutory rape,sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,burglary of a dwelling,or 
any offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.
cmt.b iii paragraph spacing added for convenience.the second phrase of the b definition is materially the same as the element test from a and is subject to the same construction,which means that it covers only convictions for an offense that requires proof of the intentional use of force.see united states,cir applying to the element test in.the first phrase of the definition describes our third approach by listing several enumerated offenses that constitute crimes of violence per se.we refer to this approach as the enumerated offenses approach.
notably absent from the b definition is the substantial of force test.its absence is explainable by considering the history of the guidelines provision.prior to the amendments to the guidelines,b defined a crime of violence by reference to the definition contained in,the career offender provision of the guidelines.see.c vol.ii,amend.the career offender definition for a crime of violence contains the element test and our fourth approach,which we will call the serious risk of injury test.under the serious risk of injury test,an offense is a crime of violence if it 
is burglary of a dwelling,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
a.this approach appears to have originated in the armed career criminal act definition of the term violent felony.e b ii.in applying the serious risk of injury test in the context of e b ii,the supreme court recently held that the listed offenses,which precede the remainder clause,illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the statute scope and that the remainder clause therefore includes only those offenses which are similar to the illustrated crimes.such a similarity exists where the underlying offense requires purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct.see begay united states,d holding that felony dui is not a violent felony under the serious risk of injury test because it was not purposeful,violent,and aggressive.
the serious risk of injury test resembles the substantial of force test because it is based on the degree of risk that the commission of the underlying offense will cause a particular result.we previously followed other circuits in holding that the serious risk of injury test was more expansive than the substantial of force test because it did not require proof of mens rea.united states,cir see leocal,at.see also united states mccall,cir en banc holding that felony dui satisfies the serious risk of injury test,recognized as overruled,united states comstock,cir united states begay,cir following mccall,rev,d.since then,however,the supreme court decided begay,in which it held that the serious risk of injury test includes only offenses that involve purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct.following begay,it is unclear whether there is any meaningful difference between the two approaches,but we need not decide that issue here.
in the commentary to was amended to create the current definition of a crime of violence,effectively severing the definition from the definition and removing altogether the serious risk of injury test from.see.c vol.ii,amend.this amendment was enacted in order to provide a more graduated sentencing structure under.roger haines,frank bowman iii jennifer woll,federal sentencing guidelines handbook,at ed.thus,in order for a defendant to receive a enhancement for a crime of violence,the crime either had to be an enumerated offense or had to satisfy the element test,the latter of which includes only crimes which have as an element the intentional use of force.neither test is a basis for a enhancement.rather,offenses satisfying the substantial of force test warrant only an enhancement under the aggravated felony provision of b c offenses that satisfy only the serious risk of injury test then fall into the remainder any other felony provision of d,which warrants only a enhancement.
although the guideline drafters omitted both tests from the enhancement,they did not remove all offenses.instead,they specially listed a number of offenses as crimes of violence and,thus,deserving of the enhancement,even though some of those crimes do not contain as an element of their offense the intentional use of force.see united states,cir noting that extortionate extension of credit and burglary do not entail use of force but do involve risk that force may be used during their commission.thus,when we consider whether a crime of conviction falls within the list of enumerated offenses,we do so without regard for whether those offenses involve the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.see id.consequently,all convictions for offenses which constitute murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses,statutory rape,sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,or burglary of a dwelling are treated as crimes of violence for purposes of the enhancement.cmt.b iii.moreover,since the enumerated offenses approach does not require us to apply either the element test or the substantial of force test,the underlying conviction need not be for an offense that involves the intentional use of force leocal does not apply.
we have identified the four approaches for defining a crime of violence as the element test,the substantial of force test,the serious risk of injury test,and the enumerated offenses approach.having identified and defined each approach,we must apply the appropriate approaches to this case.only two of the four approaches are directly relevant in the context of b,which defines a crime of violence using the element test and an enumerated offenses approach.the government concedes that the element test can not justify the enhancement here because california penal code section c does not involve an intentional use of force.we reached the same conclusion when we analyzed a current version of the greater california offense of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated with gross negligence.see gonzales,cir holding that offense met neither element test nor substantial of force test in context of review of decision of the board of immigration appeals finding petitioner removable for having committed a crime of violence.
during the sentencing hearing,the district court gave two reasons for applying the enhancement.first,it recited a passage from our opinion in united states,cir,where we held that a conviction in california under an even older version of the vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated without gross negligence statute,code,was a violent felony under the serious risk of injury test in the context of mandatory minimum sentencing under the armed career criminal act,e.this was error because the serious risk of injury test does not apply in the context of b.in addition to citing,the district court applied the enumerated offenses approach that is authorized by cmt.b iii,finding that gomez conviction for vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated without gross negligence was one of manslaughter and that it,therefore,fell within the enumerated offenses.
the district court relied largely upon the fact that the california offense is called vehicular manslaughter to find that it was manslaughter.but the supreme court has directed us to look beyond the label applied to an offense by the state legislature and consider whether the substance of the offense matches the generally accepted contemporary meaning of the term.taylor united states,d see also united states,cir.asking whether state crime fell within ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of statutory rape,enumerated as a crime of violence under b ii internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.thus,an enumerated offense must have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various states criminal codes.taylor,at.when the enumerated offense is a traditional crime,such as manslaughter,we derive its uniform meaning from the generic,contemporary meaning employed by most states,guided by scholarly commentary.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
contemporary meaning of manslaughter 
historically,the common law did not distinguish between murder and manslaughter.wayne lafave,substantive criminal law ed.eventually,however,two distinct crimes emerged.manslaughter was commonly called the unlawful killing of a human being without malice aforethought.id.m anslaughter itself was subdivided into two manslaughter intended homicide in a heat of passion upon adequate provocation and involuntary manslaughter unintended homicide under certain circumstance.id.according to lafave,it is the general trend for involuntary manslaughter to require the mens rea element of recklessness.even though some states have held that involuntary manslaughter can be established by proof of ordinary negligence,the great weight of authority requires something more.id.a.
in united states,cir,the fifth circuit agreed with lafave and held that the modern view of manslaughter required proof of recklessness.that case presented the reverse of the question presented here.the texas offense being reviewed there was called negligent homicide,but the government argued it was equivalent to manslaughter and was thus a crime of violence under b a ii.id.the mens rea element to that statute was criminal negligence,a degree of culpability higher than ordinary negligence,but lower than recklessness.the fifth circuit reversed the district court application of the sentencing enhancement,holding that a prior conviction for negligent homicide that required only criminal negligence was not manslaughter.id.
this view is consistent with the model penal code,which also requires recklessness for the crime of manslaughter and criminal negligence for the crime of negligent homicide.criminal negligence is a higher standard than ordinary negligence it requires a substantial risk that the failure to perceive such a risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor situation.id.d.under the model penal code approach,a state would not punish conduct that amounts to only ordinary negligence,such as the conduct outlawed by california penal code section c.
like california,most states have several homicide offenses,including an involuntary manslaughter statute.the fifth circuit study revealed that at least twenty state criminal codes require proof of recklessness to convict a person for the crime of involuntary manslaughter,at.thus,the modern view appears to be that recklessness is an element of contemporary manslaughter.lafave,supra,a.however,at least fifteen states have a manslaughter statute criminalizing conduct that falls short of recklessness twelve of them permit punishment when the defendant has a mens rea that is akin to criminal or gross negligence but only three states permit punishment on proof of only ordinary negligence when we look beyond statutes that use the term manslaughter,we see that another states have created homicide statutes that require a mens rea of less than recklessness,but call such offenses negligent homicide or something similar even when we expand the scope of our research to include these negligent homicide statutes,we see only eight more states that permit conviction when the defendant possesses a mens rea of only ordinary negligence we conclude that it is rare for a state to criminalize ordinary homicide where the defendant mens rea is only ordinary negligence moreover,only a handful of those states classify such offenses as manslaughter.
of course,gomez was not convicted of ordinary involuntary or vehicular manslaughter,as california defines it he was convicted of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated,a particular type of manslaughter.some states have created special statutes to punish drunk driving homicides as a number of states have enacted statutes creating the new crime of homicide by automobile.see lafave,supra,e stating that such a statute is related to the crime of manslaughter but is not manslaughter proper.typically,such statutes require proof of intoxication while driving a vehicle and are punished less severely than manslaughter.lafave,supra,e.commensurate with lesser punishment is a lesser mens rea requirement,where the state often permits conviction under the statute when the defendant has a mens rea that is less than recklessness.id.
we identify,however,only five states that have statutes similar to california,requiring proof of only ordinary negligence or less and defining the offense as a type of manslaughter.two additional states punish homicide where the defendant had a mens rea of ordinary negligence,but both classify the offense as something other than manslaughter eleven more states have drunk driving homicide statutes that require no mens rea at all or presume the necessary mens rea exists when the driver of a vehicle is intoxicated none of these states classifies the offense as manslaughter even among three additional states criminalizing homicide by drunk driving that require proof of a culpable mental state greater than ordinary negligence,only one defines the offense as manslaughter it appears there is a growing trend of at least twenty states that punish drunk driving homicides when the defendant possesses no culpable mental state or his mens rea is only ordinary negligence.but it is still exceedingly rare for such offenses to be classified as manslaughter instead,it appears more common for state legislatures to create new offenses,such as vehicular homicide,to cover such conduct.see lafave,supra,e.this comports with the general trend,noted by lafave and evident in the model penal code,that the notion of manslaughter is reserved for conduct that includes a more culpable mental state than mere negligence.id.a.
guidelines treatment of manslaughter 
in its brief,the government argues that even if the contemporary meaning of manslaughter includes a mens rea that is greater than ordinary negligence,the drafters of the sentencing guidelines clearly intended for the term manslaughter to include gomez conviction.see,at pickering,dissenting.we conclude the contrary is true when the guidelines have reason to distinguish between degrees of involuntary manslaughter,they recognize only two types criminally negligent manslaughter and reckless manslaughter.see providing distinct base offense levels for federal crime of involuntary manslaughter according to whether the defendant possessed mens rea of recklessness or criminal negligence see also,at holding that should not be read as expression of drafters intent to define manslaughter because drafters were merely creating base offense levels for federal crime of involuntary manslaughter.consequently,even if we were to look to for guidance in this case,it would only strengthen our conclusion that a homicide which requires proof of only ordinary negligence is not manslaughter.
if the drafters of cmt.b iii intended all homicides to be treated as crimes of violence,then they would have listed homicide as the enumerated offense.as it stands,they listed only murder and manslaughter.id.this limitation is consistent with the goal of the amendments to provide more graduated sentencing enhancements under,where the drafters removed from the enhancement definition of a crime of violence both tests that capture less culpable defendants.it is unsurprising,then,that we should conclude that homicide committed with a mens rea of only ordinary negligence is not included among the enumerated offenses listed in b.
since gomez conviction under california penal code section c for vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated without gross negligence is an offense that requires only proof of ordinary negligence,it can not fall within the contemporary meaning of manslaughter as enumerated in cmt.b iii.therefore,the district court erred in finding that it was a crime of violence for the purposes of applying a enhancement under b a ii.
neither gomez conviction for a drug trafficking offense nor his conviction under california penal code section c justifies the application of a enhancement under b.consequently,gomez sentence is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for in a manner consistent with our opinion.
reversed and remanded.
