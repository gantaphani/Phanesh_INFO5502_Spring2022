this is the second time that we are called to address olger case,in which he petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision upholding the immigration judge ij denial of his motion to reopen.the material facts are not disputed,and although we briefly discussed them in a order,we recount them here for the sake of clarity.
in november,an ij in chicago ordered deported in absentia to his home country of ecuador.eight years later moved to reopen his deportation hearing,claiming that he failed to appear at the hearing because he never received a notice of the hearing time or place.see c b.he asked the ij to rescind his in absentia deportation order and also moved to change venue to the immigration court in bloomington,minnesota,where he and his family then resided.in a memorandum and affidavit supporting his motion,expounded upon his claim that he did not receive notice of his deportation hearing.
began by explaining that he and a traveling companion named eloy espinoza entered the united states at san ysidro,california in july without inspection,a euphemistic way of saying they entered illegally.a few days later the duo ended up at international airport in chicago,illinois,where agents of the immigration and naturalization service ins arrested the men for their illegal entry.see a b.upon their arrest,espinoza telephoned his who lived in arias,a central player in this asked him to come to and help him and seek their release.while he was detained awaiting arias arrival,spoke with an immigration agent regarding where he would live while his deportation proceedings were pending.he informed the agent that he had never before been to chicago,had no place in the city to live,and knew no one in the city.therefore,stated,he would go with espinoza to stay with arias while the proceedings played out.
meanwhile,continued,arias arrived at and spoke with immigration agents regarding and espinoza release.the agents sought from arias information regarding how the immigration authorities could reach the two men to provide them with information regarding their upcoming deportation hearings arias responded that both men would stay at his apartment in chicago wrigleyville west cornelia street,chicago,illinois.the agents with whom arias spoke used that address when completing a variety of administrative forms regarding arrest and release among these forms was the agency order to show cause,the document upon which immigration authorities would rely to obtain contact information so they could,in turn,mail to him notice of the time and place of his deportation hearing.
after the paper work was completed,further recounted,an immigration agent reviewed the forms with him and asked if his contact is,the cornelia street address provided by correct responded that it was.the agent then informed that in a few weeks immigration authorities would mail to arias address a hearing notice that contained information regarding the time and place of his upcoming deportation hearing.was then released.he proceeded to take up residence in arias apartment on cornelia street,as he said he would.however,he never received the hearing notice,or,for that matter,any other document regarding his deportation hearing.
having received no word from immigration authorities,stated that in late he packed up his possessions and traded wrigleyville for the.paul area in minnesota.time passed,and in employer submitted a petition for an immigrant visa on his behalf.after the visa was granted,applied to adjust his status to a permanent resident.however,the ins denied application,saying he was ineligible to adjust his status.the ins cited unspecified information submitted with his employer visa petition and equally unspecified related files.curious as to what would prevent him from adjusting his status,obtained a copy of his immigration file,which contained many documents that,until that moment,he did not know existed.specifically,the file contained a photocopy of a hearing notice dated august,stating that a deportation hearing before an ij was scheduled for november.attached to the notice were two documents.the first document was a copy of a receipt for certified mail,showing that the notice was mailed the same day that it was issued and that it was addressed to the following recipient,olger gonzalo,west cornelia,chicago,il.also attached to the notice was a copy of an envelope bearing a stamp that read return to not known,and handwritten notes reading unk presumably short for unknown and.the file also contained the ij decision of november,in which he ordered deported in absentia attached to the decision was another photocopy of a receipt for certified mail,showing that the decision was mailed on the same day it was issued to the same address as the hearing notice,and another photocopy of an envelope,bearing both a postmark of november,and another attempted not known stamp.
confused as to why the hearing notice was not delivered to him in chicago when it was sent to the address he provided to the immigration agents,stated that he contacted arthur roxas,an attorney with the postal service,to see if he could shed some light on the matter.after described the documents in his immigration file,roxas informed him that,under postal service regulations,mail addressed to a person who does not reside at an address,but is merely visiting the address,will not be delivered unless the mail is addressed in care of the individual whom he is visiting.roxas also provided with the postal service internal regulations setting forth the policy.armed with this information,moved to reopen his deportation proceedings on the basis that he never received notice.
although the ij accepted version of the facts,he nevertheless denied the motion to reopen,reasoning that it was solely responsibility to specify that his mail needed to be addressed to him in care of arias,and thus he can be charged with receiving notice which was sent to the only address he provided.appealed to the bia,which upheld the denial of the motion to reopen.like the ij,the bia had no issue with the facts as presented by but echoed the ij determination that was properly charged with receiving the notice.
then petitioned us to review the bia decision.while his petition was pending,however,was deported back to ecuador.we nevertheless addressed the case,but instead of assessing the merits of arguments we accepted the government suggestion to remand the case to the bia so it could examine whether could be charged with receiving notice of his deportation hearing under our announced decision in sabir gonzales,cir.we accordingly ordered the bia to examine whether,under sabir,thwarted the postal service attempts to deliver the notice and,if not,whether the motion to reopen should be granted on the basis that he did not receive notice.see gonzales,unpublished opinion.
on remand,the bia again upheld the ij denial of motion to reopen.the bia first noted that it lacked jurisdiction to address case because his deportation constituted a withdrawal of his motion to reopen.see in re.however,this determination did not keep the bia from concluding that thwarted service of his hearing notice by not informing the ins agents at the time of his arrest that his mail needed to be addressed to him in care of arias as the bia stated,i t was not the ins responsibility to guess that the addition of those words might be necessary.the bia accordingly dismissed appeal.
which brings us to today,with again petitioning us to review the bia decision upholding the ij denial of his motion to reopen.before we reach the merits of arguments,however,the bia terse disavowal of jurisdiction requires us to address a vital and thorny issue whether case remains justiciable in light of the fact that he no longer is in the united states.this examination first requires us to determine whether the immigration and naturalization act ina provides a basis for us to exercise subject matter jurisdiction.under the provisions of the ina applicable to case,we conclude that it does.
as we recounted earlier,the ij entered its order of deportation in november.this,in turn,means that his petition for re
