carl gordon is a citizen of belize who lawfully entered the united states in.gordon obtained permanent resident status and was issued a green card.ten years later,gordon committed a series of home invasion robberies,targeting elderly women alone in their homes.in march of,a cook county grand jury indicted gordon on multiple charges,including home invasion,residential burglary,armed robbery,robbery,aggravated battery,and theft.gordon was found guilty of several of these charges and was sentenced to concurrent ten and seven year terms in the custody of the illinois department of corrections.on january,gordon was deported based on those convictions.before he was deported,an immigration judge explained to gordon that he no longer was a legal permanent resident and provided him with an form,which explained that he needed permission from the attorney general to return to the united states.
gordon returned to the united states in november of without obtaining permission from the attorney general.the exact date of gordon return is uncertain,but on appeal,gordon asserts that it was sometime during november of.gordon reentered via mexico at the san ysidro,california border checkpoint.at that checkpoint,gordon presented his green was still in his possession despite his the immigration and customs enforcement agent and was allowed to reenter the united states.
on october,gordon was again arrested on charges of home invasion and armed robbery of an elderly woman.on august,he was convicted of these crimes in illinois state court and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment.on august,gordon entered the custody of the illinois department of corrections to begin serving his sentence.standard custodial procedures should have alerted the government to gordon unlawful presence at this time,but standard procedures,for some unknown reason,were not followed in this case.
on april,gordon was interviewed by an immigration and customs enforcement agent,and he admitted to the agent that he had illegally reentered the united states by presenting his authentic but invalid green card to the inspector at the border.with this green card,gordon falsely represented that he was a lawful permanent resident of the united states.
on may,gordon was indicted on charges of being a deported alien illegally present and found in the united states without the express consent of the attorney general,in violation of a and b.this offense has a statute of limitations period from the time the offense is complete.on june,gordon moved to dismiss the indictment arguing that the prosecution was.gordon argued that the government had constructive knowledge of his illegal presence in the united states as of the moment he crossed the border at san ysidro and,through the exercise of due diligence,the government should have discovered his crime.although charged with being present and found in the united states,gordon asserted that this offense was not a continuing one in light of his entry through an official port of entry and the use of his real name,date of birth,and alien identification number,and thus his reentry was not surreptitious.therefore,gordon argued,his offense was complete for statute of limitations purposes at the time of his successful reentry.gordon also claims that he did not know his reentry was illegal because the form that he received upon his removal was confusing and he thought he was allowed to return after five years.
the government responded that gordon reentry was surreptitious because the presentation of an invalid green card concealed the illegality of his presence from the border authorities exercising normal diligence.and,because his reentry was surreptitious,the government argued,the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the government actually discovered gordon illegal presence in the united states.the government pointed out that requiring the border authorities to do a background check on everyone seeking to cross the border,even when they present an authentic immigration document,places an unreasonable burden on border personnel.gordon responded that the border authorities have computers at their stations for precisely that reason,and insisted that background checks on everyone crossing the border is not too burdensome.
on august,the district court denied gordon motion,finding that the government could not be expected to run a background check on every person requesting permission to enter the united states,especially when he or she presents authentic immigration documents.the court held that the government did not have actual or constructive knowledge of gordon illegal reentry at the time he crossed the border,and therefore the indictment was not.on november,gordon entered a conditional guilty plea,preserving his right to appeal the district court denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court concluded that gordon offense level was and his criminal history score was nine,which placed him in criminal history category four.this provided for an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.the district court then heard arguments from both parties before sentencing gordon.
gordon argued for a sentence below the advisory guidelines range.he explained that when he was deported,he was told by immigration officials that he would be denied reentry for five years after that,it was gordon understanding that he would be allowed to return by showing his green card to immigration officials.he claimed that his risk of recidivism and any threat he posed to the public in the future was significantly diminished because he would not return to the united states now that he knew he could not do so legally without the permission of the attorney general.in support of his arguments,gordon presented a copy of the form that he says was the source of his that he could return to the united states after five years.he also emphasized the fact that he reentered the united states at an official port of entry and used his real identity,which was evidence of his sincere misunderstanding of the restrictions on his reentry.he said that he did not know his green card was invalid,despite his deportation in.
the government argued for a sentence of months imprisonment,asserting that the guidelines range was woefully inadequate because gordon preyed on vulnerable and defenseless elderly women,and that gordon prior deportation for similar crimes had done nothing to deter him from returning and claiming another elderly victim.moreover,the government contended that gordon criminal history score the seriousness of his criminal history,and urged the district court for an upward departure to months on the basis that such a sentence was necessary to protect the public from gordon.this argument was based on the fact that seven of gordon prior convictions had been consolidated for sentencing,which resulted in him receiving two fewer points for his criminal history score.the government requested the guidelines range of seventy to months imprisonment,which would have been the guidelines range had gordon prior convictions not been consolidated.the government further argued that it could not prevent gordon from returning to the united states and continuing his signature offense on society elderly women.
gordon responded that his prior crimes had adequately been accounted for and that his criminal history score did not the magnitude of his criminal history.gordon also contended that the government requested months sentence was arbitrary,as it was not linked to any specific guideline.in a final comment to the court,gordon apologized for returning to the united states,and again stated that he would not return in the future.
the district court rejected gordon claim that he did not know that he could not return to the united states without permission and that his green card was no longer valid.the district judge believed that gordon was being intentionally deceitful when he presented his green card to immigration officials at the border,as logic and common sense dictated that one permanent resident status which a green card represents is revoked when one is deported.acknowledging gordon extensive contacts with the united states and lack of contacts with his native belize,the district judge also discredited gordon promise not to return to the united states again.noting gordon criminal inclinations,the district judge said he was not persuaded that gordon would not reenter the united states,despite now knowing it was a federal crime to do so.
at that point,gordon requested a sentence of thirty months imprisonment on the basis that the delay in his prosecution had deprived him of the opportunity for a concurrent sentence,and that the government requested sentence of months would result in a sentence four times the national average for illegal reentry sentences and approximately twice what his advisory guidelines range yielded.the district judge rejected gordon request.he reasoned that,after considering the presentencing report,the sentencing memoranda submitted by both parties,and the arguments raised,he was very concerned that gordon had targeted society most vulnerable citizens numerous times even after deportation for the same types of crimes,had completely disregarded the laws of the united states,and was likely to return to the united states again and continue committing his signature offense.the district judge concluded that he need ed to protect the public,and that the guidelines calculation the impact of gordon criminal history and the danger to the community that he posed.the district judge sentenced gordon to months imprisonment.
gordon first argument on appeal is that the district court erred when it held that the statute of limitations for gordon illegal reentry offense was not triggered until gordon was taken into custody by the illinois department of corrections in.gordon contends that immigration officials had constructive knowledge of gordon illegal presence in the united states in november of and thus,the statute of limitations for the crime of illegal reentry began to run at the time of his actual return to the united states.shortly after the filing of gordon opening brief,this court explicitly rejected gordon proposed constructive knowledge standard for statute of limitations purposes on illegal reentry crimes in united states are,cir.as a result,gordon argued in his reply brief that are was wrongly decided and should be overturned.

gordon first contends that his entry was not surreptitious.we disagree.gordon entered through a recognized port by means of an authentic but invalid green card that concealed the illegality of his return to the united states.gordon also claims that he did not know that his green card was no longer valid despite having been deported.the district court found this assertion to be unbelievable.absent clear error here,we accept the district court conclusion that this assertion was not credible.see greve,at see also united states jones,cir it is that the district court factual findings and credibility determinations are reviewed for clear error.accepting the district court finding that gordon knew that his green card was invalid,gordon presentation of that green card,combined with his of his prior deportation to the immigration officials at his reentry,does more than merely suggest that his reentry into the united states was surreptitious.gordon sought to deceive immigration officials and did so successfully as to his legal status in this country upon his reentry in november of.
gordon argues that are was wrongly decided,because unlike the other courts of appeal,this court has taken the burden off of the government entirely by explicitly rejecting a constructive knowledge standard.contrary to our sister circuits,we held in are that when the government should have discovered a deportee illegal presence in the united states is irrelevant to when the statute of limitations begins to run on the deportee a offense.compare are,at constructive knowledge is irrelevant to statute of limitations determination,with united states,cir the statute of limitations begins when the authorities know,or with the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement authorities,could have discovered the illegality of his presence,united states lennon,cir i llegal begins,for statute of limitations purposes,when the alien presents himself using his own name at an open point of entry even though immigration personnel failed to react,united states,cir statute of limitations starts when alien is found,but barring circumstances that suggest that immigration officials should have known of deportee presence earlier,united states gomez,cir statute of limitations begins when immigration could have discovered the violation,using diligence typical of law enforcement authorities,and clarke,at cir.statute of limitations starts when federal government could have discovered through reasonable diligence that deportee was illegally present in the united states.gordon asserts that under are,the government is allowed to ignore all signs of an alien presence in the united states until it decide s it want s to prosecute him.
the of gordon argument,however,is that so long as an alien hides well for five years after giving the government a mere sniff of his presence,he can not be prosecuted.while blatant flight from justice may toll the statute of limitations,we need not provide an incentive to illegal aliens to subtly fly under the government radar.we believe this to be a compelling reason not to join our sister circuits on this issue.see tablewares,mogi trading,cir reiterating the importance of stare decisis.although gordon makes some valid arguments challenging the reasoning of are,we do not find them compelling enough to overrule circuit precedent.thus,we decline to reconsider or overturn are.
