orlando turcios petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia denial of his motion to reconsider its rejection of his appeal of an immigration judge ij decision as being untimely filed.because we lack jurisdiction to review the petition,it must be dismissed.
factual and procedural background 
turcios is a citizen of nicaragua.in october,removal proceedings were commenced against him.the notice to appear alleged that turcios was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in,sought to reenter the united states in,was paroled into the united states for deferred inspection,and had his parole was revoked in october.turcios was previously convicted of sale of cocaine,felony spousal abuse,resisting arrest,and eight separate instances of petty theft while in the united states.the notice to appear indicated that he was removable under a a i i and ii for his convictions for a crime relating to a controlled substance,and a crime involving moral turpitude.at the hearing before the ij,turcios admitted all of his convictions and conceded removability.the ij issued the order of deportation.on the order,the ij instructed that any appeal to the bia was due by.
on december,one day before the notice of appeal was due,turcios counsel delivered the notice to federal express for overnight delivery.the notice of appeal was not received by the bia until december.
the bia entered an order dismissing the appeal as untimely.turcios filed a motion before the bia to reconsider its decision and reopen his proceedings.his motion explained that the notice was delivered late due to severe winter weather conditions.he attached a letter from federal express indicating that the late delivery was due to the winter weather.
in march,the bia denied the motion to reconsider because the motion merely offered an explanation for late delivery and did not expose an error of fact or law in the prior decision.this petition followed.
standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction over petitions for review to determine our jurisdiction.gonzales,cir,adopted in part by,cir en banc we adopt the portion of the panel opinion addressing the government claim that,under a c,we lack jurisdiction.we review the jurisdictional limitations of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira de novo.barron ashcroft,cir.
discussion 
generally,the courts of appeals have jurisdiction to review final removal orders of the bia.a.however,congress has restricted judicial review where an alien is removable based on a conviction for certain crimes.a c.such crimes include those involving moral turpitude other than a purely political offense,a a i,and a violation of any state law relating to a controlled substance other than a single offense of possession of a small quantity of marijuana,a b i.
turcios convictions are covered under a c.he admitted that he was previously convicted of sale of cocaine,felony spousal abuse,resisting arrest,and eight separate instances of petty theft while in the united states.petty theft is a crime involving moral turpitude,united states,cir,and spousal abuse is a crime of moral turpitude.grageda ins,cir.
as noted by turcios,the real id act of provides that the restriction on judicial review for criminal aliens be construed so as to preserve this court jurisdiction to address constitutional claims and issues of law raised in petitions for review,at.turcios argues that whether the bia abused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider as untimely is a question of law which this court has jurisdiction to consider.
in reviewing this question,other courts have determined that the real id act does not confer jurisdiction over challenges to the exercise of routine discretion by the bia.see de la vega gonzales,cir holding that upon review of circuit case law and the legislative history of section of the real id act,nothing in that section confers jurisdiction over challenges to the exercise of routine discretion by the bia xiao ji chen united states,cir holding that challenges to the exercise of routine discretion by the attorney general or the ij as his designee do not raise constitutional claims or questions of law under section of the real id act grass gonzales,cir section grants no jurisdiction to review an ij purely discretionary decision to deny a continuance of a removal hearing,unless that ruling resulted in such procedural unfairness as to implicate due process.vasile gonzales,cir notwithstanding a of the real id act,discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals entertaining a petition for review.gattem gonzales,cir holding that,under section,the courts of appeals have jurisdiction to consider question s of law raised in petitions for review,but not discretionary decisions of the attorney general.
turcios challenges only the bia denial of discretionary relief of reconsideration of its prior decision dismissing the untimely notice of appeal.he does not raise any constitutional challenges,nor does he raise any questions of law as contemplated by the real id act.since the bia denial of turcios motion to reconsider was an exercise of routine discretion,we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
i respectfully dissent.i am filing the same dissent in holder,and turcios holder,because these two cases raise identical legal issues,in materially similar factual and legal contexts.the issue in both cases is whether the board of immigration appeals ought to have considered an appeal that was sent in time to arrive before the deadline,and was guaranteed by the shipper to arrive in time,but got stamped in at board headquarters the day after the due date.the merits are not at issue before us,just lateness.the issue of lateness affects innumerable cases,and it is a matter of chance whether an alien attempting to appeal falls into this pit.
in turcios,the alien lawyer attached to his motion for reconsideration a letter from fedex express.fedex says that although the shipment was due for delivery by on december severe weather conditions caused an extensive and lengthy disruption of our transportation system,and thus the parcel did not reach its destination on the anticipated date.delivery was completed on december at 
in,the alien lawyer personally brought the notice of appeal to the post office first thing in the morning for guaranteed express mail delivery the next day,which would have been timely.however,for the first time in over ten years,attorney was let down by late express mail delivery.a clerk told her that some sort of error appeared to have been made by the post office at the airport in virginia.the post office error caused the notice of appeal to get to the bia a day late 
although the bia interprets the statutes and regulations as requiring that filing deadlines be strictly enforced,the bia also acknowledges that it has the authority to relieve litigants from the consequences of late filing for exceptional circumstances.the bia,in both cases,followed its own panel decision in in re liadov which held that short delays by overnight delivery services are not extraordinary,so appellants must take such possibilities into account and act accordingly.the only place notices of appeal can be filed is falls church,virginia so evidently act accordingly means fly to one of the area airports or send the notice at some unknown and unpredictable time prior to the deadline so that the bia would think the delivery service delay extraordinary.the board holds that even though it lacks authority to extend the thirty day deadline,it does have authority to certify a case to itself under c where a case presents exceptional circumstances.
oddly,the bia does not provide for any means of filing notices of appeal other than showing up in falls church,a trip most aliens could afford to pay their lawyers to make from outside the sending the papers by post office or private delivery service.federal courts,no seekers of novelty themselves,generally provide for electronic case filing the federal rules of civil procedure expressly address electronic filing doubtless electronic filing saves attorneys
