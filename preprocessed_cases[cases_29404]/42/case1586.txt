on october,appellant abduladhim ahmed al sabahi was charged in a superseding indictment with knowingly possessing firearms while illegally and unlawfully present in the united states,in violation of g a and a.a jury found al sabahi guilty of three counts.al sabahi appealed,alleging that he was not illegally or unlawfully present in the united states,that the district court committed a confrontation clause violation,and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.we now affirm.
on november,al sabahi a native of yemen entered the united states using a visa that expired in may.al sabahi remained in the united states after his visa expired without obtaining authorization to do so.on january,al sabahi voluntarily registered with the national security entry exit registration system nseers,a war on program pursuant to which men of certain ages and from certain countries were fingerprinted,photographed,and interviewed.immigrations and customs enforcement then placed al sabahi in removal proceedings because he had overstayed his visa.in august,al sabahi married a united states citizen,and he thereafter filed an i application to legalize his presence in the united states.
at the time of the events relevant to this case,al sabahi worked at scooters in and out convenience store in littleton,north carolina.on february,a pepsi employee named jonathan mosley came to scooters to remove a pepsi cooler.al sabahi placed a millimeter pistol on the store counter during mosley visit.according to mosley,al sabahi told him that he could not take the cooler.mosley then left the store and called his supervisor,donald ferguson.when ferguson arrived,he saw the gun and realized that al sabahi was not going to release the cooler.ferguson then called mike suggs,the chief of the littleton police department.suggs did not see the gun when he arrived,but he had seen it on prior occasions.suggs told al sabahi to keep the gun under the store counter.
on march,suggs and other officers were conducting a traffic checkpoint.officer shane jenkins stopped al sabahi,who was driving a gold toyota camry.although ali saleh the owner of scooters owned the car,al sabahi frequently borrowed it.suggs looked down at the car floorboard and saw part of a pistol grip.he asked jenkins to remove al sabahi from the car and then retrieved a millimeter pistol from the vehicle.suggs was familiar with the pistol and was aware that al sabahi sometimes carried it in the vehicle.suggs instructed jenkins to charge al sabahi with carrying a concealed weapon.
on may,ronald lee came to scooters to sell a caliber handgun to saleh.saleh was not present at the store,so al sabahi took cash from the register and purchased the firearm.lee prepared a receipt in al sabahi name.when saleh found out that al sabahi had bought the gun,he contacted lee and told him that al sabahi was an illegal alien and should not have purchased a firearm.lee later met with saleh and prepared a new receipt that named saleh as the purchaser.
saleh testified that,on september,he went home and found al sabahi drunk,carrying the caliber handgun,and claiming that it belonged to him.al sabahi then left with the firearm,and saleh reported the theft to the police.jenkins later retrieved the gun from one of saleh relatives.
on may,al sabahi was charged in a indictment with violating g a and a.these provisions make it a crime for an alien illegally or unlawfully in the united states to knowingly possess in or affecting commerce,any firearm or ammunition.g a see also id.a subjecting individuals who knowingly violate g a to a fine and up to ten years imprisonment.al sabahi moved to dismiss the indictment on august,arguing that he was not illegally or unlawfully in the united states because he registered with nseers and had filed an i application for an adjustment of his status.al sabahi also contended that only an immigration judge had jurisdiction to determine whether he was legally present in the united states because he had been placed in removal proceedings.the district court denied al sabahi motion to dismiss.
on october,al sabahi was charged once again in a superseding indictment with violating g a and a.count one concerned the february,incident with the millimeter pistol that took place at scooters count related to the march,incident with the same gun that occurred during the traffic stop count three involved the may,incident in which al sabahi purchased the caliber handgun and count four concerned the september,incident involving the same gun,which took place at saleh residence.
al sabahi trial took place from january,to january.at trial,al sabahi attempted to introduce a telephone call report concerning his encounter with the pepsi employee.the district court held that the document did not fall within any exceptions to the rule against hearsay and that,even if it did,the court would exclude it under federal rule of evidence.a jury found al sabahi guilty on counts one,two,and three and not guilty on count four.the district court sentenced al sabahi to months imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently.al sabahi filed a timely appeal,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we turn first to al sabahi argument that the district court should not have found that he was illegally or unlawfully present in the united states.we review de novo the district court ruling on al sabahi motion to dismiss the indictment.united states brandon,cir.
federal regulations recognize that a lien s illegally or unlawfully in the united states include nonimmigrant s whose authorized period of stay has expired.as a general matter,
an alien who is only permitted to remain in the united states for the duration of his or her status becomes illegally or unlawfully in the united states for purposes of g a upon commission of a status violation.we look to the date of the status violation to determine when the alien presence became unauthorized,not to when that violation is recognized by official decree.
united states atandi,cir footnote omitted see also united states latu,cir united states bazargan,cir.furthermore,an alien who has acquired unlawful or illegal status either by overstaying a visa or illegally crossing the border without admission or parole can not relinquish that illegal status until his application for adjustment of status is approved.united states elrawy,cir.al sabahi remained in the united states after his visa expired,and his request for adjustment of status has not been approved.therefore,under these general principles,al sabahi was illegally or unlawfully in the united states at the time he possessed the firearms in question.
despite these general rules,al sabahi makes two arguments that he was not illegally or unlawfully present in the united states under g a.first,he contends that he was in effect paroled via d when he registered through nseers.pursuant to,aliens are not illegally or unlawfully in the united states if they are in valid parole status.the provides that the attorney general may parole aliens into the united states temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.d a.in this case,however,the attorney general did not take any action on al sabahi behalf,and al sabahi does not identify any urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit that warranted his parole.furthermore,parole is granted only to aliens who have not yet entered the united states,united states anaya acosta,cir per curiam,and al sabahi was already present in the united states when he complied with the nseers program.therefore,al sabahi argument that he was not illegally or unlawfully present in the united states because he was in effect paroled fails.
second,al sabahi argues that he was placed in limbo or quasi immigration status when he filed his i application for adjustment of his status.in support of this argument,al sabahi cites the tenth circuit decision in united states hernandez,cir.in hernandez,the tenth circuit held that the district court properly convicted the defendant under g because he purchased the gun in question before filing an amnesty application.id.at.the court explained in dicta that,h ad th
