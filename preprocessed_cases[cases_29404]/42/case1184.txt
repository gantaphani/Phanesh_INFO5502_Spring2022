while this petition was pending in this court,petitioners and the attorney general filed a joint motion with the bia to reopen the bia proceedings.the bia granted that motion and reissued its decisions and orders without change.the petitioners did not file a petition for review in this court of the reissued decisions and orders.thereafter the attorney general filed a motion with this court to dismiss the petition for review of the original decisions and orders for lack of jurisdiction.we hold that because the reissued decisions and orders did not alter the prior decisions and orders that petitioners challenge in their petition,we have jurisdiction over their petition.therefore we will deny the attorney general motion to dismiss the petitions on jurisdictional grounds.we,however,will deny the petition for review on the merits.
ii.factual background and procedural history 
ordonez is a native and citizen of guatemala who has three sons.ordonez first entered the united states on march,unaccompanied by her children and apparently without inspection,but on that day border patrol agents detained her.she claims that during this detention she expressed fear of returning to guatemala because of abuse she had suffered there.nevertheless,the department of homeland security,after serving her with a notice and order of expedited removal,removed her on april.but on june,within less than two months of her removal,ordonez reentered the united states with her youngest son,gonzalez,who was then six years old,apparently again without inspection.this entry also was not successful,as the border patrol detained her and gonzalez on june.in immigration court proceedings that followed,the ij in his decision stated that,as ordonez explained it,she returned with her son because she was told that it was more likely that she would be released if she were to show up with a child.ar.ordonez,however,left her other two sons in guatemala with her parents.following ordonez second detention,the department of homeland security initiated proceedings against her to restore the prior order of removal,and served gonzalez with a notice to appear in immigration court to answer the charge that he was removable under a a i.
on september,while these removal proceedings were pending,ordonez filed an application seeking asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat gonzalez applied for similar relief as a derivative applicant on his mother application.
in the immigration court,ordonez resisted removal and sought protective relief based on her alleged fear of abusive conduct by her former boyfriend,jose lopez,with whom she had a relationship from approximately to.ordonez contended before the ij that during that time frame,lopez subjected her to verbal,physical,and sexual abuse.ordonez testified in the immigration court that in april,she ended her relationship with lopez and thereafter she had no contact or communication with him until january,when,apparently by chance,she encountered him.ordonez asserts that during this encounter,lopez grabbed her on the street,kicked her,threw her to the ground,and attempted to rape her,but she managed to escape.ordonez claims that later in the same month,lopez found her at her home and raped her.she alleges that he threatened to kill her and any of her children who were with her if he saw her again.as a result of these alleged actions and threats,ordonez asserts that she stopped leaving her house alone and fled to this country to escape lopez.
following oral testimony and the filing of affidavits,an ij on december,denied ordonez claims for relief.in his oral decision,the ij first noted that ordonez was placed only in withholding of removal proceedings in accordance with e because she was ineligible for asylum due to the reinstatement of the prior order for her removal.see a.in addressing the merits of the case,the ij concluded that ordonez was not credible given her vague recollections of dates,inconsistencies between her testimony and documentary evidence,and his belief that her testimony regarding the border patrol conduct during her first attempt to enter this country was inconsistent with what the court knows to be the practice of the border patrol.ar.accordingly,he rejected her application.the ij further determined that even if her testimony had been credible,she still failed to establish a basis for withholding of her removal.finally,the ij denied ordonez relief on her cat claim because he determined that there was no basis to find that any harm she had suffered in guatemala or would suffer if she returned to that country had been or would be inflicted or instigated by or with the consent,acquiescence,or willful blindness of any public official or person acting in an official capacity.
the ij also determined that gonzalez claims failed because of ordonez lack of credibility.the ij found support for this outcome by observing that gonzalez two older brothers continued to live in guatemala without incident,a circumstance from which an inference could be drawn that he could safely return to that country.petitioners appealed to the bia from the ij decisions and orders.
on may,the bia dismissed petitioners appeals.in reaching its result,the bia discerned no clear error in the ij consideration of the totality of the circumstances,ar,and concluded that the ij provided specific,cogent reasons for finding ordonez not credible under section b b iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,ar.moreover,the bia concluded that ordonez had not presented independent evidence showing that a probability as opposed to a possibility of torture is more likely than not,by or with the consent or acquiescence to include the concept of willful blindness of an official of the guatemalan government if she returned to guatemala.ar.as a result,the bia dismissed ordonez appeal in its entirety.
in a separate decision and order,also issued on may,the bia dismissed gonzalez appeal from the decision and order that the ij had rendered with respect to him.the bia first referenced its affirmance of the ij denial of ordonez claims for asylum and withholding of removal due to her lack of credibility.the bia then noted that gonzalez asylum application was derivative to ordonez and thus he did not have an independent claim for relief.accordingly,the bia concluded that,in light of his mother ineligibility for relief,his claims,too,must fail.alternatively,the bia noted that any threatened harm to gonzalez,even if credible,would not be on account of any protected ground.further,the bia highlighted the fact that the record did not reflect that gonzalez suffered any harm before leaving guatemala or that his two older brothers who remained in guatemala suffered any harm either before or after their mother left guatemala to come to this country.finally,the bia rejected gonzalez cat claim because the adverse credibility finding with respect to ordonez entirely foreclosed his claims.
on may,petitioners filed a timely petition for review and a motion for a stay of removal in this court.on june,the attorney general and petitioners filed a joint motion with the bia to reopen the bia proceedings because neither party had received the decision and order from the bia that dismissed gonzalez appeal.on the same day,the attorney general filed a motion to hold the proceedings on the petition for review in abeyance in light of the joint motion before the bia to reopen the proceedings before the bia.the attorney general argued that i f the board reopens proceedings,this court will no longer have jurisdiction over the board decision that is currently the subject of the petition for review filed in this case.see respondent motion to hold proceedings in abeyance,at june.petitioners did not object to this request.
on july,the bia entered an order in which it granted the joint motion to reopen the bia proceedings.specifically,the bia stated that t he record reflects that a separate decision was prepared on behalf of gonzalez,but may not have been received by the parties.respondent response to court order and motion to dismiss,ex,at cir.consequently,the bia ordered that its prior decisions of may,with respect to both petitioners,be reissued and further determined that they shall be treated as entered as of today date namely,july.id.
petitioners filed an uncontested motion for a stay of removal and on august,we granted that motion and denied the attorney general motion to hold the proceedings in abeyance as moot in light of the bia july,reissuance of its may,decisions and orders.we also asked the parties to comment on the purpose of the motion to reopen and the effect,if any,of the bia reissuance of its earlier decisions and orders on this court jurisdiction.
the attorney general on august,filed a motion to dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.in that submission,the attorney general clarified that the purpose of the joint motion before the bia was to allow the bia to address gonzalez claims,as the parties may not have recognized that it already had done so.the attorney general argued that,as a result of the bia reissuance of its earlier decisions and orders,we lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition for review because the may,decisions and orders were no longer final.the attorney general also asserted that petitioners would have days from the date of the reissuance of the decisions and orders,until august,to file a petition for review of the reissued decisions and orders.but petitioners did not file a new petition for review within that time period or at any point thereafter.accordingly,we directed the parties to file supplemental letter memoranda to address the question of whether we have jurisdiction.
petitioners contended in response to our direction to comment on the question of the motion to reopen that the bia reissued its may,decisions and orders on july,solely to cure an unintentionally incomplete record,and the reissuance of the may,decisions and orders,without change,did not render the initial petition for appellate review moot.they asserted that,to the contrary,the reopening ripened the case so that the decisions and orders could be reissued and we could address their pending petition for review on the merits.the attorney general,however,argued that the bia original decisions and orders were no longer final,as they had been vacated and replaced by the new decisions and orders and therefore we do not have jurisdiction over the petition for review of the original decisions and orders.the attorney general also pointed out that p etitioners had ample opportunity to file new petitions for review after the newly issued decisions,particularly inasmuch as the attorney general motion to dismiss,filed on august,specifically alerted the parties to the necessity of filing new petitions for review on or before august.see respondent letter memorandum in response to the court,order,at.
iii.statement of jurisdiction and standard of review 
the bia had jurisdiction over this action pursuant to b and.we discuss our jurisdiction under a,ina a,at length below and ultimately conclude that we have jurisdiction on the merits,we decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order s of removal were based,b a,and the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,b b.
iv.discussion 
jurisdiction 
an order of removal may be reviewed only when t he petition for review is filed not later than days after the date of the final order of removal.b emphasis added.though the petition for review was timely,we are left with the jurisdictional issue of whether the bia grant of a motion to reopen proceedings,which resulted in the reissuance of previous decisions and orders without change,divested us of jurisdiction to hear the merits of the petition for review from the original decisions and orders.we conclude that it does not.
in stone ins,d,the supreme court interpreted the consolidation provision of which currently reads as follows when a petitioner seeks review of an order under this section,any review sought of a motion to reopen or reconsider the order shall be consolidated with the review of the order.b.the issue before the court in stone was whether the court of appeals for the sixth circuit correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear a petition for review of a deportation order then pending before it,the specific question being whether the filing of a timely motion for reconsideration of a decision by the board of immigration appeals tolls the time period for seeking judicial review of the decision.stone,at.at.
stone dealt with an adverse deportation decision and order that the bia made with respect to the petitioner,marvin stone,on july.id.at.at.without then filing a petition for review,stone filed a timely motion to reopen reconsider the july,decision and order with the bia in august.id.on february,some months later the bia denied the motion as frivolous.id.thereafter,stone petitioned the court of appeals for review of both the july,deportation order and the february,denial of his motion to reopen or reconsider.id.on a simple counting of days,the petition was timely as to the february order,but untimely as to the july deportation order.see id.the court of appeals held that it did not have jurisdiction to review the july,deportation order,though it could review the february,order denying the motion to reopen.the issue in the supreme court,then,was whether the filing of the motion to reopen for reconsideration tolled the time within which stone could file a petition for review of the july,deportation order,or,alternatively,whether stone petition for review was out of time with respect to that order so that the court of appeals correctly dismissed it.see id.
turning to the consolidation provision,the court concluded that b y its terms,it contemplates two petitions for review and directs the courts to consolidate the matters.id.at.at.the court elaborated 
the words of the statute do not permit us to say that the filing of a petition for reconsideration or reopening dislodges the earlier proceeding reviewing the underlying order.the statute,in fact,directs that the motion to reopen or reconsider is to be consolidated with the review of the order,not the other way around.this indicates to us that the action to review the underlying order remains active and pending before the court.we conclude that the statute is best understood as reflecting an intent on the part of congress that deportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashion after issuance,irrespective of the later filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider.
stone established that the initial bia decision is final when issued,irrespective of the later filing of a reconsideration motion,and the aggrieved party would seek judicial review of the order within the specified period.upon denial of reconsideration,the petitioner would file a separate petition to review that second final order.id.at.at accord id.at.at the consolidation provision reflects congress understanding that a deportation order is final,and reviewable,when issued.its finality is not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.stone dealt with a scenario in which the petitioner did not file his petition from the initial bia order but rather filed his petition after the bia denied his motion for reopening or reconsideration.consequently,the court of appeals correctly did not review the deportation order.
