miguel angel gomez hernandez gomez hernandez appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following his conviction for illegal reentry after deportation,in violation of a,enhanced by b.he challenges the district court determination that his prior arizona state court conviction for attempted aggravated assault is a crime of violence,and the resulting sentencing enhancement under the sentencing guidelines manual b a ii 
gomez hernandez principal contention on appeal is that his attempted aggravated assault conviction is not a crime of violence because completed aggravated assault under arizona law encompasses a lesser mens rea than the generic definition of aggravated assault ordinary recklessness rather than extreme indifference recklessness.but he was convicted of attempted aggravated assault and,under arizona law,attempted aggravated assault can not be based on this lesser mens rea.in essence,gomez herndandez would have us ignore his crime of conviction and,instead,consider each statute underlying his conviction in isolation.
the supreme court has rejected such a approach.the purpose of comparing the statute of conviction to the generic offense is to determine whether a defendant prior conviction justifies stricter consequences under the sentencing guidelines,such as the sentencing enhancement imposed here.thus,the court has been clear that this analysis should be conducted in the context of the defendant actual crime of conviction.see james united states,applying approach established in taylor united states.
here,we have no doubt that gomez hernandez conviction for attempted aggravated assault rested on the elements of generic attempted aggravated assault.we have jurisdiction under and,and we affirm.
gomez hernandez was born in mexico in and moved to the united states with his family when he was years old.on september,gomez hernandez was indicted for aggravated assault and attempted aggravated assault in the arizona superior court for maricopa county.the indictment alleged that gomez hernandez,using a carpet,a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument,intentionally,knowingly or recklessly caused a physical injury to,in violation of.a,a,b,a,and.it further alleged that gomez hernandez,using a carpet,a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument,intentionally,knowingly or recklessly attempted to cause a physical injury to,in violation of,a,b,a,and.both offenses were charged as dangerous felonies involving the discharge,use,or threatening exhibition of a carpet,a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument,the intentional or knowing infliction of serious physical injury upon the named victim,in violation of.p.
on october,gomez hernandez pled guilty to aggravated assault and attempted aggravated assault as charged in the indictment.at the plea colloquy,gomez hernandez testified briefly regarding the facts underlying the charges

the defendant yes,your honor 
gomez hernandez was sentenced to years on the aggravated assault count and six years on the attempted aggravated assault count,both to run concurrently.he was deported to mexico on february,following the completion of his sentence.
on october,the border patrol apprehended gomez hernandez near douglas,arizona.he was indicted and pled guilty to one count of illegal after deportation,in violation of a,enhanced by b.over his objection,the district court imposed a sentence based,in part,on a enhancement under ussg b a ii for his previous deportation following the arizona conviction 
the district court allowed gomez hernandez to enter into a conditional plea of guilty permitting this appeal of the enhancement.gomez hernandez timely appealed.
we review de novo a district court determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence.united states rodriguez guzman,cir.the sentencing guidelines provide for a enhancement for a defendant convicted under,i f the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence.ussg b a ii.aggravated assault is specifically enumerated in the application note to guideline as a crime of violence,see ussg cmt.b iii,as is attempting to commit aggravated assault,see ussg cmt.
we apply the approach set forth in taylor to determine whether gomez hernandez prior conviction for attempted aggravated assault is a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines.see esparza herrera,at.under the categorical approach,federal courts do not examine the facts underlying the prior offense,but look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense and compare it to the generic definition of the offense.united states espinoza cano,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also taylor,at explaining that the categorical approach generally requires the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.
if the statutory definition of the prior offense is not a categorical match,we apply the modified categorical approach.we examine limited categories of documents to determine whether the facts underlying the conviction necessarily establish that the defendant committed the generic offense.espinoza cano,at citing taylor,at.w hen the conviction in question is based on a guilty plea,we have approved the sentencing court consideration of the charging documents in conjunction with the plea agreement,the transcript of a plea proceeding,or the judgment id.internal quotation marks omitted.
two related taylor analyses are required to determine whether a prior conviction for an attempt offense qualifies as a crime of violence.see united states saavedra velazquez,cir rebilas mukasey,cir.specifically,we must determine whether the defendant conviction establishes that he committed the elements of the generic definition of attempt and that the underlying offense he attempted meets the generic definition of that offense.see saavedra velazquez,at rebilas,f d at.
gomez hernandez challenges the district court determination that his prior arizona conviction for attempted aggravated assault constitutes a crime of violence under the guidelines.we conduct the two taylor analyses first,we ask whether gomez hernandez attempted aggravated assault conviction corresponds to the generic definition of attempt second,we ask whether the offense he attempted corresponds to the generic definition of aggravated assault.
we have previously determined that arizona attempt statute and the generic definition of attempt are,in general,coextensive.see united states taylor,cir.although our prior analysis was based on arizona case law as of june,see,we are not aware of any subsequent arizona decision deviating from the generic definition of attempt.see id.at common law an attempt was defined as the specific intent to engage in criminal conduct and an overt act which is a substantial step towards committing the crime.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.thus,we are satisfied that gomez hernandez was convicted of the generic elements of attempt.
we turn to the second taylor inquiry was gomez hernandez convicted of attempting to commit the elements of generic aggravated assault,the underlying offense gomez hernandez argues that he was not because completed aggravated assault under arizona law encompasses a lesser mens rea than generic aggravated assault and arizona aggravated assault statute criminalizes behavior.we address and reject each of gomez hernandez arguments in turn.
there is no dispute that an arizona conviction for aggravated assault as opposed to attempted aggravated assault does not categorically qualify as a crime of violence under guideline b a ii.see esparza herrera,at.
