the board of immigration appeals denied the asylum application of francis gatimi,a kenyan,and the applications of his wife and daughter,which are derivative from his.the board also denied a motion to remand the matter to the immigration judge for further consideration based on changed conditions in kenya since the original application for asylum,but we have no jurisdiction to review that order a bars judicial review of rulings by the board that there are no changed circumstances materially affecting an application for asylum.see khan filip,cir.and a b ii,as interpreted in kucana mukasey,cir,cert.granted,d,bars judicial review of discretionary decisions of the board,thus including motions to reconsider,see a,b,which was the nature of gatimi motion to remand.
gatimi is a member of the kikuyu tribe,which dominates kenyan politics.in he joined a kikuyu group called the mungiki the kikuyu word for multitude.the group has obscure political aims and idiosyncratic religious observances,which may be a cover for extortion and other financially motivated criminal acts.united nations human rights council,report of the special rapporteur on extrajudicial,summary or arbitrary executions,philip alston,addendum,mission to kenya,may,visited july,were all the online sources cited in this opinion dep t of state,bureau of democracy,human rights,and labor,human rights report kenya,www.state.gov g drl rls hrrpt af.htm.

the group also compels women,including wives of members and of defectors,to undergo clitoridectomy and excision.the kenyan government has outlawed the group and these practices.but there is a serious question,as the sources we have cited explain,whether it is able or even willing to protect people targeted by the group,such as defectors,or to prevent such practices,which are common in kenya as in much of africa.dep t of state,bureau of democracy,human rights,and labor,human rights report kenya,www.state.gov g drl rls hrrpt af.htm dep t of state,office of the senior coordinator for international women issues,report on female genital mutilation,www.state.gov documents organization.pdf.
gatimi defected from the mungiki in,and shortly afterward a group of mungiki broke into his home,looking for him,and when they could not find him killed his servant.he called the police,but they refused to help or protect him.a month later the mungiki returned to his home,looking for his wife,whom they wanted to circumcise.they did not find her.she then fled to the united states with her newborn child.
the mungiki returned to gatimi home,killed the family pets,burned two vehicles,and threatened to gouge out his eyes.again he complained to the police,and this time they assured him they would protect him.on the strength of this assurance his wife came back to within a week the mungiki told gatimi that unless he produced his wife within two weeks for circumcision he would be killed.she went into hiding and in returned to the united states,followed shortly by gatimi.
he returned to kenya a few months later,having heard that conditions had improved.he was wrong.the mungiki kidnapped and tortured him,releasing him only after he promised to produce his wife for circumcision.he left kenya and joined his wife in the united states and applied for asylum.
the immigration judge ruled that the acts committed by the mungiki against gatimi were not persecution but merely mistreatment.that is absurd.with regard to gatimi claim to face persecution in the form of female genital mutilation,a recognized ground of asylum,the immigration judge lapsed into incoherence.the following is his entire discussion of the claim as far as the female respondent claim that she is afraid to return to kenya because of fear of female genital mutilation,while that contention may be sincerely subjectively expressed,i do find that as toward country conditions that is,it has an objective basis.he also ruled that gatimi had not shown that the kenyan police were helpless to protect him from the mungiki,and that in any event defectors from the mungiki do not constitute a particular social group.
the board did not reach the question whether gatimi had been persecuted,but affirmed the immigration judge on the basis that defectors from the mungiki are not a particular social group and that as far as gatimi fear of female circumcision was concerned gatimi had failed to present sufficient testimonial or documentary evidence to establish that a reasonable person would fear persecution in kenya on this basis.
persecution is a ground for asylum only if motivated by race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.the immigration statute does not define particular social group,but the board has defined it as a group whose members share common characteristics that members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because such characteristics are fundamental to their individual identities.in re kasinga,bia see also lwin ins,cir in re acosta,bia,overruled on other grounds by in re mogharrabi,bia.so far,so good if the members have no common characteristics they ca constitute a group,and if they can change those is,cease to belong to the significant hardship,they should be required to do so rather than be allowed to resettle in america if they do not meet the ordinary criteria for immigration to this country.
sepulveda gonzales,cir citations omitted,gives examples of qualifying groups the educated,landowning class of cattle farmers targeted by colombian rebels,christian women in iran who oppose the islamic dress code for women,parents of burmese student dissidents,and children who escaped after being enslaved from ugandan guerillas who had enslaved them.sepulveda holds that former subordinates of the attorney general of colombia who had information about the insurgents plaguing that nation were also a particular social group.they had been targeted for assassination by the insurgents,and many had been assassinated.while an employee could resign from the attorney general office,he could not resign from a group defined as former employees of the office once a former employee,always a former employee unless one is reemployed by one former employer.see also koudriachova gonzales,cir former kgb agents ins,cir former members of the police or military in re fuentes,bia former member of the national police.
we can not see how this case can be distinguished from sepulveda,which the board did not cite.instead the board cited cases which hold that a group must have social visibility to be a particular social group,meaning that members of a society perceive those with the characteristic in question as members of a social group.the board said there was no evidence that gatimi possesses any characteristics that would cause others in kenyan society to recognize him as a former member of mungiki there is no showing that membership in a larger body of persons resistant to mungiki is of concern to anyone in kenya or that such individuals are seen as a segment of the population in any meaningful respect.
this formula can not be squared with sepulveda.more important,it makes no sense nor has the board attempted,in this or any other case,to explain the reasoning behind the criterion of social visibility.women who have not yet undergone female genital mut
