opinion of the court 
the issue before us is whether an alien married to a united states citizen remains an immediate relative,within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act ina,if the couple had been married for less than two years when her citizen spouse died.it is an issue this court has never addressed.
factual and procedural history 
osserritta robinson robinson,a citizen and national of jamaica,entered the united states on january,as an visitor on a visa and married louis robinson robinson,a united states citizen,in february.in march,robinson filed a petition for alien relative petition for an immigrant visa on behalf of his wife as an immediate relative.at the same time,robinson filed an application to adjust her immigration status to that of a lawful permanent resident lpr.
robinson died on october,in the staten island ferry accident.on october,the citizenship and immigration services uscis informed robinson that her petition had been automatically terminated upon the death of her husband.according to uscis,robinson was no longer an immediate relative within the meaning of the ina because her husband death occurred before the couple had been married for two years.
robinson filed a petition for a writ of mandamus and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against michael chertoff,the secretary of the department of homeland security,and emilio gonzalez,director,citizenship and immigration services requesting that the court order uscis to reopen her petition and application and treat her as an immediate relative of a united states citizen.the complaint also asked the court to enjoin uscis from using the death of robinson as a discretionary factor in adjudicating robinson application.robinson chertoff,wl,at may.the district court denied the government motion to dismiss and granted summary judgment in favor of robinson.thereupon,the district court set aside uscis determination that robinson was not a spouse,ordered uscis to process her petition and application,and granted a declaratory judgment that robinson is an immediate relative under b a i and for the purposes of adjudicating an petition.app.at the government appeals.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under and section of the apa,to review the meaning of the term immediate relative as it appears in b a i.because this is a purely legal question and does not implicate agency discretion,the ina jurisdictional bar,a b ii,which precludes judicial review of most discretionary immigration decisions,is not applicable in this case.pinho gonzales,cir.
we have jurisdiction under.we exercise plenary review of the district court statutory interpretation,but afford deference to a reasonable interpretation adopted by the agency.pinho,at.
statutory scheme 
a united states citizen who seeks to gain lawful permanent resident status for an eligible family member must begin the process by filing an petition with uscis on behalf of an alien who is an immediate relative.b a i,a a i a.concurrently,or thereafter,the alien spouse for whom the petition was filed the immediate relative must file an application for adjustment of status.a a.immediate relatives are defined in the ina as 
t he children,spouses,and parents of a citizen of the united states,except that,in the case of parents,such citizens shall be at least years of age.in the case of an alien who was the spouse of a citizen of the united states for at least years at the time of the citizen death and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen death,the alien shall be considered,for purposes of this subsection,to remain an immediate relative after the date of the citizen death but only if the spouse files a petition under section a a ii of this title an petition within years after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries.
b a i emphasis added 
uscis shall approve the petition filed by the citizen spouse only if it determines,after an investigation,that the facts stated in the petition are true and that the alien in behalf of whom the petition is made is an immediate relative.b.
approval of the petition renders the immediate relative eligible for adjustment of status under a,which provides,in pertinent part 
the status of an alien may be adjusted by the attorney general,in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe,to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien makes an application for such adjustment,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.
a.because immediate relative visas are not subject to numerical visa limitations,b a i,once the petition is approved the immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien spouse at the time her application is filed,a.thus,eligibility to adjust status to that of an lpr is contingent upon approval of the petition.
discussion 
robinson argues that she remained an immediate relative within the meaning of b a i after the death of her husband.the government counters that robinson is no longer a spouse eligible to be considered an immediate relative because she had not been married to her citizen spouse for two years at the time of his death.the government reads the second sentence of section b a i as qualifying the term spouse in the first sentence of the section.in other words,the government argues that a spouse remains an immediate relative within the meaning of the ina after the death of his or her citizen spouse only if the couple had been married for two years at the time of the citizen death.
robinson argues in response that because the first sentence of the provision does not in any way qualify the term spouse,she remains a spouse after her husband death.she interprets the second sentence which contains the marriage requirement as granting a separate right for widows to for visas rather than as a limitation on the definition of spouse.
more than years ago the bureau of immigration appeals bia considered the effect of a citizen spouse death on a pending petition for an immigrant visa on behalf of the alien spouse.in in re varela,the bia held that an alien spouse was no longer a spouse because her citizen spouse died prior to a determination of her petition.the government argues that we should defer to the bia precedent.
the district court,without even citing in re varela,agreed with robinson interpretation of the immediate relative provision,relying on the reasoning of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit in freeman gonzales,cir.the ninth circuit refused to accord deference to varela because it stated that the bia decision lack ed statutory analysis,and is further undercut by the bia later finding in in re sano,that it was.freeman,at citation added.
instead,the ninth circuit held that the first and second sentences of the statutory provision stand independent of each other and provide for two different processes,such that one or the other the citizen spouse petitions or,if he dies without doing so,the alien widow may do so.freeman,at.it reasoned that because the only limitation on the definition of immediate relative in the first sentence relates to alien parents the grant of immediate relative status is limited to those whose citizen child is at least years old and t here is no comparable qualifier to be a spouse,the term immediate relative means the spouse of a citizen,without exception.id.at.thus,according to that court,freeman qualified as the spouse of a citizen when she and her husband petitioned for adjustment of status,and absent a clear statutory provision voiding her spousal status upon her husband untimely death,she remains a surviving spouse.id.at emphasis in original.
the freeman court rejected the government argument that the second sentence implicitly qualifies the general definition of spouse by imposing a marriage requirement.instead,it viewed the second sentence as applying to those aliens whose citizen spouses did not initiate an adjustment of status proceeding before they died,granting such surviving spouses a beneficial right to file an immediate relative petition even without a living citizen spouse to vouch for the fact of the marriage.id.at.
relying on freeman,the district court held that robinson remained an immediate relative after the death of her spouse and noted that,t he court can not imagine that congress intended the time of death combined with the pace of adjudication,rather than the petitioner conscious decision to promptly file an petition,to be the proper basis for determining whether the alien qualifies as an immediate relative.robinson,wl,at.
robinson argues that the death of her husband did not affect her status as an immediate relative which,she contends,vested at the time her husband filed the petition.the government contends that immediate relative status is not determined at the time the petition was filed but at the time the petition is adjudicated.it supports that argument by noting that the present tense is used in b,the statutory provision governing the grant of immigrant visas.this provision states that the attorney general now the secretary of homeland security shall,if he determines that the facts stated in the petition are true and that the alien in behalf of whom the petition is made is an immediate relative specified in section b,approve the petition.b emphasis added.
the district court believed that the fact that the statute is written in the present tense is not particularly significant,robinson,wl,at,but we disagree.the use of the present tense in b belies robinson contention that an alien marital status at the time of filing the petition controls,and makes plain that the facts in the the alien spousal be true at the time uscis decides the petition.
the present tense is also used in the section governing adjustment of status,which provides that the attorney general may adjust the status of an alien if 
the alien makes an application for such adjustment,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.
a emphasis added.
robinson relies on the last clause of the subsection at the time his application is filed to argue that eligibility for immediate relative status at the time of filing the application is controlling.robinson statutory construction of the provision is not persuasive.instead,the natural reading of this provision is that the final clause applies to only the third requirement.see united states hodge,cir the doctrine of the last antecedent teaches that qualifying words,phrases,and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and not to others more remote.quoting resolution trust nernberg,cir.if the phrase,at the time his application is filed applied to more than the third requirement,its natural placement would be before the second as well as the third requirement.
in addition to her attempt to find support in the statutory language,robinson also argues that under the regulations governing the processing of petitions her eligibility for a visa is to be determined at the time of filing.she notes,for example,that a provides that the citizen spouse must file form for a qualifying relative and b provides that evidence in response to a request must establish eligibility at time of filing.however,these regulations merely set up the procedures by which a citizen petitions for a relative.a,a.they do not suggest that the agency must grant the application of a surviving spouse by considering only the marital status at the time the petition was filed.likewise,the regulation to which robinson points that provides that the agency must deny the petition if it receives additional evidence that shows that the surviving spouse was not eligible at the time of filing,b,merely shows that eligibility at the time of filing is a necessary condition for the grant of a petition it does not establish that eligibility at that time is sufficient if the citizen spouse dies before the adjudication.as such,the regulations do not support robinson argument.
accordingly,we hold that eligibility for an immediate relative visa depends upon the alien status at the time uscis adjudicates the petition,not when that petition was filed.this becomes dispositive in the situation when a citizen spouse dies before the citizen spouse and the alien were married for two years.
the underlying issue of statutory construction is not complicated.to repeat,section b a i provides 
t he term immediate relatives means the children,spouses,and parents of a citizen of the united states,except that,in the case of parents,such citizens shall be at least years of age.in the case of an alien who was the spouse of a citizen of the united states for at least years at the time of the citizen death and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen death,the alien shall be considered,for purposes of this subsection,to remain an immediate relative after the date of the citizen death but only if the spouse files a petition under section a a ii of this title within years after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries.
the first sentence of the immediate relative definition can not be divorced from the second sentence.the first sentence provides a general definition of immediate relatives based on familial relationships to a citizen.in the same sentence,the definition of parent is qualified by adding that a parent is deemed an immediate relative only if his or her child is at least years old.the second sentence qualifies the definition of spouse by including as an immediate relative the widow or widower of a citizen spouse who died as long as had been the spouse of the united states citizen for at least two years at the time of the citizen spouse death.for those surviving spouses who had been married for two years but for whom no petition for immediate relative status had yet been filed,the section also provides an opportunity to remedy that gap by authorizing the surviving spouse to within two years of the death of the citizen spouse.
the language and this interpretation is straightforward.significantly,the marriage requirement applies to both groups of surviving spouses,those for whom the citizen spouse had filed the petition before his death and those for whom the citizen spouse had not filed the petition.
the immediate relative provision contains one exception to the rule that the death of the citizen spouse terminates immediate relative status if the death occurs before the petition is granted,the exception covering the situation of a couple who had been married for two years at the time of the death as we stated in united states mcquilkin,cir,it is a canon of statutory construction that the inclusion of certain provisions implies the exclusions of others.the doctrine of inclusio unius est exclusio alterius informs a court to exclude from operation those items not included in a list of elements that are given effect expressly by the statutory language.id.at quoting in re tmi,cir.as a result,we conclude that a spouse ceases to be an immediate relative when the citizen spouse dies unless the couple had been married at least two years at the time of death.in effect,the second sentence qualifies which spouses of deceased citizens are immediate relatives,just as the last clause of the first sentence qualifies which parents of citizens are immediate relatives.
our reading of the immediate relative provision comports with the ordinary meaning of the term spouse.a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning at the time congress enacted the statute.perrin united states,d.the ina does not provide a helpful definition of the term spouse in its definitional section.instead,it negatively defines spouse by stating who is not a spouse the term sic spouse,wife,or husband do not include a spouse,wife,or husband by reason of any marriage ceremony where the contracting parties thereto are not physically present in the presence of each other,unless the marriage shall have been consummated.a.this can not be considered a definition in any meaningful way because it repeats the terms it seeks to define and,as robinson herself notes,does not preclude common understandings of the term.appellee br.at.
significantly,the ina definitional section does provide definitions of other terms such as child,which it defines to mean an unmarried person under years of age who satisfies other specific requirements.b,c.in addition,the ina includes a definition of parent that expressly includes a deceased parent.c.congress choice to include specific definitions of these common family and not to include such a definition of spouse strongly suggests that the ordinary meaning of spouse at the time of the enactment of the immediate relative provision should control.see perrin,at.
the original immediate relative provision of the ina was enacted in and stated in pertinent part i mmediate relatives shall mean the children,spouses and parents of a citizen of the united states provided,that in the case of parents,such citizen must be at least years of age.act to amend the immigration and nationality act,stat,codified as amended at b a i emphasis in original.the common,ordinary meaning of spouse in,according to black law dictionary covering that period,was o ne wife or husband.black law dictionary ed that entry also cites a oregon supreme court decision in which the court separately defined surviving spouse to mean the one,of a married pair,who outlives the other.rosell state indus.acc.comm n,or.
in,congress amended the ina to add the second sentence of the immediate relative provision,which,for the first time,extends the term to cover the situation of the death of the citizen spouse and includes the marriage requirement.immigration act of,stat.by that time,black law dictionary had added the following to its definition of spouse surviving spouse is one of a married pair who outlive the other.black law dictionary ed.we reject robinson argument that the inclusion of surviving spouse in the black law dictionary entry for spouse proves that she remains legally a spouse even though her husband is deceased.the fact that black law dictionary entry for spouse defines surviving spouse separately disproves robinson hypothesis.
moreover,to conclude that spouse and surviving spouse have the identical meaning is illogical and is contrary to our understanding of the legal effect of death on a marriage.the standard legal effect of death on marriage is that it terminates the legal union.see d marriage m arriage is terminable only by death or presumption of death,or by a judicial decree of divorce,dissolution,or annulment.the domestic relations law of new jersey the state in which robinson and her husband resided at the time of his death and the state in which this action was brought also suggests that a marriage terminates upon the death of one spouse.see stat.ann.a west former husband is presumed to be father of child born within days after the marriage is terminated by death,annulment or divorce stat.ann.a west belief that spouse is dead is defense to bigamy.
the very language of the immediate relative provision distinguishes between a living spouse and a surviving spouse when it states that an alien who was the spouse of a citizen of the united states for at least years at the time of the citizen death shall be considered to remain an immediate relative.b a i emphasis added.because robinson citizen spouse died before the couple was married for two years,robinson does not qualify as an immediate relative under the ina.
our dissenting colleague argues that robinson will be removed because her petition is stuck in the government bureaucracy.dissent typescript op.at.that misstates the facts and the law.we agree with the agency that robinson claim must be rejected,not because of any government bureaucracy but because she does not meet one of the congress requirements for immediate relative status,that she had been married to her citizen spouse for at least two years.congress has imposed a requirement of a particular length of a prior marriage in a variety of situations.for example,one of the ways in which a surviving spouse can qualify for veterans benefits is by showing that the surviving spouse was married to the veteran for one year or more.see see also a armed forces act b,c social security act.
we are aware that the result of our holding is that robinson is ineligible for lpr status as a result of a tragic accident that neither she nor her citizen spouse could have avoided or anticipated.but our obligation is to interpret the statute according to its language.our holding is consistent with the core purpose of the immigration policy the promotion of family unification for citizens and lawful permanent residents.see act to amend the immigration and nationality act,stat.at codified as amended at b a i,at,reunification of families is emphasized as the foremost consideration of the legislation.
admittedly,inclusion of a surviving spouse as an immediate relative if was married for two years also does not promote unification of the marital unit but congress undoubtedly recognized that other considerations become relevant once the alien spouse builds increased ties with the united states.a marriage that lasted two years can be presumed to have been bona fide,and in that period the surviving spouse would have developed settled expectations congress could reasonably determine that an alien with a pending petition who had been married to a citizen for less than two years at the time of the citizen spouse death is not entitled to lpr status.congress created a balance between the goal of family unity and the legitimate expectations of an whose connections to the united states were likely to have become solidified during the marriage period.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth,we will reverse the order of the district court and direct it to grant the government motion to dismiss.
as a result of the government fatally flawed interpretation of b,osseritta robinson will be removed from the united states,in spite of her full compliance with the ina,simply because the petition filed on her behalf by her deceased husband is stuck in the government bureaucracy.the government argues,and the majority agrees,that both the plain language of the statute and deference to their implementation of this provision dictate this result.i disagree for three reasons.first,i believe the plain language leads to a contrary result.second,even were this definition ambiguous,i would not defer to the government interpretation.third,i do not think that chevron,natural resources defense council,d even applies.i will discuss these reasons in inverse order.
in chevron the court ruled that when congress explicitly or implicitly delegates authority to an executive agency to develop regulations and practices to fill the interstices in the law,the courts must defer to them.the court held that t he power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,by congress.quoting morton ruiz,d.in chevron congress had failed to define a term.the epa promulgated detailed regulations and national standards defining the term at issue.the court held that because the regulatory scheme was technical and complex,the agency considered the matter in a detailed and reasoned fashion,and the decision involve d reconciling conflicting policies,courts must defer to the technical expertise of the agency.chevron,at.
here congress provided us with a definition of immediate relative and had no reason to delegate,explicitly or implicitly,any further authority to the executive department to further tweak the definition.the words and phrases at issue are not technical.the agency has no relevant expertise to more fully define them for us.there is no legislative history to suggest there existed any controversy which congress referred to the agency to resolve.the only
