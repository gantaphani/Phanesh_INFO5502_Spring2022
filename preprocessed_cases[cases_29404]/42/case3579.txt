this appeal concerns the notice required by statute before the state department could terminate an immigrant visa registration for failure to file a timely application.sukhwinder and dharam singh collectively the singhs challenge the termination of sukhwinder visa registration.the state department terminated sukhwinder visa registration for failure to apply within one year of notice of eligibility,but the singhs contend that the indirect notice provided was inadequate under section g of the immigration and nationality act ina,g.because section g requires notice to the alien,we reverse and remand for the district court to set aside the visa termination.
sukhwinder singh is a native and citizen of india.his brother dharam singh is a native of india who became a united states citizen in.in,dharam filed a petition with the and nationalization service to establish that sukhwinder was his brother and to begin the process of establishing sukhwinder eligibility for an immigrant visa.this filing is known as an petition or,simply,an.see a.in,dharam retained attorney gordon quan to assist with the petition,which the government soon thereafter approved.after nearly a decade,dharam contacted quan in september to request an update concerning the petition.quan sent a letter to sukhwinder address in india to inform him that the visa publication of the state department bureau of consular affairs that lists immigrant visa eligibility according to the date of the approved,country of origin and relationship with the not yet reached the priority date of dharam petition and that the embassy would not contact sukhwinder until he was eligible to apply for his immigrant visa.
on september,the national visa center nvc mailed an instructional packet to quan at his office address listed on the petition.quan records do not indicate that he received the packet or any subsequent mailing concerning dharam petition.on september,the nvc sent sukhwinder immigrant visa petition to the embassy in new dehli,india.the next month,the government sent correspondence to dharam,although the parties dispute whether it was a visa application packet or merely notice that sukhwinder case had been forwarded to the embassy in new dehli.
in,and,the embassy sent materials to quan address,back in the united states.then on september,the state department terminated sukhwinder visa registration and destroyed related records,based on sukhwinder failure to apply.throughout the process,state department records showed sukhwinder address as village paddabet,dhaliwa,dist.kapurthala,punjab,india,but there is no evidence that the embassy,the nvc or any other agency sent correspondence to that address.
while these events were transpiring,sukhwinder had left india on november,for the united states and petitioned for asylum,although his wife and children have continued to live at the address listed on the petition.the government placed sukhwinder in removal proceedings in september,and in february he applied for an adjustment of status to become a permanent resident.however,the government denied his request because his visa registration had been terminated in.as of june,removal proceedings against sukhwinder were still ongoing.
after the government denied sukhwinder application for adjustment of status,the singhs commenced this collateral litigation under the administrative procedure act apa,seeking reinstatement of the approved petition.the government answered,and the parties engaged in limited discovery before for summary judgment.in an opinion and order,the district court granted the government summary judgment.the court first found that the doctrine of consular nonreviewability did not deprive it of subject matter jurisdiction,because the singhs challenged the authority of the department of state,rather than an exercise of its discretion.the court then concluded that section g of the ina,which mandates termination of immigrant visa registration one year following notification to the alien,merely directs the agency to select means that were reasonably calculated,in the circumstances,to achieve the statutorily mandated goal of notifying the alien.the court reviewed the termination of sukhwinder visa registration under the arbitrary and capricious standard of the apa and found that no trier of fact addressing the undisputed evidence could rationally conclude that the agency did not have a rational basis for believing that the method that it chose to notify sukhwinder singh by sending the notices to attorney quan was reasonably calculated to get the message to the visa applicant.
the district court had jurisdiction under and and entered judgment in march,which the singhs timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.on appeal,the government has correctly abandoned its argument that consular nonreviewability places this suit outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.see patel reno,cir w hen the suit challenges the authority of the consul to take or fail to take an action as opposed to a decision taken within the consul discretion,jurisdiction exists.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment as well as its statutory interpretations de novo.photomedex,irwin,cir.we must determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.under the apa,a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.whether agency action is not in accordance with law is a question of statutory interpretation,rather than an assessment of reasonableness in the instant case.see nw.envtl.advocates u.envtl.prot.agency,cir citing holland mining ass n,cleveland ohio,cir see also coeur alaska,se.alaska conservation council,addressing statutory text,the agencies regulations construing it,and the epa subsequent interpretation of those regulations rather than mere reasonableness.
as an initial matter,the government suggests that this case may be moot because sukhwinder can not successfully adjust his status as a result of his unlawful entry in.although a permits only individuals inspected and admitted to adjust to permanent resident status,the beneficiary of an petition filed on or before april,may be excepted from that rule after paying a penalty.see i.sukhwinder is also not required to leave the united states to apply for a visa in india,subjecting himself to the reentry bar based on an extended unlawful presence,see id.a b i ii,because an individual who entered the united states without inspection need not return to his or her country of origin in order to apply for adjustment of status.see id.i.
qualified immigrants who are the brothers or sisters of citizens of the united states may be allocated immigrant visas according to a yearly quota system.a.subject to certain exceptions not present here,any citizen of the united states claiming that an alien is entitled to classification by reason of a relationship described in a may file a petition with the attorney general for such classification.id.a a i.the attorney general first investigates the alien beneficiary and then conveys approved petitions to the department of state.see id.b.the secretary of state must then authorize a consular officer to grant preference status to the beneficiary.see id.within each country of origin and preference category,the state department then issues visas to eligible immigrants in the order in which a petition in behalf of each such immigrant is filed with the attorney general.e see also g permitting an beneficiary with approved preference status to apply when he or she has a priority date on the waiting list which is earlier than the date shown in the visa bulletin for the alien country of origin and preference category.
