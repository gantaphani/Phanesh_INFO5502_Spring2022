this petition for review presents the question of whether convictions for solicitation to commit rape by force,in violation of california penal code c,and solicitation to commit assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury,in violation of california penal code a,constitute crimes of violence under a f for immigration law purposes.we hold that they do.accordingly,we dismiss the petition for review.
background 
sunil prakash is a native and citizen of fiji who became a lawful permanent resident of the united states in.in,prakash was charged with two felony violations of california penal code.count charged prakash with soliciting another to commit and join in the commission of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury with the intent that the crime be committed,in violation of california penal code a.count charged prakash with soliciting another to commit rape by force and violence with the intent that the crime be committed,in violation of california penal code c.after he pled nolo contendere,prakash was convicted of the crimes charged and sentenced to serve two years in prison.
prakash was thereafter placed in removal proceedings.based on the solicitation convictions,he was charged with the commission of an aggravated felony,specifically a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment was at least one year.prakash disputed the charge,contending that solicitation offenses do not fall within the meaning of crime of violence.
the immigration judge disagreed with prakash and ordered his removal from the united states pursuant to a a iii.he held that prakash convictions constituted crimes of violence because soliciting a person to assault and rape another person involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used against the person or property of another in the course of committing the offense.
the board of immigration appeals affirmed that decision,holding that prakash crimes by their nature involve a substantial risk that force will be used in the course of committing them.
prakash timely petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
under a c,this court does not have jurisdiction to review the removal of aliens who are removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.however,we retain jurisdiction over constitutional claims and questions of law.a d.we have jurisdiction over a case sufficient to determine whether we have jurisdiction.see,tall mukasey,cir.we also have jurisdiction to determine as a matter of law whether a conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under a a iii.see,ngaeth mukasey,cir mukasey,cir mukasey,cir.we review this legal question de novo.see,at,at.
iii.discussion 
the term aggravated felony is defined in a,a provision with a long list of subsections,a u,each of which identifies an offense or activity that qualifies as an aggravated felony.the subsection primarily at issue here is f a crime of violence as defined in section of title,united states code,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.in,the term crime of violence is defined as 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
prakash was convicted under california penal code a and c.these provisions state,in relevant part 
a every person who,with the intent that the crime be committed,solicits another to commit or join in the commission of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury shall be punished by imprisonment 
c every person who,with the intent that the crime be committed,solicits another to commit rape by force or violence shall be punished by imprisonment 
under california law,the violent act of rape or assault by force does not actually have to occur before a defendant can be held guilty of solicitation 
solicitation is complete once the verbal request is made with the requisite criminal intent thus,solicitation does not require the defendant to undertake any direct,unequivocal act towards committing the target crime it is completed by the solicitation itself,whether or not the object of the solicitation is ever achieved,any steps are even taken towards accomplishing it,or the person solicited immediately rejects it.

because neither of the offenses for which prakash was convicted include as an element the actual use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,his convictions do not constitute crimes of violence under a,quoted above.the issue is whether they fall within the definition in b.prakash makes several arguments supporting his position that they do not.
one of his arguments is based upon the language of b.prakash does not deny that the crimes of which he was convicted entailed a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used.his convictions required that he had the specific intent that the crimes of rape and assault be committed.focusing on the last few words of b,however,he contends that the crimes did not involve a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense,because solicitation could be committed with the mere utterance of words and any actual force would not come until sometime later,after the solicitation offense had been completed.
the third circuit rejected a somewhat similar argument in ng attorney general,cir.in that case,the third circuit held that solicitation to commit murder,in violation of a federal statute proscribing the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of a,was a crime of violence for immigration purposes because the natural consequence of such an act is that physical force will be used upon another.id.at.the court found it irrelevant that the person ng solicited was a government informant who had no intent to commit the that there was no actual risk in that instance that force would be it concluded that the act of solicitation of murder poses a substantial risk that physical force will be used against another,regardless of whether the actual use of force ever occurs.id.
we similarly hold that solicitation to commit rape and assault are crimes of violence,even if the actual violence may occur after the solicitation itself.section b turns on the risk of physical force as a consequence of the criminal conduct at issue,not on the timing of the force.the risk of violence is created and exists from the time of the solicitation.that the crime of solicitation can be committed without the use of force and before any actual force is used does not diminish the substantial risk of violence that solicitation of rape and assault inherently presents.
the words in the statute in the course of committing the offense require a causal link between the crime and the physical substantial risk,in this case,that the solicitation of rape and of assault will lead to violence.those words do not impose a chronological limitation.it is the risk of violence flowing from a given crime that this statute is concerned with,not necessarily when in a chronological sequence the violence occurs.prakash has not identified any logical reason why violence that might take place a few minutes,hours,or even days after the solicitation to commit rape or assault has been committed should be disregarded,or why the statute should be interpreted in that fashion.we see no reason to do so.
the interpretation of the phrase in the course of committing the offense as a chronological limitation does not make sense in the context of determining whether a given crime is a crime of violence.the discussion by the california supreme court in people wilson,quoted above,for example,arose within a discussion of what action was required for a defendant to commit the crime of solicitation of mu
