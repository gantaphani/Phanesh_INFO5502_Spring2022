background 
skurtu,a native and citizen of moldova,was served with a notice to appear nta,charging him as removable under a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii,for being convicted of an aggravated felony,and under a a ii of the ina,a a ii,for being convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of the same scheme of criminal misconduct.at the beginning of the removal process,the ij informed skurtu that he had the right to retain private counsel and gave skurtu a list of legal aid attorneys from which skurtu might seek legal counsel for a reduced cost or pro bono.skurtu subsequently informed the ij that these attorneys declined to provide representation.the ij reminded skurtu that he still had the right to obtain a lawyer before the removal hearing.skurtu,nonetheless,represented himself at the removal hearing,and the ij found skurtu removable.
after the finding of removability,skurtu declined to designate a country for removal,so the ij designated his country of nativity and.skurtu then applied for withholding of removal and cat protection.skurtu stated that he was seeking relief based on his nationality.in the application,he stated that he had never been harmed and that he did not fear harm if he were returned to moldova.at the hearing,the ij inquired whether skurtu had any evidence that he might be tortured if returned to moldova,to which skurtu replied,i have no evidence.the ij then clarified with skurtu that,in fact,he had no evidence,to which skurtu replied,no.skurtu also told the ij,when i tell i going to fear for my life,i will lie.in response to the ij subsequent questions,skurtu replied that he had never been detained,interrogated,convicted,or sentenced in moldova,nor had any of his family members.
skurtu then called both of his parents to testify on his behalf.skurtu asked the ij if he could translate his father testimony because his father does not speak fluent english the ij responded that skurtu had not requested an interpreter and that one was not present.skurtu then asked the ij if skurtu could translate if his father had a problem understanding,but the ij instructed skurtu that his father would have to speak in english.skurtu father testified that he did not know what would happen to skurtu if he were returned to moldova.skurtu then questioned his mother,who also testified that she did not know what would happen to skurtu if he were returned to moldova.
in addition to skurtu and his parents testimony,the ij reviewed the state department country report on human rights practices for moldova and skurtu criminal record.
the ij issued his oral decision on november.in his decision,the ij noted that skurtu bore the burden to prove that he was entitled to withholding of removal and cat protection.the ij found that skurtu failed to present any evidence concerning past persecution,pointing out that he had specifically asked skurtu if in his native country either he or his family members were detained,interrogated,convicted,or sentenced to prison,and he said that they were not.the ij also concluded that skurtu failed to establish a fear of persecution,stating that absolutely nothing in the record supported a finding that skurtu faced any real problems based upon the five reasons given in the act.the ij also found that skurtu failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to moldova.accordingly,the ij ordered that skurtu be removed from the united states to moldova.
thereafter,skurtu appealed the ij decision to the bia,arguing that the ij ignored evidence of past persecution that some of his relatives had suffered in moldova.he also asserted that he had a right to appointed counsel before the ij that his eighth amendment rights would be violated if he were returned to moldova and that the communist government of moldova would persecute him upon his return.finally,he maintained that the ij did not take into account the hardships that he would face if returned to moldova.on february,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision.
on may,skurtu mailed a pleading entitled complaint to the united states district court for the district of columbia.the complaint was received on may,and filed on june.thus,skurtu complaint was filed over days after the bia issued its decision.the complaint was docketed as a habeas corpus petition pursuant to.the complaint alleged,inter alia,that the ij failed to inquire about or take into consideration the persecution,abuse,discrimination,torture,and any life threatening situations of petitioner parents,grandparents,and petitioner aunts and uncles or what they faced while they were in moldova.in addition,the complaint alleged that the ij failed to note any other reasons for this petitioner family members becoming refugees from moldova and failed to ask his mother or father about any abuses while the y were on the stand and under oath.it also stated that the ij made erroneous findings and failed to take into consideration skurtu age at the time that he entered the united states.in addition to these claims,the complaint alleged that the ij denied skurtu his right to appointed counsel and his right to a fair hearing due to the ij failure to fully and fairly develop the record.
thereafter,the united states district court for the district of columbia transferred the complaint to the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri.that court then transferred the complaint to this court as a petition for review,stating 
this matter is before the court upon its own motion.petitioner seeks to overturn an order of removal deporting him to his native country,moldova.this court does not have jurisdiction to hear petitions challenging orders of removal.pursuant to,a petition for review must be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings.petitioner immigration proceedings took place in potosi,missouri.as a result,the court will order the clerk to transfer this case to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,skurtu challenges the bia summary affirmance of the ij decision and the ij order granting the immigration and naturalization service ins petition to remove skurtu from the united states and denying skurtu claim for asylum,withholding of deportation,and relief under the cat.skurtu argues that he was denied his fifth amendment due process right to counsel during the removal proceedings and denied his fifth amendment due process right to a fair hearing because of the ij failure to fully develop the record.additionally,he asserts that the district court erred by treating his complaint as a petition for review pursuant to the real id act and transferring it to this court instead of treating it as a habeas petition and retaining jurisdiction.
in response,the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to review skurtu complaint and must dismiss the complaint because it is an untimely petition for review,as skurtu failed to file it within days of the bia decision and equitable tolling does not apply.
whether skurtu complaint challenges an order of removal 
to properly determine whether we have subject matter jurisdiction over skurtu complaint,we must first determine whether skurtu complaint effectively challenges the ij ultimate order of removal and falls within the purview of the real id act
