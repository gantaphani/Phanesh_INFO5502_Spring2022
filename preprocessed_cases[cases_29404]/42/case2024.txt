musa abdul ikharo is a nigerian native who entered the united states illegally in,but later became a lawful permanent resident.in,the government charged ikharo with removability due to his having two convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude and because of his status as an aggravated felon.an immigration judge ij found ikharo removable as charged and denied his applications for waiver of inadmissibility,asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture cat.
ikharo appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia and,following a fee dispute with his counsel,he attempted to file a pro se brief.the bia rejected ikharo brief as improperly filed,however,and summarily affirmed the ij decision.it further denied ikharo motion to reconsider.for the following reasons,we deny review of both the bia order affirming the decision of the ij and the bia order denying ikharo motion to reconsider.
background 
a.the charge of removability 
ikharo entered the united states without inspection through the border in.while living in nigeria,ikharo was a medical assistant in the nigerian navy,but he deserted in order to immigrate to the united states.ikharo became a lawful permanent resident in november via an unspecified immigration procedure and joined the united states naval reserve one month later.at all times subsequent to his obtaining permanent residency,ikharo lived in columbus,ohio.ikharo was married from to and he has three children,two of whom are united states citizens.
in december,ikharo pled guilty in the franklin county court of common pleas to disseminating matter harmful to a juvenile,in violation of ohio revised code a,and gross sexual imposition,in violation of ohio revised code.ikharo was sentenced to two years of imprisonment after entering a plea of guilty.he also received an other than honorable discharge from the united states navy due to his conviction 
eight years later,in may,ikharo was indicted in the franklin county court of common pleas on one count of burglary,in violation of ohio revised code.following a jury trial,ikharo was convicted on this charge and received a prison sentence.his conviction was vacated on procedural grounds,however,by the ohio tenth district court of appeals,which held that ikharo trial counsel was ineffective.ikharo subsequently pled guilty to the offense of criminal mischief in august.he received a prison sentence on this reduced charge.
in october,prior to the vacatur of ikharo burglary conviction,the former immigration and naturalization service now the department of homeland security served ikharo with a notice to appear.the agency charged ikharo with removability because he was an alien who,after being admitted to the united states,had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,and had been convicted of an aggravated felony,specifically the sexual abuse of a minor.
ikharo challenged the charge of removability on multiple grounds.first,he sought waivers of inadmissibility under sections c and h of the immigration and nationality act ina,c and h.although congress repealed ina c in,relief under that statute remains available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.ins cyr.section c allows for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility for a liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.ina c repealed.
the bia has held that this provision is applicable to aliens who are lawful permanent residents regardless of whether they departed the united states following the act or acts that render them deportable.in re silva.but this relief is available only if the alien otherwise deportable offense is comparable to one of the grounds of inadmissibility set forth in ina a.f providing that an alien is ineligible for a c waiver when charged with removability as an aggravated felon on a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section of the act.
ikharo claimed that he was eligible for relief under c because he had lived in the united states legally for more than seven years prior to his being charged with removability.he also contended that his conviction for gross sexual imposition was not a conviction for sexually abusing a minor and therefore did not qualify as an aggravated felony under a.
ikharo likewise sought a waiver of inadmissibility under h b.under this provision,an alien designated as an aggravated felon is eligible for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility if he or she can establish that deportation would result in extreme hardship to the united states citizen or lawfully resident spouse,parent,son,or daughter of such alien.ina h b.in his application for relief,ikharo claimed that his removal would cause extreme hardship to his then son,a united states citizen.ikharo testified that he had been paying child support for his son since,but said that his son would not accompany ikharo to nigeria due to their family christian beliefs,the poor quality of nigerian schools and health services,and the fact that ikharo would not have a home for his son.
in addition to his applications for a waiver of inadmissibility,ikharo sought asylum,the withholding of removal under ina b,b,and relief under the cat pursuant to and.ikharo stated that,as a christian,he feared being persecuted by muslims should he to return to nigeria,noting that his parents house was invaded by muslim fundamentalists in.he added that upon returning to nigeria for a visit shortly after the incident,he discovered that his parents house had been searched and that their car and valuables had been taken.according to ikharo,there were blood written signs of death on the door of the house.
ikharo also sought protection from the repercussions of his decision to desert the nigerian navy.he claimed that the navy would likely court martial him and sentence him to life imprisonment or death by firing squad for leaving the service without being formally discharged.
b.the removal hearing 
in may,ikharo appeared and testified at his removal hearing before the ij.he reiterated his belief that he would be imprisoned or executed for deserting the nigerian navy,adding that he had visited nigerian military prisons prior to coming to the united states and observed unsanitary conditions and inhumane treatment of prisoners at those facilities.ikharo insisted that the nigerian military indiscriminately executed deserters,despite acknowledging that nigerian law did not include the death penalty for such an offense.to support his argument,ikharo presented a document purportedly issued by the nigerian naval headquarters stating that the death penalty was imposed on deserters.ikharo said an unnamed friend in nigeria obtained the document for him.
in addition to testifying about his desertion from the nigerian navy,ikharo elaborated on the persecution that he would allegedly suffer due to his christian beliefs if he were removed to nigeria.ikharo said that his parents had been members of their church for years and that his father was an active and member of the congregation.he submitted various pictures of his father preaching at the church.according to ikharo,members of the community easily identified him as his father son and as a similarly strong supporter of the congregation.
ikharo stated that,after their house was invaded by muslim fundamentalists in,his parents sought treatment in a hospital several hours away from their residence in an effort to escape their attackers.he added that he sent money to his parents and visited them after the incident,but that his mother died soon thereafter.according to ikharo,his father relocated to the southern region of the country and,although few muslims live nearby,his father still fears being tracked down and attacked by muslim fundamentalists.ikharo testified that although the of nigeria was christian,he was unable to prevent muslim attacks in the country.he conceded,however,that the muslim fundamentalists were not connected to the nigerian government.
don ibezim,a united states citizen who was born in nigeria,testified on behalf of ikharo.a program manager and research specialist at the ohio state university,ibezim said that he knew ikharo when the latter was an engineering student at ohio state in the early.ibezim was of the opinion that ikharo would be arrested and tortured upon returning to nigeria and that ikharo could not avoid these consequences simply by living in another part of the country.in addition,ibezim recalled being told of ikharo visit to nigeria following the invasion of his parents house.ibezim stated that the attack occurred during a time of much civil unrest in the country due to conflicts between muslims and christians,and that several homes were destroyed during rioting.
c.the ij decision 
in july,the ij issued a written decision finding ikharo removable as charged and denying his applications for relief.the ij rejected the argument that ikharo was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to ina c,concluding that ikharo conviction constituted the aggravated felony of the sexual abuse of a minor.relying on in re blake,which held that convictions for the sexual abuse of minors have no statutory counterpart in a,the ij determined that ikharo was ineligible for relief under c.the ij similarly denied ikharo application for a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h b,finding that ikharo had failed to provide evidence to support his claim that his son would experience extreme hardship if ikharo was removed.
next,the ij found that ikharo was a witness.although ikharo had provided a letter purportedly received from the nigerian naval headquarters stating that he was a wanted defector,the ij afforded the letter minimal weight due to its lack of authentication and ikharo inability to explain how he obtained it.the ij further doubted ikharo claim that he would be tortured or executed if removed to nigeria in light of the fact that he had visited his parents in without incident.ikharo was also faulted by the ij for failing to present affidavits,news articles,and country reports to substantiate his fear of torture and execution.finally,the ij questioned ikharo testimony about his parents,noting that ikharo presented no evidence supporting his claim that the attack on their house was religiously motivated.the ij also observed that although ikharo testified that his mother died in,his asylum application stated that both parents were still living.collectively,these deficiencies in ikharo testimony led the ij to conclude that ikharo was not a credible witness.
unlike ikharo,the ij found ibezim to be a credible witness,but held that ibezim testimony did not support ikharo claim of future persecution.the ij reached this conclusion because ibezim did not know ikharo in nigeria and also does not know ikharo family personally.this was apparently the ij way of explaining that ibezim was unable to verify that ikharo family was persecuted by muslim fundamentalists.
finally,the ij denied all of ikharo applications for relief.the ij found that ikharo was statutorily ineligible for asylum due to his conviction for gross sexual imposition,an aggravated felony.ikharo applications for withholding of removal under both ina b and the cat were similarly denied.the ij determined that,although ikharo was sentenced to only two years imprisonment for his conviction,the offense was a particularly serious crime under ina b b ii,thereby rendering him statutorily ineligible for relief.as for ikharo ineligibility for the deferral of removal under the cat,the ij found that ikharo had failed to establish that he was more likely than not to be tortured by the nigerian government upon returning to that country.
appeal to the bia 
ikharo appealed the ij decision to the bia in august,challenging the ij conclusions that he was removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony and that he was ineligible for the relief he sought.in february,the bia,in response to a motion filed by ikharo samuel ezenagu,extended the deadline for ikharo submission of his brief until march.shortly thereafter,ikharo and ezenagu became engaged in a fee dispute,and ezenagu allegedly declined to file a brief with the bia unless ikharo first paid the outstanding fee balance.ikharo dismissed ezenagu as his counsel on march.he then filed a pro se brief with the bia four days later,which the bia rejected because it was not signed by an attorney of record.on march,ezenagu filed a motion to withdraw as ikharo counsel,which the bia granted the following month.
in august,the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision without further opinion.ikharo,who by this point in time had retained his current counsel,filed a motion to reconsider that requested the bia to accept his pro se brief as timely submitted.although he argued that the bia should have accepted his pro se brief and reconsidered its decision in light of the brief,ikharo submitted to the bia only the cover and signature pages of the document.declining to alter its previous decision,the bia denied ikharo motion to reconsider in april.
ikharo now petitions this court for review of the bia august order affirming the ij decision and the bia april order denying his motion to reconsider.these two cases have been consolidated for review.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction over ikharo petition for review 
as an initial matter,the government contends that we do not have jurisdiction over ikharo petition to review the bia order.the government argues that because the ij determined that ikharo was removable as an aggravated felon under ina a a iii,a a iii,based on his conviction for gross sexual imposition,this court review is precluded by statute.
pursuant to ina a c,a c,n otwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a a iii.but this jurisdictional bar is limited by the next subparagraph of the statute,which states that n othing in subparagraph b or c shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law.ina a d.we also retain jurisdiction to determine whether ikharo conviction was an aggravated felony and therefore constitutes grounds for removal under ina a a iii.see patel ashcroft,cir thus,we have jurisdiction to review whether a c applies,whether patel offense constitutes an aggravated felony.
where the bia summarily adopts the ij decision without issuing its own opinion,we review the decision of the ij as the final administrative order.holder,cir.on petitions from bia decisions,we review questions of law de novo,but substantial deference is given to the bia interpretation of the ina and accompanying regulations.khalili holder,cir.this deference,however,does not extend to the bia determination that ikharo is an aggravated felon.instead,the conclusion that a particular state conviction amounts to an aggravated felony within the meaning of a a iii is reviewed de novo because such a conclusion depends upon interpreting state statutes and federal statutes unrelated to immigration.patel,at.
under ina a a iii,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.an aggravated felony,for the purposes of this statute,includes the murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.ina a a,a a.
the ij concluded that ikharo conviction constituted the sexual abuse of a minor and was therefore an aggravated felony for ina a a iii purposes.in addition to the preceding statutes,the ij relied upon the definition of sexual abuse of a minor,which includes the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in,or assist another person to engage in,sexually explicit conduct or the rape,molestation,prostitution,or other form of sexual exploitation of children,or incest with children.a.the ij then compared the language of ohio statute with the federal statute,noting that the ohio statute prohibits,among other things,engaging in sexual contact with a nonspouse less than old,where the perpetrator purposely compelled the victim to submit by force or threat of force.see ohio ann.observing that both statutes prohibit sexual contact with a child,the ij determined that ikharo conviction constituted the sexual abuse of a minor and,as such,that ikharo was removable as an aggravated felon pursuant to ina a a iii.although the ij failed to differentiate between the various subsections of,thereby erroneously indicating that every conviction under that statute necessarily involves force or threat of force,any error in this regard was harmless because ikharo specifically pled guilty to the gross sexual imposition of a person less than old.
ikharo contested this issue before the ij,and he alluded to the argument in his motion to reconsider before the bia.but he did not pursue this argument in his brief to this court.we therefore conclude that he has waived any challenge to the ij holding on this issue.see,pagan fruchey,cir en banc having failed to challenge the district court qualified immunity ruling in his briefing,pagan has waived any argument that the district court decision was incorrect.shkabari gonzales,cir holding that the petitioners had waived their claims for withholding of removal and for protection under the cat by referencing them only in the statement of issues in their appellate brief.accordingly,we lack jurisdiction to review the ij order of removal,except with regard to ikharo constitutional claim.
constitutional claim 
ikharo constitutional claim is based on his argument that the bia refusal to consider his pro se brief due to its lack of an attorney signature violated his right to procedural due process.according to ikharo,this rejection deprived the bia of its ability to effectively evaluate the various forms of relief he sought.
this court has summarized the analytical framework for reviewing alleged due process violations as follows 
we review de novo alleged due process violations in removal hearings.we have stated that fifth amendment guarantees of due process extend to aliens in removal proceedings,entitling them to a full and fair hearing.to constitute fundamental unfairness,however,a defect in the removal proceedings must have been such as might have led to a denial of justice.thus,proof of prejudice is necessary to establish a due process violation in an immigration hearing.therefore,reviewing an alleged due process violation is a inquiry first,whether there was a defect in the removal proceeding and second,whether the alien was prejudiced because of it.
vasha gonzales,cir brackets,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.our task is thus to analyze whether the bia refusal to accept ikharo pro se brief was a defect in his removal proceeding and,if so,whether ikharo was prejudiced by the bia refusal.
defect in the proceedings 
turning to the first prong of the due process inquiry,we note that ikharo bears the burden of demonstrating that there was a defect in the proceedings.t he mere possibility of a defect is not sufficient to show actual constitutional error.perlaska holder,app x,cir.ikharo argues that none of the rules governing the filing of briefs with the bia preclude pro se submissions made directly by the alien.he correctly points out that the regulations regarding filings with the bia are silent as to whether an alien attorney must sign a submitted brief.see.ikharo further relies upon the bia practice manual,which states in relevant part that n o appeal,motion,brief,or request for board action is properly filed without a signature from either the alien,the alien representative,or a representative of the department of homeland security.bia practice manual ch.b.
but the manual also states that w henever a party is represented,the party should submit all filings and communications to the board through the representative.filings should always be made by a party to the proceedings,or a party representative,and not by a third party.id.ch.d.ikharo concedes that the language in ch.d is ambiguous,but he asserts that the word or in the second sentence operates in the disjunctive,thereby allowing for either aliens or their representatives to make filings.moreover,ikharo seeks leniency in the interpretation of the practice manual,restating his allegation that he dismissed ezenagu as his attorney on march,just four days before his brief was due.
ikharo makes a colorable showing that the bia practice manual does not explicitly prohibit a represented party from filing a brief pro se.under ch.b,properly filed briefs include those signed by aliens.and ch.d does not explicitly exclude such filings.the first sentence of the rule does not alien attorney to submit all filings by providing that the represented alien should submit all filings through the representative.but the second sentence indicates that a represented alien can make such a filing.accordingly,ikharo has a plausible argument that the bia rejection of his brief in the absence of his attorney signature constituted a defect in his removal proceedings.
we have no need to resolve this issue,however,because ikharo is unable to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the existence of any such defect.a showing of prejudice is essentially a demonstration that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings,and this court does not presume prejudice.gishta gonzales,cir citation omitted.the only prejudice that ikharo points to is the fact that his arguments regarding his applications for relief were never considered by the bia.
but we have no basis for determining whether these arguments would have affected the outcome of ikharo removal proceedings because ikharo never resubmitted his pro se brief to the bia.instead,when ikharo obtained counsel and filed his motion to reconsider with the bia,he submitted only the cover and signature pages of the brief.the contents of his pro se brief are therefore not in the record,nor is there any meaningful indication regarding whether the arguments made therein would have changed the outcome of the bia decision.
moreover,to the extent that ikharo pro se brief contained the same arguments that he now raises on appeal,he can not show that the brief would have affected the outcome of his proceedings.ikharo essentially argues that the bia rejection of his brief precluded proper consideration of the ij finding that ikharo was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to ina c,a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to ina h b,the withholding of removal under both ina b and the cat,and the deferral of removal under the cat.as discussed below,all four of his arguments are without merit.
ikharo first contends that the ij erred by relying on in re blake,in denying his application for waiver of inadmissibility under ina c because,at the time of the ij ruling,the bia decision in blake was on remand from the second circuit court of appeals.the bia in blake held that an alien convicted of sexually abusing a minor is ineligible for relief under c because the offense constitutes an aggravated felony that has no counterpart in a.blake,at.on appeal,the second circuit remanded the case to the bia to determine whether a conviction for the sexual abuse of a minor,among other crimes,could constitute a crime of moral turpitude under a.blake carbone,cir.
the bia,however,is not required to accept an adverse determination by one circuit court of appeals as binding throughout the united states.in re anselmo.because the second circuit remand in blake is not binding on cases arising outside of that circuit,the ij did not commit legal error in applying blake to ikharo application for relief.
ikharo next asserts that,with regard to his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h b,the ij deprived him of the opportunity to submit evidence that his son would face extreme hardship if ikharo was removed.this argument,however,is unsupported by the record.at the removal hearing,the ij permitted ikharo attorney to submit additional briefing on his h b claim and specifically i
