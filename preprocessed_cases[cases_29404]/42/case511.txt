petitioners in this immigration case sought asylum relief,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.the immigration judge and board of immigration appeals denied relief,finding the asylum application and the other claims meritless.petitioners did not timely seek judicial review of that decision instead,they moved for reconsideration before the bia,were denied,and then sought judicial review of that latter denial.
their petition presents a question of first impression in this circuit as to limits on jurisdiction whether a,which forbids direct review of the decision that an asylum application is,applies equally to review of the bia denial of reconsideration on the same issue.we hold that it does,and therefore that we have no jurisdiction as to denial of asylum to the petitioners.
we do have jurisdiction over the denial of reconsideration as to withholding of removal and cat protection.since we find that the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration of these claims,we deny the petition for review.
petitioners are a married couple,agron and sonila mehilli,and their three children,xhesika,xhonathan,and serxhi mehilli.all rely on the application for relief of the father,agron mehilli mehilli.
mehilli application and testimony 
mehilli,a native of albania,arrived in the united states on a date which is the subject of some dispute.mehilli applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief on june,in that application,he stated that he entered the united states on december.he later changed that date of entry,as we explain below.on january,the former immigration and naturalization service ins instituted removal proceedings against him.
on may,mehilli appeared before an initial immigration judge.he testified that he left albania in late november of and traveled to athens,then milan,and finally los angeles,arriving on december.mehilli told the initial ij that he entered the united states using a false passport bearing the name fatmir gjata.the initial ij immediately asked the government to check whether a fatmir gjata entered the country on that date the government ran a computer check and found no matches.when this was relayed to mehilli,he said,i do believe it,because i came,that the way i came from albania that the name.he added i can not lie.
mehilli later appeared before a second ij on three different dates in to offer further testimony.at the first of these hearings,the ij said he would start the case de novo and would take testimony even on issues covered by the initial ij,because he needed to make credibility determinations himself.
mehilli then testified to a version of events that differed substantially from both his earlier testimony and his asylum application he stated that he had traveled from athens to milan using the name fatmir gjata,but that he had then traveled from milan to los angeles with a slovenian passport bearing the name marko brezar.he also stated that he arrived on may,not december.mehilli submitted as evidence a passport bearing the name marko brezar he also submitted a plane ticket bearing the same name,which he said he had used to fly to los angeles.asked why he was changing his testimony,he testified that the person that gave me these passports and tickets told him not to show the name and date that i arrived here.
during the same hearing,the second ij addressed mehilli motion for a new trial,in which he argued that the initial ij had behaved improperly by discounting mehilli credibility and trying to impeach his testimony on peripheral issues.the second ij denied this motion,stating 
your client has admitted to us that he was lying to the immigration judge at the last hearing.so i finding your motion here less than convincing where you seem to be complaining that the judge was impugning your client credibility at the last hearing unfairly,when,in fact,it turns out that your client was lying to the judge.
the ij went on to find that,since mehilli offered little proof other than his own testimony as to his arrival date,and since he was not credible given his false testimony under oath,he had not proved that he arrived in the united states within a year before filing his asylum application this failure rendered him ineligible for asylum.
the ij stated that despite this ruling,he would hear mehilli testimony as to the merits of all three claims for relief mehilli testified as follows he became a member of albania democratic party in and played an active role in the party.beginning in,he owned a bakery in tirana,the albanian capital.in,the rival socialist party came to power,and mehilli began to feel pressure from government officials.in february,members of the socialist party came to mehilli bakery and told him to close it down they told him they were closing bakeries like his because they wanted to take the democratic party off the power.mehilli refused.when socialist officials started paying return visits to bakeries,asking them why they had not closed as ordered,mehilli moved to a new space elsewhere in tirana the bakery occupied the first floor,while mehilli and his family lived upstairs.the bakery kept running even after mehilli left albania,and mehilli was still receiving money from its operation,even up to the time of the hearing.
in the summer of,mehilli testified,he received a letter purporting to levy a fine against his bakery the letter stated that if mehilli did not pay,he would be killed.he offered no evidence as to who might have sent the letter.however,he testified that several days later,he went to pick up his voting card and discovered that his and his wife names were misspelled on their cards at this point,he testified,he realized the incidents were had altered his card so he could not vote,and the fine was being levied for political reasons.he admitted on,however,that many voters experienced problems with the voter registration lists.
several days after the voting card incident,mehilli testified,police officers came to his home at and searched it.he testified that the officers pushed him against a wall and said,we came to pick up the guns that you have illegally,because you a member of the democratic party,you have guns.finally,mehilli testified that in november,unknown assailants tried to kidnap his younger son.he stated that one day,as his wife,her brother,and his son were leaving the brother home,three people tried to grab his wife and take her son from her arms.he could not identify the assailants he said they must have been socialists because the kidnapping attempt was a continuance of their actions against him.
mehilli wife,sonila,also testified.as to the attempted kidnapping,she testified that an armed man tried to grab her son and she pushed him away as she did so,her brother opened fire,frightening the man off.she stated that she did not fall to the ground at any time during the incident.as to the search,sonila mehilli said she saw an officer push her husband,and that no one else was pushed.
b.the ij decision and subsequent appeals 
the second ij oral decision of september,rejected mehilli application on numerous grounds.the ij reaffirmed his finding that mehilli was from seeking asylum.he noted that mehilli application was dated june,and that on the application mehilli wrote that he had entered the united states on december.however,he also noted that mehilli admitted testifying falsely under oath to the initial ij.the ij found,based on these facts and his observations of mehilli demeanor,that mehilli was not credible.since mehilli had relied largely on his own testimony to prove his date of entry,the ij found that mehilli had not established an arrival date and thus had not established that his application was filed within one year of arrival the ij also rejected mehilli claim that he should be exempted from the deadline due to extraordinary,ineffective assistance of mehilli had not complied with the regulatory requirements for making such a claim.
nonetheless,the ij proceeded,in the alternative,to consider mehilli asylum claim,and other claims for relief,on their merits the ij pointed to a number of inconsistencies in mehilli story
