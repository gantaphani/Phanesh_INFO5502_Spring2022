gazmend gjeci,an ethnic albanian citizen of kosovo,entered the united states illegally on may,and filed an administrative request for asylum a little less than one year later.his case has languished in the immigration courts since that initial filing it was continued thirteen at the behest of the the course of four years before going to a merits hearing.gjeci,who contends that he suffered grave mistreatment at the hands of the serbian army during its occupation of kosovo,argues that the immigration judge denied him due process in refusing to grant one more continuance so that he could obtain new counsel and rebut a government report stating that documents tending to establish persecution were not what they purport ed to be.he further argues that the board of immigration appeals bia abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen the case so that he could rebut that government report.we agree that the merits proceeding was fundamentally unfair and grant gjeci petition on due process grounds.we need not reach the issue involving the motion to reopen.
background 
although gjeci asylum claim is relatively straightforward,it has spawned a rather confusing record.in addition to the sheer number of times the case has been delayed,two different immigration judges participated in its adjudication and at least four different lawyers have been involved in gjeci representation in the seven years since he received his notice to appear.
gjeci asylum claim centers primarily on his membership in the democratic league of kosovo ldk,a separatist political party comprised of kosovar ethnic albanians,and on the political realities of kosovo in the late.his application explains that before he left kosovo,serbian officials arrested him four times,and beat and otherwise harassed him on a number of occasions for his nationality and political opinions.the application also states that serbian officials suspected gjeci and his father of collecting food supplies for the kosovo liberation army kla,an insurgent guerilla outfit that initially directed its attacks against the serbian police and later against serbian civilians.see human rights watch,under orders war crimes in kosovo,available at.gjeci explained that he and his father,who used to run a caf√© until it was destroyed during the war,had gathered the food in an attempt to help villages under siege.
a central component of the evidence in the present case is a packet of seven documents that gjeci offered to support his contention that he was persecuted in kosovo.these documents which,as we will see,are contested include two subpoenas ordering gjeci to appear in court for alleged activity,an order sentencing gjeci to five months in prison for activity including propaganda,two search warrants for the gjeci home,an order sentencing gjeci to three years in prison and,finally,a yugoslavian identification card with his name and photograph on it.
gjeci asylum application began its slow journey through the immigration courts on july,when he was served with a notice to appear on july,for his removal proceedings.he appeared as directed and brought an interpreter with him but no lawyer.immigration judge anthony petrone continued his case to november.the record contains no transcript for that date.on february,judge petrone held a status conference and set a merits hearing date for july.attorney shefik adrizi represented gjeci at this hearing.on july,gjeci gave the documents described above to the government for examination.
on july,gjeci represented by adrizi appeared before a new immigration judge carlos cuevas.the government requested a continuance,indicating that it suspected some of gjeci documents might have been altered and that it intended to submit them to its forensic document laboratory fdl for examination.judge cuevas stated that if the documents were authentic,he would be inclined to grant gjeci petition.he continued the hearing and set a status call for october.no transcript appears in the record for that day.
the next hearing took place on november.bradley harrington,an attorney from adrizi office,appeared on behalf of gjeci,whose appearance had been waived.the government indicated that it was still investigating the authenticity of the documents and had nothing new to offer at that point.judge cuevas set the hearing over for another status conference on april.adrizi appeared on gjeci behalf at that status hearing,and the government stated that it was still waiting for results from the fdl.the judge continued the hearing and set another status conference for november.at the november call,the government indicated that it had given adrizi the fdl report.judge cuevas told adrizi that he assumed gjeci needed time to prepare his defense,continued the hearing,and set a new status hearing for may.
on april,however,judge cuevas granted adrizi request to withdraw from his representation of gjeci.adrizi motion cited irreconcilable differences between the two and included an affidavit from gjeci authorizing adrizi withdrawal.the affidavit further indicated that adrizi had returned gjeci file to his client.at this point,however,the government still possessed the documents whose authenticity is central to this case.
alexandra baranyk represented gjeci at the next status hearing,which the judge held on may.the government stated at this hearing that it still had gjeci original documents.baranyk made an oral motion for their return,but the government insisted that the request be in writing so that it did not tender anything not so requested.since this hearing took place on a day when the judge had a very full schedule of hearings,he indicated that he did not want to spend time on this issue and told the parties to work it out.he then continued the case to september,for a document exchange.at the september conference,however,the government told judge cuevas and baranyk that it was not prepared to return the documents because it was unclear whether they had been photographed in accord with standard operating procedure.the judge continued the case again.
on january,the parties came together for another hearing,and the government returned the original documents to baranyk.although gjeci was at this hearing,it does not appear that an interpreter was present,nor does it appear on the record that gjeci understood that his documents had been returned to his counsel.the judge then set a status conference date for august.on july,however,gjeci filed a motion for change of venue.the substance of this motion,which we transcribe in full since baranyk and judge cuevas deemed it so significant,reads

thank you again for your understanding,
gazmend gjeci 
as gjeci noted in his motion,the judge had scheduled his status hearing for the afternoon of august.baranyk,however,appeared before judge cuevas that morning on a different matter.after dealing with the other matter,baranyk and judge cuevas turned to the gjeci case,in which baranyk had moved to withdraw in light of gjeci motion for change of venue.judge cuevas told baranyk that he believed it was obvious that gjeci was aware of the scheduling of the august hearing and also,because gjeci himself had filed a motion for change of venue instead of relying on baranyk,that gjeci was taking matters into his own hands.judge cuevas did not discuss the status of gjeci case,nor did they discuss his file or original documents.when gjeci arrived for his hearing alone at on august,judge cuevas asked english and with no he knew that baranyk had withdrawn.gjeci responded that he did.after that single question,judge cuevas moved on to the motion to change venue.after denying that motion,the judge asked gjeci whether he understood,and gjeci replied that he understood some.at that point,judge cuevas called an interpreter and again explained his reasons for denying the motion to change venue.significantly,however,the judge never revisited the issue of baranyk withdrawal,and he asked gjeci no questions beyond simply that first question in english about whether he knew that she had in fact withdrawn.
after denying the motion to change venue,judge cuevas proceeded to schedule gjeci merits hearing.he told gjeci that the merits hearing would take place on august,and that at that point he would take testimony and conclude the case.the judge asked gjeci if he understood,and gjeci again replied that he did.
gjeci arrived at the august hearing again alone,although an albanian interpreter was present.judge cuevas questioned gjeci and ultimately concluded that his story was not credible since he could not provide enough details about his alleged arrests and beatings precise dates,for example and since he could not rebut the fdl report indicating that his documents had been falsified.
gjeci,however,was confused about this hearing from the start.he answered only one question before objecting,over and over again,that he had no lawyer with him,that he had not understood that this hearing would be his merits hearing he testified he thought he was again up for a status conference,and that he had no idea where his original documents were.despite his protests,judge cuevas refused to grant him a continuance and pressed onward,ultimately concluding that gjeci had failed to meet his burden of proof.the documents played a significant part in judge cuevas decision he criticized gjeci at length for failing to rebut the fdl report indicating that the documents were not what they purported to be.at.
after the august hearing,gjeci,via miami attorney lourdes,appealed judge cuevas decision to the bia,arguing that the judge had violated his due process rights by proceeding with the hearing.it appears from the record that the attorney never possessed gjeci documents and was therefore unable to pursue any challenge to the fdl report.the bia summarily affirmed judge cuevas decision.at some point after that,gjeci retained his current counsel,stephen berman,who set about trying to locate gjeci documents.on march,berman exchanged emails with susan,an attorney in baranyk firm.berman told her that,according to the hearing transcripts,her office should have gjeci documents.indicated that her firm would check the file but m ost likely the service kept the originals though.at.firm later discovered that they had retained the documents for more than two years but finally sent them to berman.
after receiving the documents,gjeci retained a forensic document expert to examine the documents.that expert contradicted the fdl report,finding no conclusive proof of document tampering.the expert also noted that it was not appropriate for the fdl to determine that the documents were not authentic without comparing them to similar kosovar documents.gjeci filed a motion to reopen his case in order to submit this evidence.the bia denied the motion,explaining that judge cuevas had not relied wholly on the fdl report in denying asylum.specifically,the bia noted that gjeci testimony was too unconvincing to support his claim.gjeci filed petitions for review both of the due process appeal and of the denial of his motion to reopen.
ii.discussion 
we review a claim of denial of due process de novo.feto gonzales,cir kerciku ins,cir.to prevail on a due process claim,an alien must show prejudice likely to impact the results of the proceedings.capric ashcroft,cir.because the bia summarily affirmed the immigration judge opinion with respect to due process,the immigration judge opinion constitutes the final agency determination.kllokoqi gonzales,cir.
removal proceedings must be fundamentally fair and allow an alien a reasonable opportunity to present evidence.kerciku,at.although much about the way gjeci case was handled is unsettling,the central due process error stems from the way in which baranyk was permitted to withdraw from gjeci representation.we accordingly focus our discussion there and on the consequences of that withdrawal.we find that baranyk with her retention of gjeci documents and the immigration judge refusal to grant gjeci a continuance when it became apparent that gjeci did not fully understand the consequences of baranyk withdrawal and would not be able to evaluate the fdl gjeci of a fundamentally fair proceeding.
it is well settled that,while aliens have no sixth amendment right to counsel,they do enjoy a statutory right to retain counsel.ambati reno,cir.this right is important to the fairness of removal proceedings,and immigration judges commonly grant aliens an initial continuance to secure representation,as judge petrone did here.see richard steel,steel on immigration law.related to this statutory right are the rules that an alien must knowingly waive representation,ramirez ins,cir,and that immigration judges must take pains to ensure that an alien rights are protected when counsel wishes to withdraw,al khouri ashcroft,cir dep t of justice,exec.office of imm,immigration judge benchbookk i hereinafter benchbook.
in the present case,both baranyk and judge cuevas inferred from gjeci pro se motion to change venue an intent to take matters into his own hands and to proceed without baranyk.but this conclusion was not based on direct questioning,and there was little effort to verify gjeci intent.drawing inferences from gjeci pro se motion is particularly troubling,since he was represented by counsel.see,abdullah united states,cir holding that a represented party in a criminal action is generally not entitled to have his pro se motions reviewed.
compounding questions involving the inferences here are the surrounding circumstances.immigration judges may,of course,grant an attorney motion to withdraw as a counsel of record upon an oral or written motion.b.grounds for motions to withdraw include among other things a difference of opinion over the direction of the case,an alien failure to cooperate with the attorney in preparing the case and an alien failure to keep the attorney apprised of his whereabouts or his failure to appear for hearings,in re rosales,bia.
but,although judges generally have wide discretion to grant or deny motions to withdraw,they must bear in mind their duty to protect an alien rights.see benchbook,at i see also al khouri,at discussing an immigration judge duties when an alien appears pro se.immigration judges must,of course,be sure that aliens are aware of their hearing dates,which judge cuevas was able to infer here.but beyond this,the judge took no other steps to protect the alien rights.gjeci was not present,although he was due to appear in a few hours.nothing in the record suggests gjeci knew that baranyk was withdrawing but for a single question in untranslated english.judge cuevas made no attempt to ascertain the status of the case before granting baranyk motion,especially including the status of the documents that all parties regarded as central to gjeci petition.the judge asked no questions about whether baranyk client communicated any desire to proceed without her representation in the case.and importantly,the judge did not order baranyk to return gjeci documents.
when gjeci arrived for his hearing a few hours later,the judge asked him no questions about whether he actually wanted to proceed without baranyk.the judge did not discuss the critical consequences of the counsel withdrawal that gjeci,for example,would be responsible for recovering the documents and rebutting the fdl report or what baranyk reasons were for the withdrawal which would have afforded gjeci the opportunity to explain whether he understood what he was doing when his filed his pro se motion.the judge set the merits hearing over for august,but spent little time explaining to gjeci that gjeci would need to put on evidence that day if he came without a lawyer.he told gjeci that the government had given gjeci and his prior att
