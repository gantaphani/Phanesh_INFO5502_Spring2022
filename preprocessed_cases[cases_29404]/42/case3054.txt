chehade dib lichaa al khouri,a lebanese citizen,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision,affirming without opinion the immigration judge ij denial of his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture.because we find that al khouri was denied a full and fair hearing on his claims for relief before the ij,we grant al khouri petition for review of the bia decision and remand for a new hearing.
al khouri left lebanon in january of.in lebanon,al khouri was employed as a taxi cab driver,and he claims that syrian and hizballah forces stopped him on several occasions and attempted to recruit him to transport people and weapons.al khouri never explicitly refused their requests,nor did he acquiesce.according to al khouri,two days before he fled lebanon,syrian soldiers pulled him from his car and beat his bare feet in front of his wife and children.he also testified that syrian and hizballah forces have gone to his house in search of him,and he believes that his mistreatment is due to his refusal to cooperate with their efforts to recruit his assistance and because he is christian.
al khouri arrived in the united states using a fraudulent visa.the immigration and naturalization service ins placed him in removal proceedings in february of.ins charged al khouri with misrepresentation and failure to possess entry documents into the united states.al khouri conceded these charges,and,therefore,the ij found him removable.al khouri immediately sought relief from removal and indicated his intent to file for political asylum and withholding of removal and to seek relief under the convention against torture.accordingly,the ij scheduled an individual hearing on the merits of these claims for may of.at this hearing,the ij denied relief and ordered that al khouri be removed from the united states to lebanon.
al khouri was initially represented by an attorney,suzanne brown.however,because al khouri failed to pay her for her services and failed to communicate with her to prepare his case,she notified him six months before his merits hearing that she intended to withdraw.al khouri,however,did not contact brown to make financial arrangements or to prepare his case,despite the risk that he would be forced to proceed without counsel.in a certified letter dated february,brown informed al khouri that she had filed a motion to withdraw as his attorney,and she advised him that he should find another lawyer.
because the ij had not ruled on brown motion to withdraw,she appeared at al khouri merits hearing on may.there,she renewed her motion to withdraw.the ij granted her request and explained to al khouri that he could go forward without counsel or could withdraw his application and accept the departure order.the ij refused to grant al khouri a continuance,and al khouri opted to proceed without counsel.in addition,before leaving the hearing,brown gave al khouri a copy of his application.this application details all the circumstances that would support al khouri claim.the application was written in english.al khouri native language is arabic.an interpreter was present at the hearing,and the ij recessed court for ten minutes to give al khouri an opportunity to review his voluminous application with the interpreter.
at the beginning of the hearing,the ij told al khouri that he had reviewed all the documents submitted into evidence.in addition,the ij specifically asked al khouri if the information in his application was correct.al khouri responded that it was,and,therefore,the ij instructed him to sign the statement under oath and admitted the statement into evidence.
because al khouri was acting pro se,the ij questioned him about the basis of his claims.he instructed alkhouri,
now,sir,what going to happen next is that i going to ask you questions,since you not represented about your claim.in other words to go into your case.the way i going to elicit,that is bring out the information is by questions and answers.i do want you to tell me your whole story,just answer one question.
at joint,at emphasis added.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij determined that al khouri was not credible and that he did not merit relief from the removal order on any of the grounds asserted in his application.pertinent to this appeal,the ij adverse credibility determination was based in substantial part on the differences between al khouri testimony and his application.in particular,the ij highlighted in his oral decision that he,
concluded that al khouri testimony is not really reliable.i have reached that conclusion because of the omission of many of the averments or statements contained in the application about his experience.if the events occurred as he described in his statment sic,he had a very different experience and for very different reasons than that which he has described in his testimony today.
oral of the ij,at joint,at emphasis added.
al khouri appealed the ij decision denying him relief to the board of immigration appeals.the bia affirmed the decision without opinion pursuant to,which sets forth a streamlined procedure wherein a single member of the bia,rather than the usual review,summarily affirms the outcome reached by the ij but not necessarily the ij reasoning.therefore,for purposes of this petition for review to our court,we review the ij findings as though they had been made by the bia.dominguez ashcroft,cir citing a.our standard of review for legal determinations is de novo.ins,d.
al khouri requested a continuance after brown withdrawal so that he could procure a new lawyer.he argues that his due process rights were violated when the ij granted brown motion to withdraw,denied his motion for a continuance,and forced him either to proceed pro se or to accept the departure order.we reject this argument and find that the ij did not abuse his discretion when he refused to continue al khouri removal hearing and that there was no denial of al khouri right to counsel.
it is that,while there is no sixth amendment right to counsel,uspango ashcroft,cir,aliens have a statutory right to counsel at their own expense,b a,and are entitled to the fifth amendment guarantee of due process of law in deportation proceedings.reno flores,d.in certain circumstances,depriving an alien of the right to counsel may rise to the level of a due process violation.united states,cir.
no such violation occurred here,however.first,aliens are free to waive their statutory right to counsel,which al khouri did.see id.an alien may voluntarily waive representation by counsel,however,and that waiver will be respected.second,al khouri is entirely to blame for the situation that unfolded at his hearing which resulted in his proceeding without representation of counsel.it would be nonsensical to recognize a constitutional entitlement to a continuance based on counsel withdrawal when petitioners themselves are responsible for the withdrawal.
six months before the hearing,brown warned al khouri that,if he did not contact her to make payment arrangements and to prepare his case,she would withdraw her representation.three months before the hearing,she informed him that she indeed filed a motion to withdraw with the court,and she advised al khouri to find another attorney.an ij has wide discretion to manage his or her docket,and it was not an abuse of discretion to deny al khouri request for a continuance,especially where al khouri had more than sufficient notice of and bore the blame for his counsel withdrawal.ashcroft,cir holding no due process violation and no abuse of discretion when ij denied last minute continuance request and where alien attorney failed to appear at removal hearing.
nevertheless,an alien right to due process of law in deportation proceedings encompasses more than any right to counsel alleged by al khouri.the fifth amendment due process clause mandates that removal hearings be fundamentally fair.flores,at.ins,cir see also plyler doe,d aliens,even aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful,have long been recognized as persons guaranteed due process of law by the fifth and fourteenth amendments.in addi
