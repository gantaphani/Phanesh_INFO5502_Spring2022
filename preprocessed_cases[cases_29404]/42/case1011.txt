petitioner lin li hua no,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,asks us to review an order of the bia summarily affirming the ij denial of her application for political asylum and for withholding of removal under b of the immigration and nationality act ina,b,and article of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,treaty doc.ij gabriel videla denied lin asylum application on the ground that lin had not carried her burden of proving that she had applied for asylum within one year of entering the united states,as required by a.the ij also held,in the alternative,that lin claim that she had been forcibly sterilized by the chinese government was not credible.as such,the ij held,lin had not made out a claim for asylum and,a fortiori,for withholding of removal under the ina.moreover,the ij concluded that lin had not shown that it was more likely than not that she would be subject to torture if she returned to china,and was therefore ineligible for cat relief.
based on our court decision in xiao ji chen dep t of justice,cir,we hold that,insofar as lin challenges the ij credibility finding as it related to her evidence of timely filing,we are without jurisdiction to review the ij determination that lin asylum application was untimely.to the extent that lin challenges that determination on due process grounds,we have jurisdiction to hear lin claim,see id.at,but her contention is without merit.as to lin application for withholding of removal under the ina,despite inconsistencies in lin testimony,the errors in the ij analysis lead us to grant lin petition for review and to remand to the bia for reconsideration of her claim.
background 
lin testified to the following facts at her removal hearing of may.lin and her husband,lin dun ji,were married on march,they have two children together,a boy born october,and a girl born may.three or four months after the boy was born,chinese officials informed lin that she needed to have an intrauterine device iud inserted.she refused and was fined yuan,which her paid after officials threatened to remove items from her house.authorities returned some time later and again threatened to take away everything from the house unless lin had an iud inserted.she acquiesced.lin testified inconsistently and confusingly concerning the date on which the iud was inserted,sometimes giving a date in,and sometimes one in.
lin found out she was pregnant with her second child in august.asked by her attorney how she was able to become pregnant with her second child with an iud inserted,lin replied,i did not even know when the iud was missing.lin lived with her aunt an hour away from her home during the second pregnancy,but after lin daughter was born,family planning officials found out about the baby from people talking about the birth.cadres visited lin home in order to have her sterilized,but since they did not find her there,they took her husband away instead.when lin found out that her husband had been detained and threatened with beatings,she returned home immediately and turned herself in.
lin was taken to the hospital,where she was forcibly sterilized.she described the procedure in graphic detail.she said that the medical staff administered partial anesthesia,but that it was still an intensely painful procedure.during this procedure,doctors held down her hands and tied down her feet,but did not secure any other parts of her body.
two or three months after the sterilization,family planning officials visited lin home to collect a second fine,for yuan.her husband got into a fight with the officials and subsequently went into hiding.when the officials could not find him,lin says,they destroyed his car lin said she left china in,and arrived in the united states on october of that year.she testified that she did not leave earlier because her daughter was too young.she said she fears going back to china because she will be detained and beaten there upon her return.lin filed her application for political asylum on june.
the ij denied that application as untimely on the ground that lin had failed to produce sufficient evidence that she had filed for asylum within one year of entering the united states.the ij also held that lin claim that she had been forcibly sterilized in china was not credible.specifically,the ij said that lin demeanor and testimony suggested that she was not testifying from lived experience but was instead relating back information that she had not yet successfully committed to memory.second,certain aspects of lin testimony,such as the alleged insertion of an iud and her husband detention,were not mentioned in her asylum application and certain affidavits submitted in support of her claim.third,the household registration document lin submitted,which indicated that her son was registered in december and her daughter in,was inherently unreliable and contradicted portions of her testimony.finally,and most critical ly,according to the ij,lin account of the sterilization procedure performed on her was not credible because,if lin was in fact experiencing the pain she described,and if only her hands and feet were tied down,it would not be possible for doctors to perform so precise an operation.moreover,it would be implausible for china to perform sterilizations with such bluntness if the goal was to sterilize successfully.
since the ij found lin account of coerced family planning incredible,he found that she could not meet her burden of showing either past persecution or a fear of future persecution,as she must in order to be eligible for asylum.because the standard for withholding of removal under ina b is a more stringent standard than for asylum,see b ramsameachire ashcroft,cir,lin also could not establish eligibility for withholding.finally,the ij found that lin statements as to the possibility that she would be beaten upon returning to china were too vague to establish eligibility for cat relief.
lin appealed to the bia,which,in an order dated october,affirmed without opinion the ij decision.see e.lin timely petitioned for review with our court.she argues that the ij determination that she did not meet her burden of establishing the timeliness of her application was arbitrary and,therefore,violates due process.lin also contends that the ij committed numerous errors in arriving at his adverse credibility determination,and that his analysis of her cat claim misapplied the standard applicable to such claims.
discussion 
timeliness of lin asylum claim 
subject to certain exceptions not relevant here,the ina requires that an demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that she has filed her application within one year of entering the country.a b.lin testified that she entered the united states on october.she also submitted an affidavit from her husband in which he stated that they reunited in the united states in october.since lin applied for asylum in june,her application would be timely if her testimony and her husband affidavit were credited.the ij held,however,that lin testimony,standing alone,was inadequate in light of his adverse credibility finding,and that her husband affidavit must be given diminished weight because he was not present in the courtroom and available for.
the ina provides that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under a.a.we recently construed this language to deprive our court of jurisdiction to review discretionary and factual determinations made by an ij or the bia pursuant to a.xiao ji chen,at.to the extent that lin challenges the ij credibility determination as it relates to her claimed date of entry,therefore,we are without jurisdiction to review his rejection of her application as untimely.see ins,cir generally,courts have treated credibility questions in deportation proceedings as questions of fact.
lin styles her timeliness argument,however,not as a challenge to the ij credibility determination,but as a constitutional claim.lin contends that due process requires that an ij determination that an has not met her burden of proof as to timeliness be based on some evidentiary quantity and not on the ij own unsupported and arbitrary opinion.petr.br.at.lin argument amounts to a claim that the ij held her to an impermissibly high burden of proof,and that this violates her constitutional right to due process.
since lin challenges the constitutionality of the ij decisionmaking process,we have jurisdiction to review her claim in light of the real id act of,stat,real id act.see xiao ji chen,at interpreting real id act a a iii,codified at a d,as providing jurisdiction in the court of appeals to review constitutional claims or matters of statutory construction,even in the context of bar determinations.we have not had occasion to decide whether an ij discretionary determination that an alien failed to proffer credible evidence adequate to her burden of proof may constitute a due process violation.mendoza manimbao ashcroft,cir finding a due process violation where the bia made an adverse credibility finding sua sponte on direct review,after the ij made no such finding,because the bia had failed to provid e the petitioner with notice that his credibility was at issue and in what specific respect his credibility was being questioned.but assuming arguendo that an ij egregious disregard of applicable standards or procedures in making a credibility determination might acquire constitutional determination we need not,and hence do not,make find no such violation in this case.under the circumstances presented,we can not say that the ij determination that lin failed to prove her date of entry by clear and convincing evidence was arbitrary or denied her a full and fair opportunity to present her claims.xiao ji chen,at accord capric ashcroft,cir due process requires that an applicant receive a full and fair hearing which provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
because we do not disturb the ij finding that lin asylum application is untimely,our review is limited to lin claim for withholding of removal under the ina see xiao ji chen,at e ligibility for withholding of removal is not subject to a b bar and,accordingly,must be considered by the bia regardless of the timeliness of the initial asylum request.
ii.our standard of review of lin withholding claim 
in order to qualify for withholding of removal under the ina,an applicant must establish that her life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal based on race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a see b.a rebuttable presumption of withholding eligibility attaches to an applicant who demonstrates that she suffered past persecution based on one of the enumerated grounds.see ivanishvili dep t of justice,cir.absent a showing of past persecution,an applicant for withholding must show that it is more likely than not that she would suffer future persecution based on a statutory ground if returned to the country of removal.see yueqing zhang gonzales,cir citing b.
in accordance with our international human rights obligations,withholding of removal is a mandatory form of relief under the ina.once an alien establishes her entitlement to withholding she can not,with certain exceptions not relevant to this case be removed to the country in which she is likely to be persecuted.see wu zheng huang ins,cir.
our review of the ij factual findings,including his adverse credibility determination,is for substantial evidence xue hong yang dep t of justice,cir.it remains challenging,however,to determine the appropriate course to take when the ij factual finding is based in only in what we have come to regard as analytic errors.such errors include,for example,a misstatement of the facts in the record or bald speculation or caprice,zhou yun zhang ins,cir unreasonable demands for corroborative evidence where the applicant is otherwise credible,see jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir diallo ins,cir overreliance on airport interviews and accounts thereof that do not bear indicia of reliability,see ramsameachire,at discussing why some airport interviews are more reliable than others and reliance on inconsistencies that are not dramatic and and were never brought to an alien attention,see ming shi xue bia,cir.
congress has specified that an ij administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see xiao ji chen,at zhou yun zhang,at.the second circuit interprets this statutory standard to mean that the factual findings of an ij merit deference so long as they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.see,xiao ji chen,at see also diallo,at stating that the agency factual findings must be upheld if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole internal quotation marks omitted.and,where an ij errors are relatively minor in light of the record as a whole,the understandable inclination is to assume the errors are harmless and deny review,just as we would affirm a district court judgment tinged with errors that do not affect the ultimate outcome of the proceeding.see united states dominguez benitez,d.
we must be equally mindful,however,of the instruction of sec chenery,that a judicial judgment can not be made to do service for an administrative judgment.id.at.quoted in ins ventura,d per curiam.it is precisely because factfinding in both the asylum and the withholding contexts is expressly committed to the discretion of the executive office of immigration review eoir that,when those findings rely upon legal errors,the appropriate remedy is generally to vacate those findings and remand to the bia for reconsideration of an applicant claim.see chenery,at.i f the administrative action is based upon a determination of law as to which the reviewing authority of the courts does come into play,an order may not stand if the agency has misconceived the law.twum ins,cir.
our court asylum and withholding jurisprudence,then,remains on a continuing course of reconciliation between the twin commands neither to disturb substantially supported factual determinations nor to let stand determinations that rely,in whole or in part,on legal error.two distinct but related formulations have emerged in recent cases.in cao he lin dep t of justice,cir,a case dealing with factfinding primarily in an asylum context,we recognized,for the first time explicitly,that not every minor error requires a remand.id.at.the cao he lin court stated that,notwithstanding identified errors,remand to the bia would be futile in at least three circumstances first,if the ij explicitly adopts an alternative and sufficient basis for her determination second,where the ij or bia reliance on an erroneous aspect of its reasoning is so tangential that there is no realistic possibility that the outcome would be different on remand and third,where overwhelming evidence supporting the administrative adjudicator findings makes it clear that the same decision would have been reached in the absence of the errors.id.at.
more recently,in xiao ji chen,a case dealing with factfinding in a withholding of removal context,we reaffirmed the general rule of cao he lin that an error does not require a remand if the remand would be pointless because it is clear that the agency would adhere to its prior decision in the absence of error.xiao ji chen,at.because the panel in cao he lin ultimately directed a remand,and the cao he lin panel rejected almost all of the ij credibility analysis,finding only one element of it to be permissible,the xiao ji chen panel characterized as dicta the cao he lin panel precise articulation of the circumstances in which remand would be futile.id.the xiao ji chen panel relied instead on somewhat broader language from cao he lin and said that t he overarching test for deeming a remand futile is when the reviewing court can confidently predict that the ij would reach the same decision absent the errors that were made.id.at quoting cao he lin,at.
as the xiao ji chen court recognized,it was not bound by any dicta in cao he lin.see id.at quoting united states garcia,cir calabresi,concurring dicta is not and can not be binding.it was bound,and all future panels are bound,only to cao he lin holding.thus,in cases which involve facts analogous to those in cao he lin,a subsequent panel is required not to deny review on futility grounds,but in cases with dispositively different facts,it need not do so.
just as the xiao ji chen panel was bound to the holding of cao he lin,so are we,of course,bound to the holdings of both cases.we have little difficulty,however,concluding that the two cases are reconcilable.although xiao ji chen employs broader language than cao he lin,the differences between the two standards are,in fact,more a matter of linguistics than law.id.at.taken together,cao he lin and xiao ji chen establish that remand to the bia is futile a when the ij articulates an alternative and sufficient basis for her determination b when her reliance on the erroneous aspect of her reasoning is substantially tangential to her findings or c when overwhelming evidence in the record makes it clear that the same decision is inevitable on remand,or,in short,whenever the reviewing panel is confident that the agency would reach the same result upon a reconsideration cleansed of errors 
we reiterate,then,that cao he lin and xiao ji chen together provide a nevertheless of scenarios under which remand to the bia is futile despite errors made by an ij.these scenarios exemplify those occasions on which a reviewing panel may confidently predict that the agency would reach the same conclusion absent the identified errors.having discussed the appropriate standard of review of an ij factual findings,we turn to the adverse credibility finding in lin case.
iii.the ij adverse credibility finding 
the ij pointed to several legitimate grounds for skepticism as to lin account of her experiences with china coercive family planning policies.for example,the ij was troubled that,upon observing lin testimony,he ha d the impression that lin was not testifying from actual experience but rather wa s attempting to relate back information which she ha d not reduced to memorization very successfully.in reviewing adverse credibility determinations,w e give particular deference to those that are based on the adjudicator observation of the applicant demeanor,in recognition of the fact that the ij ability to observe the witness demeanor places her in the best position to evaluate whether apparent problems in the witness testimony suggest a lack of credibility or,rather,can be attributed to an innocent cause such as difficulty understanding the question.jin chen dep t of justice,cir accord zhou yun zhang,at.
we can be still more confident in our review of observations about an applicant demeanor where,as here,they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony.see zhou yun zhang,at.the ij referenced two such examples,both of which lend credence to an adverse credibility finding.first,the ij noted that when lin was asked how long after the birth of her second child she was sterilized,she gave a precise date,may.it took additional questioning to adduce that the sterilization occurred days after the birth of lin daughter.the ij took this as suggestive that lin wa s not testifying from actual experience.it is possible,of course,that lin gave a precise date because she misunderstood the question she was being asked.but it is not unreasonable for an ij to conclude that,coupled with his observations of the applicant demeanor,such a response indicates that the applicant is testifying from a script rather than from experience.
second,and more significantly,the ij noted that lin testimony as to the year of her iud insertion was inconsistent.lin variously testified that she had the iud inserted in february and sometime in.in light of the fact that lin was several months pregnant with her second child in early,the ij legitimately took lin confusion as to the date of the iud insertion as evidence that she was not testifying from actual experience.
the ij,properly,also relied on various inconsistencies in the household registration documents that lin submitted.those documents indicated that her registered in august but that her son was not registered until december,at the couple home address in china,when lin and her husband were both in the united states.lin testified that she registered her son in november and her daughter in may,approximately one month after each child birth.when the ij asked lin why the documents did not comport with her testimony,she first said that she did not remember exactly when her children were registered.lin then attempted to clarify by saying a mistake was made when she was issued new registration documents.the ij found this explanation and vague,a finding we have no cause to disturb.
the ij also found lin incredible based on perceived inconsistencies between her written asylum application and her testimony.in particular,lin left out of her any mention of having an iud inserted.even if lin was not truthful as to having an iud inserted involuntarily,this would not,of course,speak directly to whether she was forcibly sterilized,which is the heart of lin withholding claim.see in re,bia holding that coerced sterilization is a permanent and continuing act of persecution see also,at an adverse credibility finding may not rest on inconsistencies that do not concern the basis for the claim of asylum or withholding,but rather matters collateral or ancillary to the claim diallo,at relatively minor and isolated discrepancies in testimony need not be fatal to credibility where the disparities do not concern material facts.
lin omission of her iud insertion,though,is not merely ancillary or collateral to the persecution complained of,but is rather an important episode in a narrative of continuing persecution at the hands of family planning officials.see xu duan dong ashcroft,cir per curiam finding no error where an adverse credibility finding was based in part on an omission that bore a legitimate nexus to the petitioner claim of persecution.although we might question placing dispositive weight on lin neglecting to mention the iud insertion in her initial application,it was not error for the ij to consider it in making his credibility determination.
we are less comfortable with the ij reliance on another omission lin husband failure to mention in his affidavit in support of her application that he had been detained for one day before her event that lin herself testified to in detail before the ij and which she included in her supplemental affidavit in support of her asylum application.given lin extensive testimony on this matter,the omission of potential persecution of lin husband in his own omission,incidentally,that was mentioned on the record for the first time in the ij within the category of inconsistencies which do not concern the basis for the claim of asylum or withholding,but rather matters collateral or ancillary to the claim,at.the ij reliance on this omission,therefore,was error.
were overreliance on a tangential omission the sole error the ij made in reaching his adverse credibility determination,this case would likely be akin to those cases in which we have held that,despite some errors,remand to the bia was futile.see,singh bia,cir per curiam qyteza gonzales,cir per curiam xiao ji chen,at.the ij most troubling finding in this case,however,is also the one that,by his own description,he relied on as the most critical issue here.and the fact that the ij stated that this finding was key to his credibility determination is crucial under the futility analysis of both cao he lin and xiao ji chen,because by his own account the ij relied on that finding as the most critical element of his credibility determination.
lin testified that she was forcibly sterilized with only her hands and feet tied down,and that the procedure was intensely painful.the ij found this account absolutely incredible,concluding that,based on the judicial ly notice d fact that an individual thigh muscles are probably the strongest muscles in a person s body,a ny person who would be subjected to the pain that lin described would involuntarily react to that by vigorously moving her hips or thighs,which of course would mean that it wo
