the panel dismissed in part and denied in part mikhail pechenkov petition for review of the board of immigration appeals denial of withholding of removal and adjustment of status.
the panel held that it lacked jurisdiction pursuant to a c over pechenkov challenge to the discretionary determination finding him ineligible for withholding because the crime underlying his removability was a particularly serious crime.the panel upheld the revocation of pechenkov asylee status pursuant to a,also due to his conviction,and denied pechenkov constitutional challenge to the provisions precluding adjustment of status after his asylee status was revoked.
judge graber,concurring,agreed that in this case the court lacks jurisdiction to review the bia particularly serious crime determination,but wrote separately to urge the court to consider revisiting,in an appropriate case,what she believes is an erroneous reading of a c.judge graber wrote that this court alone has created an exception,allowing review of a denial of relief,as opposed to a denial based on ineligibility due to a criminal conviction.she would rather simply inquire as to whether an alien is charged with removability because of a relevant crime and whether the ij correctly sustained the charge,and find that if so,the court lacks jurisdiction over questions not covered by a d.
petitioner mikhail pechenkov seeks review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia adopting and affirming an immigration judge ij denial of his application for withholding of removal.petitioner argues that the bia abused its discretion in ruling that he was ineligible for withholding of removal because he had been convicted of a particularly serious crime within the meaning of b b ii.petitioner also raises a constitutional challenge to the legal provisions precluding adjustment of his immigration status.he argues that he is eligible for adjustment of status because his asylee status was revoked improperly,under a regulation that purportedly contradicts relevant statutory authority.we dismiss,for lack of jurisdiction,petitioner challenge to the particularly serious crime determination,and we deny his petition with regard to the application to adjust status.
petitioner,a native and citizen of russia,was admitted to the united states in.he filed an application for asylum,which was granted.after he obtained asylee status,petitioner was convicted of felony assault with a deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury,in violation of california penal code section a his penalty included a suspended sentence of three years,felony probation for three years,days in jail,and restitution.
after his conviction,petitioner filed an application,pursuant to b,to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident.that application was denied because,under.a a i i,conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude renders an alien inadmissible.in denying the application,the immigration also expressly determined that petitioner was not entitled to a waiver under c,which allows waiver of certain bars to admissibility for humanitarian purposes,to assure family unity,or when it is otherwise in the public interest.
petitioner asylee status was later revoked pursuant to a,because he was no longer eligible for asylum after his conviction.soon after revoking petitioner asylee status,the immigration authority commenced removal proceedings against him.the notice to appear alleged that petitioner had,after being admitted as a crewman,remained in the united states longer than permitted,making him removable under a b.
petitioner then applied for withholding of removal,relief that is one of the two subjects of this petition for review in,petitioner filed a new application to adjust his status,including an application for waiver of inadmissibility.that application is the other subject of this petition.
at a hearing in early,petitioner admitted the factual allegations in his notice to appear and conceded his removability.in,the government added an additional basis of removability,arguing that petitioner conviction was for an aggravated felony,making him removable under a a iii.petitioner contested the additional basis of removability,but the ij sustained the charge,finding expressly that petitioner conviction qualified as an aggravated felony.
in addressing petitioner withholding of removal application,the ij noted that b,which provides for withholding of removal,does not apply to an alien who,having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,is a danger to the community.after considering and weighing several factors,the ij determined that petitioner crime qualified as a particularly serious crime and that petitioner was a danger to the community.for that reason,the ij denied withholding of removal.
regarding the adjustment of status application,the government argued that petitioner was ineligible to apply for such relief after his asylee status had been revoked.in response,petitioner filed a short brief that the ij construed as conceding ineligibility for adjustment of status.nevertheless,petitioner continued to argue that the revocation of his asylee status was constitutionally defective.regarding that argument,the ij final decision notes a lack of jurisdiction to review the termination of the petitioner asylum status.
petitioner appealed to the bia,which adopted the ij opinion.petitioner brief to the bia did not challenge the aggravated felony finding or that ground of removability.
in adopting the ij opinion,the bia reiterated that petitioner was ineligible for withholding of removal because he had been convicted of a particularly serious crime.with respect to the application to adjust status,the bia noted that it lacked jurisdiction to consider petitioner constitutional arguments regarding the revocation of his asylee status.petitioner timely seeks review,challenging the bia evaluation of the factors supporting the particularly serious crime finding that precluded withholding and the constitutionality of the regulation under which his asylee status was revoked.petitioner does not dispute that he is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.
at the outset,the government asserts that we lack jurisdiction over this petition,citing the provisions of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.specifically,a c provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,and except as provided in subparagraph d,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed among other crimes,an aggravated felony.
emphasis added.but subparagraph d of that same statute provides 
nothing in subparagraph c shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.
