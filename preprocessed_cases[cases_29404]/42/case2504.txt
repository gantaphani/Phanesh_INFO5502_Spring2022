petitioner mohammad abu hashish seeks review of an adverse decision of the board of immigration appeals the bia or board that denied his request for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the decision of the bia and dismiss the petition.
backgrounda.facts 
abu hashish is a jordanian who originally was admitted to the united states on february,on a visitor visa.upon entering this country,abu hashish first worked as a stock boy,and then as a street vendor.in,abu hashish began distributing candy to grocery stores.from to,he owned and operated two different stores.
in november,abu hashish pleaded guilty to theft of a recordable sound in violation of illinois criminal code,see ilcs he was sentenced to one year probation and was required to pay restitution.in,abu hashish again was charged with theft,specifically obtaining or exerting unauthorized control over the property of another,in violation of ilcs a on december,he pleaded guilty to this misdemeanor charge.abu hashish was given a conditional discharge sentence of two years and was required to pay restitution in the amount of.
administrative proceedings 
in june,the former immigration and naturalization service ins issued abu hashish a notice to appear.at an april,hearing before an immigration judge ij,abu hashish conceded removability but sought cancellation of removal.see.a hearing on his claim for relief was continued several times to allow counsel for abu hashish and for the government to obtain documentation regarding the disposition of criminal charges against him.the ij also suggested that abu hashish counsel explore other avenues of relief should abu hashish convictions render him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.at a subsequent hearing,the ij confirmed his receipt of a brief filed by abu hashish,which continued to assert his eligibility for cancellation of removal,as well as of other documents from the parties concerning abu hashish convictions.
in a decision issued on april,the ij determined that both abu hashish and theft convictions constituted crimes of moral turpitude.abu hashish,therefore,was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.the ij also determined that,in light of these crimes,abu hashish had not established good moral character for the requisite number of years necessary to qualify for a grant of voluntary departure.see.abu hashish appealed to the bia.
in a written opinion dated april,the bia affirmed the ij decision.the bia rejected abu hashish argument that the ij should have conducted an inquiry into the nature of the respondent theft convictions to determine whether such convictions in fact constitute crimes involving moral turpitude.the bia stated that i t is well settled that theft,regardless of the sentenced sic imposed or the amount stolen,is a crime involving moral turpitude.id.furthermore,because both of abu hashish crimes fell into this category,he could not invoke the exception available for individuals who had committed only one petty offense as defined by statute.see id.citing a a ii ii.finally,the bia stated that,in light of the respondent most recent theft conviction,the immigration judge properly found that the respondent failed to establish his eligibility for voluntary departure.id.
analysisa.jurisdiction 
generally speaking,this court has jurisdiction to review final orders of removal under.however,this court does not have jurisdiction to review the discretionary decision of the attorney general to grant or deny cancellation of removal or voluntary departure.see a b i.despite this prohibition,we do have jurisdiction to review nondiscretionary determinations relating to an alien eligibility for relief.see,ashcroft,cir holding that the meaning of the term continuous physical presence for purposes of cancellation of removal is a nondiscretionary question of statutory interpretation.we also may review constitutional questions and questions of law raised in a petition for review of a final removal order.see a d.because abu hashish claims with respect to both cancellation of removal and voluntary departure raise questions of law,we have jurisdiction to review those claims.
cancellation of removal 
abu hashish argues that the bia erred when it deemed his theft convictions crimes of moral turpitude,which rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal.before evaluating abu hashish specific claims,we turn briefly to the statutory requirements for cancellation of removal.see id.b.section b provides 
the attorney general may cancel removal of,and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
a has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application 
b has been a person of good moral character during such period 
c has not been convicted of an offense under section a crimes of moral turpitude or crimes,a,or a of this title except in a case described in section a of this title where the attorney general exercises discretion to grant a waiver and 
d establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
section goes on to state that any period of physical presence shall be deemed to end when the alien has committed an offense referred to in section a a crime of moral turpitude or a offense.id.d.with these standards in mind,we turn to abu hashish claims on appeal.
on the issue of whether his crimes constitute crimes of moral turpitude abu hashish submits that the board should have looked beyond the crimes charged to his underlying conduct to determine whether his crimes fall within this category.abu hashish analogizes his first theft of a recordable downloading music over the internet.this type of activity,abu hashish maintains,does not arouse indignation in the general populace and,therefore,should not be considered a crime of moral turpitude.with respect to his second conviction,receiving stolen property,abu hashish suggests that,because a defendant could be convicted for this crime absent actual knowledge that the property was stolen,it does not entail the moral culpability usually associated with crimes of moral turpitude.
we believe that abu hashish arguments ignore the framework that we have established for analyzing whether a crime is one of moral turpitude for purposes of the immigration laws.we recently restated that framework in padilla gonzales,cir 
in determining whether a crime involves moral turpitude,we employ a categorical approach that is,we determine whether a given crime necessarily involves moral turpitude by examining only the elements of the statute under which the alien was convicted and the record of conviction,not the circumstances surrounding the particular transgression.this practice is intended to promote uniformity and avoid the oppressive administrative burden of scrutinizing the specific conduct giving rise to criminal offenses.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.other circuits follow the same approach.see vuksanovic united states attorney general,cir t he determination that a crime involves moral turpitude is made categorically based on the statutory definition or nature of the crime,not the specific conduct predicating a particular conviction.gonzales,cir using a categorical approach to determine whether a crime constitutes moral turpitude gonzales,cir stating that,in determining whether a crime is a crime of moral turpitude,we look to the statutory crime definition as interpreted by the state courts,without regard to the particular circumstances surrounding the specific offender violation partyka attorney of the united states,cir whether an alien crime involves moral turpitude is determined by the criminal statute and the record of conviction,not the alien conduct.dalton ashcroft,cir w e have long endorsed categorical analyses of criminal statutes in the con
