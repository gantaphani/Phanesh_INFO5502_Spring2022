abdel hamid mekhoukh,a native and citizen of algeria,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals,denying his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under article of the united nations convention against torture.we deny the petition for review.
background 
this case arises against the background of the ongoing and turmoil that has engulfed algeria since late.see generally bureau of democracy,human rights and labor,united states department of state,country reports on human rights algeria,ar country reports bureau of democracy,human rights and labor,united states department of state,of asylum claims and country conditions june ar profile of asylum claims see also mediouni ins,cir debab ins,cir meguenine ins,cir.the conflict began when the ruling party,the national liberation front fln,foreseeing a loss to an islamic fundamentalist party,the islamic salvation front fis,cancelled the second round of scheduled democratic elections.the military then took power from the civilian president.these events caused significant unrest in the country.since then,the government of algeria has been engaged in a brutal conflict with radical islamic parties,resulting in over deaths.torture and other human rights abuses,including the killing of innocent civilians,have been perpetrated by both the armed insurgents and the government security forces.see country reports ar the security forces committed numerous serious human rights abuses.profile of asylum claims ar security forces commit serious abuses.they were responsible for numerous disappearances,carried out killings,routinely tortured and otherwise abused detainees,and arbitrarily arrested and detained or held incommunicado many individuals suspected of involvement with armed islamic groups.see also meguenine,at both sides have acted with considerable brutality toward the civilian population.
mekhoukh,an ethnic berber was born on april,in algiers,algeria.during the years he lived in algeria,from birth until,he supported berber causes,but he was not an activist.on one occasion,around,when he was about,he met,and had his picture taken with lounes matoub,a popular entertainer and berber activist who was assassinated by islamic radicals in.while he was in algeria,mekhoukh suffered no persecution on account of his berber ethnicity or his support of berber causes.
in approximately,mekhoukh received his first draft notice.mekhoukh was then enrolled at a university and eligible for an educational deferment.in late,the university temporarily closed due to political unrest in the country.see infra.when it reopened in the spring of,mekhoukh did not return.at that point,he was no longer entitled to an exemption from military service,but he continued to avoid his military obligation by filing false educational certificates.while he was in algeria,mekhoukh never claimed that he had a conscientious objection to military service in the algerian military nor did he ever inquire about the possibility of alternative service.mekhoukh received draft notices after he left the university,but the record does not establish when those notices were received,how many were received,or their content mekhoukh remained in algeria,working,until.during those five years,between and,mekhoukh experienced no negative consequences as a result of his fraudulent avoidance of military service.
when the conflict in algeria started in,mekhoukh did not align himself with either the ruling party or the fis.his position was,and remains today,that the government should not have cancelled the elections and that the fis had the right to rule if democratically elected.while he was in algeria,mekhoukh suffered no persecution on account of these political opinions.
mekhoukh left algeria in and reached the united states in,entering on a forged french passport.after leaving the united states for new zealand,where his application for asylum was denied,he reentered the united states in october.he was detained by the ins and determined to be deportable.he then applied for asylum,for withholding of deportation,and for protection under the united nations convention against torture.after a number of continuances,the retention and firing of one attorney,and several changes of venue from los angeles to houston to boston,mekhoukh finally filed his official application for asylum,withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture on october.his application for asylum was just barely within the time limit that applies to asylum claims.at the initial proceeding,mekhoukh was advised that he had the right to be represented by counsel at his hearing,although not the right to appointed counsel.he was given a list of persons and organizations he could contact for help in finding an attorney.a hearing date of february,was set,giving him over three months to find counsel and prepare.
on february,mekhoukh appeared for his hearing late and without counsel.he asked for a continuance,saying that he had important documents on the way and that he wanted to obtain an attorney.the immigration judge denied his motion,noting that mekhoukh had been in the country for more than a year,that three months had passed since he had filed his official application,and that it would be unfair to other applicants to squander the three hours she had set aside for his case.however,she accepted his proffer as to what the additional documentary evidence would show.an interpreter was present at the hearing,although mekhoukh himself testified mostly in english.
at the conclusion of his hearing,the immigration judge issued an oral decision denying mekhoukh application for asylum,for withholding of deportation,and for protection under the united nations convention against torture.she concluded that mekhoukh failed to meet his burden to show a fear of persecution,and necessarily failed to show a likelihood of persecution,on account of his ethnicity,political opinions,his avoidance of military service.
mekhoukh appealed to the board of immigration appeals.he provided the board with additional documentary evidence,including a copy of his forged school certificate for the year,a copy of his picture with matoub,and copies of a number of government reports and media publications,documenting the violence and human rights abuses that have been endemic in algeria since.he did not submit copies of any draft notices.he asked the board either to reverse on the existing record or to remand his case to the immigration judge for further consideration in light of this additional evidence.on december,the board of immigration appeals affirmed,without opinion,making the immigration judge decision the final agency determination.see e.
mekhoukh moved for reconsideration,contending that the board had failed to consider his new evidence and that he was entitled to a remand to permit the immigration judge to consider it.he also argued that the board decision to affirm without opinion was improper where new evidence was proffered.the board denied the motion on february.it stated that it had considered mekhoukh new evidence prior to affirming the immigration judge decision.it further noted that to the extent mekhoukh was objecting to the fact that it affirmed without opinion,such motions were barred by regulation.see b.
mekhoukh petitions for review of the denial of his application for asylum,for withholding of deportation,and for protection under the convention against torture.
ii.discussion 
we have jurisdiction over mekhoukh appeal pursuant to b.
standard of review 
our review of an order of removal is circumscribed by statute.a court of appeals must decide a petition for review only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.b a.t he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,id.at b b emphasis added,and a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the united states is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law,id.at b c.
in order to be eligible for asylum,an alien must be a refugee within the meaning of section a a of title of the united states code.b.a refugee is defined,in relevant part,as 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
a see also albathani ins,cir an asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she falls within the statutory definition of refugee.see a see also fesseha ashcroft,cir.
mekhoukh does not claim that he has suffered any persecution in the past,but that he has a fear of persecution if he returns to algeria.an applicant has a fear of persecution if a t he applicant has a fear of persecution in his or her country of nationality on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion b t here is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country and c h e or she is unable or unwilling to return to,or avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of such fear.b i.thus,a fear of persecution has both subjective and objective components subjectively,the must show a genuine fear of persecution,and objectively,the record must show by credible,direct,and specific evidence,facts that would support a reasonable fear that the petitioner faces persecution.see guzman ins,cir quoting ravindran ins,cir quoting ins,cir.
the immigration judge accepted mekhoukh claim that he feared persecution,but concluded that the record evidence did not establish that his fear was.on appeal,mekhoukh contends that the immigration judge erred in her weighing of the record evidence he maintains that the record demonstrates that his fear of persecution on account of his ethnicity,his political opinions his avoidance of military service is.he also raises several procedural issues,challenging the fairness of his hearing before the immigration judge and the board abbreviated review of that decision.
ethnicity and political opinions 
mekhoukh first claims he has a fear of persecution based on his ethnicity and political opinions because he is a berber,he supports berber causes,and he is likely to be perceived as a berber activist.in order to be eligible for asylum on this ground,mekhoukh must demonstrate that there is a reasonable possibility that he is likely to be identified as a target for persecution on account of his ethnicity or political opinions.see debab,at generally,evidence of widespread violence and human rights violations affecting all citizens is insufficient to establish persecution.internal quotations omitted see also profile of asylum claims ar i t is important in our view to differentiate between algerian political asylum applicants with legitimate fears based on who they are and what they have done and the majority of of whom are young adults whose personal security situation does not appear to be very different from that faced by the algerian population at large and who may be seeking to escape the turmoil or find better economic opportunities in the united states.the immigration judge concluded,and we agree,that the record does not support such a finding.
we consider first whether mekhoukh berber ethnicity in and of itself renders him eligible for asylum.under certain limited circumstances,an applicant may be eligible for asylum without providing evidence that he would be singled out individually for persecution if a he establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion and b he establishes his or her own inclusion in,and identification with,such group of persons such that his or her fear of persecution upon return is reasonable.b iii.while there is no issue as to mekhoukh berber ethnicity,the record does not support,much less compel,the conclusion that there is a pattern or practice of persecution directed at persons of berber ethnicity.meguenine,at asylum claim denied because no pattern or practice of targeting neutral health care workers in algeria.according to the state department,there may be some discrimination and harassment of berbers in the capital city of algiers and other large towns,but there is no pattern of action by the algerian authorities against algerians simply because they are of berber origin.profile of asylum claims ar.none of the evidence proffered by mekhoukh,before the immigration judge or to the board,compels a contrary finding.accordingly,mekhoukh berber ethnicity by itself does not demonstrate his eligibility for asylum.
we consider next mekhoukh claim that he has a fear of persecution based on his berber ethnicity combined with his support for berber causes.again,as there is no evidence that similarly situated persons have been targeted for persecution,mekhoukh can not rely solely on his inclusion in that group to support his asylum claim.b iii.nor are those characteristics likely to cause the government to single him out for persecution.
mekhoukh also contends,however,that there is a reasonable possibility that he will be perceived as an activist for berber causes and persecuted even assuming that the record supported mekhoukh claim that berber activists as a group face systematic persecution,it does not establish a reasonable possibility that mekhoukh would be perceived as a member of this group.see b iii b.mekhoukh claims that he could be perceived as an activist because of his berber ethnicity,his support of berber causes,and the fact that he had his picture taken,in approximately,with a renowned activist,lounes matoub.it is hard to imagine that these facts would ever result in the government labeling mekhoukh an activist they certainly do not compel that conclusion,especially when the other record evidence is considered.for example,mekhoukh remained in algeria for a number of years after the picture was taken without ever experiencing any persecution.and no member of his family has ever been persecuted.see ins,cir t he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien homeland undercuts the alien claim that persecution awaits his return.it is similarly impossible to imagine that these facts would lead the government to target mekhoukh for persecution.meguenine,at t he board could reject the applicant fears of specific harm on this record as insufficiently severe and particular to support eligibility for asylum.accordingly,we agree with the immigration judge that mekhoukh fear of persecution based on his berber ethnicity and support of berber political causes is not.
in a slight modification of his argument,mekhoukh also claims that he is likely to be targeted for persecution because of his political opinion that the government should not have cancelled democratic elections in,that the islamic fundamentalist party has the right to rule if democratically elected and that the present government is illegitimate.even assuming that mekhoukh neutrality qualifies as a political opinion for asylum purposes there is simply no evidence in the record that persons who hold this opinion are targeted for persecution or that mekhoukh himself is likely to be identified as such a person and targeted.
mekhoukh,if he returns to algeria,may well be at risk because of the ongoing violence between the government security forces and armed insurgent groups.however,the record does not support mekhoukh claim that he faces persecution for his ethnicity or political opinions.accordingly,we agree with the immigration judge that mekhoukh has not proved a fear of persecution based on either his ethnicity or political opinions.
evasion of military service 
mekhoukh also claims he has a fear of persecution based on his avoidance of military service.even though a sovereign nation enjoys the right to enforce its laws of conscription,and normal penalties for evasion generally are not considered persecution,see selective draft law cases,two types of asylum claims can arise based on avoidance of military service.first,an alien may be eligible for asylum if refusal to serve in the military results not in normal draft evasion penalties,but rather in disproportionately severe punishment on account of one of the five grounds enumerated in the refugee act.see ins,cir citing office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees,handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status,geneva refugee handbook second,an alien is eligible for asylum if the alien would be associated with a military whose acts are condemned by the international community as contrary to the basic rules of human conduct.see also vujisic ins,cir mojsilovic ins,cir.under those circumstances,punishment for desertion or draft evasion could in itself be regarded as persecution.vujisic,at quoting refugee handbook.mekhoukh claims he is eligible for asylum on both accounts.
excessive punishment 
mekhoukh claim that his draft evasion will lead the government to label him as an islamic fundamentalist sympathizer and a terrorist and,therefore,to target him for abuse or death,has little support in the record.as noted above,mekhoukh own testimony establishes that he has not been an activist in any way and that he has never identified himself as a supporter or sympathizer with any of the armed insurgent groups,making it unlikely that the algerian government would label him a terrorist and impose a disproportionately severe punishment on him for his draft evasion.moreover,there is no evidence that the algerian government is likely to label draft evaders as terrorists or target them for persecution absent such evidence,mekhoukh is not eligible for asylum on this basis.see ins,at petitioner failed to show that he would be singled out for his refusal to serve.
conscientious objection 
mekhoukh also claims that he avoided his military service in algeria,and wants to continue to avoid it,because he objects to serving in a military that is known to commit human rights abuses.mekhoukh is eligible for asylum on this ground only if the algerian military has been condemned by the international community as a military that commits human rights abuses there is a reasonable possibility that mekhoukh will have to serve in that military if he returns to algeria or face punishment for refusing to serve and mekhoukh has a genuine conscientious objection to service.mekhoukh bears the burden of establishing these facts.
nature of algerian military 
it is difficult to discern from the immigration judge oral decision whether she expressly considered made a finding about the nature of the algerian military,but the record clearly establishes that the algerian military is a military whose acts are condemned by the international community as contrary to the basis rules of human conduct see,country reports ar security forces have committed numerous serious human rights abuses see also profile of asylum claims ar security forces have allegedly resorted to the arrest,interrogation,and torture of persons suspected of having islamist sympathies 
ii.military service 
an alien claim to asylum based on his objection to serving in an internationally condemned military requires proof that there is a reasonable possibility that the alien will have to serve or be punished for refusing to serve.see mojsilovic,at the immigration judge concluded that mekhoukh failed to meet his burden of proof on this point because he failed to establish that alternative service was not available or to ask about the possibility of positions.mekhoukh contends that she assigned too much weight to this particular fact.he points out on appeal that there are many practical reasons why an alien might fail to inquire about the possibility of alternative service but he apparently failed to advance these reasons to the immigration judge nor does he seriously claim that they apply to him.his real reason for not inquiring,suggested by his testimony and clearly asserted on appeal,is that he thought any inquiry would be futile.he asserts,without any supporting evidence,that it is inconceivable that the algerian military would give a conscripted soldier the option of choosing a position.his assertion may be correct,and any inquiry may have been futile.but his failure to make any inquiry or to justify his failure does,as the immigration judge concluded,amount to a failure to satisfy his burden of proving that if he returned to algeria he would,in fact,have to serve in algeria military in a combat position.certainly,the weight the immigration judge assigned to this fact was not manifestly contrary to law.b c.
indeed,had mekhoukh addressed his burden of proving his assertion that a assignment was unavoidable by inquiring about it,he might have discovered,as have we,that algeria has adopted a regularization program for males of a certain age who have not fulfilled their military service,under which they may be excused from any further obligation.according to the report of the ins resource information center which was available at the time of mekhoukh immigration hearing,algeria has established a program to permit draft evaders,even those who are residing outside of algeria,to apply for regularization of their status.see id.algerians aged and over who have not done military service are currently being invited to apply for an exemption from military service.it is still not clear who exactly will benefit from such registration,but it appears that many individuals considered draft evaders or who presently have a deferral may be included.
mekhoukh had the burden of proving that if he returned to algeria he would be drafted,assigned to combat duty,and become obligated to commit human rights violations.his burden included pursuit of evidence to sustain his assertion.he has failed to do so.
iii.genuine conscientious objection 
the immigration judge did not make a finding as to whether mekhoukh has a genuine conscientious objection to service,but that is immaterial as mekhoukh claim was properly rejected on other grounds.
credibility 
the immigration judge found that mekhoukh was not a credible witness.he has made many assertions that are unfounded,not corroborated and are simply improbable.ar.mekhoukh challenges this finding on appeal.we need not address this issue as the immigration judge rejected mekhoukh asylum claim,and we have reviewed and approved that rejection,without relying on the adverse credibility finding.
procedural fairness of immigration hearing 
having concluded that the existing record fails to establish mekhoukh eligibility for asylum,we must consider his claim that procedural flaws compromised the fundamental fairness of his hearing before the immigration judge and necessitate a remand.it is well established that the fifth amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.morales ins,cir quoting reno flores,d.mekhoukh contends his hearing was unfair because of his lack of counsel,the incompetency of the interpreter,and the immigration judge failure to fully develop the record.we apply de novo review to a claim that an administrative law judge violated a party right to due process.ins,at.
lack of counsel 
mekhoukh first contends that the hearing before the immigration judge was fundamentally unfair because his lack of counsel hindered his ability to present his case,particularly given the language barriers.the absence of counsel in and of itself can not support mekhoukh claim.a petitioner in an asylum proceeding is not entitled to appointed counsel.moreover,the immigration judges throughout this proceeding have more than fulfilled their obligation to inform mekhoukh of his rights and options with respect to counsel.before the case was transferred to boston,at mekhoukh request,he had retained and dismissed one counsel.after he filed his official application in boston,the immigration judge for his case informed him that he was entitled to retain counsel,continued the hearing for several months in order to give him time to do so,and provided him with a list of contacts.under such circumstances,it was certainly reasonable fo
