background 
petitioner rafiu ajadi abimbola,a citizen of nigeria,entered the united states in and was granted lawful permanent resident status on september.in the latter half of the,abimbola was charged with several federal and state crimes.on february,abimbola pleaded guilty in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york to bank fraud in violation of.moreover,on november,he entered an alford plea to larceny in the third degree in violation of connecticut general statutes 
in june,based on the federal conviction,the immigration and naturalization service ins served abimbola with a notice to appear.the ins sought abimbola removal pursuant to a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii,for an aggravated felony conviction as defined under ina a g.a g,that subsection defines aggravated felony as a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.id.although the original charge only included the federal conviction,the ins amended the notice to appear by adding the connecticut larceny conviction.the ins asserted that connecticut larceny is a theft offense and therefore also an aggravated felony.
abimbola responded pro se,arguing that the connecticut larceny conviction is not an aggravated felony as defined by the ina.he also moved for a change of venue from oakdale,louisiana to new york request the immigration judge ij denied.finally,abimbola applied for asylum,asserting that he would be killed by muslim extremists if he returned to nigeria because of his family prominent position in their christian church.
in december,at a removal hearing in oakdale,louisiana,the ins withdrew the charge of removability based on the federal conviction as that conviction was still on direct appeal abimbola contested the charge of removability,arguing that the conduct underlying the state larceny conviction constituted fraud and deceit rather than theft.he argued that the conviction should not be construed as an aggravated felony.on june,the ij found abimbola removable as an aggravated felon and ordered him removed to nigeria.the ij also denied abimbola application for asylum and his petition for withholding of removal under ina b and the united nations convention against torture cat.the ij reasoned that abimbola did not provide credible testimony concerning his alleged fear of persecution and torture in nigeria.
abimbola appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.he added several arguments that had not been presented to the ij.first,he argued that his alford plea did not constitute a conviction pursuant to a a.second,he argued that he was entitled to discretionary relief under former c of the ina.see c,repealed by illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,b,stat.with regard to the denial of withholding of removal under b and cat,abimbola only challenged the credibility determination of the ij.on february,the bia dismissed abimbola appeal,finding that abimbola had been convicted of an aggravated felony and was not eligible for any other form of relief from removal,including relief under the former c.the bia did not address abimbola alford plea argument.
on august,abimbola filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,challenging his detention,the removal proceedings,and his order of removal.he presented to the district court the same arguments he previously made before the bia.the district court denied the habeas corpus petition and lifted the stay of removal it had imposed pending the outcome of the petition.abimbola ashcroft,ng,wl,dist.lexis.the district court reasoned that abimbola alford plea was a conviction for purposes of the immigration laws and that connecticut larceny qualifies as an aggravated felony.the court also concluded that the ij had not abused its discretion in denying the motion to change venue.finally,the district court held that the claim under former c was unexhausted because it was never presented to the ij and that the claims under b and the cat were nonreviewable because abimbola only challenged the ij credibility findings.judgment was entered on september.
abimbola appeals the district court decision.
discussion 
is larceny under connecticut law,see,an aggravated felony under the ina more specifically,was petitioner convicted of a theft offense under section a g of the ina when he entered an alford plea to the state crime we agree with the bia as well as the district court that petitioner committed an aggravated felony and is deportable.we also find that petitioner other claims are either without merit or that we lack jurisdiction to hear them.thus,we affirm the district court order denying the habeas petition and dismiss the appeal.
connecticut larceny 
when this court is called upon to construe a provision of the ina,we must give substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the statutes it is charged with administering.evangelista ashcroft,cir.since the term theft offense is not to any other federal criminal statute,the bia interpretation is given controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,d see also evangelista,at.
the bia interprets theft offense to include the taking of property whenever there is a criminal intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership,even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.in re,bia.this definition is similar to definitions adopted by three of our sister circuits.for example,the ninth circuit defines theft offense as a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership,even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.united states,cir en banc ins,cir same united states,cir same.
congress used the words theft offense rather than just theft,thus indicating that the phrase ought to be read to incorporate different but closely related constructions in modern state statutes,at emphasis added.the bia broader,more generic definition recognizes that the contemporary crime of theft stems from the common law crime of larceny but is not confined by the definition.id.at alterations and quotation marks omitted.in taylor united states,d,the supreme court defined burglary within the meaning of the abuse act of,e.that statute provides a sentence enhancement for a defendant who is convicted for unlawful possession of a firearm.id.at.the court noted that congress intended to use a generic view of burglary in order to prevent offenders from invoking the arcane technicalities of the definition of burglary to evade the provision,and protected offenders from the unfairness of having enhancement depend upon the label employed by the state of conviction.id.at.as several courts and the bia have recognized,the taylor analysis is analogous to the ina and weighs heavily in favor of a broad understanding of theft offense.see,at.in our view,the bia interpretation of theft offense is reasonable.
we do not defer,however,to the bia interpretation of state criminal laws as the bia is not charged with the administration of these laws.ming lam sui ins,cir.thus,we review de novo the bia determination that connecticut larceny is a theft offense and therefore an aggravated felony.see chrzanoski ashcroft,cir.
to determine whether a particular state offense constitutes an aggravated felony under federal law,this court employs the categorical approach.under this analysis,removability does not rest on the particular set of facts underlying an alien criminal conviction.dickson ashcroft,cir.the categorical approach focuses on the intrinsic nature of the offense rather than on the factual circumstances surrounding any particular violation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we must ask whether every set of facts violating a statute satisf ies the criteria for removability,dickson,at,keeping in mind that only the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under a given statute is relevant.dalton ashcroft,cir citation omitted.when the criminal statute at issue encompasses some classes of criminal acts that fall within the federal definition of aggravated felony and some classes that do not fall within the definition,the statute is considered divisible.id.if a statute is divisible,a court may then look to the record of conviction for the limited purpose of determining whether the alien conviction was under the branch of the statute that permits removal.id.at.under section c b of the ina,the record of conviction includes the charging document,plea agreement,a verdict or judgment of conviction,and a record of the sentence or plea transcript.c b see dickson,at.
abimbola contends that even if we adopt the bia definition of theft offense,portions of connecticut larceny statute,are broader than this definition.he makes two arguments to support finding section divisible.first,he argues that while section clearly criminalizes theft of services,theft offense only encompasses the theft of tangible property.second,he argues that portions of connecticut statute do not incorporate the necessary intent requirement present in a theft offense.if we agree with him that the state statute is divisible,he asserts that the case must be remanded as the record does not reflect the section of the statute for which he was convicted.we reject his arguments,finding instead that connecticut larceny is not divisible and is a theft offense.
section provides 
a person is guilty of larceny in the third degree when he commits larceny,as defined in section,and the property consists of a motor vehicle,the value of which is five thousand dollars or less the value of the property or service exceeds one thousand dollars the property consists of a public record,writing or instrument kept,held or deposited according to law with or in the keeping of any public office or public servant or the property consists of a sample,culture,microorganism,specimen,record,recording,document,drawing or any other article,material,device or substance which constitutes,represents,evidences,reflects or records a secret scientific or technical process,invention or formula or any phase or part thereof.
a.section,in turn,provides a person commits larceny when,with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person,he wrongfully takes,obtains or withholds such property from an owner.id.at emphasis added.the statute then lists different fact scenarios which constitute larceny the statute is careful to note however that this list is not exclusive.id.
with respect to abimbola first argument,it is clear that section includes theft of services.a person is guilty of larceny in the third degree when he commits larceny,and the value of the property or service exceeds one thousand dollars.a emphasis added.thus,the question turns on whether the federal definition of theft offense is limited to tangible,movable property.
in,the bia articulated a general definition of theft offense,but did not decide whether theft of services fell within that definition abimbola argues that relied on the model penal code definition in determining whether theft of services constitutes theft.since the code recognizes that theft involves the taking of property,which traditionally included only movable property,abimbola contends that theft offense should be limited in a similar way.
abimbola finds support for his view in the ninth circuit majority opinion in.after adopting a broad and generic definition of theft offense,the majority ruled that the definition does not include theft of services or labor,at.the majority reasoned that theft of services or labor are not within the definition of theft offense because traditionally one labor is not one property.id.quoting mpc,cmt.the majority noted that many states have enacted provisions,but indicated that this fact suggests that if labor were property,there would be no need for separate provisions criminalizing the theft of labor or services.id.
we respectfully disagree with this conclusion.as noted above,the statutory crimes of theft theft offenses have evolved from the common law.while traditional definitions may not have included services as property within the definition of theft,many state statutes had criminalized such conduct prior to the enactment of a g.the bia did look to the model penal code in,but it also correctly reasoned that theft offense incorporates modern state theft statutes.furthermore,as the dissent in noted,the model penal code itself includes theft of services in the commentary indicates that labor or professional service,though arguably viewed as a species of property,had not been included in the traditional scope of that term in ordinary theft statutes but that since promulgation of the code in,more than half of the states have enacted theft of service provisions,at citing american law institute,modern penal code and commentaries ii,cmt.emphasis in original.congress clearly intended to incorporate a modern understanding of theft.it therefore would make little sense to exclude theft of services from the definition.finally,as the district court noted,this circuit has already concluded that the legislative history of this statute and its plain language indicate a clear congressional intent to expand the definition of aggravated felony as applied to theft offenses to bring more convictions within its ambit.see united states pacheco,cir holding that misdemeanor larceny is a theft offense under a g if the punishment is for at least one year.in our view,inclusion of theft of services in section does not broaden the state statute beyond the definition of theft offense.
second,abimbola argues that section,by incorporating section,does not mandate the intent element required in the bia definition.we agree with the district court that section intent requirement is no broader than the requirements of a g.first,the preamble to specifically states that to be convicted of larceny,a person must have the intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person.emphasis added.since section encompasses this definition of larceny,the plain reading of the statute includes the necessary intent requirement.there is no reason to believe that the connecticut courts consider this preamble meaningless verbiage.connecticut adheres to the basic canon of statutory construction that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence,clause or phrase in a legislative enactment,and that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions.hall gilbert bennett.furthermore,the connecticut supreme court recently noted that i n order to sustain a conviction under connecticut larceny provisions,we require proof of the existence of a felonious intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently and that a specific intent to deprive is an essential element of larceny,which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.state calonico,emphasis added and alterations omitted.
finally,first and larceny both define larceny by reference to the definition in section.see.the difference in severity depends on factors such as the value of property involved or whether extortion was used in commission of the crime.id.accepting abimbola position would require a conclusion that intent to deprive is not a requirement of first and larceny in connecticut.
abimbola presses that some of the subsections in do not require intent to deprive.in particular,he points to two cases involving the receipt of stolen property state gabriel,and state perez.the plain language of section states that a person is guilty of larceny by receiving stolen property if he receives,retains,or disposes of stolen property knowing that it has probably been stolen or believing that it has probably been stolen.state a.the connecticut supreme court has noted that this crime does not involve specific intent but has recognized that knowingly receiving,retaining,or disposing of stolen goods involves guilty knowledge or criminal intent.gabriel,at.by definition,the victim has already suffered a deprivation of property before the defendant has done anythin
