facts and procedural history 
jordon was born in london,england,on may.jordon parents,celeste and herbert jordon,were married at the time of his birth.in,jordon and his family moved to jamaica.shortly thereafter in,jordon mother and sister moved to new york,new york,but jordon stayed in jamaica with his father.on march,jordon came to the united states to live with his mother in new york.in,jordon adjusted his immigration status to that of lawful permanent resident.
on march,when jordon was fourteen years old,his mother became a naturalized united states citizen.at some point in,jordon father moved to new york to live with his wife and children.on may,jordon turned eighteen years old.in,jordon mother began divorce proceedings in new york state court.the divorce court ultimately found that jordon father had abandoned jordon mother at some time prior to june,but did not specify a precise date of abandonment.in,the divorce became final and jordon father returned to jamaica.
on march,jordon was convicted in the supreme court of new york,kings county,for criminal possession of a loaded pistol and received a prison sentence.as a result of jordon conviction,an immigration judge found that he was deportable under a c and entered an order of deportation in absentia on august.jordon filed a motion to reopen the order on april,asserting that he had not received notice of his deportation hearing.the board of immigration appeals bia denied the motion on may.on june,jordon was deported to england.
in december,jordon returned to the united states and was admitted under the visa waiver program on december,in connection with his readmission under the visa waiver program,jordon executed a nonimmigrant visa waiver arrival departure form form.on the form,jordon checked no next to the question asking whether he had ever been arrested or convicted for an offense or crime involving moral turpitude or a violation related to a controlled substance or been arrested or convicted for two or more offenses for which the aggregate sentence to confinement was five years or more or been a controlled substance trafficker or are you seeking entry to engage in criminal or immoral activities.the form jordon executed includes a waiver of rights provision which states that i hereby waive any rights to review or appeal of an immigration officer determination as to my admissibility,or to contest,other than on the basis of an application for asylum,any action in deportation.the form also includes a certification provision stating that i certify that i have read and understand all the questions and statements on this form.the answers i have furnished are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.jordon signed his name and entered the date immediately below the waiver of rights and certification provisions.
apparently on the same day he executed the form,jordon was arrested and charged with illegal reentry under a and b on may,he pleaded guilty to a information charging illegal reentry under a and b and was later sentenced to a prison term of months.he served his prison term at,pennsylvania,a facility operated by the federal bureau of prisons.
on october,the immigration and naturalization service ins filed an immigration detainer notice with the bureau of prisons on december,the ins issued several documents relating to jordon and his impending deportation as a result of his illegal reentry conviction.first,it issued a notice of intent to remove for violating the terms of your admission under section of the immigration and nationality act,which stated that ins had found that jordon had reentered the united states under the visa waiver program,executed a waiver in connection with his reentry of his right to contest deportability before an immigration judge and the board of immigration appeals,and to any judicial review of any and all of the above decisions except for the filing of an application for political asylum,and violated the terms of his readmission under the visa waiver program by virtue of his illegal reentry conviction under a and b.
the notice of intent to remove also informed jordon that the ins had entered an order to deport him from the united states.this order,also issued on december,and denominated order of deportation,section and,stated that jordon was not a united states citizen or national,was admitted under the visa waiver program,and had violated the conditions of his admission under the program by illegally reentering the united states under a and b.it also informed jordon that he had executed the waiver set forth in the notice of intent to remove,and ordered that he be deported.
on september,while still serving his prison term for illegal reentry,jordon filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania challenging his impending deportation.jordon argued,inter alia,that he was not removable because he was a derivative united states citizen under a as a result of his mother naturalization as a united states citizen.the magistrate judge recommended granting the petition and,on february,the district court followed that recommendation,granted the petition and directed jordon immediate release from ins custody.the district court found,among other things,that legal separation of one parents within the meaning of a need not occur prior to the naturalization of the custodial parent.in its view,a requires only that the custodial parent naturalization occur before the child turns eighteen,regardless of whether the child parents legally separated before or after such naturalization.thus,the district court concluded,jordon did not need to prove that his parents were legally separated at the time of his mother naturalization.
bice filed a timely notice of appeal on april.see fed.a b.in may,bice filed a.b motion,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because jordon was not in immigration custody at the time he filed his petition as required by.on december,the district court denied the rule b motion.
and standard of review 
we begin,as we must,with jurisdiction.this appeal was briefed and argued in the id act era,and at that time presented jurisdictional questions regarding exhaustion,the in custody habeas requirement under,and the scope of a district court habeas jurisdiction over nationality claims such as jordon in light of certain provisions of.for the reasons that follow,we will convert this appeal into a petition for review and exercise jurisdiction over it under the real id act,thus obviating any need to address the questions relating to habeas jurisdiction 
several provisions of both pre and id act make the courts of appeals,not district courts,the first and often last judicial arbiter of nationality claims such as jordon.section b expressly provides for the courts of appeals to review claims of nationality asserted in the course of agency removal proceedings,and to resolve them unless they present disputed factual issues,in which case they should be remanded to a district court for resolution in the first instance.see b a and b.section b c makes clear that nationality claims may be decided only as provided in this paragraph.prior to the real id act,courts were divided over whether these provisions created the exclusive means by which nationality claims at least initially make their way to the federal courts,and thus abrogated district courts jurisdiction over habeas petitions raising such claims.compare taniguchi schultz,cir concluding that while b does not foreclose completely the writ of habeas corpus,and district courts retain habeas jurisdiction where the petitioner has no other judicial remedy,there is no habeas jurisdiction over nationality claims because b provides a specific remedy,and is the exclusive means of determining citizenship for aliens in removal proceedings.ins,d,t he sole and exclusive avenue for review of a claim of nationality is by direct petition for review to the courts of appeals.with dragenice ridge,cir habeas review of nationality claims must remain available.citations omitted gomez bice,d,rejecting government argument that district courts lack jurisdiction over habeas petition raising nationality claim under b and concluding that it has jurisdiction over habeas petitions regarding nationality.jordon,of course,raised his nationality claim in the first instance in his habeas petition to the district court,not in a petition for review to us,thus appearing to present the question of the district court habeas jurisdiction over his claim.
the real id act,which became law just days after argument in this case on may,allows us to avoid the dense thicket of habeas jurisdiction over nationality claims.the real id act amended in several pertinent respects.first and foremost,it made petitions for review filed with the court of appeals the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of most orders of removal,including the order of removal at issue here.see a supp bonhometre gonzales,cir.in so doing,the act expressly eliminated district courts habeas jurisdiction over removal orders.see also kamara attorney general of the united states,cir.at the same time,the act also enlarged our jurisdiction,stating that none of its provisions which limit or eliminate judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.a d bonhometre,at.we have explained that this amendment evidences congress intent to restore judicial review of constitutional claims and questions of law presented in petitions for review of final removal orders.this now permits all aliens,including criminal aliens,to obtain review of constitutional claims and questions of law upon filing of a petition for review with an appropriate court of appeals.papageorgiou gonzales,cir.
we have also acknowledged that congress left no doubt that the real id act changes to a d would be retroactive.see real id act b providing that the new a d shall take effect upon the date of the enactment of this division and shall apply to cases in which the final administrative order of removal was issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this division.papageorgiou,at our review of the act confirms that congress expressly intended that the amendments restoring our jurisdiction be applied retroactively to pending petitions for review.
the real id act expressly addresses habeas petitions pending before district courts as of the date of enactment,providing that they shall be transferred to 
the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed under section b of the immigration and nationality act,as amended by this section the court of appeals shall treat the transferred case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review under such section,except that subsection b of such section relating to the filing deadline shall not apply.
real id act c.the act is silent as to the procedural posture appeal from a district court grant of a habeas petition pending before the court of appeals as of the date of the act enactment.but we have nonetheless concluded that d espite this silence,it is readily apparent,given congress clear intent to have all challenges to removal orders heard in a single forum the court of appeals conf.at,that those habeas petitions that were pending before this court on the effective date of the real id act are properly converted to petitions for review and retained by this court.bonhometre,at.thus,in bonhometre,we converted an appeal from a district court grant of a habeas petition raising a fifth amendment due process claim into a petition for review,disregarded the district court disposition,and reviewed the merits of the due process claim.id.at.and in kamara,we likewise converted an appeal from a district court grant of a habeas petition raising a fifth amendment due process claim into a petition for review,vacated the district court disposition,and examined the merits of the due process claim.kamara,at.following the lead of bonhometre and kamara,we will convert the instant appeal from the district court grant of jordon habeas petition into a petition for review,vacate the district court decision,and address the merits of jordon derivative citizenship claim as if it had been raised in a petition for review before us in the first instance.see also ins,cir treating a petition raising a nationality claim,which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the district court and then transferred to the second circuit via,as a petition for review under the real id act,and proceeding to merits.
this approach not only obviates the need to address the question of district courts habeas jurisdiction over nationality claims discussed above,but also obviates the question of whether jordon was in custody for purposes of.as noted,we have vacated the district court decision and have converted bice appeal from the district court grant of jordon habeas petition into a petition for review.accordingly,whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over jordon petition challenging bice custody,whether jordon was in custody under,is a jurisdictional inquiry no longer relevant to our analysis here.
despite the conversion of this appeal from a grant of a habeas petition into a petition for review,our scope of review remains the same,and we may thus examine claims of constitutional or legal error,including jordon derivative citizenship claim.see bonhometre,at kamara,at quoting bakhtriger elwood,cir in the wake of ins cyr,d,we are not aware of any cases that have upheld habeas review of factual findings or discretionary determinations in criminal alien removal cases.rather,all circuits to decide the issue have limited criminal alien habeas petitions to constitutional challenges or errors of law.we exercise plenary review over jordon derivative citizenship claim,as it presents a pure question of statutory interpretation.see tavarez klingensmith,cir citation omitted.
the derivative citizenship claim 
we turn,finally,to the merits of jordon derivative united states citizenship claim.jordon presents his derivative citizenship claim under the former a.congress repealed a with its enactment of the child citizenship act of cca,stat.the cca had an effective date of february,days following its enactment.because all relevant events respecting jordon claimed derivative citizenship occurred prior to the cca effective date,a controls our analysis see bagot ashcroft,cir citation omitted see also minasyan gonzales,cir derivative citizenship is determined under the law in effect at the time the critical events giving rise to eligibility occurred.citations omitted.
