tareq abufayad,a native of saudi arabia and citizen of palestine,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming an immigration judge ij determination that he is removable,pursuant to a b i ii,for being likely to engage in terrorist activity after entering the united states.he also seeks review of the bia determination that he does not qualify for a grant of protection under the convention against torture cat based on his fear of being mistreated upon returning to palestine as a consequence of being removed on grounds.because we conclude that substantial evidence supports the bia conclusions,we deny the petition.
a palestinian born in saudi arabia,tareq abufayad lived in gaza from age six to about age nineteen,when he left to attend university in the west bank and,later,egypt.his father and five siblings are residents or permanent citizens,and abufayad obtained an immigrant visa to move from egypt to the united states with his father sponsorship in january of.on february,when attempting to enter the united states at san francisco international airport,a customs and border protection agent randomly approached abufayad.alerted by abufayad confrontation al attitude,he took abufayad to a secondary examination area,where agents inspected abufayad luggage,as well as his laptop computer and external hard drive collectively computer.opening abufayad computer and examining its contents,materials that they described as came to their attention.this in turn led to more extensive interviewing and abufayad detention.
upon seizing abufayad computer,immigration and customs enforcement ice conducted a detailed forensic search of its contents at headquarters.an investigation of abufayad hard drive,conducted by rita katz,led to her conclusion that,w hile the majority of the data stored on this hard drive is not considered jihadist,the hard drive nonetheless also contains a significant amount of jihadist material,including jihadist videos,audio clips,songs,pictures,rhetoric,training manuals,and justifications of violence.katz report noted that the material was consistent with the jihadist material found on jihadist websites and shared within the global jihadist community.the computer also contained hacking programs and stolen credit card numbers.contact information on the defunct islamic association for palestine,a designated terrorist organization,was found in abufayad luggage.
for several days thereafter,abufayad was interviewed by,inter alia,agent gregory mandoli,a department of homeland security dhs special agent assigned to the ice national security unit and detailed to the federal bureau of investigation fbi joint terrorism task force.abufayad inconsistent statements did not alleviate concern.after first saying that he did not remember having jihadist materials on his computer,and later saying that he had them for potential use in a future school project,abufayad told agent mandoli that he had downloaded the files out of curiosity about current events and often forgot that he had such files after saving them.when agent mandoli asked abufayad about hamas founder sheikh yassin,some of whose writings were found on abufayad computer,abufayad responded that he respected him as a religious figure but did not agree with his politics.
abufayad was also questioned about his background and potential affiliations with hamas.abufayad said that,while growing up in gaza,he attended a local mosque whose main imam was younis,a childhood friend of his father who later became a fundamentalist member of the hamas government.until about age fifteen,abufayad occasionally donated small amounts to the mosque charity donation box,which he characterized as going to hamas social programs.abufayad also said that he had two cousins who were hamas had conducted a suicide attack in gaza during the second intifada in,and the other was living in yemen.abufayad also discussed having briefly shared an apartment with four hamas members when he first arrived at bir zeit university in the west bank.he said he was approached to join hamas at least twice but that he did not join and was not involved in hamas activities.
the government charged abufayad as removable on the basis that there were reasonable grounds to believe that he was likely to engage after entry in terrorist activity,pursuant to a b i ii,and for having engaged in terrorist activity by affording material support to a terrorist organization,pursuant to a b i i.
both the government and abufayad presented substantial documentary and testimonial evidence at abufayad hearing before the ij.agent mandoli testified about the computer content and his interviews of abufayad.the government also presented fbi special agent robert miranda as an expert witness.agent miranda testified on his review of videotapes of abufayad interviews with ice,a disk of materials found on abufayad computer,and katz were reasonable grounds to believe that abufayad was likely to engage in terrorist activity in the united states.given abufayad connections and his past activities as well as his interest in matters relating to jihad,miranda believed that abufayad would afford material support to individuals connected to terrorist groups if given the opportunity.agent miranda stated that his suspicions regarding abufayad were cumulative,as abufayad had significant elements that would have made him an exceptionally attractive target for recruitment.because hamas sought recruits among the class,agent miranda thought that the organization hamas would definitely seek abufayad talents,which included a university background in computer science.a green card would increase abufayad desirability as a recruitment target.
agent miranda further testified that,based on his knowledge of the organizational structure and operational security of hamas,he did not believe abufayad claim that he had lived with hamas members at bir zeit university but had no hamas affiliations.after speaking with a hamas expert in the israeli security agency,agent miranda had concluded that it was unlikely that hamas members would permit an outsider who does share their opinions into their inner cell.according to the israeli expert,it was a common excuse among captured hamas members to say that hamas was merely trying to recruit them.
abufayad testified at length about the contents of his computer,his alleged connections to hamas,and his religious and political beliefs.he stated that,if admitted as a lawful permanent resident,he intended to live with his family and continue his studies.he reiterated that he had downloaded the jihadist materials found on his computer out of interest in current events,including several events that had occurred in the vicinity of his hometown in gaza,and said that he had never looked at many downloaded items.he testified that he was not and had never been a member of hamas or any other organization advocating the use of violence.he denied receiving any training or support from any such groups or giving donations to any organization advocating violence.he said that he had occasionally dropped a few shekels for the needy in the mosque collection box,which was not nominally affiliated with hamas or any other group.abufayad disavowed any approval of or close relationship with his cousins who were members of hamas.
abufayad also testified about his roommates at bir zeit university.he stated that the student board assigned him housing and that his assigned roommates turned out to be.abufayad testified that he had told agent mandoli that the roommates political view was with hamas,not that they were hamas members.their activities were limited to university activities such as organizing talks and lectures,and their conversations were confined to politics.the roommates did not try to recruit abufayad into hamas military wing and were indifferent when abufayad declined to help them in their political activities.abufayad stayed with them for two to three months before moving in with other students.
following the hearing,the ij found abufayad inadmissible on the basis that there were reasonable grounds to believe that abufayad was likely to engage in terrorist activity upon his entry to the united states the ij stated that the reasonable ground to believe standard is akin to the probable cause standard and is satisfied when there is sufficient information for a reasonable person to believe the standard is met.the ij observed that the charge of inadmissibility was premised on future conduct,namely the possibility that abufayad would utilize his computer expertise in support of hamas terrorist activities.the ij stated that abufayad was an attractive target for recruitment but that the statute required more evidence of likelihood to engage after entry in any terrorist activity.this is especially true since respondent has no past history of terrorist activities and dhs concede d that respondent is not a terrorist.unable to find legal authority defining the term likely to engage,as used in the statute,the ij looked to the dictionary,which defines likely as in all probability probably,and distinguished it from a simple possibility.
the ij determined that abufayad possession of jihadist materials on his computer demonstrated his interest and bias in terrorism and provided some evidence of abufayad disposition.stating that denial alone is insufficient to establish that an alien is clearly and beyond doubt not inadmissible,the ij held that m ere possession of highly inflammatory,information along with the factors identified by agent miranda would provide reasonable grounds to believe that respondent is likely to engage in terrorist activity.the ij described the case as admittedly close but found the evidence sufficient to support a charge of removal under the relatively low burden imposed by the probable cause standard of proof.
abufayad then submitted an application for deferral of removal pursuant to the cat,arguing that dhs investigation into his background and his detention in relation to terrorism charges would subject him to torture upon his return to the palestinian territories.he claimed that the immigration proceedings,which had officially labeled him a hamas supporter and an individual likely to engage in terrorism,caused him to fear returning to palestine because he would face a cumulative probability of torture by the israeli security forces and the palestinian authority pa that exceeded fifty percent.
in support of his application,abufayad submitted documentary evidence about the use of torture in the region to elicit information from suspected terrorists.abufayad also called an expert on country conditions in israel and palestine,who testified that while it is impossible to say for sure what can happen in any individual case,between the risk to abu fayad sic from both the israeli government and the palestinian authority one can assume that he does face a greater than risk of being detained by one or both authority and interrogated using methods that contravene international law.in rebuttal,the government expert stated that there was a percent likelihood that abufayad could be safely returned to gaza and that the probability of encountering mistreatment in the west bank,if returned there,was slim.
the ij granted abufayad request for cat protection and deferral of removal from palestine.the ij determined that agent miranda consultation with an israeli security official had made israeli authorities aware of abufayad,that any attempt by abufayad to enter gaza would lead to his detention,and that it was more likely than not that respondent would be detained by israeli security forces and interrogated by the use of torture or other cruel and inhumane treatment.the ij also concluded that the pa would take an active interest in abufayad for similar reasons that dhs sought respondent removal as a potential hamas terrorist.the pa would be aware of his return pursuant to deportation procedures,it was reasonable to conclude that the pa would want to question him,and individuals in the pa custody suspected of having hamas affiliations face a high probability of torture during interrogation.as a result,the ij deemed it highly probable that abufayad would face detention and interrogation by use of torture as a suspected hamas supporter or terrorist.
abufayad appealed the ij october,decision finding him removable,and the government the ij decision granting abufayad deferral of removal from palestine under the cat.the bia dismissed abufayad appeal and sustained the government appeal.
addressing the charge of removability as likely to engage after entry in any terrorist activity under a b i ii,the bia noted that the ij had properly concluded that the reasonable ground to believe standard is akin to the probable cause standard and stated that the ij had reasonably determined that the term likely means probably and is distinguishable in degree from a mere possibility.expressing its agreement with the ij,it concluded that 
the voluminous number of highly inflammatory,materials found in the respondent computer and hard drive,considered along with the respondent background and other factors cited by agent miranda,adequately provides the dhs with a reasonable basis upon which to believe that the respondent would likely engage in terrorist activity after entering the united states.the respondent claim that he downloaded the numerous files on his computer simply out of curiosity does not adequately prove that he is clearly and beyond a doubt not inadmissible as charged.
the bia affirmed that the ij had properly found abufayad inadmissible under a b i ii and removable to palestine 
as to the ij decision to grant abufayad protection under the cat,the bia agree d with the dhs that the ij engaged in speculation and relied on factual findings relating to the respondent entitlement to protection under the cat that are not clearly supported by the record.for example,the ij improperly found that israeli authorities were aware of the accusations lodged against abufayad as a hamas supporter and potential terrorist because it is not evident from agent miranda testimony that he provided the hamas expert or the israeli authorities with any information specifically identifying abufayad.the ij had also failed to cite any objective evidence that the pa would more likely than not identify abufayad as a hamas supporter,detain him,and torture him as a result.the bia therefore sustained the government appeal and ordered abufayad removed to palestine.
where the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and law rather than adopting the ij decision,our review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent that the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we review questions of law de novo.see hamazaspyan holder,cir.factual findings by the bia,including those underlying the bia decision that an applicant is not eligible for cat protection,are reviewed for substantial evidence.see id.at silaya mukasey,cir.to reverse the bia finding,we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion,but compels it ins.
an applicant for admission in a removal proceeding carries the burden to establish that he is clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section of this title.c a.an applicant is inadmissible under a b i ii if a consular officer,the attorney general,or the secretary of homeland security knows,or has reasonable ground to believe,that the applicant is engaged in or is likely to engage after entry in any terrorist activity,as defined in a b iv.the reasonable ground to believe standard in the removal context is similar to the probable cause standard.see malakandi holder,cir holding that reasonable grounds should be evaluated against a reasonable person,probable cause standard.where,as here,an applicant possesses a valid visa upon entry,constituting prima facie evidence of admissibility,the burden shifts to the government to submit some evidence that he is not admissible under the charged grounds kepilino gonzales,cir.if the government meets its burden by introducing reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence of inadmissibility,ins,cir,the applicant bears the burden of rebuttal in proving that he is clearly
