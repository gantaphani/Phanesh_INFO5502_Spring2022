opinion of the court 
tehram steve roye petitions for review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals the bia or the board ordering him removed from the united states based on his convictions for aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of a child.roye asserts that he is entitled to deferral of removal under the united nations convention against torture cat because,if removed to his home country,he will likely be imprisoned and,with the consent or acquiescence of the jamaican government,be subjected to torture by other prisoners and prison guards.because the bia erred in its review of roye claims,we will grant his petition for review,vacate the bia order of removal,and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
roye is a native of jamaica,who was admitted to the united states on april,as the spouse of a citizen.on april,he pled guilty in the pennsylvania court of common pleas to committing an aggravated assault,in violation of.a,and to endangering the welfare of a child,in violation of.the amended information to which he pled alleged that he had sexual intercourse by forcible compulsion with his old daughter.administrative record at.the trial judge sentenced roye to a term of six to twenty years imprisonment but strongly recommend ed that consideration be given to his immediate transfer into a psychiatric f acility.id.at.
fourteen years after roye pled guilty,the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice to appear nta,charging him as removable under ina a a iii,a a iii,because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony under a a.
roye application for deferral of removal 
roye subsequently filed,on february,a form i,application for asylum and withholding of removal,seeking deferral of removal under the cat.on that form,roye stated that he fear s rape and death if returned to jamaica,and that his mental illness gives rise to bizarre and criminal behavior that will make him a clear target for police officers and other inmates who sexually assault inmates with mental illnesses.at.
an immigration judge ij held a hearing on may,during which roye counsel presented three witnesses anne weidman testified that,after examining roye,she diagnosed him as having schizoaffective disorder,bipolar type.she said that the nature of roye condition was such that he would need to take medication for the remainder of his life,but she noted that roye often refused to take medication outside a treatment environment.id.at.weidman also observed that roye suffered manic and depressive episodes,and had incidents in which he set his cell on fire and became very sexually preoccupied id.at.
nancy anderson,an attorney who has practiced law in jamaica and who was a member of the independent jamaican council for human rights also testified during the hearing.she said that many mentally ill persons in jamaica are prosecuted for minor offenses and are incarcerated,often indefinitely.she also described the general experience of mentally ill inmates in jamaican prisons,indicating that they are frequently subjected to physical and sexual abuse by both fellow prisoners and prison officials.she said that the most prevalent abuse is sexual,but that mentally ill inmates also suffer other kinds of physical abuse because it is easy to inflict on someone who is on some medication.id.at.anderson believed that,if roye were returned to jamaica,he was likely to be incarcerated for an indefinite period of time if he arrested,and would be exposed to abuse by guards and other inmates while in prison.id.at.
anderson also testified regarding the extent to which jamaican prison officials are involved in the abuse of mentally ill prisoners.when asked to describe that involvement,anderson replied 
a lot of complaints are of ill treatment at the hands of these correctional officers or warders.
t hings are done that they must know about and they must be able to see,but they do nothing to prevent it or to assist the mentally ill inmates.there are some warders who will call me and say that this person is being abused,they do know by who,but i should come and have a look at the situation or i should send someone to speak to them,and but that those are few and far between.i really believe that i believe that some of the correctional officers themselves are abusing prisoners and a lot of them are turning a blind eye to what is going on.
wendel abel,a physician who worked with deportees with mental illness es for almost years id.at,and whose research involved looking at the impact of deportation on persons who are mentally ill and who have been deported to jamaica id.at,also testified during the hearing.he said that mentally ill prisoners in jamaica suffer physical abuse,both by prison staff and also other prisoner s,so much so that prison officials have had to separate the mentally ill from the remainder of the prison population.id.at.he also said that mentally ill prisoners are not allowed out at the same period of time as prisoners who are not mentally ill because the other prisoners will physically and sexually abuse them.id.at.
b.the ij june,decision 
on june,the ij found that roye was removable due to his felony convictions,but the ij granted roye request for deferral of removal under the cat.in that decision and order,the ij summarized the evidence of record,specifically detailing the testimony of anderson,abel,and weidman.he gave particular emphasis to the testimony of anderson and abel,noting that they verified that mentally ill detainees and prisoners are often sexually and physically assaulted in the jamaican prison system because of the nature of their mental illness id.at.he also credited anderson assertion that the high incident rate of sexual assaults against mentally ill detainees and prisoners is well known to the jamaican government who essentially refuses to take the necessary action to punish the guards responsible.id.
based on the evidence,the ij found that 
t he only reasonable and conclusion is that roye will be homeless in jamaica due to a lack of family ties there.he will decompensate due to a lack of needed medications for his behavior.he has a history of violence while off his medications,and even while on the medications,continues to exhibit behavior.roye at times refused to acknowledge his mental disease,and sometimes refuses to take his medicines.as abel opined,even in the best of circumstances,which are highly unlikely to prevail,roye will likely be detained in prison and thereby suffer sexual and physical assaults 
id.at.the ij also found that the evidence demonstrated that roye prospective persecutors would physically and sexually assault him with the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering,the goal or purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
c.the bia october,opinion and order 
the dhs appealed the ij order,arguing that the immigration court erred as a matter of law when it found roye will be subject to torture by or through the acquiescence of jamaican prison guards,if removed to jamaica.id.at.on october,the bia sustained the appeal and ordered roye to be removed.
based on its examination of the record,the bia concluded that roye had failed to meet his burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to jamaica,either through the government inflicting or instigating the feared torture,or because the government would consent or acquiesce to such torture.id.at.significantly,the bia credit ed the testimony of the three witnesses who testified at the may,hearing and accept ed their testimony as an accurate depiction of what likely would occur upon roye return to jamaica.id.at.however,even crediting that testimony,the bia determined that the evidence of record did not establish that the government of jamaica has the specific intent to torture roye,as required for a grant of deferral of removal under the cat.id.the bia explained that,even if jamaican government officials were to place roye in indefinite detention despite being aware that roye would be likely to suffer physical and sexual abuse in prison,as maintained by roye witnesses,such action would not,by itself,establish that they possess the motive or purpose of torturing roye.id.
the bia also rejected the assertion that the jamaican government would consent to or acquiesce in roye abuse by other prisoners or prison guards.in doing so,it explained that,under the governing law,to prove that roye will be tortured by or through the acquiescence of jamaican officials id.at,roye would have to do more than show that the officials are simply aware of the activity constituting torture yet are powerless to stop it id.at id.at stating that mere willful blindness to,or deliberate ignorance of,the tortuous acts of others is insufficient to constitute acquiescence by public officials internal quotation marks omitted.the bia went on to say that roye must show that the public official s,prior to the activity constituting torture,had awareness of such activity and thereafter breached their legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
on may,roye filed a petition for review of the order of removal and a motion seeking a stay of removal pending the resolution of that petition the government subsequently moved to remand the matter to the bia to allow the bia to reconsider roye petition in light of our decision in kaplun attorney general of the united states,cir.on june,we granted roye request to stay the bia order of removal,and on october,we granted the government motion to remand.
d.the bia may,opinion and order 
on remand,a divided bia again sustained the dhs appeal in its march,opinion,the bia observed that,under kaplun,the question of the future likelihood of torture is a mixed one,with both a factual component,what is likely to happen to the petitioner if he is removed and a legal one,does what is likely to happen amount to the legal definition of torture.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the bia decided that,under the standards articulated in kaplun,there was no clear error in the ij factual determination of what is likely to happen to roye if he is returned to jamaica,but the bia reaffirm ed its prior determination that what is likely to happen to roye upon his return to jamaica does not satisfy the legal definition of torture for purposes of granting deferral of removal under the cat.id.at.
it based that conclusion on its determination that,upon de novo review,the evidence does not establish that roye would be imprisoned by jamaican authorities for the specific purpose of torturing him.id.it said that,under pierre attorney general of the united states,cir en banc,proof of knowledge on the part of government officials that severe pain or suffering will be a practically certain result of an applicant detention does not satisfy the specific intent requirement of the cat.id.rather,the bia stated,the specific intent requirement requires an applicant to show that his prospective torturer will have the motive or purpose to cause him pain or suffering.id.the bia also rejected the assertion that jamaican prison officials would consent to or acquiesce in roye mistreatment.that conclusion was based on its understanding that the evidence roye offered that jamaican prison officials turn a blind eye to the physical and sexual abuse of mentally ill prisoners was insufficient to prove that the jamaican government possesses the requisite specific intent to torture roye see id.noting that mere willful blindness to,or deliberate ignorance of,the torturous acts of others is insufficient to constitute acquiescence by public officials internal quotation marks omitted.
roye timely petitioned for review of the bia march,decision 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
because the basis for roye removal is his conviction for an aggravated felony,our jurisdiction is limited under the real id act to constitutional claims or questions of law raised by his appeal.catwell att y,cir quoting a d.the phrase questions of law refers to purely legal inquiries such as those involved in statutory interpretation,jarbough att y,cir,or inquiries into whether the bia used the correct standard in reviewing the ij decision and whether the bia assigned to the petitioner the correct burden of proof,tran gonzales,cir.c onstitutional claims,constitute,at minimum,colorable violation s of the united states constitution.jarbough,at.f actual or discretionary determinations are outside of our scope of review.pierre,at.

iii.discussion 
roye petition for review requires us to answer the following legal questions whether the bia correctly applied the law in reviewing the ij finding that roye will be physically and sexually assaulted in a jamaican prison by prisoners and prison guards who specifically intend to cause him pain or suffering and whether the bia applied the correct legal standard in reviewing the ij finding that it is more likely than not that jamaican public officials will consent to or acquiesce in assaults on roye the answers to these questions turn largely on the language of the cat and its implementing regulations,as well as our precedents.
the cat prohibits any signatory state from expel ling,return ing or extradit ing a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,treaty doc.the treaty became binding upon the united states when president clinton delivered the ratifying documents to the in.doc.iv.it thereafter became the policy of the united states not to expel or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture silva rengifo att y,cir alterations in original quoting foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra,div,tit.xxii,stat.codified at note.
article i of the cat defines torture as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.it does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.

b.the physical and sexual abuse of mentally ill prisoners in jamaican prisons 
the ij stated that the widespread physical and sexual abuse of mentally ill inmates in jamaican prisons was specifically intended to cause severe pain and suffering.the bia did not disagree with that conclusion see at accepting that there was no clear error in the ij factual determination of what is likely to happen to roye if he is returned to jamaica,but went on to reject roye request for cat relief because,inter alia,roye had not demonstrated that he would be imprisoned by jamaican authorities for the specific purpose of torturing him,id.roye contends that it was error for the bia to focus on the intent of jamaican public officials who decide to imprison someone with mental illness,instead of focusing on whether the physical and sexual abuse that mentally ill prisoners experience is intended to cause pain and so may qualify as torture.he is correct.
during the may,hearing before the ij,roye offered the testimony of expert witnesses who opined that,if removed,he will be imprisoned and will be physically and sexually assaulted by guards and other inmates.specifically,roye offered the testimony of anderson,who said that mentally ill prisoners are frequently the victims of sexual abuse because they are easy targets for sexual predators,as well as the testimony of abel,who said that the physical and sexual abuse of mentally ill inmates in jamaican prisons is so pervasive that those inmates must be separated from the rest of the prison population id.at.the ij credited that testimonial evidence and concluded that,if removed,roye would indeed be imprisoned and subjected to physical and sexual abuse by people specifically intending to cause him severe pain and suffering.the bia,as noted,did not disagree with those factual findings.nevertheless,battling a strawman,it rejected roye cat claim based on the fact that there was no indication that roye would be imprisoned by jamaican authorities for the specific purpose of torturing him.id.
no one had raised the question of jamaican authorities intent regarding imprisonment because it is beside the point roye was endeavoring to make.yet that is where the bia chose to center its attention,saying,proof of knowledge on the part of government officials that severe pain or suffering will be a practically certain result of an applicant detention does not satisfy the specific intent requirement of the cat id.by concentrating its inquiry on whether the act of detaining mentally ill deportees is an act of torture,rather than on whether the physical and sexual abuse of mentally ill prisoners that occurs in jamaican prisons rises to the level of torture,the bia incorrectly analyzed roye claim for relief.thus,although the bia articulated the correct legal standard for specific intent in a cat case,see pierre,at holding that specific intent requires more than proof of knowledge on the part of government officials that severe pain or suffering will be the practically certain result of the actions challenged as torture,it applied it to the wrong question,ignoring the ij finding on specific intent and bypassing consideration of whether the physical and sexual assaults that roye is likely to experience during a term of incarceration in a jamaican prison rise to the level of torture under the cat.
by focusing on the intent of public officials who may decide to imprison roye,the bia failed to attend to roye actual argument regarding the intent of those who will likely assault him.that failure requires us to grant roye petition for review.
alleged consent to or acquiescence in acts of torture 
roye contends that he is also entitled to relief under the cat because jamaican officials have turned a blind eye to the pervasive assaults in their prisons and are thus consenting to or acquiescing in torture.he argues that,in this instance,the bia understood the question but applied the wrong legal standard.more specifically,he contends that the bia erred in holding that mere willful blindness to,or deliberate ignorance of,the torturous acts of others is insufficient to constitute acquiescence by public officials.petitioner br.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.roye also argues that the bia inappropriately conflated the mens rea necessary to prove that public officials consent to or acquiesce in acts of torture with the mens rea necessary to prove that public officials themselves have committed acts of torture.he is correct on both counts.
under the cat and its implementing regulations,in order to prove that a public official will consent to or acquiesce in torture,an alien must demonstrate that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,had awareness of such activity and thereafter breach ed his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.a.although that language suggests that public officials must have actual knowledge of torture for it to be said that they consent to or acquiesce in it,we held in silva rengifo that the cat definition of acquiescence includes both actual knowledge and willful blindness.at.we reasoned that a showing of willful blindness is sufficient to demonstrate government acquiescence in torture because e vidence that officials turn a blind eye to certain groups torturous conduct is no less probative of government acquiescence than evidence that such officials participate in acts of torture.id.at.thus,under silva rengifo,acquiescence to torture can be found when government officials remain willfully blind to torturous conduct and thereby breach their legal responsibility to prevent it.id.
here,the bia relied on a contrary understanding of the law.in its may,opinion,it accepted the ij factual finding that jamaican prison officials turn a blind eye to the physical and sexual abuse of mentally ill prisoners.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the bia also said,however,that willful blindness is insufficient to prove government consent to or acquiescence in torture.it thus concluded that roye had failed to demonstrate that jamaican public officials will,for purposes of the cat,be culpable for any assault he is likely to suffer in prison.that holding ignores the import of silva rengifo and was therefore error.
the error of applying an incorrect rule of law was compounded when the bia conflated the mens rea requirement pertaining to those who commit acts of torture,specific intent with the minimum mens rea requirement pertaining to those who consent to or acquiescence in acts of torture committed by others,willful blindness.as noted above,the bia acknowledged that the record contained evidence that jamaican officials deliberately ignore the rape of mentally ill prisoners.nevertheless,the bia said that evidence of the government willful blindness is insufficient to demonstrate that the jamaican government possesses the requisite specific intent to torture.id.at.the bia thus confused two distinct elements of a claim for relief under the cat,torture versus consent to or acquiescence in torture and further confused the mental states associated with each.see auguste,at explaining that an alien seeking relief under the cat must show both that severe physical or mental pain or suffering will be intentionally inflicted and that it will be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim.again,roye adduced evidence tending to prove that,if removed,he will be physically and sexually assaulted in prison and that jamaican prison officials will turn a blind eye to that severe mistreatment.instead of examining those two issues separately,as controlling precedent requires,see,the bia mixed them together,saying that evidence that the jamaican government is willfully blind to the mistreatment of mentally ill prisoners could not prove specific intent to cause pain and suffering merging those inquiries was an error of law that requires us to grant roye petition for review
