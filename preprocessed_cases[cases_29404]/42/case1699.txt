sylvia anita was convicted in the eastern district of virginia in of conspiracy to defraud the united states and four counts of immigration fraud.on appeal,challenges four of her five convictions,contending that the conduct underlying three of her immigration fraud convictions does not fall within the ambit of the governing statute,a and that the district court committed plain error when it named an unindicted in the jury instructions.as explained below,we reject these contentions and affirm.
during the relevant time period,was the sole practitioner in a district of columbia law practice called ryan webster.her work primarily involved the representation of aliens seeking permanent legal status in the united states through the process for issuance of permanent resident cards commonly called green cards one method for securing a permanent resident card is for an alien to first obtain immigrant status based on employment in the united states.under the evidence,systematically sought immigrant status for her clients as part of an immigration fraud scheme.that scheme,and particularly her use of fraudulent immigration documents,underlies the criminal convictions challenged in this appeal.
in order to properly assess contentions,we must possess an elementary understanding of the process through which aliens seek and secure immigrant status based on employment.pursuant to federal law,an alien seeking permanent legal status based on employment must utilize a process,involving the department of labor the dol,the department of state,and the immigration and naturalization service the ins 
first,an alien must have a prospective employer in this country,and that employer must petition the dol for a labor certification on behalf of the alien the dol administers its labor certification program through one of its agencies,the employment and training administration the eta when issued,a labor certification evidences the dol acknowledgment of two predicate facts sufficient united states workers are not able,willing,qualified,and available for a particular job and employment of a particular alien will not adversely effect the wages and working conditions of united states workers similarly employed.see a a i.in order to secure a labor certification,an alien prospective employer,or an attorney acting on its behalf,is required to file with the dol a form,application for alien employment certification certification application.if an attorney acts for the employer,the attorney is required to file with the dol an ins form,notice of entry of appearance as attorney or representative attorney appearance notice b.the certification application is analyzed by the dol and,if it satisfies the essential requirements,it is then certified and constitutes a valid labor certification.
in the second step of the process,the alien prospective employer,or an attorney acting on the employer behalf,is required to file with the ins the labor certification,along with a form,visa petition for prospective immigrant employee visa petition.an attorney representing the prospective employer in this second step must also file with the ins an attorney appearance notice see.a visa petition constitutes a request to the ins that the alien named in the labor certification be classified as eligible to apply for designation within a specified visa preference employment category.see b.if the ins approves the visa petition and classifies the certified alien as so eligible,the alien is assigned an immigrant visa number by the department of state.
the requirements for the final step of the green card process depend upon whether the certified alien,at the time of his application,resides inside or outside the united states.when a resident alien receives a visa number,he must file with the ins a form,application to adjust status green card application.the ins then considers the resident alien visa petition and green card application and determines whether to adjust the resident alien status.n.if the green card application is approved,the ins adjusts the status of the resident alien to that of a lawful permanent resident who is entitled to live and work in the united states.a.the ins then issues a green card to the immigrant evidencing his immigrant status.on the other hand,when a nonresident alien is assigned a visa number,he must then complete the application process for an immigrant visa.see id.a.upon completion of this process and receipt of ins approval,the nonresident alien receives an immigrant visa and is entitled to enter and work in the united states.sometime after entering the united states,the immigrant receives his green card from the ins.
in her law practice,specialized in securing permanent legal status for her alien clients through the process summarized above.under the evidence,in the typical situation,would file a certification application,together with an attorney appearance notice,with the dol,seeking a labor certification for an alien client and the alien purported prospective employer.upon issuance of a labor certification by the dol,would submit it to the ins on behalf of the purported prospective employer,along with a visa petition and an attorney appearance notice.would normally charge her alien clients approximately each for her work in this process.
developed a lucrative law practice in the representation of her alien clients.in order to expedite the process,she systematically forged the signatures of purported prospective employers on the certification applications and visa petitions filed with the dol and the ins because she filed attorney appearance notices with the dol and ins,purporting to represent prospective employers,the immigration authorities dealt exclusively with.
in february,was indicted in the eastern district of virginia for five felony offenses arising out of her immigration fraud scheme.in count of the indictment,she was charged under with conspiracy to defraud the united states by attempting to obtain,and by obtaining,by false statements,forgery and fraud,immigration benefits for aliens.in counts,and,was charged under a.the charges alleged in those three counts tracked the language of the first of the four unnumbered paragraphs of a.the first paragraph of a provides,in relevant part 
whoever knowingly utters,uses,or possesses any such visa,permit,border crossing card,alien registration receipt card,or other document prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the united states,knowing it to be forged,counterfeited,altered,or falsely made is guilty of a felony.

in april of,was tried before a jury in federal court in alexandria,virginia.nora,former office assistant,was a key government witness.in connection with count,testified that had signed the name james radcliffe,on behalf of collision,on approximately fifteen certification applications filed with the dol.radcliffe was also called as a witness,and he testified that he had neither signed those forms nor given permission to sign for him.each form reflected that the prospective alien employee lived outside the united states and intended to apply for an immigrant visa.in connection with count,testified that the name cecil lockhart on the relevant visa petition was signed by.lockhart,in his testimony,denied any knowledge of either this form or of mitra rezvani,the prospective alien employee for whom it was filed.the visa petition reflected that rezvani lived outside the united states and intended to apply for an immigrant visa.as to count,identified as having signed the name eliana noguchi on a certification application and on a visa petition filed on behalf of the little flower montessori school.in her testimony,noguchi denied any knowledge of these forms and of manik kadir,the prospective employee named thereon.the forms reflected that kadir resided in virginia and intended to petition for an adjustment of his alien status to that of an immigrant.the defense presented no evidence on behalf of.
at the conclusion of the evidence,sought judgment of acquittal on counts,and,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure in support of her rule motion,contended that a does not apply to the conduct underlying counts,and.more specifically,she asserted that certification applications and visa petitions do not constitute documents prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the united states the court denied motion.
prior to the jury deliberations,the court instructed the jury on the applicable legal principles.the court first instructed on the law of conspiracy under count of the indictment.in instructing the jury on the aspect of that count,the court advised,now,evidence has been received in this case that a person,nora,the defendant legal assistant,was a of the defendant and said things during the existence or life of the alleged conspiracy in order to further advance its goals.raised no objection to this part of the instructions.the court then instructed the jury on counts through.as to counts,and,the court explained that the government was obliged to prove each of three elements beyond a reasonable doubt first,that the defendant uttered,used,or possessed a document second,that the document was prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the united states and,third,that the defendant knew the document was forged and falsely made.also did not object to this instruction.
the jury found guilty on all five counts of the indictment.on august,the court sentenced to sixty months imprisonment on count and to concurrent terms of months on each of counts through.after filing her notice of appeal on august,filed an emergency pro se motion in the district court,seeking to vacate,set aside,or correct her sentence under.additionally,lawyers sought to withdraw from further representation,asserting that she would not communicate with them.during an august,hearing on these motions,again contended that her use of the fraudulent certification applications and visa petitions did not fall within the ambit of a.on that same day,the court entered an order rejecting this contention,denying her pro se motion as premature,and authorizing her trial lawyers to withdraw.united states.this appeal,with newly appointed counsel,followed in due course.
we review de novo a district court denial of judgment of acquittal.united states gallimore,cir citing united states romer,cir.additionally,our consideration of the ambit of a presents a question of law,which we also review de novo.united states buculei,cir citing village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.by contrast,we review for plain error an issue raised on appeal but not previously asserted in the district court,such as challenge to the jury instructions on count.see,b united states curry,cir.finally,in assessing the denial of a rule motion,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.see glasser united states.
in seeking reversal of her convictions on counts,and,does not contest the fact that the first and third elements of the a offense were proven,that is,that she knowingly uttered,used,or possessed a document,and that she knew the document was forged and falsely made.instead,her primary contention on appeal relates to the second element of a a offense.she maintains that the certification applications underlying counts and and the visa petitions underlying counts and do not qualify as other document s under a more specifically,she asserts that the certification applications and visa petitions are neither prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into the united states nor prescribed as evidence of an authorized stay or employment in the united states.
in assessing a statute scope,we first examine its plain language.united states sheek,cir statutory construction must begin with the language of the statute and the court should not look beyond that language unless there is ambiguity or unless the statute as literally read would contravene the unambiguously expressed legislative intent gleaned from the statute legislative history.see also united states buculei,cir.as explained below,certification applications and visa petitions fall within the plain language of a because they constitute documents prescribed by statute and regulation for entry into the united states 
first,the certification applications constitute documents prescribed by both statute and regulation for entry into the united states.pursuant to statutory mandate,an immigrant may not enter this country without a valid unexpired immigrant visa.a.the ins may not issue an visa unless the dol has previously issued a labor certification see id.b c an immigrant visa may not be issued to an immigrant until the consular office is in receipt of a determination made by the secretary of labor pursuant to the provisions of section a a of this title.id.a a i any alien who seeks to enter the united states for the purpose of performing skilled or unskilled labor is inadmissible,unless the secretary of labor has determined and certified to the secretary of state and the attorney general that i there are not sufficient workers who are able,willing,qualified,and available and ii the employment of such alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the united states similarly employed.pursuant to the dol regulations,an alien prospective employer must file a certification application with the dol before the dol can issue a labor certification.a a n employer who desires to apply for a labor certification on behalf of an alien shall file,signed by hand and in duplicate,a department of labor application for alien employment certification form.
pursuant to statute and the applicable regulations,it is clear that absent the filing of a certification application,the dol is unable to issue a labor certification without a labor certification,an immigrant can not obtain a valid visa and in the absence of an visa,an immigrant can not legally enter the united states for employment.a certification application is therefore a document prescribed by both statute and regulation for entry into the united states.as such,the district court did not err in denying request for judgment of acquittal on the charges relating to forged certification applications.
secondly,use of forged visa petitions,as alleged in counts and,also falls within the ambit of a,in that visa petitions are also prescribed by statute and regulation for entry into the united states.the ins limits the number of immigrants who may receive immigrant visas each year.see a allowing certain number of visas each fiscal year id.d specifying number of visas that may be issued.as such,an alien must be classified for employment purposes before receiving an immigrant visa.see id.b distributing visas allotted for workers among priority workers,members of professions holding advanced degrees or aliens of exceptional ability,skilled workers,professionals,and other workers,qualified special immigrants,and employment creation.and the regulations of the ins specifically prescribe that a petition to classify an alien must be filed on form,petition for immigrant worker.a emphasis added.
our analysis of whether a visa petition constitutes a document under a is simple absent the filing of a visa petition,an alien can not be classified by the ins absent classification by the ins,an alien can not obtain an visa and in the absence of an visa,an alien may not legally enter the united states for purposes of employment.accordingly,a visa petition constitutes a document prescribed by statute and regulation for entry into the united states,and the district court did not err in denying judgment of acquittal on the visa petition issue.
notwithstanding these seemingly simple analyses,maintains that,because neither a certification application nor a visa petition constitutes the ultimate document presented to immigration authorities for entry into the united states,neither falls within the ambit of a.she contends that certification applications and visa petitions alone are insufficient for entry into the united states and that an immigrant must ultimately obtain an immigrant visa.although accurately stated,this fact does not remove certification applications and visa petitions from the reach of a.certification applications and visa petitions may be insufficient,in and of themselves,to authorize entry into the united states,but they are plainly prescribed by law as prerequisites thereof.as explained above,absent the filing of certification applications and visa petitions,immigrant visas can not be issued by the ins.the fact that other documents may also be utilized by the authorities for entry purposes does not alter the statutory and regulatory mandates governing certification applications and visa petitions 
pursuant to the foregoing,the provisions of a are unambiguous,and the term other document s as used therein encompasses the certification applications and visa petitions at issue here.as such,our analysis of whether they are prescribed for entry into the united states must end,unless congress has clearly expressed an intent to the contrary.see buculei,at sheek,at.in this instance,congress has not expressed a contrary intent.instead,congress,in amending the statute in,expressed its intent to broaden the types of documents included within the reach of a.
prior to,a specifically encompassed visas,permits,and other documents required for entry into the united states.the supreme court had occasion to construe the predecessor statute in,and it did so narrowly.in united states,d,the court affirmed the reversal of defendant conviction under the predecessor a ruling that counterfeit alien registration receipt cards did not fall within its scope.the court interpreted a to include only a narrow class of entry documents,and it observed that,although an alien registration receipt card can sometimes be used by an alien to reenter the united states,its essential purpose is to identify the bearer as a lawfully registered alien residing in the united states.id.at.according to the court,t he language of denotes a very special class of entry whose primary raison is the facilitation of entry into the country.id.at.
in,congress amended a to expand its reach.significantly,congress replaced the phrase required for entry with the phrase prescribed by statute or regulation for entry,which is the operative terminology that we must assess.in doing so,congress expressed the clear intention of broadening the types of documents encompassed by a.see i,at explaining that amendments expanded types of documents within a,at same.as the fifth circuit explained in construing the amendments,congress expanded the proscription of the statute from being limited to required entry documents to any documents prescribed either by statute or by regulation for entry into the united states.united states osiemi,cir emphasis in original holding that counterfeit passports fall within prescribed language of a even though they are not always required for entry see also united states rahman,cir,cert.denied,d agreeing with osiemi that plain language of a encompasses foreign passports.in specifying documents prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into the united states,rather than just those documents required for entry,congress expanded a to include documents such as the forged certification applications and visa petitions underlying convictions.in such circumstances,the district court did not err when it denied judgment of acquittal as to counts,and 
next contends that the district court erred when it identified an alleged unindicted,not named by the grand jury,in its instructions to the jury.in instructing the jury,the court stated,without objection now,evidence has been received in this case that a person,nora,the defendant legal assistant,was a of the defendant and said things during the existence or life of the alleged conspiracy in order to further advance its goals.contends that this instruction constituted an impermissible and erroneous modification of a form instruction spelled out in a jury practice textbook.the form instruction provides that evidence has been received in this case that certain persons,who are alleged in the indictment to be,have done or said things during the existence or life of the alleged conspiracy in order to further or advance its goal s,grenig lee,federal jury practice and instructions ed emphasis added.contention on this point has two prongs that the court reference to by name undermined the jury role and that the court statement that evidence has been received that was a constituted a neon sign,effectively instructing the jury to find guilty.as explained below,this contention lacks merit and must be rejected.
first of all,because failed to object to this instruction at trial,we review her contention for plain error only.in order to award relief on a plain error contention,we must be able to identify an error,which is plain,which affects substantial rights,and which seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states brewer,cir quoting united states olano,d.because there was no error in the instruction complained of,the first prong of this test is not met,and we need not assess the other aspects of the plain error analysis.
in the circumstances of this trial,the court use of the witness proper name in its instruction to the jury was appropriate.as acknowledges,it was obvious under the evidence that was a indeed,she was the only employee at ryan webster during the fraud scheme.moreover,testified that she aided and assisted in falsifying certification applications and visa petitions.
finally,the instruction as given,that evidence has been received that was a,constituted permissible comment on the evidence by the trial court.as we have heretofore observed,the trial judge,in charging the jury,may comment upon the evidence,so long as it is also clear that the jury determines all matters of fact united states godwin,cir citing quercia united states.the court reference to constituted a fair characterization of the evidence,and the instruction did not express any opinion on whether the evidence was either convincing or sufficient.in these circumstances,the instruction was not erroneous,and this assignment of error must be rejected.
pursuant to the foregoing,we affirm convictions and sentence.
section a of title is a comprehensive statute that indisputably prohibits falsification of certification applications and visa petitions.this conduct is specifically and unambiguously proscribed by the fourth unnumbered paragraph of a,which prohibits persons from knowingly mak ing under oath,or penalty of perjury any false statement with respect to a material fact in any application,affidavit,or other document required by the immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereunder.a west supp emphasis added.the government,for reasons unknown,chose to charge only under the first paragraph of a,which makes it a crime knowingly to falsify any immigrant or visa,permit,border crossing card,alien registration receipt card,or other document prescribed by statute or regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay or employment in the united states.id.emphasis added.because i disagree with my colleagues conclusion that the forms that falsified here are other documents within the meaning of the first paragraph,i respectfully dissent from parts.and iv.of the panel opinion.i concur in the remainder of the opinion.
