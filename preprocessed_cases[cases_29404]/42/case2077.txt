petitioner gamil appeals from a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge ij opinion that failed to meet his burden of proof for establishing eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture,and holding that was eligible for removal due to a michigan state conviction for possession of a controlled substance.argues that he is not subject to removal because his prior conviction did not in fact involve a controlled substance and because his plea of guilty was withdrawn and his conviction vacated.argues further that the ij abused its discretion in declining to continue case,the ij breached a duty to inform that he was eligible for relief under immigration nationality act h,he was entitled to voluntary departure,and he had demonstrated that he was qualified for asylum,withholding of removal,and withholding under the convention against torture cat.
the government urges us to remand to the bia so that the agency may determine whether conviction for possession of khat constitutes possession of a controlled substance.in the alternative,the government argues that may not collaterally attack his state conviction the bia found correctly that petitioner conviction applied for immigration purposes this court lacks jurisdiction to consider requests for continuance and voluntary departure the ij did not err in failing to provide petitioner the opportunity to apply for a h waiver and has waived review of the denial of his petition for asylum,withholding of removal,and withholding under the cat.opposes a remand.
for the reasons stated below,we hold that a remand is unnecessary because challenge to his michigan state court conviction constitutes an impermissible collateral attack.because presents no other claims that would entitle him to relief,we deny the petition for review.
petitioner gamil,a native and citizen of yemen,was admitted to the united states on march,as a conditional resident because of his marriage to an american citizen.on december,was arrested in dearborn,michigan for possession of a controlled substance,after having been found selling khat at a dearborn area convenience store he pleaded guilty to the charge on july,and received a sentence of probation and a fine of.was discharged from probation on july,for the successful completion of his probationary requirements,and his case was dismissed.
on august,the former immigration and naturalization service,now the department of homeland security dhs,served with a notice to appear,charging him with removability,pursuant to a b i,based on his controlled substance conviction.responded by requesting asylum pursuant to,withholding of removal pursuant to b,protection under the cat,and,in the alternative,voluntary departure pursuant to.
after a hearing on his asylum petition,the ij rejected claim,finding that his petition was untimely because it was filed more than one year after his arrival to the united states.furthermore,the ij assuming that petition was petition was meritless because lacked credibility due to his failure to disclose an arrest for failure to obey a police officer,and he had failed to establish that he had suffered any past persecution while he lived in yemen.finally,the ij found that did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured upon his return to yemen.
appealed the ij decision to the bia.while his appeal was pending,counsel for filed a motion for withdrawal of guilty plea,for new trial,and for dismissal of charges with the dearborn trial court.the motion,which was premised explicitly on c e and f,stated,in pertinent part 
that on july,defendant gamil pled guilty to the charge of possession of a controlled substance,an apparent violation of dearborn city ordinance 
that defendant pled guilty on advice of his then counsel and received probation for months and was successfully discharged from probation on july st,
that defendant has complied with all the conditions set by this court and has not been subsequently arrested by any authority for any other violations of criminal law 
that grounds for holding defendant guilty of violating dearborn city ordinance do not otherwise exist independent of defendant plea of guilty,which he moves to withdraw forthwith 
that insofar as there are no other grounds for holding defend ant guilty of the charge listed above,it is therefore not equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.
the motion was granted without explanation on june.
the bia upheld the ij decision,agreeing that is statutorily ineligible for asylum because of his untimely application,that petitioner failed to meet his burden to establish by sufficiently consistent and credible testimony that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted on account of a protected ground,and that failed to meet his burden of proof to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to yemen.the bia,quoting from matter of pickering,i n bia,also rejected petitioner argument that the june,vacatur of his conviction rendered him ineligible for removal,explaining that had not demonstrated whether his plea of guilty was vacated for reasons solely related to rehabilitation or immigration hardships or on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.the bia further rejected claim that the ij erred in failing to continue his proceedings and that the ij erred in denying him the opportunity to apply for a waiver of inadmissability pursuant to.the bia did not address argument,raised in an august,motion for leave to file supplemental brief,that his conviction for possessing khat was not a violation of any law relating to a controlled substance under the controlled substances act csa.timely petitioned this court for review.
the dhs charged with removability pursuant to,which sets out the class of deportable aliens,including 
any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,is deportable.
a b i.spends the bulk of his brief on appeal arguing that khat is not a controlled substance under the csa,and therefore he is not removable under a b i 
the government urges us to remand to the bia so it may determine whether conviction qualifies him for removal,relying on the supreme court decision in ins ventura,d per curiam for support.in ventura,the supreme court held that it was error for the lower appellate court to address,without first allowing the bia to consider,the government claim that the petitioner did not qualify for asylum because conditions in his home country had improved to the point where no threat of persecution existed currently.id.at.the court concluded that the appellate court committed clear error by disregard ing the agency role,and observed that a court of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.id.at.internal quotation omitted.the supreme court explained the rationale that compelled remand to the bia 
generally speaking,a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands.this principle has obvious importance in the immigration context.the bia has not yet considered the changed circumstances issue.and every consideration that classically supports the law ordinary remand requirement does so here.the agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter it can evaluate the evidence it can make an initial determination and,in doing so,it can,through informed discussion and analysis,help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.
four years later,in gonzales thomas,d,the supreme court again held that remand is necessary where the bia fails to consider a petitioner claim under
