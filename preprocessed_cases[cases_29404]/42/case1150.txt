petitioner ke zhen zhao is a national of the people republic of china prc who seeks asylum in the united states on account of china one child policy.he appeals from the denial of his motion to reconsider his application after the board of immigration appeals board affirmed an adverse ruling by an immigration judge that rejected his asylum petition.respondents are the united states attorney general,the board,the office of immigration judges,the commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service ins and the district director of the ins.
when the immigration judge made the adverse ruling on petitioner asylum application,and the board denied his motion to reconsider its affirmance of that ruling,these administrative judges were exercising their discretionary authority.courts ordinarily defer to such discretionary administrative determinations,lest a court substitute a judicial view for an agency experience and expertise.but granting deference to administrative tribunals does not mean we have clothed their rulings with that kind of power expressed in the maxim the king can do no wrong.to the contrary,administrative tribunals are not royal judges,and their rulings are not unfettered instead they are constrained to decide cases in a manner.thus,when a court is persuaded in a given case,such as this one,that an administrator has acted arbitrarily or capriciously,the ordinary entitlement to judicial deference disappears.
background 
entry into the united states 
when zhao arrived in the united states on february,at honolulu international airport,he was questioned through an interpreter by an ins official.he acknowledged that he understood the questions asked him and admitted to using a false passport from korea under a false name.zhao said he obtained the passport in bangkok,thailand from a person unknown to him,and that while he paid to get to hawaii,his brother agreed to pay another upon his arrival in new york.petitioner told the ins official he came to the united states to find work.
that same day the ins served written notice on zhao that he would be subject to exclusion proceedings and possibly deportation.he was charged with intending to immigrate for employment purposes without certification from the secretary of labor,a a supp.v substantially unchanged from statute seeking entry into the united states through fraud,id.a c i supp.v same and lacking valid entry documents,id.a a i i supp.v same.after two years of adjournments,a hearing on those charges,at which petitioner had counsel,was held on february.
asylum application 
prior to that hearing,zhao had filed an application in september seeking asylum in the united states and the withholding of his deportation.in a statement attached to the application,he indicated he left china in november to escape the threats and persecution of the chinese communist government and to avoid imprisonment and sterilization as a consequence of my political views and supposedly activities regarding the government birth control policy.
according to petitioner,after his second son was born the government imposed a fine that he could not afford to pay.troops attempted to arrest him several times.when officials were called in to effect his arrest,imprisonment and forcible into hiding for three years.
he claimed in his application that were he to return to china,officials there would consider him guilty of two criminal and violating the birth control policy and leaving china without permission.as punishment,he anticipated being sentenced to prison or a labor camp and being forcibly sterilized.
exclusion proceedings 
the immigration judge who presided over petitioner exclusion hearing did so with the help of an interpreter.after petitioner conceded the charges lodged against him by the ins,the immigration judge turned the focus of the hearing to zhao asylum and withholding of deportation application.in support of that application zhao counsel filed copies of his marriage certificate,household registration booklet,birth certificate,resident for the people republic of china,and family planning policy registration card indicating that his wife underwent tubal ligation.the government,for its part,submitted petitioner false passport and his statement to the ins official on his date of entry into the united states.
only petitioner testified at the hearing.he stated that he had worked in construction for a private company in the fujian province of china.his wife became pregnant four times during their marriage.her first pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage.she gave birth to a son in.her third pregnancy was aborted due to health problems,and her fourth resulted in the birth of a second son in.
when asked whether he and his wife could have more children,zhao answered that his wife had been sterilized on september.referring to china policy of allowing only one child per family,he stated that his wife was ordered by the chinese government to undergo the sterilization procedure.the order was first in writing,but local officials came to their house later to tell her she had to go for the procedure.
petitioner claimed he voiced his opposition to the sterilization and promised not to have any more children,but described the officials as insistent that his wife be sterilized.zhao testified that he was fined yuan in about in dollars just prior to his wife sterilization procedure,but could not afford to pay that amount.he further testified that local officials tried to arrest him for his failure to pay the fine and because he had not immediately agreed to his wife having the procedure.petitioner escaped arrest by leaving the fujian province soon before his wife underwent sterilization.
on,he acknowledged that his primary reason for coming to the united states was to find work.he said that before flying to hawaii,he had worked for two years in nancheng,located in china jiangxi province,and then moved to the hunan province.but in hunan,he said he was not allowed to work for reasons supposedly linked to his opposition to the birth control policy.
the government also asked whether petitioner wife paid the fine levied against him.petitioner answered she did not have to pay because she was sterilized.upon being asked what he expected if he returned to china,zhao answered that he thought he would be arrested for violating the birth control policy,even though his wife had been sterilized.when questioned why he believed chinese officials were still after him,he explained that his wife and other contacts in china had so warned him.moreover,he explained that emigrants who returned to china are routinely arrested,punished and fined.
decision of the immigration judge 
upon the conclusion of petitioner testimony,the immigration judge admitted into evidence the state department general advisory comments regarding country conditions on asylum claims from chinese immigrants.he then rendered an oral decision in which he first ruled that with petitioner having conceded the charges alleged by the ins,excludability has been established by clear and convincing evidence.as such,zhao could remain in this country only if his asylum and withholding of deportation application were granted.
after summarizing petitioner hearing testimony,the immigration judge noted t he credibility of the applicant is of extreme importan ce in assessing his claim.the judge found petitioner testimony not to be credible insofar as it refers specifically to his application for asylum which in no way addresses any concern about his wife sterilization.he pointed out that the application made no mention of petitioner wife undergoing sterilization,even though petitioner submitted documentation showing she had undergone an oviduct ligation.the judge further highlighted the fact that when zhao arrived in the united states,he indicated his only purpose in immigrating was to find work.again,the judge observed that petitioner did not appear to have experienced troubles with the chinese government,as evidenced by the two years he spent working in nancheng.
referring to the report of the state department,he also noted that in rural areas of china,where petitioner lived,having two children seemed to be the norm and enforcement of the one child rule was less strict.the immigration judge concluded that the record did not show any incidents of past persecution,and petitioner had presented no evidence to establish a fear of future persecution upon his return to china.the immigration judge therefore denied petitioner application for asylum and withholding of deportation.
appeal to the board of immigration appeals 
petitioner filed a timely appeal from this ruling on march.over four years later,on august,the board issued its per curiam decision dismissing the appeal.the board recognized the law had changed since petitioner application had been denied.in particular,in the board had ruled that an alien whose spouse was forcibly sterilized could establish past persecution on account of political opinion,be presumed to have a fear of future persecution,and thereby qualify as a refugee eligible for asylum within the statutory definition,which had been amended in to so provide.see in re,wl,bia lexis bia june.although zhao hearing testimony had focused on his wife sterilization,the board summarily stated that it found substantial evidence to support the immigration judge adverse credibility findings and concluded that no basis existed for overturning that judge decision.
motion to reconsider 
petitioner filed a motion asking the board to remand his case to the immigration judge.the board returned that motion because the case was no longer pending before it,but advised zhao that he could file a motion to reopen or reconsider,if the time for doing so had not expired.proceeding with different counsel,zhao then filed a motion to reconsider on november.relief was sought on two grounds ineffective assistance of counsel and the production of additional evidence of his wife sterilization in the form of radioactive dye tests performed in may.
in a decision issued december,the board reasoned that because petitioner present motion did not identify a legal or factual error in the ruling dismissing his appeal,the motion was not properly brought as one for reconsideration.it therefore characterized the motion as one to reopen his case.turning to the merits of the ineffective assistance claim,the board found zhao had not satisfied the requirements for such a claim as set forth in in re lozada,bia.with respect to the radiographic dye tests,the board held that petitioner wife was already sterilized when he presented his claims to the immigration judge,and the immigration judge so found.in any event,the board continued,he may not now buttress his claim with a subsequent test when that test could have been conducted earlier and presented at the former hearing.thus,the motion to reopen was denied.
petitioner has appealed the denial of his motion to reopen,challenging only the board decision regarding the submission of additional evidence.
discussion 
i scope of our review 
before examining the merits of the appeal,we must define the extent to which the administrative proceedings may be reviewed in this court.in congress passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,div.c,stat,iirira or act.iirira,in pertinent part,repealed of the immigration and nationality act ina,which had provided for judicial review of deportation and exclusion orders.see iirira b,stat.at.
yet that repeal does not affect this case because under transitional provisions in iirira,which are not codified in the united states code,see id,stat.at,the final provisions pertaining to removal procedures shall not apply to an alien like petitioner who was in exclusion or deportation proceedings at the time the amendments took effect.id.c,stat.at.iirira c a explains that judicial review of final exclusion or deportation orders entered in such cases after october,is governed by ina a and c,a and c,as those subsections existed prior to the act amendments.hence,although petitioner seeks review of his motion for reconsideration,such review in a transitional case is still governed by the former.see iavorski ins,cir reviewing motions to reopen see also henderson ins,cir.
the version of instructed that any review sought with respect to a motion to reopen or reconsider a final exclusion or deportation order shall be consolidated with the review of the order.a.important for purposes of this case,this statutory provision was interpreted to mean that an appeal from a final order of exclusion or deportation and an appeal from a denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider that final order involved two separate petitions filed to review two separate final orders.stone ins,d.once petitioner exclusion order was affirmed by the board,it became final.see a b supp.v.under former a,petitioner had days to file a petition for review of the final order but he failed to do so,and his filing of a motion for reconsideration did not toll the time for filing a petition to review.stone,at.
thus,the appeal before us brings up for review only the board denial of the motion to reconsider.see anderson mcelroy,cir explaining that since petitioner failed to bring direct appeal from deportation order,only the board denial of a stay of deportation sought with a motion to reopen could be reviewed.because we are precluded from passing on the merits of the underlying exclusion proceedings,petitioner assertions that he received no due process at his hearing and that the immigration judge credibility determination was not based on substantial evidence are not before us.
ii motion to reopen motion to reconsider 
before examining the denial of the motion to reconsider,we pause to analyze petitioner challenge to the board conversion of his motion for reconsideration to a motion to reopen.the board has ruled that these motions are separate and distinct and are not interchangeable.see in re cerna,bia,quoting chudshevid ins,cir.
prior to iirira,regulations promulgated by the attorney general provided the only authority for filing a motion to reconsider or reopen a deportation proceeding.see ins doherty,d.section a of iirira,stat.at,added provisions to similar to those regulations then in effect.subsequently,the regulations were amended to reflect the changes in the statute.see inspection and expedited removal of aliens detention and removal of aliens conduct of removal proceedings asylum procedures,codified in part at.
nonetheless,the new statutory provisions in are subject to the already noted transitional rules of iirira and hence inapplicable to petitioner.although the transitional rules make no mention of regulatory authority,we need not decide whether the regulations apply to petitioner case,since the substantive content of the regulations preceding and iirira is substantially the same for purposes of this appeal.the version of the regulations is found in the federal register.see executive office for immigration review motions appeals in immigration proceedings motions appeals.the current version is found at.
under either version of the regulations,a motion for reconsideration must specify the errors of fact or law in the board decision and be supported with pertinent authority.b motions appeals.at.a motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the board previous decision an error was made.in re cerna,at.when the board reconsiders it takes itself back in time and looks at the case as though a decision had never been entered.thus,if it grants the motion,the board considers the case anew as it existed at the time of the original decision.id.by contrast,a motion to reopen asks that the proceedings be reopened for new evidence and a new decision,usually after an evidentiary hearing.id.at.such motions must state what new facts would be proven at a hearing and be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.see c motions appeals.at.
in the present case,petitioner motion included new evidence and asked for relief because proper documentation of a critical aspect of the applicant claim was not made.it therefore was correctly classified as a motion to reopen.the board also properly observed that the motion papers failed to identify a legal or factual error in its previous decision of august,as required for a motion to reconsider.
petitioner reasons that because he attached copies of the radioactive dye tests to his motion,the board should have deduced what he thought were the errors underlying the prior decision.but a motion for reconsideration asks the board to reevaluate its decision on the existing factual record.see in re cerna,at.further,the board itself has instructed that with respect to asylum claims based on coercive family planning policies,an applicant should file a motion to reopen.see in re,interim,wl,bia lexis,at bia june.thus,the board properly petitioner motion as one to reopen his deportation case.
iii legal landscape surrounding petitioner application 
definitions 
at all relevant times since zhao arrival in the united states in asylum has been a discretionary form of relief for which only refugees are eligible.see b supp.v modifying language formerly at a.refugee is defined to include any person who is unable or unwilling to return to his native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution based on any of five enumerated grounds race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a supp.v.withholding of deportation is a mandatory form of relief to which an alien is entitled only if the attorney general decides that such alien life or freedom would be threatened in his native country because of any of those same five grounds.b a supp.v modifying language formerly at h.the standard of proof for withholding deportation involves a showing of a clear probability of a threat to life or freedom,which is more stringent than that required for a claim of asylum.see melendez dep t of justice,cir.while these concepts have remained steadfast over time,a full understanding of the decisions leading up to this appeal and petitioner arguments before us requires a review of changes in the law.
in the immigration board held that china one child policy was not persecutory on its face.see in re chang,bia may.because of this ruling immigrants who simply claimed that they were subject to this policy could not be granted either asylum or have their deportation withheld.see id.at.instead,they had to produce evidence that persecution would be or was taken for a reason other than general population control.see id.
congress acts 
during the pendency of petitioner appeal to the board,congress in enacted iirira.that act added the following language to the definition of refugee 
for purposes of determinations under this chapter,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
in making this change in the statute congress had before it evidence that prompted it to act to change the law.this evidence was developed at congressional subcommittee hearings on the subject of coercive population control in china that were held in may,june,and july.see coercive population control in china hearings before the subcomm.on int l operations human rights of the house comm.on int l relations hearings,cong.the subcommittee chairman spread on the pages of the congressional record the findings derived from those hearings.
he noted that forced abortion and forced sterilization are among the most gruesome human rights violations,but that refugees fleeing such treatment from the people republic of china by coming to the united states had their asylum claims rejected by the ins.cong.rec.statement of smith,chair,house subcomm.on int l operations human rights.these women were forced back to china because they were regarded as common criminals and treated accordingly.the ins,by adopting in a policy of denying asylum to those fleeing forced sterilization,had reversed a policy of granting asylum to such refugees,if they could prove a fear that they were subject to a violation of their fundamental human rights.hearings,cong.statement of smith.
the people republic of china has repeatedly cracked down on those who resist forced sterilization.it treats them as political and ideological criminals,and as enemies of the state.on that rationale,the prc has inflicted harsh punishment on refugees who are returned,such as beatings and being sent to forced labor camps,and being sentenced to prison.cong.rec.it was on this record that congress amended the definition of refugee.
following iirira,the board acknowledged that the act retroactively superseded the view expressed in in re chang,and held that an alien forced to undergo sterilization pursuant to a population control program should be deemed to have suffered past persecution on account of political opinion and was thereby entitled to the regulatory presumption of a fear of future persecution.see in re,wl,bia lexis,at bia.the next year the board ruled in in re that an alien can establish past persecution and become entitled to the presumption of a fear of future persecution if he can show that his spouse was forced to undergo sterilization.wl,bia lexis,at.these amended administrative standards were in effect when the board ruled on petitioner appeal and his motion to reconsider in and respectively.
iv denial of petitioner motion 
zhao motion to reopen his case was denied on the ground that evidence of the radioactive dye tests could have been presented at the exclusion hearing.that decision by the board may be reversed only upon our finding that it abused its discretion.ins abudu,d.an abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the board decision provides no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,douglas ins,cir,is devoid of any reasoning,or contains only summary or conclusory statements,anderson,at that is to say,where the board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
in taking issue with the denial of his motion,zhao contends the decision was arbitrary because with respect to the question of whether his wife was sterilized,the board stated the immigration judge so found.yet,it further ruled his application could not be buttress ed with the results of radioactive dye tests that the board concluded could have been conducted earlier and presented at the exclusion hearing.once the board recognized his wife sterilization,petitioner insists,it was obliged to apply iirira and the holding of in re.
respondents,including the board,believe petitioner is reading the board language out of context.first,they describe the immigration judge decision as simply reciting what petitioner had asserted at the hearing,without actually determining whether zhao wife was in fact sterilized.second,insofar as the board stated that petitioner wife was already sterilized at the time of the hearing,respondents consider the board to have ruled only that the radioactive dye tests did not relate to new matter because petitioner had submitted evidence and testified to her sterilization at the hearing.
for all of the reasons that follow,no matter how one construes the board reference to what the immigration judge found at the exclusion hearing,it was an abuse of discretion to deny petitioner motion to reopen.
accepting petitioner interpretation 
the plain meaning of the language used to deny zhao motion supports his argument that the board was recognizing a finding of fact.if the board were to have considered the fact of sterilization established,then,because it was explicitly crediting petitioner testimony and evidence on this point for the first time,the board should have explained why zhao case would not be reopened in light of in re.that case and this are very more so than the board in in re,both asylum and withholding of deportation were conditionally granted.
in re involved a claim for asylum based on china family planning policy.wl,bia lexis,at.the app
