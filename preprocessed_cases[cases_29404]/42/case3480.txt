petitioner flavio nunez reyes,a native and citizen of mexico,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision denying his application for cancellation of removal.we deny the petition.in the course of doing so,sitting as an en banc court,we overrule our equal protection holding in lujan armendariz ins,cir.we also conclude that,in light of the equities and other considerations,we will apply today new rule only prospectively.
factual and procedural history 
petitioner entered the united states in.in,he was charged in state court with one felony count of possession of methamphetamine,in violation of california health and safety code section a,and one misdemeanor count of being under the influence of methamphetamine,in violation of california health and safety code section a.he pleaded guilty to both counts,but the state court eventually dismissed the charges under california penal code section e,held unconstitutional in other part by gardner schwarzenegger,d.under that provision,the state court shall set aside the conviction and dismiss the indictment if the defendant successfully completes a drug treatment program and meets other conditions.code e.e xcept as provided in other subsections,both the arrest and the conviction shall be deemed never to have occurred.id.
in early,the federal government issued a notice to appear,charging petitioner with being removable.petitioner conceded removability but applied for adjustment of status and cancellation of removal.the immigration judge ij denied all forms of relief and ordered petitioner removed.the ij held that the state convictions rendered petitioner ineligible for any form of relief even though the state court later had dismissed the convictions.the bia affirmed the ij decision.
petitioner timely petitioned for review.a panel granted the petition because of our rule,first announced in lujan armendariz,that equal protection requires us to treat the expungement of a state conviction for simple possession in the same manner as the expungement of a federal conviction for simple possession.nunez reyes holder,cir per curiam.judge graber wrote separately to state reasons why we should revisit the rule announced in lujan armendariz.see id.at graber,concurring citing rice holder,cir ikuta,concurring arguing that we should revisit this rule ramirez altamirano holder,cir ikuta,dissenting same dillingham ins,cir fernandez,dissenting suggesting that the lujan armendariz rule is incorrect but concluding that,for purposes of this case,that is neither here nor there.

standard of review 
we review de novo the bia determination that a controlled substance conviction precludes immigration relief as a matter of law.ramirez altamirano,at.
discussion 
a.we overrule lujan armendariz.
does a conviction for a drug crime,later expunged by the state court,nevertheless constitute a conviction for federal immigration purposes history has provided an answer to that question.see in re o t,yes in re a f,att y no in re werk,yes,in some circumstances garberding ins,cir no in re manrique,b.no.against that backdrop,in,congress enacted significant changes to our immigration laws,which included a new definition of the term conviction.a a 
in lujan armendariz,we addressed the effect of the new definition on a petitioner expunged state conviction for a drug crime.we began by considering whether a federal conviction,later expunged under the federal first offender act ffoa,nevertheless constitutes a conviction for immigration purposes.importantly,the ffoa mandates that a successfully expunged federal conviction shall not be considered a conviction for the purpose of a disqualification or a disability imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,or for any other purpose.b emphases added.we thoroughly examined the apparent conflict between the quoted text of the ffoa and the new definition of conviction.lujan armendariz,at.
but we relegated to a footnote a very important additional step in the analysis did congress have a rational basis for distinguishing between expunged federal convictions and expunged state convictions we answered as follows ins counsel offered no reason,and we can not conceive of any,why congress would have wanted aliens found guilty of federal drug crimes to be treated more leniently than aliens found guilty of state drug crimes.id.at.our brief analysis of this important issue is understandable in light of the government silence.but we now are persuaded that we erred 
since our decision in lujan armendariz,the bia and every sister circuit to have addressed the issue eight in total have rejected our holding.in re salazar regino,en banc wellington holder,cir per curiam,cert.denied,june,danso gonzales,f d,cir ramos gonzales,cir resendiz alcaraz att y,cir elkins comfort,cir acosta ashcroft,cir vasquez velezmoro ins,cir herrera inirio ins,cir.the bia held 
after considering the analysis set forth in lujan armendariz,we decline to apply the ruling in that decision to cases arising outside of the jurisdiction of the ninth circuit.we therefore conclude that,except in the ninth circuit,a simple drug possession offense expunged under a state rehabilitative statute is a conviction under the immigration laws.
in re salazar regino,at.
having reconsidered the issue,we now agree with the bia and our sister circuits.a very relaxed form of rational basis review applies to this inquiry f ederal classifications based on alienage are subject to relaxed scrutiny.federal classifications distinguishing among groups of aliens thus are valid unless wholly irrational.garberding,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also abebe mukasey,cir en banc per curiam congress has particularly broad and sweeping powers when it comes to immigration,and is therefore entitled to an additional measure of deference when it legislates as to admission,exclusion,removal,naturalization or other matters pertaining to aliens,cert.denied.that standard easily is met here.the third circuit put it well 
familiar with the operation of the federal criminal justice system,congress could have thought that aliens whose federal charges are dismissed under the ffoa are unlikely to present a substantial threat of committing subsequent serious crimes.by contrast,congress may have been unfamiliar with the operation of state schemes that resemble the ffoa.congress could have worried that state criminal justice systems,under the pressure created by heavy case loads,might permit dangerous offenders to plead down to simple possession charges and take advantage of those state schemes to escape what is considered a conviction under state law.particularly in view of congress power in immigration matters,it seems plain that review is satisfied here.
acosta,at.another rational basis exists as well 
not all states permit expungement.a person convicted in such a state would be ineligible for relief under the immigration laws,whereas a person convicted in a different state would be eligible.congress reasonably could have concluded that,in the strong interest of uniformity,it would not recognize any state expungements rather than adopt a piecemeal approach.
nunez reyes,at graber,concurring.
in conclusion,we hold that the constitutional guarantee of equal protection does not require treating,for immigration purposes,an expunged state conviction of a drug crime the same as a federal drug conviction that has been expunged under the ffoa.we therefore overrule lujan armendariz holding to the contrary.by necessity,we also overrule the same holding in those cases that,bound by stare decisis,followed the rule we announced in lujan armendariz.those cases include romero holder,cir ramirez altamirano,dillingham,and cardenas uriarte ins,f d cir 
b.we will apply our decision prospectively only.
having decided to overrule lujan armendariz,we next consider whether to apply the new rule of law only prospectively.the default principle is that a court decisions apply retroactively to all cases still pending before the courts.federal courts may depart from that default principle only in certain circumstances,as outlined in chevron oil huson.below,we first explain that the chevron oil test remains good law,at least in cases,such as this one,where we announce a new rule of law not affecting our jurisdiction.balancing the three factors described in chevron oil,we conclude that we will apply our decision only prospectively.
the chevron oil test applies.
the circumstances that justify a deviation from the normal rule of retroactivity have a long jurisprudential history.in the criminal context,the supreme court originally held that prospective application was appropriate in some circumstances.linkletter walker.but the court later overruled linkletter in favor of a rule in criminal cases,any new rule of law must be applied retroactively.griffith kentucky.
in the civil context,the supreme court originally announced a test of general applicability in chevron oil.under the chevron oil test,equitable considerations in some circumstances warrant prospective application of a new rule of law.but the court has limited,in two relevant ways,the circumstances in which the chevron oil test applies.
first,a court announcing a new rule of law must decide between pure prospectivity and full retroactivity what justice souter termed selective prospectivity,in which courts weighed the equities on a basis,is foreclosed.james beam distilling georgia,souter,plurality op.see reynoldsville casket hyde,harper.dep t of taxation,when the supreme court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review crowe.bolduc,cir in a civil case,then,a court announcing a new rule of law has only two available options pure prospectivity or full retroactivity.
second,in cases in which the new rule of law strips the courts of jurisdiction,the courts must apply that new rule of law retroactively.see united states ex rel.haight catholic healthcare,cir.citing united states ex rel.eisenstein city of new york.bowles russell,cert.denied.felzen andreas,cir citing christianson colt indus.operating.equitable considerations are altogether irrelevant when a court lacks adjudicatory power.felzen,at.
we glean from this jurisprudential history the following rule of law we apply the test outlined in chevron oil in a civil case when we announce a new rule of law,as distinct from applying a new rule that we or the supreme court previously announced and when the new rule does not concern our jurisdiction.see,george camacho,cir en banc 
like some of our sister circuits,we acknowledge that the supreme court reasoning in cases such as harper could support a conclusion that the chevron oil test no longer applies in any circumstances all new rules of law must be applied retroactively.see,kolkevich att y of,n cir observing that,as some commentators have noted,it is unclear whether we have the power to apply a new rule of law prospectively in light of harper,but not reaching the issue fairfax covenant church fairfax cnty.sch,cir noting that,in harper,the supreme court cast serious doubt upon the continuing vitality of the chevron oil test.but the supreme court has not overruled the chevron oil test in the circumstances described above.see glazner glazner,cir en banc although prospectivity appears to have fallen into disfavor with the supreme court citing harper,james beam,and griffith,the court has clearly retained the possibility of pure prospectivity and,we believe,has also retained the chevron oil test,albeit in a modified form,as the governing analysis for such determinations in civil cases.fairfax covenant church,at we are struck,however,by the notable absence in harper of any statement that chevron oil is overruled but see hulin fibreboard,cir concluding,in dictum,that t he court most recent decisions leav e only an indistinct possibility of the application of pure prospectivity in an extremely unusual and unforeseeable case.as a circuit court,even if recent supreme court jurisprudence has perhaps called into question the continuing viability of its precedent,we are bound to follow a controlling supreme court precedent until it is explicitly overruled by that court.united states weiland,cir citation omitted see rodriguez de quijas.express,if a precedent of this court has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to this court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.we therefore remain bound by chevron oil.for that same reason,every court to have decided the issue has concluded that chevron oil continues to apply.see crowe,at applying the chevron oil test glazner,at same see also shah pan am.world,cir same.following our sister circuits and our previous holdings,we too will apply the chevron oil test when all three of the requirements described above are met.
in this civil case,we announce a new rule of law that does not concern our jurisdiction.the chevron oil test applies.
balancing the chevron oil factors,we will apply the new rule only prospectively.
the three chevron oil factors are whether the decision establish es a new principle of law whether retrospective operation will further or retard the rule operation in light of its history,purpose,and effect and whether our decision could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively.at internal quotation marks omitted.there is no question that our decision today establish es a new principle of law by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied.id.at.lujan armendariz clearly announced the rule that equal protection required that we treat expunged state drug convictions as we do expunged federal drug convictions.just as clearly,we overrule that holding today.
further,amici assert and the government does not dispute that,because of the clarity and consistent application of lujan armendariz for more than a decade,aliens and their counsel have acted in reliance on lujan armendariz.according to amici,aliens often have pleaded guilty to minor drug crimes and have completed drug treatment in order to have their convictions expunged all in reliance on lujan armendariz promise that doing so would spare them from adverse immigration consequences.
there can be little doubt that,as a general matter,alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.ins cyr,d eportation is an integral part indeed,sometimes the most important part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.padilla kentucky,footnote omitted.preserving the client right to remain in the united states may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.id.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.accordingly,the threat of deportation may provide the defendant with a powerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does not mandate that penalty.id.at.
our decision in lujan armendariz provided clear assurance that expungement after a plea of guilty to the state crime of simple drug possession would insulate the alien from adverse immigration consequences.even if the defendant were not initially aware of lujan armendariz,competent defense counsel,following the advice of numerous practice guides,would have advised him concerning the decision importance,at.indeed,in a situation similar to this one,where the immigration consequences are succinct,clear,and explicit,the supreme court has held that an alien counsel who fails to inform the alien of those consequences has provided ineffective assistance.padilla.at.
after our decision today,alien defendants will know that an expunged conviction for simple possession will have adverse immigration consequences those aliens will be able to make a fully informed decision whether to plead guilty or to exercise their constitutional rights,such as the right to trial by jury.see cyr,at in exchange for some perceived benefit,defendants waive several of their constitutional rights including the right to a trial and grant the government numerous tangible benefits.
for those aliens who relied on lujan armendariz,however,t he potential for unfairness in the retroactive application of today decision is significant and manifest.cyr,u.at.those aliens were assured that,after completion of drug treatment,there would be absolutely no legal consequences.their waiver of their constitutional rights was in reliance on lujan armendariz.in these circumstances,we easily conclude that the third chevron oil factor is met our decision could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively.chevron oil,at.it would be manifestly unfair effectively to hoodwink aliens into waiving their constitutional rights on the promise of no legal consequences and,then,to hold retroactively that their convictions actually carried with them the particularly severe penalty of removal,padilla.crowe,at we think that it would be patently unfair to subject a party to a forfeiture for assiduously following binding circuit precedent.wagner daewoo heavy indus.am,cir en banc it would be inequitable to punish those parties for following the clearly established precedent of this circuit.
for similar reasons,we conclude that the second chevron oil factor is met in light of the rule history,purpose,and effect,retroactive application will not further the rule operation.u.at.as we now make clear,congress intended that convictions for simple possession have adverse immigration consequences.at first glance,it may appear that retroactive application of today decision would further that purpose.after all,the convictions occurred,and congress intended that such convictions have adverse immigration consequences.
but congress did not intend adverse immigration consequences for those who were merely charged with a crime or suspected of a crime congress intended such results only for those who were duly convicted,with all the constitutional protections of our criminal justice system.relevant here,we think it is a reasonable assumption that congress intended adverse immigration consequences only for those who were convicted either after the exercise of their constitutional rights,such as the right to trial,or after an informed waiver of those constitutional rights.as discussed above,many alien defendants fell into neither category.instead,they pleaded guilty and waived their constitutional rights with a wholly uninformed understanding of the consequences of their plea.contrary to their understanding that there would be no immigration consequences,the actual consequence is the severe penalty of removal.nothing in the statute or its history,purpose,or effect suggests that congress intended adverse immigration consequences for those whose waiver of constitutional rights turned out to be so.indeed,the supreme court has instructed that such a gross misunderstanding of the immigration consequences of a plea,when caused by incompetent counsel,rises to the level of a constitutional violation.padilla.at.we conclude that retroactive application of our decision today will not further the purposes of the immigration laws.
weighing the chevron oil factors,we hold that our decision today will apply only prospectively.glazner,at if this were truly a situation where the class of persons affected by the new rule would suddenly face a strong likelihood of liability when they faced no possibility of liability before,we would be inclined to view the equities as weighing heavily in favor of pure prospective application.for those aliens convicted before the publication date of this decision,lujan armendariz applies.for those aliens convicted after the publication date of this decision,lujan armendariz is overruled.
c.we nevertheless deny the petition in this case.
because our decision applies only prospectively,we apply the rule announced in lujan armendariz to the petition for review in this case.in lujan armendariz,we held that an expunged conviction for simple possession did not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes.in later cases,we held that an expunged conviction for a lesser offense to simple possession also did not constitute a conviction for immigration purposes.ramirez altamirano,at cardenas uriarte,at.in those cases,it was clear that the conviction was for a lesser offense because the alien was convicted of a single crime that carried a lesser penalty than the crime of simple possession.see ramirez altamirano,at the structure of the alien plea agreement obviously was intended to minimize his culpability by allowing him to avoid facing the more serious drug possession charge,and reflects the state view as to the seriousness of the offense.
here,however,petitioner was convicted of being under the influence of methamphetamine.being under the influence is not a lesser crime than simple possession.although we have held that possession of paraphernalia is a lesser crime than possession of a drug itself,at least where the defendant pleaded down from an original charge of simple possession,cardenas uriarte,at,being under the influence is not a possession crime at all,and it is thus qualitatively different from any federal conviction for which ffoa treatment would be available.being under the influence is not a lesser offense to simple possession because it arguably is more serious than mere possession being under the influence alters one sober state of mind and carries an immediate risk of dangerous behavior,which mere possession does not necessarily create.for example,one could foolishly agree to hide drugs for a friend,which does not create an immediate risk of dangerous behavior.we therefore overrule rice holder,f d cir the bia did not err.
petition denied.
in overruling the equal protection holding of lujan armendariz ins,cir,see op.at,the majority corrects a longstanding error in our case law,and i concur in both its reasoning and its result.having corrected one error,however,the majority then commits another,holding that its overruling of lujan armendariz will apply prospectively only.because the majority fails to heed the supreme court warning that prospective decisionmaking is appropriate if ever only in certain circumstances that are not present here,i respectfully dissent from parts b and c of the majority opinion.
in harper virginia department of taxation,the supreme court most recent opinion on the prospective application of judicial decisions,the court expressed grave concerns about whether prospective decisionmaking is ever permissible.harper represents only the latest in a series of supreme court decisions that have severely curtailed the power of courts to engage in prospective decisionmaking and have articulated a more traditional view of the judicial power.see am.trucking ass ns,smith,scalia,concurring in the judgment t he judicial role is to say what the law is,not prescribe what it shall be.see also agostini felton,our general practice is to apply the rule of law we announce in a case to the parties before us we adhere to this practice even when we overrule a case.citation omitted.
the supreme court began experimenting with prospective decisionmaking during the.in linkletter walker,the court created a doctrine under which courts could deny retroactive effect to a newly announced rule of criminal procedure.in chevron oil huson,it established a similar doctrine for civil cases.over the next decade or so,the supreme court applied both of these doctrines in a number of cases,justified by a range of rationales of varying strength.see james beam distilling georgia beam,citing cases united states.johnson,same.
the court return to a more traditional view of judicial power began with united states johnson.expressing dissatisfaction with its prior jurisprudence and declaring that r etroactivity must be rethought,johnson,at quoting desist united states,harlan,dissenting internal quotation marks omitted,johnson cut back on linkletter by holding that subject to certain exceptions a decision of th e supreme court construing the fourth amendment is to be applied retroactively to all convictions that were not yet final at the time the decision was rendered.id.at.it was left to griffith kentucky,however,to bring the era of criminal to a close.in griffith,the court overruled linkletter and held that a new rule of criminal procedure is to be applied retroactively to all cases,state or federal,pending on direct review or not yet final,with no exception s.id.at.in explaining its decision,the court stated that the linkletter doctrine violated two of the basic norms of constitutional adjudication.id.at.first,it violated the nature of judicial review because it allowed a court to decide on a new rule of law but then refuse to apply that rule to all similar cases pending on direct review.id.at.second,linkletter selective application of new rules violate d the principle of treating similarly situated parties the same.id.
it is true that griffith left the civil doctrine of chevron oil untouched.see id.at.however,the court subsequently expressed doubts about the viability of in the civil context,as well.see beam,six justices disapproving of selective nonretroactivity in the civil context am.trucking ass ns,five justices rejecting the plurality civil nonretroactivity analysis.
the justices misgivings regarding in the civil context found expression in the court opinion in harper.justice thomas,in his opinion for the court,stated 
beam controls this case,and we accordingly adopt a rule that fairly reflects the position of a majority of justices in beam when this court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events,regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule.
harper,at.the court explained that it was imposing this rule to further the same basic norms of constitutional adjudication that had caused it to eliminate nonretroactivity in the criminal context in griffith.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court noted that the general rule of retrospective effect for judicial decisions has governed j udicial decision making for near a thousand years.id.at quoting kuhn fairmont coal,holmes,dissenting.in direct contrast to this general rule,the power to make rules of law retroactive or prospective as one see s fit is quintessentially a legislative prerogative.id.at see also griffith,at in truth,the court assertion of power to disregard current law in adjudicating cases before us that have not already run the full course of appellate review,is quite simply an assertion that our constitutional function is not one of adjudication but in effect of legislation.quoting mackey united states,harlan,concurring in the judgment internal quotation mark omitted.thus,harper said,courts ha ve no more constitutional authority in civil cases than in criminal cases to disregard current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differently.at quoting am.trucking ass ns,at stevens,dissenting internal quotation mark omitted.
although the reasons for severely limiting decisionmaking are clearly set out in harper,the court did not expressly overrule chevron oil see id.we therefore must continue to consider chevron oil where we are announcing a new rule of law for the first time and the parties have fairly raised the issue see agostini,at.harper nonetheless strongly indicated that purely prospective application of a new rule is disfavored even in this situation.in light of harper disapproval of the principle of nonretroactivity,we should interpret the chevron oil exception to retroactivity as a narrow one and avoid expanding its application.
chevron oil sets forth three factors we must consider when determining whether a decision should be applied prospectively only.when narrowly construed,as required by harper,these factors do not clearly support applying our decision overruling lujan armendariz indeed,one factor weighs heavily against a application.in addition,both practical and jurisprudential considerations strongly encourage compliance with the supreme court preferred approach of full retroactivity.
the first factor in the chevron oil test is whether the decision to be applied nonretroactively establish es a new principle of law,either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied,or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.chevron oil,at citation omitted.construed narrowly,this first factor aims at identifying those judicial decisions that unexpectedly enunciate a novel principle of law which may unfairly take litigants by surprise.our abrogation of lujan armendariz does not meet this criteria instead,it brings our circuit in line with the rest of the nation.lujan armendariz has long been an outlier in the context of national immigration law as noted by the majority,since it was decided,the bia and every sister circuit to address the issue eight in total have soundly rejected its holding maj op.at.given this context,the majority decision hardly establishes a new principle of law.chevron oil,at.to the contrary,the demise of lujan armendariz at the hands of congress,the supreme court,or the en banc ninth circuit has been clearly foreshadowed.id.because the majority is taking the unsurprising step of conforming our case law to the rest of the nation rather than adopting an unanticipated new legal rule,this factor does not weigh heavily in favor of application of its decision.
the second factor requires us to weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question,its purpose and effect,and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.id.at this factor strongly supports retrospective operation.
as the majority acknowledges,congress enactment of a broad definition of conviction in iirira,see a a,clearly expressed its intent that convictions for simple possession have adverse immigration consequences even if those convictions are later expunged by the state courts.op.at.in holding that such a result would violate the equal protection rights of aliens convicted of state offenses,lujan armendariz frustrated the realization of congress intent.today,the majority announces that,contrary to lujan armendariz,the constitutional guarantee of equal protection does not require treating,for immigration purposes,an expunged state conviction of a drug crime the same as a federal drug conviction that has been expunged under the ffoa.op.at.this ruling finally frees immigration judges,the bia,and this court to apply a a as congress intended and as it has been applied for over a decade outside the ninth circuit.by overruling lujan armendariz only prospectively,however,the majority further delays giving effect to a law that congress enacted over ten years ago,even while the majority repudiates lujan armendariz equal protection analysis.the only reasonable conclusion is that the delay caused by this prospective application retard s the operation of the majority new rule.see chevron oil,at.
the majority contrary conclusion is based on its assumption that congress could not have intended to apply the statute to aliens who may have waived their constitutional rights in reliance on our erroneous precedent.see op.at.this assumption,of course,arises solely from the majority belief that congress would balance the equities the same way it does.but we must discern congress intent from the language of the statutes it enacts,not from our own perspectives on policy.see united states gonzales,noting that where the straightforward language of a statute leaves no room to speculate about congressional intent,courts should not carve out statutory exceptions based on judicial perceptions of good policy.there is no support in the statute for the majority claim that retroactive application will not further the rule operation.op at.indeed,by substituting its own intent for that of congress,the majority usurps congress legislative prerogative to make its enactments retroactive or prospective as it see s fit,harper,at,and effectively eliminates chevron oil second factor for any case where a statute is involved because a court can always impute its own views on equity to congress.this approach is contrary to chevron oil and also expands its scope,contrary to harper.
the third factor instructs us to inquire whether our decision could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively.chevron oil,at internal quotation marks omitted.given the diversity of relief provided by state expungement statutes,including statutes that allow expungement even when an alien is convicted of drug offenses at trial,see,code,e,it is impossible to know the extent to which aliens waived their constitutional rights in reliance on lujan armendariz.see op.at.but even assuming that aliens did waive their trial rights in the expectation of subsequently avoiding immigration consequences for their offenses,and that defeating such expectations would produce inequitable results,a full consideration of the equities can not ignore the inequities that will result from the majority application of its new rule nonretroactively.the majority decision will create significant inequities between aliens in the ninth circuit who were convicted before the date of this decision and who subsequently had those convictions expunged,and all other aliens with expunged convictions everywhere in the country.the aliens in the first group,whether they actually relied on lujan armendariz or not,could avoid the immigration consequences of their convictions,while all those in the second group would be deemed to have convictions under the plain language of a a and would have to suffer such consequences.in short,the majority decision will lead to similarly situated aliens being treated differently in the future,harper,at internal quotation marks omitted,with no basis in the constitution or the statute for the difference.
the majority exacerbates this inequity by choosing to overrule rice holder,cir,retroactively,see op.at,while overruling lujan armendariz and its other progeny only prospectively,see op.at.under harper,because the majority applies its new rule abrogating rice to nunez reyes,this abrogation must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review.harper,at.in other words,the majority has singled out one unlucky aliens who may have relied on rice from the larger class it has created aliens who may have relied on lujan armendariz and its progeny with no apparent justification other than the fact that nunez reyes case happened to fall within the purview of rice this runs directly counter to the supreme court statement in harper that courts must not allow the substantive law to shift according to the particular equities of an individual party claim.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
given that applying our decision overruling lujan armendariz creates substantial inequitable results among similarly situated aliens,chevron oil third factor does not weigh heavily in favor of a application 
in sum,because courts generally ha ve no more constitutional authority in civil cases than in criminal cases to disregard current law or to treat similarly situated litigants differently,harper,at quoting am.trucking ass ns,at stevens,dissenting internal quotation mark omitted,the chevron oil exception to retroactivity must be treated as a narrow one.at a minimum,then,we should apply the exception only where all three factors clearly favor prospectivity.because here the second chevron oil factor weighs heavily against application,and neither of the other factors provides strong support for a purely prospective decision,chevron oil does not support the majority decision.
where the factors of chevron oil do not overwhelmingly support the disfavored approach of application,we should instead give effect to the general rule of retrospective effect for constitutional decisions that the supreme court reaffirmed in harper.id.at quoting robinson neil.here,practical and jurisprudential considerations also weigh heavily in favor of retroactive application of our ruling.
practical concerns are crucial in the area of immigration law,because regulating immigration is the prerogative of the legislative branch.see garcia ramirez gonzales,cir gould,concurring t he constitution gives the superordinate role to congress,and not to the federal courts,in regulating the flow and content of immigration to the united states.because congress has exclusive power over immigration,we have frequently stressed the paramount importance of national uniformity in this area.see cazarez gutierrez ashcroft,cir noting the strong interest in national uniformity in the administration of immigration laws kahn ins,cir the ina was designed to implement a uniform federal policy,and the meaning of concepts important to its application are not to be determined according to the law of the forum,but rather require a uniform federal definition.alteration omitted quoting rosario ins,cir.by applying its decision overruling lujan armendariz,where there is no constitutional reason for doing so,the majority usurps congress authority and derogates from this principle of national uniformity.
the supreme court has emphasized the substantial jurisprudential concerns that weigh against in fact,the justices seem to speak directly against the approach adopted by the majority.justice souter,joined by justice stevens,asserted in beam that the chevron oil test can not determine the choice of law by relying on the equities of the particular case.beam,at souter,announcing the judgment of the court.justice blackmun,joined by justices marshall and scalia,wrote that t he nature of judicial review constrains us to consider the case that is actually before us,and,if it requires us to announce a new rule,to do so in the context of the case and apply it to the parties who brought us the case to decide.id.at blackmun,concurring in the judgment of the court.justice scalia recognized that judges in a real sense make law,but stated that they make it as judges make it,which is to say as though they were finding it discerning what the law is,rather than decreeing what it is today changed to,or what it will tomorrow be.id.at scalia,concurring in the judgment.these perspectives commanded a majority of the court in harper.where,as here,the chevron oil factors do not clearly support,the majority insistence that our ruling be given only prospective application can not be squared with harper and with the justices underlying concerns 
instead of straining to make the law fit its notion of good policy,the majority should have followed the advice of harper and reserved prospective decisionmaking for the rare case where all three chevron oil factors clearly point toward doing so.because the majority has abjured this wiser course,i respectfully dissent.
lujan armendariz ins,cir,holds that equal protection of the laws is violated by denying federal first offender act ffoa relief to aliens whose minor drug offenses were expunged by a judge after the offender successfully completed a rehabilitation program.the majority overturns this circuit precedent and in doing so overturns a number of our cases that followed the lujan armendariz rule.in addition to the panel opinion in this case,these overturned cases include rice holder,cir,romero.holder,cir,ramirez altamirano holder,cir,dillingham ins,cir,and cardenas uriarte ins,cir.the majority throws out more than ten years of our precedent without so much as a cursory examination of the question whether congress intended to maintain ffoa treatment for minor drug offenses.specifically,the majority fails to address the question whether congress definition of conviction,set forth under a a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a,includes expungements at all.the majority skips over this statutory interpretation question and improperly jumps to the constitutional equal protection question instead.see,standard oil of california arizona,cir w e must,if at all possible,resolve cases on statutory grounds before reaching constitutional questions citing escambia county,mcmillan,per curiam.
to make matters worse,the majority denies the petition for review in this case even though it decides to apply its new rule denying state offenders ffoa relief for drug convictions prospectively only.the result is that the petitioner will be separated from his citizen wife and two children because of a minor drug conviction one that a california state judge expunged because the petitioner successfully completed a state rehabilitation program.such a result is unjust.the majority compounds that injustice by ensuring that thousands of minor drug offenders will suffer the same cruel separation from their families in the days ahead.
america is a nation.each year,thousands of people,some of them immigrants to this country,are caught up in our justice system by making the mistake of committing a minor drug offense.but congress through the ffoa has seen fit to give those folks who commit the most minor drug offenses an opportunity a second chance to redeem themselves through rehabilitation,and thereafter walk a straight and narrow path to become productive members of society and a credit to their families.for some immigrants,including thousands of residents,this second chance also means being able to stay in the country with their families intact.the majority abandonment of our precedent today means that minor drug offenders within our circuit who have fully complied with their state stringent rehabilitation programs,and who have had their minor convictions expunged by a state court judge,nonetheless will be subject to removal from the united states.for them,there will be no second chance.thousands of families will be rendered asunder,and tens of thousands of children will suffer the consequences.this harsh result,i submit,is repugnant to the values of kindness,compassion,and fundamental fairness.
i therefore strongly dissent.
this dissenting opinion starts out where the majority should have,by examining the board of immigration appeal bia decision in the case now before us.analyzing nunez reyes petition for review,i adhere to lujan armendariz and its progeny.because the majority walks away from the lujan armendariz rule only prospectively the majority pronouncement does not apply to nunez reyes case.
flavio nunez reyes nunez reyes is a national of mexico who entered the united states without inspection in.his united states citizen wife and two children reside in san jose,california.
in,nunez reyes was charged with one felony count of possession of methamphetamine,in violation of california health safety code a.this felony charge was later reduced to a misdemeanor.nunez reyes was also charged,under the same complaint,with using or being under the influence of methamphetamine,in violation of california health safety code a.the charges against nunez reyes were ultimately dismissed pursuant to california expungement statute for drug possession offenses,which states that the state court shall set aside the conviction and dismiss the indictment if the defendant successfully completes probation and that both the arrest and the conviction shall be deemed never to have occurred.code e 
in early,the federal government charged nunez reyes under a a i as a removable alien.nunez reyes conceded removability but applied for adjustment of status,cancellation of removal,and,alternatively,voluntary departure.the immigration judge ij held that the state conviction rendered nunez reyes ineligible for any form of relief.the bia affirmed the ij decision and held that nunez reyes could not avail himself of relief under the ffoa because his conviction for using or being under the influence of methamphetamine was not one for which federal first offender treatment would be available.the bia reasoned that the ffoa applies only to simple possession offenses,and that being under the influence of methamphetamine is not a simple possession offense.while recognizing that our court has applied ffoa treatment to convictions for lesser offenses,the bia held that nunez reyes had not pleaded down from a charge of simple possession and that being under the influence of methamphetamine is not a lesser offense than that of simple possession.
the matter came before our court on appeal.under de novo review,we faithfully applied our precedent,which holds that drug possession dispositions that would be eligible for ffoa treatment are not convictions for purposes of the immigration laws.nunez reyes holder,cir per curiam citing lujan armendariz,at,and garberding ins,cir.under the law of our circuit,ffoa treatment also applies to a lesser offense than that of simple possession of a controlled substance.see cardenas uriarte ins,cir noting that congressional intent indicated that the lesser crime of possession of drug paraphernalia should be given ffoa treatment.thus,under the ffoa,
an alien can not be deemed convicted for immigration purposes if he can demonstrate that the conviction was his first offense he had not previously been accorded first offender treatment his conviction was for possession of drugs,or an equivalent or lesser charge such as possession of drug paraphernalia and he received relief under a state rehabilitative statute.
ramirez altamirano,at citation omitted.nunez reyes easily met the first,second,and fourth requirements for ffoa relief.the only question left for the panel was whether nunez reyes conviction for using or being under the influence of methamphetamine was an equivalent or lesser charge than simple possession of drugs.importantly,the panel relied on our court recent decision in rice holder,cir,where we held that a misdemeanor conviction for being under the influence of a controlled substance qualifies as a lesser offense eligible for ffoa treatment.in rice,the petitioner was charged with one felony count of possession of cocaine and one misdemeanor count of using or being under the influence of a stimulant under california law id.at.rice pleaded nolo contendere and was convicted of both offenses.id.upon completion of three years of probation,the court set aside rice pleas of nolo contendere,entered pleas of not guilty,and dismissed the complaint.id.during removal proceedings,the ij found rice statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had been convicted for violating a controlled substance law.id.the bia dismissed rice appeal,holding that rice would not have been eligible for ffoa treatment for the offense of being under the influence of a controlled substance because only simple possession offenses were eligible for relief,and thus,rice stood convicted for immigration purposes.id.
in rice,we granted the petition for review and held that persons convicted of using or being under the influence of a controlled substance,where that offense is less serious than simple drug possession,are eligible for the same immigration treatment as those convicted of drug possession under the ffoa.id.at.following the precedent set forth in cardenas uriarte,at,we reasoned that there was no relevant distinction between the offenses of possession of drug paraphernalia and using or being under the influence of a controlled substance,as both are generally less serious than simple possession.rice,at see also medina ashcroft,cir.we further noted that we can be sure that using or being under the influence of a controlled substance is a lesser offense because it is a misdemeanor while possession of cocaine is a felony.id.internal marks and citation omitted.the bia decision in nunez reyes case was rendered before our decision in rice.
as judge graber concurrence to the panel opinion correctly points out,rice answered the legal questions raised in nunez reyes case,and no factual distinction exists.nunez reyes,at graber,concurring emphasis added.according to our precedent,then,nunez reyes is eligible for ffoa treatment and his convictions can not be used as grounds to deny him relief from removal.the panel granted nunez reyes petition and remanded for further proceedings.id.the panel got it right.
yet,judge graber en banc majority opinion now holds that nunez reyes petition for review should be denied.it does so by overruling rice,reasoning that being under the influence is not a lesser crime than simple possession because it is not a possession crime at all,and it is thus qualitatively different from any federal conviction for which ffoa treatment would be available.op.at.the majority further reasons that b eing under the influence is not a lesser offense to simple possession because it arguably is more serious than mere possession op.at.
the majority reasoning is flawed.our review is limited to the actual grounds relied upon by the bia.ramirez altamirano holder,cir citation omitted.if we conclude that the bia decision can not be sustained upon its reasoning,we must remand to allow the agency to decide any issues remaining in the case.id.the bia distinguished this case from lujan armendariz because nunez reyes was charged and convicted under california law for using or being under the influence of methamphetamine.the bia found nunez reyes conviction for using or being under the influence of methamphetamine not analogous to any offense for which federal first offender treatment would be available,and therefore held that the conviction dismissal was not akin to an ffoa expungement.in short,the bia stated that using or being under the influence of methamphetamine did not qualify for ffoa treatment because it was neither a simple possession offense nor a lesser offense than simple possession of methamphetamine.
however,u nder these circumstances,concluding that using or being under the influence of a controlled substance is not included in the first offender act would frustrate congressional intent and lead to an absurd result.cardenas uriarte,at.congress intended the ffoa as a limited federal rehabilitation statute that permits drug offenders who commit the least serious type of drug offense to avoid the drastic consequences which typically follow a finding of guilt in drug cases.lujan armendariz,at.nunez reyes conviction for using or being under the influence of methamphetamine is the least serious type of drug offense.in contrast to nunez reyes felony possession of methamphetamine charge,his conviction for using or being under the influence of methamphetamine was a misdemeanor.see cal.health safety code a,a.and nunez reyes drug use is not even a federal crime there is no equivalent federal criminal statute that prohibits using or being under the influence of a controlled substance.see u.if being under the influence arguably is more serious than mere possession,op.at,the majority fails to explain why neither congress nor the state of california chose to treat it as such.thus,by denying nunez reyes the benefit of ffoa treatment for his expunged conviction for using or being under the influence of drugs,the majority not only frustrates the intent of congress but also ignores the criminal statutory schemes of both congress and california,which both treat using or being under the influence as a least serious type of drug offense.
nor does the distinction between simple possession and using or being under the influence of drugs make sense under these circumstances.congress criminalized the possession of drugs,at least in part,because it did not want people to use drugs.thus,given the underlying purpose of the ffoa,the ffoa rehabilitative scheme logically applies to protect first time drug users,along with first time drug possessors,against the harsh consequences that follow from a drug conviction.lujan armendariz,at.
by way of analogy,we have previously held that a b i an exception to the automatic removability of aliens convicted of a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana implicitly applies to both possession and actual use of marijuana.see medina,at.this makes absolute logical sense because use of drugs has generally been considered a less serious crime than possession.id.quoting flores arrellano ins,cir.here,as in medina,i t defies reason to conclude that congress wanted to protect a person who possessed methamphetamine in small amounts for his own use,but then wanted to remove him from the country if he did so use it.id.thus,distinguishing between possession of drugs and their use,allowing only the former to qualify for ffoa treatment,frustrates congressional intent and leads to absurd results.
moreover,had nunez reyes been prosecuted by the federal government rather than by the state of california,he would have been charged only with simple possession of methamphetamine because,as mentioned previously,there is no federal criminal statute prohibiting using or being under the influence of a controlled substance.see.as we noted in rice,a s with possession of drug paraphernalia,congress would never have considered including under the ffoa the offense of using or being under the influence of a controlled substance,because no federal statute covers that crime.rice,at quoting cardenas uriarte,at,and citing see also ramirez altamirano,at.in fact,federal law imposes only a civil penalty for possession of a controlled substance in an amount that,as specified by regulation of the attorney general,is a personal use amount.thus,nunez reyes would have qualified for ffoa treatment had he been fortunate enough to have been caught by federal agents rather than by state officers.
to support its position,the majority claims that in cardenas uriarte,at,and ramirez altamirano,at,it was clear that the conviction was for a lesser offense because the alien was convicted of a single crime that carried a lesser penalty than the crime of simple possession.op.at.contrary to this reasoning,however,neither case relies on the number of convictions or on the fact of possession.in cardenas uriarte,possession of drug paraphernalia under arizona law was considered a lesser offense not because it was the only offense the petitioner had pleaded to,but because it would be a misdemeanor once probation was successfully completed while possession of the drugs would have been a felony.at.in ramirez altamirano,the possession of drug paraphernalia offense under california law was considered a lesser offense because it would be absurd to deny ffoa relief to individuals who possess the utensils incidental to drug ingestion but grant relief to those who possess the actual illicit drugs,not because the petitioner pleaded guilty to only the misdemeanor paraphernalia possession charge.at.thus,in neither case was the number of offenses or the fact of possession dispositive.the majority conclusion,therefore,remains unsupported.
it is difficult to square the majority application of the new rule it sets out today with the denial of nunez reyes petition for review.as the majority recognizes,a substantial number of aliens acted in reliance on lujan armendariz when they pleaded guilty to drug crimes under state law.op.at.relying on equitable considerations,the majority concludes that we must protect the reliance interests of those state offenders who may have forgone their constitutional rights under the reasonable belief that they would not face harsh immigration consequences for pleading guilty and undergoing rehabilitative drug treatment.op.at.the majority recognizes that lujan armendariz applies to the petitioner,nunez reyes,but still denies his petition for review.the majority fails,however,to distinguish lujan armendariz and its progeny from nunez reyes case.nor can the majority adequately explain why rice was wrongly decided.therefore,under lujan armendariz,cardenas uriarte,ramirez altamirano,and rice,i would grant nunez reyes petition for review.
the majority review of the bia opinion flawed.additionally,it remains unclear why the majority opinion even reaches the issue of lujan armendariz viability.the bia,in nunez reyes case,distinguished lujan armendariz to the majority satisfaction,but,puzzlingly,the opinion devotes the bulk of its efforts to overruling lujan armendariz.because we must limit our review to grounds actually discussed by the bia,this ruling is out of bounds and entirely improper.pascua holder,wl,at cir.
moreover,the majority overrules lujan armendariz on constitutional grounds without addressing the independent statutory justification,on which lujan armendariz expressly relied,for excluding dispositions from the definition of conviction.at.prudence counsels that we exert more effort before abandoning such,precedent.
in lujan armendariz,based in part on an equal protection analysis,we held that persons whose offenses would qualify for treatment under the ffoa but who are convicted and have their convictions expunged under state laws may not be removed on account of those offenses.at.in so holding,lujan armendariz faithfully adhered to congressional intent underlying the ffoa in permit ting drug offenders who commit the least serious type of drug offense to avoid the drastic consequences which typically follow a finding of guilt in drug cases.id.at.
given the ffoa directive that dispositions eligible for ffoa relief shall not be considered a conviction for the purpose of a disqualification or a disability imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,or for any other purpose,b emphases added,we must give meaning to the statute within the immigration context.as both the majority and the supreme court recognize,deportation is an integral part indeed,sometimes the most important part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.op.at citing padilla kentucky.and there can be little doubt that the particularly severe penalty of removal,id.at,is one of the most drastic consequences that results from a drug conviction.to fully effectuate congress intent to insulate drug offenders who complete expungement programs from the extremely harsh consequences that would otherwise result from their actions,ffoa relief must apply not only to eligible aliens convicted of federal offenses,but also to those convicted of state offenses.otherwise,the ffoa loses much of its efficacy because the relief it offers can be circumvented via the state criminal justice system.
keeping these principles in mind,even if the equal protection analysis set forth in lujan armendariz is abandoned,it does not follow that drug offense convictions are ineligible for ffoa treatment.in lujan armendariz,we did not consider what effect the amendment to the term conviction,promulgated in a a,had on state expungements specifically.instead,we held that the amendment did not repeal the ffoa and we then simply extended this conclusion to state expungements on the basis of equal protection.at.put another way,lujan armendariz equal protection rationale had necessary force only absent an answer to the question of what effect the new definition of conviction has on state expungements under state rehabilitation laws in general.at.assuming that lujan armendariz equal protection analysis no longer stands,we must now engage in this statutory analysis.
congress amendment to the term conviction suggests that it had no intention of altering the bia decisions to include state and convictions from that term.the majority,in leaping to the conclusion that equal protection is not violated because congress could have made a decision to treat aliens differently under rational basis review,declines to engage in any analysis,through statutory interpretation or otherwise,of whether congress actually intended to do so.the majority simply assumes that congress intended that convictions for simple possession have adverse immigration consequences,op.at,but fails to explain from where it divines such congressional intent.we should not prematurely review congress purported distinction between state and federal expungement under a cursory form of rational basis review without first looking at the relevant statutes to determine whether congress actually intended for such a distinction to exist.
in,congress addressed the meaning of the term conviction by enacting the following definition 
the term conviction means,with respect to an alien,a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or,if adjudication of guilt has been withheld,where 
i a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt,and 
ii the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the alien liberty to be imposed.
the legislative history behind the amendment to the definition of conviction fully supports the conclusion that drug possession offenses are not convictions under a a of the ina.at.in enacting a a,congress adopted most of the bia definition of conviction,as it was laid out in matter of ozkok,bia.notably,the amended definition makes no mention of the rule,cited with approval by the bia in ozkok,that expunged convictions can not serve as the basis for deportation.lujan armendariz,at.moreover,congress promulgated its new definition of conviction just after the bia reaffirmed its rule that immigration consequences do not attach to drug possession offenses,and that they would be treated the same as federal convictions expunged under the ffoa.see matter of manrique,bia.as amicus points out,when congress adopts an agency interpretation,congress intends the agency construction to be incorporated into the statute.see davis.dep t of treasury,when congress codifies a judicially defined concept,absent an express statement to the contrary,congress intended to adopt the interpretation placed on that concept by the courts.lorillard pons,the presumption that congress acted with knowledge is particularly appropriate where congress exhibited both a detailed knowledge of the incorporated provisions and their judicial interpretation and a willingness to depart from those provisions regarded as undesirable or inappropriate for incorporation.hing sum holder,cir where congress uses terms that have settled meanings in bia case law,congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.
we have previously acknowledged that the amendment to the definition of conviction in a a said nothing about expungement,and could well be interpreted to establish only when a conviction occurred without determining what might be the effect of a later expungement.murillo espinoza ins,cir citing to lujan armendariz,at.and,notably,consistent with every other circuit,the majority does not overrule lujan armendariz holding that the amendment to the definition of conviction in a a of the ina did not expressly or impliedly repeal the ffoa.its holding thereby leaves intact the ffoa exception for expunged controlled substance offenses from the definition of conviction.see lujan armendariz,at.
thus,in enacting the amendment,it appears that congress was concerned primarily with the question whether aliens could be deported during the period that followed a determination of guilt but preceded the expungement of the offense,but had no intention of altering the longstanding rule that convictions that are subsequently expunged under either federal or state law no longer have any effect for immigration purposes.id.at n.congress decision to enact essentially verbatim the majority of ozkok definition of conviction,while excluding only one part of that definition that has no bearing here,makes it particularly appropriate to read a a as incorporating the agency treatment of expunged convictions.evidently,congress approved the rule established by the bia in manrique and recognized in ozkok.
an analysis of the relevant statutes and their history reveals an independent justification for excluding minor drug offenses expunged under state law from the definition of conviction in a a.congress evidently approved of the principle that simple possession convictions do not carry adverse immigration consequences and,in enacting the amendment,had no intention of disturbing it.
in failing to reach this statutory question and instead relying only on its equal protection analysis,the majority implicitly defers to the bia post interpretation of conviction,which followed the promulgation of a a of the ina.see,murillo espinoza,at according chevron deference to the bia permissible construction of the ina statute.
after the amendments to a a,the bia reversed its previous course and held that the definition of conviction includes convictions expunged under state rehabilitative statutes.in re salazar regino,bia en banc.pursuant to this interpretation,the bia,since,has refused to follow in other circuits our circuit application of ffoa treatment to drug offenses expunged under state law.id.at stating that the bia decline s to apply the ruling in to cases arising outside of the jurisdiction of the ninth circuit.in so doing,the bia has implicitly rejected the statutory rationale for treating state and federal expungements equally,and has instead relied only on the equal protection holding of lujan armendariz on appeals within this circuit.
we need not,however,defer to the bia interpretation of the term conviction as it is used in a a.deference to the bia interpretation of a statute which it administers is proper under chevron,natural resources defense council.deference to the bia interpretation of the definition of conviction as used in a a,however,is entirely inappropriate,because that term is used not only for purposes of immigration law,but also in the criminal law context.specifically,a a definition of conviction controls the meaning of the term in the federal illegal reentry statute,and is correspondingly referenced in the united states sentencing guidelines.because a criminal statute is not administered by any agency but by the courts,its interpretation is our independent responsibility.crandon united states,see also de jesus melendez gonzales,cir stating that no deference is owed to the bia interpretation of statutes it does not administer,including the ffoa.
the supreme court has decided many cases concerning the term aggravated felony which,like conviction,is defined in a and used in without deferring to the bia and without applying the chevron framework.see,carachuri rosendo holder.nijhawan holder.lopez gonzales,leocal ashcroft.similarly,here,we must conduct our own interpretation of the statute and need not defer to the bia interpretation of conviction.because construction of this term has consequences for the administration of criminal law,it is the independent duty of the judiciary,and not the bia,to assign to the term a meaning.
relatedly,even if,in discharging our duty,we were to find that a a is ambiguous,its application in the criminal law context requires us to resolve the ambiguity favorably to the alien,pursuant to the principle of lenity applicable with respect to the gravity of removal.retuta holder,cir citing ins cardoza fonseca,and lara cazares gonzales,cir.the majority entirely fails to consider how its holding will apply to criminal laws.
as the previous analysis reveals,an independent statutory justification can rescue the holding of lujan armendariz and its progeny.nonetheless,that decision was properly decided on the basis of its equal protection analysis.i reject the majority equal protection analysis in this case,by which it overrules lujan armendariz.
the rule we articulated in lujan armendariz derives from our holding in garberding ins,cir.under garberding,persons who received the benefit of a state expungement law were not subject to deportation as long as they could have received the benefit of the ffoa if they had been prosecuted under federal law.lujan armendariz,at.garberding equal protection analysis focused on whether aliens could be treated differently based on their conduct.id.garberding establishes that aliens may not be treated differently based on the mere fortuity that they happen to have been prosecuted under state rather than federal law,or under different state laws,as there is no rational basis for distinguishing among the affected groups.id.at.lujan armendariz simply adopted and applied that same principle after finding that congress new definition of conviction had not repealed the ffoa offense exception.id.at.we applied equal protection because no rational basis exists for affording ffoa relief to an alien under federal expungement law while denying relief to identically situated aliens who qualify for similar treatment under state expungement laws.id.at.
the majority offers two purportedly rational bases for not extending ffoa treatment to aliens whose convictions have been expunged under state law.first,the majority adopts the rationale offered by the third circuit in acosta ashcroft,cir,that 
congress may have been unfamiliar with the operation of state schemes that resemble the ffoa.congress could have worried that state criminal justice systems,under the pressure created by heavy case loads,might permit dangerous offenders to plead down to simple possession charges and take advantage of those state schemes to escape what is considered a conviction under state law.
this rationale,however,is belied by the fact that the ffoa requires that the offender has not,prior to the commission of a simple possession offense,been convicted of violating a federal or state law relating to controlled substances.a.if congress was worried that state criminal justice schemes,overwhelmed by heavy caseloads,might allow dangerous offenders to plead down,they presumably also recognized that offenders could simply plead to something other than a violation of a controlled substances law and thereby achieve the same result.
moreover,the supreme court has recently held,in the context of determining what constitutes an aggravated felony,that the immigration consequences of state convictions must be applied as if the offense had been prosecuted in federal court.see lopez gonzales,at carachuri rosendo.at.if congress is willing to acknowledge that state convictions have force in the federal immigration context,it seems wholly inconsistent to assume that congress intended to treat state expungements differently.
the second purportedly rational basis offered by the majority is slightly more plausible.because not all states have expungement schemes,the majority offers,congress reasonably could have concluded that,in the strong interest in uniformity,it would not recognize any state expungements rather than adopt a piecemeal approach.op.at citing nunez reyes,at graber,concurring.
this rationale,however,is also flawed.first,under the majority reasoning,congress hypothetical interest in uniformity cuts both ways.the majority opinion assumes that congress interest in uniformity in the immigration context requires leveling down to the lowest common denominator and excluding all convictions from ffoa treatment.but the ffoa ensures its own uniformity by providing that all offenses expunged under the act will not be regarded as convictions for any purpose.b.there is no reason to believe that congress interest in uniformity among the states is more important than congress interest in uniformity in the treatment of drug offenders whose convictions have been expunged.
notably,aliens whose state convictions have been expunged are not similarly situated to those whose states have no expungement schemes in place.aliens whose convictions were expunged under state expungement schemes have undergone rehabilitation.the ffoa was passed to ensure that those offenders who undergo rehabilitative measures and ultimately get their charges dismissed or their convictions expunged are afforded a second chance.the only aliens who meet this criteria are those in states with expungement schemes.unlike the disparity created by the majority,then,distinguishing between aliens in states with expungement schemes and those in states that do not have expungement schemes survives rational basis review and undermines neither congress intent under the ffoa,nor states rehabilitative schemes.
second,i note that any alien,from any state,may have his federal drug offense expunged under the ffoa and that offense can no longer be considered as a basis for removal.it is not the case,therefore,that affording state expungements ffoa treatment would render aliens from states without state expungement schemes entirely ineligible for ffoa treatment,while those from states with expungement schemes would qualify for such treatment.any and all may receive such treatment for federal convictions expunged under the ffoa.to the contrary,then,ffoa treatment of state expungements ensures that aliens from states that offer alternatives to federal expungement programs are not severely punished merely because they were presented with and took such an alternative.
there is simply no principled reason why congress should treat offenses subject to state expungement differently from identical or lesser offenses that would have been eligible for ffoa treatment had they been prosecuted as federal crimes.equal protection considerations prohibit unequal treatment of individuals.see garberding,at.aliens who have committed identical offenses and have their convictions expunged,whether directly through the ffoa or as a result of a state rehabilitation scheme,are similarly situated.under lujan armendariz,the question has always been whether the expunged offense would have been covered under the ffoa if charged as a federal crime.at.and we have been consistent in asking and answering that question.see ramirez altamirano,at.to do otherwise would be to allow due process rights to hinge on jurisdictional happenstance.as we stated in lujan armendariz,there is no rational basis for a federal statute that treats persons adjudged guilty of a drug offense under state law more harshly than persons adjudged guilty of the identical offense under federal law.id.at.
lujan armendariz equal protection analysis was based in part on the irrationality of treating aliens differently based on the mere fortuity whether a federal prosecutor sends a drug case to the state prosecutor or chooses to keep it,or vice versa.at citing paredes urrestarazu ins,cir.without the equal treatment afforded under lujan armendariz,this unfettered prosecutorial discretion may now be exercised to dispositively determine whether an individual drug offense will yield extremely harsh immigration consequences that is,whether any particular defendant will benefit from the ffoa.this result is unsettling,to say the least.
our precedent requires that we give extra deference to congress in the immigration context.abebe mukasey,cir.but we can not allow rational basis review to serve as a rubber stamp to what a hypothetical congress might have intended.justifications for overruling one of our court longstanding precedents should be made of sterner stuff we must place some rational bounds on what survives rational basis review if the constitutional right of equal protection is to have any meaning whatsoever outside the context of suspect classifications.id.at cir clifton,concurring see also id.at thomas,dissenting i n order to be rational,the reason must be consistent.until now,employing the rational basis test,we treated drug offenders equally.i see no reason to abandon that practice,particularly when any rational basis now offered is no more or less true today than it was eleven years ago when we decided lujan armendariz.
the majority offers what it believes to be some consolation to drug offenders from now on,aliens will be able to make a fully informed decision whether to plead guilty or to exercise their constitutional rights,such as the right to trial by jury.op.at.but it will be of little comfort to aliens charged with possession offenses that their decision to plead or go to trial will be rendered with full awareness of the immigration consequences of such a conviction.will no longer be able to avoid the most drastic consequence of all removal by pleading guilty.this will further undermine state rehabilitative schemes because it will remove a tremendous incentive for drug offenders to plead guilty.as amicus point out,this change in the analysis directly eviscerates the effectiveness of states rehabilitative statutes that,like the ffoa,aim to remove the legal consequences of a minor,drug offense for those offenders who successfully complete their probationary requirements and undergo drug treatment.
finally,the notion that state expungement programs should be given different or less significant treatment than their federal counterparts is directly at odds with the principle of comity and respect for state court proceedings and processes that federal courts have embraced in other areas.see,harrington richter,state court proceedings are the central process through which federal habeas claims should be adjudicated,and federal court may not impose requirements that undercut state practices designed to preserve the integrity of the tradition.it is lamentable that,while federal courts apply extreme deference to state laws and procedures in contexts where they might serve to frustrate the vindication of constitutional or rights,we refuse to recognize state programs in the context where they might serve to trigger the ffoa in a manner completely consistent with congressional intent.see beard kindler,in light of federalism and comity concerns it would seem particularly strange to disregard state rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.though some of our sister circuits may ascribe to congress little faith in state court rehabilitative schemes,we should not feel so bound.acosta,at.
there is one thing on which we all can agree reliance on the clear,binding precedent of lujan armendariz strikes us as entirely reasonable and prudent,particularly in light of congress inaction,the supreme court steady denial of certiorari in cases raising this issue,and our own consistent application and,arguably,expansion of the precedent in a series of cases spanning more than a decade.op.at.to this list of reasons we can add one more the holding in lujan armendariz itself is entirely reasonable and prudent.moreover,there is no compelling reason why we should overrule lujan armendariz without first engaging in a thorough statutory analysis.such an analysis reveals that congress never intended to exclude drug possession dispositions from the definition of conviction in a a of the ina.
for all of the foregoing reasons,i would grant nunez reyes petition for review and hold that his two misdemeanor convictions are eligible for ffoa treatment.while the rational basis test sets a low bar,there is simply no indication that congress intended to deny ffoa treatment to aliens with minor drug offenses who have successfully undergone a program that resulted in their rehabilitation.in fact,the majority opinion serves to undermine congress evidenced intent.unless and until we are willing to engage in a thorough analysis of the definition of conviction under the ina,we should adhere to the principle of stare decisis and demonstrate restraint.this is particularly true where,as here,reexamining and casting aside our precedent is unnecessary to deciding the case before us.because the majority ultimately reaches further than it needs to,without digging deeper than it ought to,i dissent.
