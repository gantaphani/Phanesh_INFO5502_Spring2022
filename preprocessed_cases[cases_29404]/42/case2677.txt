pop,a native and citizen of romania,entered the united states on february,and applied to the ins for political asylum.on may,the ins denied his request and began deportation proceedings.pop then retained judd azulay to represent him during these proceedings.on december,azulay filed a written application for asylum for pop,in which pop claimed that the oppressive communist regimes under the dictatorship of ceausescu persecuted him for his political beliefs.further,pop claimed that the romanian government under ion iliescu,ceausescu successor,also persecuted him for his political beliefs.according to the application,in,pop was approached by an unnamed person who asked him to join the communist party and that following his refusal to join,he was subjected to surveillance and interrogation by ceausescu notorious police force,the securitate,regarding his political beliefs.pop explained that after the execution of ceausescu in december,he joined the liberal party that opposed the government headed by iliescu.pop application explained that he was active at liberal party meetings and in numerous demonstrations against the iliescu government.pop application stated that in june,he was arrested and detained for hours on two occasions,and that during each detention,he was interrogated and beaten by the sir,the successor to the securitate.pop application further explained that the sir warned him to cease his political involvement and criticism of the iliescu government and that he was subsequently denied job promotions and salary increases on account of his beliefs.finally,pop application stated that pop believed he would be arrested and interrogated,be denied employment,have his life threatened,and be imprisoned because of his opposition to the iliescu government if he were to return to romania.
deportation hearings commenced on july,and pop conceded deportability but sought asylum as a refugee.the proceedings were continued until november,at which time azulay sought an additional continuance in order to submit several newspaper articles addressing the current conditions in romania.this continuance was denied.pop was then sworn as a witness and stated that the information in his asylum application was true and correct.further,pop testified that he had nothing to add to the application and that it adequately and completely represented his claim for asylum.other than pop application,azulay did not submit any additional evidence on pop behalf.
the ij then issued his oral decision.the ij began by reviewing the information contained in pop application regarding his political activities in romania.the ij then reviewed an advisory opinion from the state department advisory opinion,which stated that conditions in romania had been profoundly transformed since ceausescu overthrow in and that the current government respected civil liberties.the advisory opinion explained that political conditions in romania had improved,and therefore,past mistreatment under ceausescu or in would not lead to mistreatment by the current government.the ij concluded that pop had not established either past persecution or a fear of future persecution and thus,he denied pop claim for asylum.
on november,azulay filed a notice of appeal and on march,azulay filed a brief that challenged,inter alia,the ij conclusions on asylum.pop retained new counsel and on august,filed a motion to reopen or in the alternative,to remand his case the motion asserted that azulay provided ineffective assistance to pop by failing to properly investigate all of the facts of his case.specifically,the motion contended that pop asylum application lacked information regarding the granting of asylum to pop,mariana,based on the same factual background as pop claim.pop also submitted his own affidavit,numerous newspaper articles,and an affidavit from mariana in support of his motion to remand.
initially,pop affidavit contended that azulay failed to encourage him to contact mariana and that mariana would have supported his claim.pop affidavit did not detail any additional past persecution that pop suffered but did outline persecution suffered by mariana and her mother.for example,pop stated that he witnessed the securitate question mariana and her mother and that the securitate harassed mariana mother and father for many years.the newspaper articles addressed various actions the romanian government had taken since the fall of ceausescu.
mariana affidavit stated that pop left her in,that she soon thereafter obtained a divorce,and that she and pop did not talk again until.mariana stated that she came to the united states in november and was granted asylum soon thereafter.although she did not attach her asylum application,mariana detailed over fifteen years of persecution that she,her father,and her mother endured due to the actions of her father,a prominent member of the jehovah witnesses.mariana also stated that her family was persecuted by the securitate because mariana aunt had emigrated to the united states,and that the securitate sought information about her aunt.according to mariana,the securitate also attempted to recruit her to spy on her friends,family,and neighbors,but that mariana refused to work with the securitate.further,mariana stated that her and pop son,alexander,was granted asylum because of her permanent resident alien status.mariana affidavit also supported pop claim that he was persecuted for his political opinions between and.finally,mariana affidavit stated that mariana and pop were active in opposing the iliescu government from until and that mariana was certain that pop will be persecuted if he returns to romania,even though the government has changed again.
on october,the bia denied pop appeal and his motion to remand.the bia first addressed the appeal and noted that the facts presented in pop asylum application did not amount to past persecution.further,the bia noted that the state department country report country report indicated that political conditions in romania had improved considerably,and thus made it unlikely that pop would face persecution in the future.in denying pop motion to remand,the bia found that pop was not prejudiced by any alleged deficiency in azulay representation.the bia noted that current country conditions have been so altered as to remove any presumption that past mistreatment under ceausescu or in the chaotic first year after his overthrow will lead to mistreatment in the future despite the suspicions of some people regarding leaders who held office under the prior regime.the bia also stated that pop fear of future persecution was not reasonable because it was based entirely on incidents that occurred prior to the elections.addressing the newspaper articles,the bia found that they undermined pop position because they supported the ij conclusion that persons who express their political opinions in romania are not currently persecuted by the romanian government.the bia concluded that pop was not prejudiced by azulay allegedly deficient performance because pop would still have been deported had azulay done what pop asserted was required.pop then appealed the bia denial of his motion to remand.
ii.analysis 
we review the bia decision to deny a motion to remand for abuse of discretion,mindful of the broad discretion we must afford such decisions.see ins abudu,d.we must affirm the bia denial unless it was made without a rational explanation,it inexplicably departed from established policies,or it rested on an impermissible basis.see man ins,cir quotation omitted.pop argues that the bia should have remanded his case because azulay performance was constitutionally deficient.in this circuit,however,whether there exists a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in immigration c
