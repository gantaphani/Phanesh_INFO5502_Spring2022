the bia,in a nonprecedential decision by a single member of the board,dismissed petitioner appeal because it found he had failed to show that he had been persecuted,or that he had a fear of future persecution,on account of any of the grounds protected by the immigration and nationality act ina.koudriachov also seeks review of the bia december,order denying his motion to reopen its march,decision.in re koudriachova,no.a.
because the bia march,decision dismissing petitioner appeal contains significant ambiguities and potential misunderstandings of the relevant legal standards,we grant the petition for review and remand to the bia for additional investigation or explanation.we dismiss petitioner motion to reopen the december,order of the bia as moot.
background 
the bia held that koudriachov was ineligible for asylum even if his testimony before the immigration judge ij and in his asylum application was wholly credible.consequently,for purposes of this appeal,we accept petitioner account of the events leading up to his application for asylum as truthful and accurate.see yan chen gonzales,cir.
koudriachov is a native of the former united soviet socialist republic soviet union or ussr.in his testimony before the ij,petitioner provided a harrowing and at times brutal account of his experiences in the soviet military and as a neophyte russian intelligence agent.his encounters with the soviet military began when he was and,as part of a period of mandatory military service,he was drafted into the ussr ministry of internal affairs mvd.petitioner explained that the mvd was not a part of the regular soviet army,but rather comprised a special group of troops responsible for guarding secret military objects and locations,controlling riots in prisons and student towns,and fulfilling special assignments relating to terrorism and saboteur groups.to prepare mvd soldiers for their unique responsibilities,they were given extensive physical,psychological,and ideological conditioning.koudriachov found objectionable many aspects of the mvd training program and operations.in particular,he believes it morally wrong that convicted criminals were brought to the mvd base so that soldiers could practice combat techniques on them.partially as a result of his moral misgivings regarding these practices,koudriachov resolved not to pursue a military career.
he completed his term of military service in and subsequently enrolled at the leningrad institute of meteorology institute in what is now the city of petersburg.following his participation in an international student festival,koudriachov was summoned to the regional headquarters of the komsomol,the youth wing of the communist party.there he met with a komsomol official who ordered him to write reports on his interactions with foreigners.koudriachov objected to writing such reports,but agreed to do it after being threatened with expulsion from the institute.the purpose of the reports was never explained,though petitioner suspected they were used to obtain personal information about foreigners for the purpose of blackmailing them.he believes he was selected for this task because of his previous training with the ministry of internal affairs.
in his third year at the institute koudriachov was ordered to report to an address,liteynyi,which was known to be the headquarters of the kgb intelligence service in leningrad petersburg.there he met an individual referred to as vitaly sergeyevich.there is some confusion in the record as to whether sergeyevich contacted koudriachov on behalf of the mvd or the kgb.we will refer to the agency as the kgb for purposes of this opinion without resolving this factual question.
sergeyevich became koudriachov contact within the kgb.in their initial meeting,sergeyevich informed the petitioner that he had been selected to work as a spy for the soviet government and that he would eventually be attending a special school in moscow to prepare him for this work.koudriachov had no desire to become a kgb agent but realized he had no choice.
after graduating from the meteorology institute in,petitioner received an assignment from sergeyevich to begin work at a factory that employed many foreign specialists.koudriachov was told that he would work there for a few years before attending spy school.petitioner testified that throughout his employment at the factory he met regularly with sergeyevich to report technical and personal information he had obtained from his.while koudriachov thought it immoral to betray his in this way,he continued to divulge the information because sergeyevich threatened him by saying he would be drafted into the army or subject to violence were he to refuse.
as the date for petitioner departure to spy school drew near,he resolved to defect from the kgb and flee with his family to the united states.in preparation for this momentous step,koudriachov tried to distance himself from sergeyevich surveillance by moving to a different address in petersburg.however,very soon after he moved,he was attacked in the street by two men who koudriachov believes were sent by sergeyevich.indeed,the day after the attack,the petitioner was summoned to sergeyevich office and asked about his change of residence.
on september,koudriachov and his family entered the united states on visitor visas.in koudriachov wife,elena,applied for asylum and withholding of removal.koudriachov was selected for a diversity visa in april and became eligible for adjustment of status to legal permanent resident.once he realized that his adjustment application required him to request that the russian government reissue or register his passport,however,koudriachov decided that he could not pursue his adjustment application and had to pursue an asylum claim instead.the ij allowed koudriachov to substitute his asylum application for that of his wife on october.
on february,the ij rejected the petitioner application for asylum and withholding of removal,finding that he was not credible.koudriachov appealed the decision to the bia.on march,the bia dismissed the appeal.the bia assumed the petitioner was credible,but found he had nonetheless failed to establish that he was persecuted or fears persecution on account of any ground protected under the ina.ninety days later,petitioner filed a timely motion to reopen with the bia in which he offered new evidence in the form of an expert affidavit of a former kgb intelligence officer,yuri shvets,and,for the first time,requested relief under cat.on december,the bia denied the motion to reopen.koudriachov now petitions for review of the bia dismissal of his appeal from the ij february,decision and the bia denial of his motion to reopen.we grant the petition in part,and dismiss in part.
discussion 
i overview of applicable law 
where,as here,the bia does not adopt the ij decision to any extent,we review only the decision of the bia.see chen bureau of citizenship immigration,cir.we review de novo the bia interpretation of the law as well as its application of the law to the facts.see tanov ins,cir.when the bia interprets ambiguous language in the ina in a precedential opinion issued by a three judge panel,we defer to that interpretation so long as it is reasonable.see rotimi gonzales,cir per curiam chevron res.def.council,d.factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard and are upheld when they are supported in the record by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.see islami gonzales,cir.
to qualify as a refugee,an asylum applicant must establish that he or she has been persecuted in the past,or has a fear of persecution in the future,on any one of five statutorily protected grounds.see gonzales,cir.these grounds include persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.in this case,koudriachov asserts that he is eligible for asylum because
