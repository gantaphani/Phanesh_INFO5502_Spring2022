arturo escobar barraza,a citizen of mexico,applied for permission to remain in the united states as a permanent resident under a provision establishing a preference for immediate relatives of citizens.both his wife and his mother are citizens of the united states.before the agency made a final decision on this application,however,escobar was convicted in nebraska of possessing drug,a pipe for smoking marijuana.an immigration judge concluded that this conviction makes escobar inadmissible,see a a i ii,and an alien who is inadmissible at the time he seeks adjustment of status not only is ineligible for permanent residence,see a a,but also is not entitled to remain in the united states.the ij ordered him removed to mexico,and the board of immigration appeals agreed.
escobar lead argument is that a a i ii is inapplicable because no federal law forbids simple possession of drug bans the import,export,or sale of drug paraphernalia.section a a i ii applies to a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title.as escobar understands this language,the phrase as defined in section of title modifies the entire text of the subsection rather than the immediate antecedent controlled substance.he contends,in other words,that a a i ii operates similarly to a b,which lopez gonzales,d,read to create a rule that drug offenses under state law may be treated as aggravated felonies for immigration purposes only if the deeds also are felonies under federal law.see also united states,cir,rehearing denied,cir.
section a b defines an aggravated felony to include illicit trafficking in a controlled substance including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title the court read the parenthetical phrase to refer to the immediate antecedent and thus to cover only events that are crimes under federal law.in a a i ii,by contrast,the immediate antecedent is controlled substance,and the interpretive stance taken by lopez thus does not assist escobar,for marijuana is a controlled substance under schedule i,c i c,to which points.
no court of appeals has applied the approach to a a i ii.escobar reading is not grammatically sound.v iolation of any law or regulation of a state as defined in section of title would be incoherent.section does not define states or state laws it defines many terms used in title,including the schedules on which controlled substances are listed,but does not say which acts concerning what substances are lawful and which forbidden.the only plausible understanding of a a i ii is that as defined in section of title modifies controlled substance and nothing else.
although a a i ii makes escobar inadmissible,the attorney general may permit some inadmissible aliens to enter or remain in the united states.section,h,is among the grants of discretionary authority.this subsection reads 
the attorney general may,in his discretion,waive the application of subparagraphs a i i,b,d,and e of subsection a of this section and subparagraph a i ii of such subsection insofar as it relates to a single offense of simple possession of grams or less of marijuana if 
b in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse,parent,son,or daughter of a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the attorney general that the alien denial of admission would result in extreme hardship to the united states citizen or lawfully resident spouse,parent,son,or daughter of such alien and 
the attorney general,in his discretion,and pursuant to such terms,conditions and procedures as he may by regulations prescribe,has consented to the alien applying or reapplying for a visa,for admission to the united states,or adjustment of status.
no waiver shall be provided under this subsection in the case of an alien who has been convicted of or who has admitted committing acts that constitute murder or criminal acts involving torture,or an attempt or conspiracy to commit murder or a criminal act involving torture.no waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if either since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony or the alien has not lawfully resided continuously in the united states for a period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the united states.no court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision of the attorney general to grant or deny a waiver under this subsection.
because escobar is inadmissible under a a i ii,a waiver is possible only if his conviction relates to a single offense of simple possession of grams or less of marijuana.the ij and bia concluded that this means that the conviction itself must be for simple possession of marijuana a crime differs from simple possession of marijuana and makes waiver impossible.the board wrapped up despite the fact that this reading might result in harsher results for someone convicted of what might be considered a lesser crime,possession of paraphernalia,than for someone convicted of possession of grams or less of marijuana,the law is quite clear on its face and we apply the law as written.
two preliminary subjects before we take up escobar challenge to this decision.
first,the concluding sentence of the hanging paragraph no court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision of the attorney general to grant or deny a waiver under this subsection.does not foreclose judicial review,because a d adds a proviso constitutional claims or questions of law remain reviewable.escobar wins if h means one thing and loses if it means something different that the sort of legal question to which a d refers.see cevilla gonzales,cir jim√©nez viracacha mukasey,cir.
second,we do not give any special weight to the agency construction of h.that not because we think the statute unambiguous the phrase relates to creates interpretive problems.but the board acting by a single member asserted that the statute is clear,and by forswearing any exercise of administrative discretion the board also disabled its counsel from invoking the principle of chevron natural resources defense council,d.if the board should return to the subject in the future,our opinion as far as we can tell is the first judicial encounter with this not be the last word on the statute administration.see national cable telecommunications association brand x internet services,d.
possessing a pipe for smoking marijuana is a crime within the scope of a a i ii because drug paraphernalia relates to the drug with which it is used,and that statute speaks of a crime relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title.if possession of drug paraphernalia relates to the controlled substance for the purpose of a,why not for the purpose of h the board observation that a conviction for possessing paraphernalia differs from a conviction for possessing marijuana is true,but h is not limited to a conviction for possessing less than grams of marijuana.the phrase is such subsection insofar as it relates to a single offense of simple possession of grams or less of marijuana emphasis added.the board understanding deprives the italicized phrase of any function,treating relates to as if it were is.neither the board opinion nor the brief and argument by the department of justice has suggested what relates to means,or how that phrase can bring a paraphernalia conviction within a a i ii but not h.
consider someone who is arrested while smoking marijuana from a pot pipe at a concert.in most states,that three crimes possessing marijuana,possessing drug paraphernalia,and using drugs in a public place.if the state obtains a conviction for possessing marijuana,then h applies if the alien had grams or less.a gram can of loose tobacco,see top tobacco,north atlantic operating,cir,is sold as enough for cigarettes this implies that grams of marijuana is considerab
