harchenko and his family are natives and citizens of the ukraine.they arrived in the united states in october,with a visitor visa that allowed them to stay until april.on december,harchenko filed a petition for asylum that included derivative petitions for his wife,tetiana harchenko,and son,oleksandr.on march,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause,charging harchenko with deportability for remaining in the united states for a time longer than permitted.
harchenko petition for asylum was denied initially on august.the ij noted that she had some problems with harchenko credibility because his application alleged a fear of persecution on the basis of his jewish ethnicity,while his supplemental application emphasized the likelihood that he would be threatened by criminals if he returned to the ukraine.the ij nonetheless assumed harchenko claims were credible and concluded that he had failed to establish a likelihood of present or future persecution in the ukraine based upon his identity as a member of the jewish faith,or as a jewish national.an order was entered denying harchenko applications for asylum and the withholding of deportation and granting voluntary departure.the order noted that if the r espondents fail to depart when and as required,the privilege of voluntary departure shall be withdrawn without further notice or proceedings and the following order shall become immediately effective r espondents shall be deported from the united states to the ukraine on the charges contained in the orders to show cause.
although harchenko filed a timely notice of appeal with the bia,his brief was not submitted on time and the bia declined to grant an extension.harchenko ins,cir harchenko i.the bia later denied his motion to consider his untimely brief and affirmed the ij decision.id.at.the bia also reiterated the ij earlier grant of voluntary departure t he respondents are permitted to depart from the united states voluntarily within days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director and in the event of failure to so depart,the respondents shall be deported as provided in the original order.this court affirmed the bia decision on november.id.
between the ij initial ruling and the bia decision to affirm,harchenko filed a form application for labor certification as a licensed physical nurse at broadview facility in parma,ohio.this application was approved by the ins on october.in light of the approved labor certification,the harchenkos argued to the ins that they were eligible for an adjustment in status to permanent residents upon the reopening of their deportation proceedings.however,the ins advised them that they were barred from seeking an adjustment of status for five years pursuant to e of the immigration and naturalization act ina,due to their failure to leave the united states following the issuance of the bia may decision granting voluntary departure.
on october,the harchenkos filed an emergency motion to reopen and,in the alternative,to request reinstatement of voluntary departure.the bia concluded that the motion to reopen was untimely and rejected harchenko argument that a final order of deportation did not exist until the period of voluntary departure had expired.harchenko had argued that the period of voluntary departure was tolled while he pursued an appeal of the bia decision affirming the denial of his application for asylum,but the bia noted that the regulatory deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen runs from the date the ij enters an order of deportation,and not from the date the voluntary departure period expires.in the alternative,harchenko had argued that the bia should exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings due to exceptional circumstances,but the bia concluded that harchenko desire to seek an adjustment of status was not an exceptional situation warranting reopening.harchenko also requested reopening on the basis of changed circumstances arising in the ukraine,but the bia found that he had not demonstrated such a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues further at a full evidentiary hearing.finally,the bia denied harchenko request that it reinstate the period of voluntary departure,finding that it lacked the authority to do so because it was denying his motion to reopen.he now appeals from the order denying his motion to reopen and request for voluntary departure.
this court jurisdiction to review the bia denial of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings was altered by adoption of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.prior to,parties who wished to appeal any decision of the bia filed a petition for review in the court of appeals for the circuit in which the administrative proceedings had been held.ina a formerly codified at a.section was repealed by the iirira and replaced with a new judicial review provision codified at,but the repeal applies only to immigration proceedings begun after april.iirira c,a c.the iirira specifically provides for the application of transitional rules in cases in which deportation proceedings were pending before april,and a final deportation order was filed after october.iirira c.because the bia issued its decision on july,and petitioners were placed in proceedings before april,this case is governed by former of the ina,as amended by the iirira transitional rules.
although harchenko asserts eight issues in his brief he is in essence arguing just two points the bia abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen,and if this court affirms the denial of his motion to reopen,it should nevertheless reinstate his earlier grant of voluntary departure.
motion to reopen 
harchenko first challenges the bia denial of his motion to reopen.he argues that the bia erred in concluding that his motion to reopen was untimely,in deciding that he had failed to demonstrate changed country conditions in the ukraine,in declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings,and in finding that it lacked the authority to reinstate voluntary departure.this court reviews the bia denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.ins doherty,d.legal issues are reviewed de novo.see mikhailevitch ins,cir.
under the rules in effect at the time the harchenkos filed their asylum petition,a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the bia had to be filed no later than days after the date of the bia decision.see c.however,the filing deadline does not apply to motions to reopen filed by aliens who are deported in absentia filed by aliens seeking asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed country circumstances jointly filed by the alien and the ins and filed by the ins where the basis of the motion is fraud in the original
