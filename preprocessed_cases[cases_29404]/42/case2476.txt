background 
on april,a united states magistrate judge issued a warrant for pronsivakulchai arrest.in october of,pronsivakulchai was arrested in thailand based on the warrant issued in the united states.she was then incarcerated at lad yao prison in bangkok for seven months until she was extradited to the united states.while she was detained at lad yao,she witnessed rampant corruption,such as open narcotics trafficking and guards forcing inmates to pay for their food or for places to sleep.the prison guards also beat her.
on may,she first appeared in a united states district court for the charges against her.here,the prosecutors and the dea contacted her about assisting with a drug trafficking investigation in thailand.dea agent kirk meyer asked pronsivakulchai to write letters to various people she had met in prison whom the dea believed to be drug traffickers.pronsivakulchai agreed when the prosecutors and the dea told her that if she cooperated,they would help her with her case.
pronsivakulchai wrote in the letters that she had won her case in the united states and offered to buy drugs from these individuals in exchange for cash payments,which the prisoners could use to bribe their way out of lad yao.pronsivakulchai prepared the letters and sent them to agent meyer.he in turn sent the letters on to the targeted individuals imprisoned in thailand.
agent meyer then told pronsivakulchai that he needed her assistance in gathering more information for the investigation.pronsivakulchai agreed and asked her sister,who was still in thailand,to help gather more information on the drug traffickers.she testified that in her hometown,many drug traffickers could be identified by real estate and other luxury items they owned.pronsivakulchai sister collected the addresses of the homes where it appeared the drug traffickers lived.pronsivakulchai then wrote similar letters to these individuals.
specifically,pronsivakulchai wrote a letter to siang yoksap.she knew that yoksap was involved in illegal activity because yoksap had previously attempted to sell pronsivakulchai protection.yoksap was a member of the kon nakorn gang,and was killed three to four weeks after pronsivakulchai gave her letters to agent meyer to send to thailand.shortly after yoksap death,cheet,a member of the kan nakorn gang,came to pronsivakulchai sister home in ranong looking for pronsivakulchai.cheet visited her sister many times to inquire about pronsivakulchai whereabouts.pronsivakulchai believed that these persistent inquiries stemmed from the letters she wrote yoksap as part of the dea investigation.
pronsivakulchai applied for asylum because she believes she will be killed by the individuals she informed on,specifically the thai gangs or drug dealers.she explained that there is rampant corruption in thailand and the gangs and police often share information and work in conjunction with one another.since the gangs operate both in and outside of prison,pronsivakulchai believes that she will likely be killed whether or not she is in prison.
in january of,the prosecutor offered pronsivakulchai a plea deal.she refused to take it because she maintained her innocence.on the day pronsivakulchai case was set for trial,the government moved to dismiss the case against her.after spending three and a half years in jail in both thailand and the united states without being tried for a crime,pronsivakulchai was turned over to the department of homeland security.
on may,pronsivakulchai had a master calendar hearing in immigration court.the government argued that pronsivakulchai was ineligible for asylum because,they claimed,she was a drug trafficker in thailand.as evidence,the government submitted a partial and uncertified translation of a thai warrant.the ij gave the government another opportunity to obtain a certified translation of the thai warrant.the ij also asked for all the documents related to the dismissed criminal case and wanted a dea agent to testify regarding pronsivakulchai help with the dea investigation.
the next master calendar hearing took place on july,and for reasons that are not clear to us,the record contains no transcript of this hearing what we can conclude from the record is that the ij admitted the translated thai arrest warrant over pronsivakulchai objection.the thai warrant,which was issued on april,by a police lieutenant colonel,states that it is for the arrest of vatcharee whose last name is unknown.pronsivakulchai said she had never seen the thai warrant until it was entered as an exhibit in the immigration proceedings against her.since there is no transcript of this hearing in the record,it is unclear if the government complied with the ij request to turn over all the documents against pronsivakulchai in the united states dismissed criminal case.it is also unclear from the record whether the dea agent ever testified regarding pronsivakulchai assistance in the drug trafficking investigation.
pronsivakulchai finally had a merits hearing on her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat,on august.because it was her first merits hearing,pronsivakulchai thought she could present evidence refuting the thai warrant and rebutting the government contention that there was a reason to believe she had committed a crime in thailand.pronsivakulchai tried to present this evidence but the ij refused to consider rebuttal testimony or evidence addressing the government contention that she was inadmissable under section a c of the immigration and nationality act ina as someone they believed was trafficking in narcotics,a c i.the ij made clear that she would not consider testimony addressing pronsivakulchai applications for asylum or withholding of remov
