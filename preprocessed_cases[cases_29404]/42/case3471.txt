after a jury trial in may,espinoza baza was convicted on two counts of violating,which prohibits a deported alien from reentering the united states without the consent of the united states attorney general.espinoza baza now appeals from his conviction and from his subsequent sentence of months imprisonment.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
espinoza baza was born in mexico on july.three years later,his family relocated to the united states,where espinoza baza resided for the next nineteen years.in january,after being convicted on a series of offenses,espinoza baza was deported to mexico.
not long after his deportation,espinoza baza illegally reentered the united states and engaged in more criminal conduct.as a result,following a state conviction for assault with a deadly weapon,espinoza baza was deported for the second time in february.again,however,espinoza baza immediately returned to the united states,where he was apprehended after committing two additional offenses disturbing the peace in october and evading a peace officer in november.
in october,after serving prison time for his offenses,espinoza baza was charged with being an alien found in the united states after having been deported for committing an aggravated felony,in violation of a,b.in a superseding indictment,espinoza baza was later charged with two separate violations of section one count of illegally reentering the united states in and a second count of illegal reentry in early.
espinoza baza case proceeded to trial in may,where one of the primary issues pertained to espinoza baza alienage.at trial,the government introduced evidence that espinoza baza was a mexican citizen and that both of his parents were born in mexico.this evidence consisted of two sworn confessions in which espinoza baza admitted to police and immigration officials that neither he nor his parents were united states citizens.as part of his defense,espinoza baza introduced evidence indicating that he had made inconsistent statements about his mother citizenship status.specifically,espinoza baza introduced notes from a police interview in which an investigating officer noted that the mother might be a united states citizen after espinoza baza expressed uncertainty about his mother citizenship.
after the government rested its case,espinoza baza sought to proffer evidence that his maternal grandfather was born in texas.he also sought to introduce testimony from two of his maternal aunts,who would have testified that espinoza baza mother entered the united states illegally at some unspecified time.according to espinoza baza,this evidence was admissible to show that he might have obtained derivative citizenship through his mother and grandfather.
after considering espinoza baza proffer,the district court excluded this evidence.relying on g,which sets forth the requirements for derivative citizenship,the district court ruled that espinoza baza could qualify for this defense only if his mother had been a united states citizen and had resided in the united states for at least ten years prior to espinoza baza birth with at least five years of residency after she reached age fourteen.because espinoza baza did not introduce evidence linking his grandfather alleged citizenship with these requirements,the district court concluded that this proffer,to the extent it was relevant at all,was of very minimal probative value.the district court therefore ruled,pursuant to federal rule of evidence,that consideration of this evidence by the jury unnecessarily risked confusion of the issues and could have resulted in a verdict based upon mere speculation.
following the district court evidentiary ruling,espinoza baza raised one additional issue pertaining to derivative citizenship.this time,he requested that the court instruct the jury on the defense,arguing that at least some evidence of derivative citizenship had been introduced at trial.the district court,however,disagreed and denied espinoza baza instruction,concluding that the trial record did not contain anything more than a mere scintilla of evidence of derivative citizenship.
at the conclusion of espinoza baza trial,the jury found him guilty on both counts of the superceding indictment,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of vi,the district court calculated the advisory guidelines range to be to months imprisonment.yet,rather than impose a sentence within this range,the district court granted a downward and sentenced espinoza baza to just months.according to the district court,a downward variance was appropriate because espinoza baza had spent almost his entire life in the united states and had become culturally assimilated to life in america.nevertheless,given espinoza baza significant criminal history and because he had reentered the united states illegally on multiple occasions,the district court declined espinoza baza invitation to impose an even lower sentence.
on appeal,espinoza baza challenges the district court evidentiary ruling and its refusal to give a jury instruction pertaining to derivative citizenship.he also contends that his month sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.
the crime of illegally reentering the united states after deportation consists of the following elements the defendant is an alien he was deported and removed from the united states and he thereafter voluntarily reentered and remained in the united states without the consent of the attorney general.united states godinez rabadan,cir see also.this appeal raises two challenges related to the alienage element.first,espinoza baza contends that the district court improperly excluded evidence related to his derivative citizenship defense.second,he argues that the district court erred by rejecting his request for a jury instruction on that defense.
we turn first to espinoza baza contention that the district court improperly excluded evidence related to derivative citizenship.in illegal reentry cases,the government carries the burden of establishing alienage by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.united states smith baltiher,cir.this means that an individual accused of violating section is entitled to put the government to its proof on the issue of alienage and must be permitted to defend himself by seeking to prove that he was not an alien.united states meza soria,cir.a defendant right to present evidence in support of his defense,however,is not without limits.greene lambert,cir.while the constitution prohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote,rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence that is irrelevant,lacking in foundation,or when its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or potential to mislead the jury.holmes south carolina,see also.relevancy,unfair prejudice and jury confusion.
in his appeal,espinoza baza argues that the district court committed reversible error when it excluded evidence suggesting that his grandfather was a united states citizen.this challenge requires us to consider two issues.first,we must determine whether the grandfather alleged citizenship is relevant to the question of alienage.if so,we then must decide whether the district court abused its discretion when it held that the potential for jury confusion outweighed the probative value of this evidence.
under the federal rules,evidence is relevant if is has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.in illegal reentry cases,this means that when a defendant brings forth probative evidence that has a tendency to make derivative citizenship more likely,it is relevant to the issue of alienage.united states sandoval gonzalez,cir.
to determine whether espinoza baza proffered evidence has a tendency to make derivative citizenship more likely,it is first helpful to address the requirements of that defense.see scales ins,cir using t he applicable law for transmitting citizenship that was in effect at the time of an individual birth to determine derivative citizenship.two requirements were necessary for espinoza baza,who was born in wedlock in,to have obtained derivative citizenship one of his parents must have been a united states citizen at the time of espinoza baza birth and this parent must have been physically present in the united states for at least ten years prior to espinoza baza birth,with five of those years occurring after the parent attained the age of fourteen.see g.
in light of our decision in sandoval gonzalez,it is clear that espinoza baza proffer is legally relevant to the issue of alienage.in support of his defense,espinoza baza sought to introduce testimony suggesting that his maternal grandfather was born in the united states.specifically,two of espinoza baza aunts offered to testify that their father grandfather was born in texas and resided there for some unspecified time period before relocating to mexico.we agree with the government that this evidence only indirectly and tangentially relates to the requirements for derivative citizenship the grandfather citizenship provides little in the way of evidence indicating that one of espinoza baza parents was a citizen or that this parent resided in the united states for the requisite time period.nevertheless,under the generous standard articulated in sandoval gonzalez,espinoza baza proffer is legally relevant because a person whose grandfather was born in the united states is more likely to be a derivative citizen than someone whose grandparents were born abroad.
the government contends that espinoza baza evidence is not relevant because it fails to address section g residency requirement.based on decisions from the first and second circuits,the government further asserts that espinoza baza was required to proffer prima facie evidence on both elements of the defense before his proffer would be deemed relevant for purposes of derivative citizenship.see united states guerrier,cir affirming the exclusion of evidence that supported some,but not all,of the requirements for derivative citizenship united states williams,app x,cir concluding that the defendant fail ed to establish a prima facie derivative citizenship claim.while we see some logic in our sister circuits approach that is,requiring illegal reentry defendants to proffer at least some evidence relating to both prongs of the derivative citizenship defense before allowing that evidence to go to the jury our analysis is constrained by sandoval gonzalez.that case leaves us with no choice but to conclude that espinoza baza evidence of his grandfather citizenship was relevant to the issue of alienage.
yet,while espinoza baza evidence is legally relevant,that is not the end our inquiry.under federal rule of evidence,a district court has discretion to exclude even relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
we afford a district court rule determination great deference.united states hinkson,cir.as we explained in kanekoa city and county of honolulu,t rial judges are better able to sense the dynamics of a trial than we can ever be,and broad discretion must be accorded them in balancing probative value against prejudice,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,w here the evidence is of very slight if any probative value,even a modest likelihood of unfair prejudice or a small risk of misleading the jury will justify excluding that evidence.united states hitt,cir.further,given the substantial deference owed to a district court rule rulings,we generally will not disturb such a ruling unless it lies beyond the pale of reasonable justification under the circumstances.united states pineda doval,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
applying these principles,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence suggesting that espinoza baza grandfather was born in the united states.here,we agree with the district court conclusion that the probative value of espinoza baza evidence is,at best,marginal.according to espinoza baza,his grandfather citizenship status gives rise to an inference that he might have obtained derivative citizenship.but,for the jury to plausibly draw that inference,additional facts are necessary.here,there is no indication that the grandfather spent any significant time in the united states following his birth so as to convey derivative citizenship to espinoza baza mother,or that the mother even entered the united states prior to espinoza baza birth or resided here for a sufficient period of time as necessary to convey derivative citizenship to her son.absent these facts,we are left with only speculation,not proof.because the record is devoid of anything that links the grandfather citizenship status with the requirements for derivative citizenship under g,the probative value of espinoza baza evidence is extremely small.see united states acres,cir holding the probative value of excluded evidence to be minimal where there was nothing linking that evidence to the facts at issue rogers raymark,cir given the tenuous link between the proffered evidence and the dispositive issues,the district court could reasonably find that plaintiff proffered evidence had little probative value.
we also agree with the district court conclusion that espinoza baza evidence,if admitted,would have created a substantial risk of confusion and that it might have caused the jury to base its verdict on highly speculative evidence rather than espinoza baza guilt or innocence.see old chief united states,permitting trial courts to exclude evidence pursuant to rule having an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.under our precedent,even a small risk of misleading the jury substantially outweighs the probative value of minimally probative evidence.hitt,at united states gonzalez flores,cir evidence presenting even a modest likelihood of unfair prejudice is high enough to outweigh the probative value of marginally relevant evidence.absent facts connecting espinoza baza evidence with the elements of derivative citizenship,there is at least a modest risk that the jury might be misled into reaching a verdict on pure speculation.thus,because espinoza baza evidence provided only marginal probative value and presented an undue risk of jury confusion,we can not say that the district court decision falls outside the pale of reasonable justification under the circumstances.pineda doval,at.
our conclusion finds additional support here because espinoza baza proffer,on its face,demonstrates that there is no way that he could have obtained derivative citizenship.according to espinoza baza proffered evidence,his aunts would have testified that his mother went to the united states illegally at some point.if espinoza baza mother lacked legal authorization to enter and reside in the united states,then there is no way that she could have been a citizen,derivative or otherwise.obviously,if espinoza baza mother was not a citizen,it follows that she irrespective of the grandfather citizenship status or the duration of the mother residency in the united states could not possibly have conveyed derivative citizenship to her son.under these particular circumstances,the probative value of the excluded evidence is virtually zero.see united states velasques vela,cir holding that proffered evidence arguably relevant to one element of derivative citizenship was properly excluded because that evidence demonstrated clearly that the defendant could not possibly satisfy the other element.
we recognize that the district court conducted its rule analysis without the benefit of our recent decision in sandoval gonzalez.that case holds that a criminal defendant faces no burden whatsoever regarding the issue of derivative citizenship in a prosecution for an offense of which alienage is an element.at.but again,while this language
