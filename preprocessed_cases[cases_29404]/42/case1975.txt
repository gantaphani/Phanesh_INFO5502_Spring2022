javier aparicio,judith rangel and eliseo realzola filed this suit against the immigration and naturalization service ins,and against wiley blakeway,the head of the san antonio ins citizenship branch,kenneth pasquarell,the director of the san antonio ins district,and attorney general janet reno,all in their official capacities only.plaintiffs alleged that the san antonio ins office relied on information in their respective applications for special agricultural worker status while reviewing their applications for naturalization,despite the confidentiality provision set forth in b a i.plaintiffs sought declarative and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class that would have been affected by this policy.because none of the class representatives had been denied citizenship after exhausting the statutorily mandated review process,their suit was dismissed by the district court for lack of jurisdiction.for the same reason,we affirm the dismissal.
background 
a.the applicable laws 
in,congress recognized that a shadow population of millions of illegal immigrants had been living in this country for a number of years.i,at,reprinted in,mcnary haitian refugee center,d.yet,despite their contributions to employers and their communities,these immigrants were victimized because their undocumented status rendered them afraid to seek help from the governmental authorities.i,at,reprinted in.because congress found it undesirable that the ins would spend its resources intensifying interior enforcement or attempting to deport these aliens en masse,they amended the immigration and naturalization act to legalize the immigration status of certain categories of these aliens.this would permit those aliens to openly contribute to american society and allow the ins to focus its efforts on border enforcement.id.the legislation also made the burden on undocumented aliens more onerous by criminalizing the hiring of undocumented workers and denying them many federal welfare benefits.mcnary.at.one subsection of this legislation addressed the fact that producers of perishable agricultural commodities had come to heavily rely upon an undocumented labor force.in order to keep these laborers available for work at these farms but give them the independence to move from job to job at their discretion,congress created the special agricultural worker or saw program.i,at,reprinted in.under the saw program,a worker could apply for temporary resident immigration status during a specified period if he could prove both that he has resided in the united states and that he performed seasonal agricultural services in the united states for at least ninety days during the period from may,to may.see a.after a fixed period of either one or two years,depending on the number of applicants,those temporary resident workers would automatically receive permanent resident status.id.at a.
a prominent feature of the saw statute was its confidentiality guarantee.the government was forbidden to use the information furnished by the applicant pursuant to an application filed under this section for any purpose other than to make a determination on the application id.at b a i.the government could,however,rely on any other information in its file as well as any information it could obtain from another source.id.at b c i.congress did not directly explain the purpose of this provision,but in regard to similar language elsewhere in the legislation congress commented that t he confidentiality of the records is meant to assure applicants that the legalization process is serious,and not a ruse to invite undocumented aliens to come forward only to be snared by the ins.i,at,reprinted in.this confidentiality provision has been strictly construed.in in re masri,int.bia,the board of immigration appeals held that the confidential information could not be used in a later proceeding to rescind permanent resident status,even though the rescission was based on alleged fraud in the saw application process.see also e implementing the statute strictly.
after five years of continuous residence following lawful admission to permanent residence,an alien becomes eligible to apply for naturalization.a.a naturalization applicant must demonstrate,inter alia,good moral character the ability to read,write and speak english and a basic knowledge of united states history and government.see a,a.the applicant also has the burden of proving he was lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence.once the application has been filed,an ins officer interviews the applicant and makes a determination to either approve or deny the application.if the application is denied,the applicant can request a hearing before an immigration officer.a.this second hearing must be before an officer of a higher grade level than the first.b.if the ins again denies the application,or if days elapse from the date of the first determination without the reconsideration taking place,the applicant may seek review of the denial in the united states district court.c.applicants may only appeal to the district court,however,if they either sought administrative review and the application was again denied,or if they sought administrative review and the review was delayed for more than days.id.at d.rather than conducting an administrative review,the district court reviews the case de novo and makes its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.id.
b.the present appeal 
the class representatives 
the three appellant class representatives share a similar story.they are each mexican nationals who applied for and received temporary resident status under the saw program in,and accordingly then received permanent resident status automatically in.they each applied for naturalization in or,and for that purpose were interviewed in and in the san antonio office of the ins.during their interviews,each claims he or she was quizzed extensively about the agricultural work that had qualified him or her for saw status and each claims the ins interviewer had reviewed the confidential information from his or her saw application.for each of them,the interview was followed by a letter from the ins commanding him or her to produce evidence corroborating the legitimacy of his or her agricultural work.
from that point,their experiences diverged somewhat.javier aparicio responded to the letter by filing this class action lawsuit against the ins challenging their practice of reviewing the saw information.the ins reiterated its demand for the corroborating evidence,and aparicio reply informed the ins that he was unable to acquire the information and alleged the request violated the saw confidentiality provisions.on june,the ins informed aparicio that it had independently investigated the lawfulness of his permanent resident status and approved his application for naturalization.this approval came before the district court considered the motion to dismiss at issue in this case.
judith rangel responded to the letter by providing some,but not all,of the requested corroboration.the ins denied her application on october,and she never sought any sort of review of that denial.on june,aparicio amended his lawsuit to include rangel as a class representative.
eliseo realzola received the letter and then submitted the proof he was able to obtain along with explanations why he could not obtain the rest.on october,the ins informed realzola that his evidence was insufficient and ordered him to provide corroboration.he did not do so,and on june,he joined aparicio suit as a class representative.the ins finally approved realzola application for naturalization on february,four months after the present appeal was filed.
the lawsuit 
aparicio filed his class action lawsuit on april,on behalf of himself and the class of persons who received permanent resident status through the saw program and who had applied for or would apply for naturalization through the san antonio ins office.he sued the immigration and naturalization service itself,as well as in their official capacities wiley blakeway,the head of the san antonio ins citizenship branch,kenneth pasquarell,the director of the san antonio ins district,and attorney general janet reno.aparicio alleged the ins use of the confidential saw application information in the naturalization process violated b a i and the constitutional right to due process,and sought a declaratory judgment,an injunction against the further use of the confidential information,and an injunction to reopen all cases affected by this practice that had been denied or withdrawn for lack of prosecution.aparicio then filed for a preliminary injunction against the continued use of the confidential information and moved to certify the class.aparicio aggressively began discovery,but the ins moved for a protective order on the grounds that discovery was premature.the district court granted the protective order on june.on june,aparicio amended his complaint to include rangel and realzola as class representatives.
the district court granted a motion to dismiss the suit on august,holding the plaintiffs claims were unripe because they had not exhausted the statutory appeal procedures before taking their case to the district court.the present appeal followed.
discussion 
this court must consider whether the district court correctly dismissed aparicio suit.we review this decision de novo.see home builders ass city of madison,cir.it is worthwhile to begin by noting that aparicio raises neither a privacy concern nor a challenge to the original process of applying for saw status.aparicio also conceded at oral argument that the ins can investigate whether saw status was properly granted,so long as the ins does not use the information made confidential by b a i.similarly,the ins does not attempt to revoke the saw or lawful permanent residence status of the appellants,and appellants do not contend that it does rather,the ins seeks only to use the confidential application information when and for purposes of determining whether the naturalization applicant was lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence as required for naturalization by.the plaintiffs suit,thus properly understood,challenges only the ins alleged practice of referring to the confidential saw information solely during and for purposes of the naturalization process.may the district court take jurisdiction over this claim given that all three class representatives failed to follow the administrative review process mandated by we hold today that the district court correctly declined jurisdiction.
mcnary haitian refugee center.
the legal issues in this case stand under the shadow of two supreme court cases,the first of which is mcnary haitian refugee center,d.appellants rely on mcnary to support their claim that challenges to ins practices and statutory interpretation lie outside mandatory review provisions.
in mcnary,seventeen unsuccessful saw applicants and two refugee services challenged the procedure by which the ins reviewed saw applications.mcnary.at.the suit challenged ins practices including,inter alia,refusing to show adverse evidence to the applicant,refusing to allow the applicant to rebut adverse evidence,refusing to allow applicants to present witnesses on their own behalf,refusing to provide competent interpreters,and refusing to make a transcript of the hearing.id.at.after the district court entered an injunction against it,the ins appealed,ultimately raising before the supreme court the sole contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case due to the exclusive review provisions in e.id.at.the supreme court rejected the ins contention,finding that the provision only applied to a determination respecting an saw application and a generalized challenge to ins practice was not contemplated by this statutory language.id.at.the court also held the statutory words such denial indicated a singular decision,not a pattern or practice.id.the court found additional support by reasoning that the administrative review process would not generate the type of record necessary for reviewing the plaintiffs claims,and thus congress did not contemplate that procedural and constitutional claims would come within that provision.id.additionally,the court reasoned that the abuse of discretion standard of review mandated by the statute would be improper for the claims raised by the plaintiffs,further indicating that congress never intended for the exclusive review provision to apply to such challenges.id.at.
though it had been the cornerstone of the ins case,the mcnary court distinguished heckler ringer,d on several grounds.in heckler,the plaintiffs had sought review of a medicare policy denying them a particular form of surgery,but the court held the federal courts lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had not followed the administrative review procedures.heckler.at.the mcnary court held the heckler plaintiffs had essentially sought review of the denial of their benefits and a substantive declaration of their rights,which was a direct appeal within the contemplation of the medicare review statute,while the mcnary plaintiffs went outside the saw statute by generally challenging ins practices and merely asking that their case files be reconsidered in light of the newly prescribed procedures.mcnary.at.the court also reasoned that the heckler plaintiffs had been able to receive a meaningful review while the mcnary plaintiffs would not no adequate record was assembled during the ins administrative review process,especially not for the type of challenges being raised by the plaintiffs.id.at.moreover,direct judicial review would have been available only in a deportation proceeding and thus was tantamount to a complete denial of judicial review for most undocumented aliens.id.the court therefore distinguished heckler and affirmed the decision to accept jurisdiction over the case.id.at.
reno catholic social services 
the court revisited mcnary in reno catholic social services,d hereinafter css,the second case affecting our decision today.in css,the court again addressed the effects of the reform of the immigration and naturalization act.the css court addressed two separate challenges to the ins interpretation of the statutory provisions permitting certain undocumented aliens to receive temporary resident status.the first concerned the requirement that the alien show continuous physical presence since a certain date the ins had determined that the statutory exception for brief,casual and innocent absences would only be permitted if the alien had received advance permission from the ins.id.at.the second challenge addressed the requirement that the alien show continuous unlawful residence in the united states during that period,with a statutory exception for certain brief periods.the ins regulations said that an alien who left the country and then reentered by showing facially valid documentation had broken the chain of unlawfulness and therefore could not meet this standard.id.at.in both cases,the ins modified the rule not long after it was initially promulgated.in neither case did the ins appeal the initial determination that the regulations were invalid,but in both cases the ins challenged a later order of the district court seeking to extend the application period because of the error.id.at.the ins argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction due to the restricted judicial review mandated by the act.id.
the court accepted both appeals and decided to vacate and remand.id.the court recognized that the limited judicial review provision,f,was virtually identical to the provision it had interpreted in mcnary two years earlier.accordingly,the court again held that the statutory language a determination respecting an application for adjustment of status and such denial did not describe a challenge to a practice or procedure.id.at.the ins claimed that an action challenging the ins interpretation of a statute was different than the procedural challenge in mcnary,but the court rejected the argument and held the the plaintiffs arguments were not restricted by the limited review provision.id.at.
the court then noted that another jurisdictional hurdle lay in the path of the plaintiffs the ripeness requirement traditionally applied in suits seeking in
