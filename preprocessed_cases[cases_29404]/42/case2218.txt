zainab ali petitioned the immigration and naturalization service for asylum and for protection under the convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.an immigration judge denied the petition,and on appeal the board of immigration appeals affirmed the order.ali now challenges the board finding that she had been firmly resettled in denmark,thus making her ineligible for asylum,and its ruling that she did not warrant protection under the convention.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the board order must be affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
zainab ali is a native and citizen of iraq.in august,immigration and naturalization service officials detained ali for attempting to enter the country without proper authorization.the commenced proceedings to deport ali to iraq for attempting to enter the country without proper authorization and with the aid of a fraudulent document.subsequently,ali filed an application for asylum.after the immigration judge determined that ali was subject to removal for attempting to enter the country with a false danish passport,he proceeded to address ali asylum claim,which was based on the following circumstances.
ali family is shiite muslim,and her father was a member of the opposition wa party in iraq during the.during this period,ali father went into hiding to escape threats and harassment from iraqi authorities,and because of his absence,ali mother was subject to threats and detainment.due to the constant threats and harassment,the family fled iraq in and settled in syria for ten years.in syria,the family rented a home for shelter,ali attended school,and ali father continued his affiliation and activities with wa.because of his political activities,ali father was arrested several times by syrian authorities who endeavored to persuade him to relinquish his political affiliation and spy on iraq.
in,the family returned to iraq to visit ali ailing grandmother and stayed approximately two months,until the iraqi government discovered that they were in the country.according to ali,the government pursued the family in a car chase,during which there was an accident in which ali suffered serious injury,but ali and her family escaped across the border into syria.
the family remained in syria for two months,during which time ali,at the age of,married an iraqi citizen.shortly thereafter,danish authorities accepted the family into denmark as refugees.the danish authorities issued ali and her family passports and residence permits,and her family continues to live in denmark.ali,however,without notification to danish authorities,utilized her danish passport and returned to syria after staying six months in denmark.using an iraqi passport that she obtained during her visit to her grandmother,ali obtained a visa and entered the united states in to visit her husband,who had matriculated at an educational institution in ohio.
ali stayed in the united states for six years,during which time her visa expired,and she gave birth to two children who have united states citizenship.following a visit from her mother,ali and her children went to denmark in april,in response to information from her family that her father was seriously ill.upon arrival,danish authorities confiscated her passport because it had expired.they also informed her that she no longer had refugee status in denmark and that she would be deported.ali applied for asylum in denmark,but her application was rejected.
shortly after her arrival in denmark,ali discovered that the report of her father illness was a ruse designed to persuade her to leave her husband.at one point during her stay in denmark,ali was beaten and kicked by her father and three brothers because she refused to leave her husband.apparently,the danish police arrested the assailants,and an officer questioned ali at a hospital.the danish police report indicates that ali told the police that she did not want her three brothers punished,although she wanted the authorities to admonish her brothers not to contact her any more.ali testified that an officer said that he would instruct ali father and brothers not to bother her or go near her.however,when ali herself requested that her brothers not be punished,the danish chief of police decided not to pursue the case any further and released them from custody.according to ali,after she was released from the hospital,she went to stay with her sister who lived in a location five hours from her parents home.at her sister home,one of ali brothers wielded a gun and threatened to kill her.following this incident,ali obtained the false danish passport and returned to the united states with her children.
the immigration judge denied ali request for asylum and found her ineligible for withholding from removal.on appeal,the board remanded the case and directed the immigration judge to correct some deficiencies in the record and rule on the motion to reconsider.on reconsideration,the immigration judge denied the request for asylum on the basis of his finding that ali had firmly resettled in denmark and thus was not eligible for asylum according to statutory dictate,but he granted her request for withholding of removal to iraq and ordered instead that she be removed to denmark or syria.ali now seeks reversal of the board order affirming that ruling.
discussion 
firm resettlement 
the united states attorney general possesses discretion to grant asylum to any alien she determines to be a refugee,b,and a court may not reverse the attorney general determination unless the decision is manifestly contrary to the law and represents an abuse of discretion.see id.b d.on review,moreover,administrative factual findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.see id.b b.
under the recently enacted illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,an alien may not obtain asylum if she was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the united states.b a vi.immigration regulations further provide that an alien is firmly resettled if,prior to arrival in the united states,he or she entered into another nation with,or while in that nation received,an offer of permanent resident status,citizenship,or some other type of permanent resettlement.but even before the advent of iirira and the express,statutory requirement with respect to resettlement,the supreme court declared that the presence of firm resettlement constituted a factor for mandatory consideration in asylum petitions.see rosenberg woo,d.in woo,the petitioner fled china in and resided in hong kong until when he entered the united states on a visa.the petitioner remained in the united states,allowing his visa to expire.after the commenced deportation proceedings in,the petitioner applied for an immigrant visa claiming a preference as an alien fearing persecution from his communist homeland.id.at.in reviewing the ninth circuit holding that the issue of firm resettlement was irrelevant to the petitioner status,the court noted that the terms firmly resettled and fled are closely related to the central theme of refugee creation of a haven for the world homeless people.id.at.the country asylum laws were enacted to help alleviate the suffering of homeless persons and the political instability associated with their plight.it was never intended to open the united states to refugees who had found shelter in another nation and had begun to build new lives.id.at.as a result,the court held that firm resettlement is one of the factors which the immigration and naturalization service must take into account to determine whether a refugee seeks asylum in this country as a consequence of her flight to avoid persecution.id.
the subsequently imported the proscription into its asylum regulations,and various courts have echoed the rationale of the supreme court opinion in woo,although the issue has not been treated in a published opinion in this circuit.in yang immigration and naturalization service,cir,for example,the petitioners fled laos and took refuge in france,where they remained for years
