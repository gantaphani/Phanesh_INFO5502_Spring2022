yueqing zhang petitions for review of an august,order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming without opinion an august,order of an immigration judge ij denying zhang claims for asylum under a and withholding of removal under b of relevance to this appeal,the ij denied zhang claims for asylum and statutory withholding of removal on the ground that zhang opposition to extortion by corrupt government officials in his home city did not constitute political opinion within the meaning of a and b a.we grant the petition for review and remand for reconsideration of zhang claims because retaliation for opposition to government corruption may,in appropriate circumstances,constitute persecution on account of political opinion within the meaning of those statutes.
background 
zhang claims for relief,as set forth in his written application and his hearing testimony,were based primarily on his opposition to corruption among local government officials in tianjin city,china.in may of,zhang began to help run his father private auto parts business in tianjin.local government officials from the tax bureau and the bureau of industry and commerce extorted approximately yuan renminbi rmb from the company in december and january,demanding payments on various transparent pretexts according to zhang,such extortion of businesses was common in tianjin,and his father had previously complied with similar demands.zhang disagreed with the decision to make the payments,but his father warned him that failure to make them could lead to retaliation by government officials and closure of the business.in may of,a few months after zhang took over management of the company from his ailing father,an official from the tax bureau demanded an additional yuan rmb as a putative loan to defray the expense of the official cousin wedding.zhang refused to make the loan,angering the official.the taxation bureau subsequently closed zhang business for a audit in july of,causing him to lose business.
zhang testified that by the end of he was forced to pay government officials yuan rmb on various other pretexts.frustrated with this extortion,zhang drafted a letter of protest to the mayor of tianjin in january of,alleging that the tax bureau,the bureau of industry and commerce,and the public security bureau were riddled with corruption.he then solicited support from other local business owners,three of whom added their signatures to the letter.zhang claimed that after the four businessmen sent the letter,the officials retaliated against the signatories companies.zhang company lost its tax registration license and a license issued by the bureau of industry and commerce,forcing its closure the other three companies also faced retaliation from the government in the form of fines or forced closures.for the next six months,zhang sought in vain to obtain new permits that would enable him to resume business.on august,he obtained a meeting with guowen rei,an official at the bureau of industry and commerce who was also,zhang later learned,the nephew of the mayor and general secretary of the communist party in tianjin.rei asked zhang for yuan rmb for his child schooling.zhang refused and explained that if rei did not allow zhang company to reopen,zhang would have no means to survive.rei called the police,who forcibly removed zhang from the building and transported him to the local police station.zhang explained to the police that guowen rei had tried to extort money from him and the police demanded that he produce evidence to substantiate the charge.when zhang said he was unable to do so,the police accused him of making false charges and then beat,kicked and shocked him.zhang was then detained for fifteen days for having disrupted the functioning of a government office.
upon his release,zhang consulted several lawyers,all of whom declined to help him.in september of,zhang wrote a letter to the official tianjin newspaper repeating his charges of widespread local corruption and charging that extortion of business owners was common throughout china.the newspaper did not publish the letter.instead,zhang received in response a letter from a reporter telling him that the editor would not publish a critique of public officials.the reporter advised zhang to be careful before taking further action and wished him well,but also told him that he would forward the letter to the public security bureau for the top leader to read.in october of,officials of the public security bureau and the bureau of industry and commerce came to zhang home.after learning that zhang was not at home,the officials told his wife that they wanted him to come to their office to discuss his opinion regarding them.warned by his wife,zhang did not return home after this incident.an acquaintance,who was a court official,also advised zhang that he was in trouble with the nephew of the mayor and general secretary of the communist party in tianjin and that he had better not go home and better run now.zhang traveled to ninjing,where he stayed first with a friend and later in a small hotel.the police continued to look for him at his home in tianjin.concerned that he could not evade public security authorities indefinitely without proper identification,zhang fled to the united states in may of.
once here,zhang participated in the activities of an organization variously identified as either the china refugee council or the china refugee committee,which is opposed to communist rule in china.he learned from his wife that public security officials continued to visit his home.according to an october letter from zhang wife,another signatory of zhang original letter to the mayor made further appeals to authorities in beijing and was subsequently imprisoned for falun gong membership.in july of,zhang wife informed him in a letter that public security officials had returned to his house and taken away letters and photos zhang had sent her regarding his political activities these officials told his wife that they knew that he was colluding with reactionary forces abroad to attack the chinese communist party and central committee.the police treated his wife roughly during this episode.
at the conclusion of zhang hearing,the ij delivered a brief oral decision denying all of zhang claims for relief,which we discuss in detail below.zhang appealed the denial of his claims to the bia,which affirmed without opinion the results of the ij decision pursuant to the regulation,a this timely petition for review followed.

the on account of requirement 
in order to qualify for asylum,an applicant must establish that he or she meets the statutory definition of a refugee contained in a a.see b a the burden of proof is on the applicant for asylum to establish that he or she is a refugee as defined in a.see also islami,at.a refugee is defined in relevant part as a person who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.similarly,an applicant will qualify for withholding of removal only upon a finding that it is more likely than not that the alien life or freedom would be threatened upon removal to a country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a b ramsameachire,at.although the statutory provision governing withholding uses the term because of rather than on account of and does not incorporate by direct reference the definition of refugee in a,we treat as identical the requirement under each statute of showing that persecution relates to an enumerated ground.see,islami,at ramsameachire,at noting that the withholding of removal analysis overlaps factually with the asylum analysis,but involves a higher burden of proof as to the likelihood of future persecution.we therefore discuss only a in the balance of this opinion.
in order to establish persecution on account of political opinion under a,an asylum applicant must show that the persecution arises from his or her own political opinion.ins,d.thus it is not sufficient that the persecutor act from a generalized political motive.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the applicant must also show,through direct or circumstantial evidence,that the persecutor motive to persecute arises from the applicant political belief.id.at.see also zhang slattery,cir t he focus of the statute is on the victim opinion and whether the persecuted is visited by reason of that opinion,abrogated on other grounds by statute,a.it follows from these principles that where the applicant political belief takes the form of opposition to a government policy or practice that is visited on the population at large,mere subjection to that policy or practice will not itself qualify as persecution on account of political opinion.instead,an applicant for refugee status must establish a fear of reprisal that is different in kind from a desire to avoid the exactions however harsh that a foreign government may place upon its citizens.zhang,at.that is,an applicant must establish a fear of reprisal on account of having demonstrated opposition to the government policy 
zhang claim 
zhang principal claim of persecution relates to the consequences of his opposition to the repeated extortionate activity of government he categorized as political in his asylum application as noted above,the ij rejected this claim on the ground that it is not within any of the enumerated grounds set forth in section a.in particular,the ij found that zhang desires to be free from extortion or corruption or blackmail which in the opinion of the court is not a basis for granting relief under section.the acts of extortion,corruption or blackmail are not in the opinion of the court persecution.the ij rejected zhang claim that he attempted to be a whistle blower,holding that his letter writing and attempt to publish a complaint in the newspaper is not in the opinion of the court covered under political opinion of section a.the ij also found that the closure of zhang business,his detention,and the fact that he was sought by the authorities neither constituted persecution nor gave rise to a fear of persecution.
although the logic of the ij holding is not fully apparent from his decision,he appears to have reasoned in two steps,holding first that zhang subjection to extortionate activity was not persecution on account of political opinion,and then holding that zhang public opposition to the government corrupt practices did not constitute political opinion within the meaning of the ina.the first holding,that subjection to extortion is not persecution within the purview of the statute merely because the victim happens to dislike the practice,is consistent with the standard elaborated in and our own caselaw,at.holding that an applicant opposed to conscription by guerillas must show that the guerillas would persecute him because of his political opposition to their cause,rather than because of his refusal to fight with them zhang,at reasoning that an applicant prosecution for noncompliance with a policy of general applicability based on the applicant desire not to have the policy applied to him does not constitute persecution on account of political opinion citing,at.in resting his second holding on the categorical rule that opposition to government extortion can not serve as the basis for a claim based on political opinion within the meaning of the ina,however,the ij both misapprehended the nature of zhang claim and failed to undertake the analysis required by our decision in osorio ins,cir.
in osorio,we rejected an impoverished view of what political opinions are,especially in a country where certain democratic rights have only a tenuous hold.id.at.we held that the bia unreasonably interpreted a in concluding as a matter of law that osorio,a union leader persecuted for his union activity,was not persecuted on account of political beliefs,but merely for economic disputes with the government.id.at.rejecting any distinction between the political and the economic,we found that osorio union activism subjected him to persecution because he and his union posed a political threat to government authority via their organized opposition activities,id.at,and held that such persecution constituted persecution on account of political opinion under a,even though the threat arose from opposition to the government economic policies and even though osorio and the members of his union stood to gain financially from successful opposition to those policies.id.at.we noted that the united nations handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status un handbook provides that 
what appears at first sight to be primarily an economic motive for departure may in reality also involve a political element,and it may be the political opinions of the individual that expose him to serious consequences,rather than his objections to the economic measures themselves.
id.at quoting un handbook,at we held that determining whether a given individual attempt to oppose or alter a government economic practices manifests a political opinion requires examination of the political context in which the dispute took place in order to determine whether the dispute bears a political dimension.id.where the dispute is such that the asylum seeker did not merely seek economic advantage but mounted a challenge to the legitimacy and authority of the ruling regime itself,and where the applicant can show that this political threat is the motive for the persecution perpetrated or feared,the applicant can meet the definition of a refugee.see id.
the ij reasoned conclusorily here that because zhang desire d to be free from extortion or corruption,his activities in opposition to these practices were not covered under political opinion within the meaning of the ina.zhang did not,however,proceed on the theory that his initial unwillingness to meet officials demands to make unwarranted payments constituted an expression of political belief for which he was persecuted.as both his asylum application and his subsequent briefs to the bia and this court make clear,zhang theory of the case is quite different.he argues that the dispute became political when he decided to marshal support from similarly afflicted business owners and to attempt to publicize and criticize endemic corruption extending beyond his own case.zhang argues that at this stage his efforts were transformed from a purely attempt to shield his business from greedy bureaucrats into a challenge to the legitimacy of the municipal government this was the point at which the government closed his business,detained and beat him,and sent public security officials to his home to discuss his opinion of them.on zhang theory,then,what began as an attempt by government officials to extort him became an attempt to repress his challenge to the government legitimacy.it is clear under osorio that if zhang can show that the government acted with the latter motive,his claim is covered under political opinion within the meaning of a 
the government seeks to distinguish osorio on the grounds that,inter alia,it concerned trade unionism in guatemala,a broad social movement which at the time in question w
