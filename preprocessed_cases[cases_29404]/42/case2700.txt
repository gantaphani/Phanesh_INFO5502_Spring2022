reymundo,raymundo martinez,appeals from the sentence imposed by the district court based upon his illegal entry into the united states after deportation.takes issue with three of the district court rulings,which ultimately affected the length of his sentence.we affirm all of the district court conclusions.
background 
a citizen of mexico,had been a lawful permanent resident of the united states.in december of,he was convicted of and sentenced for criminal sexual assault under ilcs a formerly,ch,para.for inserting his finger into his daughter vagina,who was thirteen years old at the time.was deported to mexico on december,for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.
soon thereafter,on april,he was found in winnetka,illinois.in july,he pled guilty to violating for unlawfully reentering the united states without the attorney general permission,but reserved the right to contest whether his prior illinois conviction for criminal sexual assault was indeed an aggravated felony.at his sentencing hearing in november,the district court enhanced his base offense level by sixteen levels because his prior conviction was an aggravated felony,refused to depart downward under because his prior conviction was a crime of violence,and refused to depart downward for conditions of confinement based on his status as a deportable alien.the district court set his sentence at forty one months imprisonment.appeal contests each of these decisions,which are questions of law we review de novo.see united states jaderany,cir united states mcmutuary,cir.
discussion 
sexual abuse of a minor 
challenges the conclusion that his illinois conviction for criminal sexual assault has been labeled as one for sexual abuse of a minor,and is thus an aggravated felony.we agree with the district court and hold that a conviction under ilcs a formerly,ch,para.constitutes an aggravated felony under a.
a assigns a base offense level of eight to a defendant convicted of unlawfully reentering the united states.however,if the defendant prior conviction constitutes an aggravated felony,his or her base offense level will be enhanced by sixteen levels.see b a.application note of references a for the definition of aggravated felony,and a a lists sexual abuse of a minor as an aggravated felony.but,the statutory guidance ends here,for t he phrase sexual abuse of a minor is not defined in a a either expressly or by reference to any other statutory provision.ins,cir.
we have expressed the need for uniformity in determining whether a conviction falls within the federal understanding of the phrase sexual abuse of a minor.uniformity is particularly needed since state and federal classifications and definitions of crimes vary so widely.for example,argues that his conviction was not for sexual abuse of a minor because illinois labels his conviction as one for sexual assault rather than sexual abuse of a minor.we have held that this of no matter.see ins,cir since state definitions vary wildly,how states classify crimes is not determinative see also a the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law.while we did not fashion a formal definition of sexual abuse of a minor in as we did in ins,cir creating a generic federal definition for burglary under a g,and do in,at creating a generic federal definition for theft offense including receipt of stolen property under a g,we have deciphered that congress intended to give a broad meaning to the term sexual abuse of a minor,at accord united states,cir recognizing the differ ing approaches employed in the circuit to testing a prior conviction for aggravated felony status.
further,we have explained that 
i n determining whether congress intended the phrase sexual abuse of a minor to include conduct punished under a particular state statute,we must generally employ a categorical approach that is,we consider only whether the elements of the state offense of which the alien was with the language of the sexual abuse of a minor,rather than whether the alien specific conduct could be characterized as sexual abuse of a minor.
id.at.in,we applied an exception to the categorical approach and held that the defendant convictions under ilcs a and a formerly,ch,a a constituted sexual abuse of a minor,even though neither the statute nor the charging papers revealed the age of the victim,since the record clearly revealed that the victim was old.see id.at.
this case is less complicated than since both the statute of conviction and the charging papers reveal that the victim was a minor and that sexually abused that victim.the statute of conviction,entitled criminal sexual assault,relevantly states a the accused commits criminal sexual assault if he or she commits an act of sexual penetration with a victim who was under years of age when the act was committed and the accused was a family member.ilcs a formerly.ch.the charge of conviction,here the indictment,reads raymundo martinez committed the offense of criminal sexual assault in that he,committed an act of sexual penetration upon the victim,to wit an intrusion in that raymundo martinez inserted his finger into the victim vagina,and the victim was under years of age when the act was committed and raymundo martinez was a family member,to wit father 
the conduct that led to conviction in this case,according to the language of the statute as well as the indictment,was sexual penetration of a victim who was under years of age.black law dictionary provides a generic understanding of the word minor.it defines minor as a n infant or person who is under the age of legal competence in most states,a person is no longer a minor after reaching the age of black law dictionary ed.state conviction squarely fits within the federal understanding of the phrase sexual abuse of a minor,which adopts the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the words.see,at accepting the bia creation of a generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor which was consistent with the ordinary,commonsense meaning of th e phrase united states,cir adopting an ordinary,contemporary,common meaning of the words by examining their dictionary definitions united states,cir adopting the common,everyday meanings of the words sexual and minor and abuse.therefore,conviction was of a crime that constitutes an aggravated felony.
ii.crime of violence 
requested a downward departure under sec,cmt,which permits a departure if the aggravated felony enhancement overstates the seriousness of the defendant prior offense.thus,if the aggravated felony enhancement is applied,
and a the defendant has previously been convicted of only one felony offense b such offense was not a crime of violence or firearms offense and c the term of imprisonment imposed for such offense did not exceed one year,a downward departure may be warranted based on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.
cmt.the district court ruled that was ineligible for such a departure because his prior conviction constituted a crime of violence.application note of refers to a for a definition of crime of violence,which defines it as,in part,any offense under federal or state law,punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
relying on our opinions in xiong ins,cir and united states shannon,cir en banc,argues that his conduct did not create a serious potential risk of physical injury since inserting a finger into a vagina,could not possibly lead to the pregnancy of the child.we understand reliance on xiong and shannon,for they are among the only cases on this subject in our circuit.however,we find both distinguishable.
in both cases the crime of conviction was classified as statutory rape.see xiong,at shannon,at.in shannon,we rejected the government contention that any sex act with a minor should be per se classified as a crime of violence.see at.the defendant had violated.stat,which forbade sexual contact or intercourse with victims under sixteen years of age.see id.at.in holding that a violation of the statute was not per se a crime of violence,we determined that eng
