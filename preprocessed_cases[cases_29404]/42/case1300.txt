opinion of the court 
petitioner contests the reinstatement of a old order of removal,challenging both its legal and factual bases.given the nature of the reinstatement procedure,the record before us is,not surprisingly,sparse and,in the ordinary case,might nonetheless be sufficient for us to perform the full judicial review we are required to perform.but petitioner,with some support in even that sparse record,has raised questions which,with further development of the facts,could lead to a different result.he also challenges the regulation that applies to a reinstatement determination,a challenge we reject.we will,however,vacate the reinstatement determination itself and remand so that the relevant facts can be developed and the open questions answered.
factual background 
petitioner renato manuel da costa is a native and citizen of portugal.in,at age nine,he entered the united states with his family as a lawful permanent resident.shortly thereafter,he and his family left the country for bermuda,apparently relinquishing their lawful permanent resident status.in,now age fourteen,returned,with his family,to the united states as a visitor,and overstayed his visa.removal proceedings were initiated against him and his family in.
in,an immigration judge found that the family was subject to removal,and granted them the right to depart voluntarily by july.they did not do so,and asserts that the order of removal was judicially invalidated at some later point.some support for that assertion is the fact that on october,applied for a new alien registration receipt card,which application was granted in early.it was noted on the application,presumably by the examining immigration officer,that original green card was seen and destroyed on.the assertion is also supported by the fact that in april,went to canada to attend a wedding,and reentered the united states four days later using his green card.this reentry occurred without incident.finally,we note,it does not appear that any member of his family has been removed pursuant to the order of removal over these many years.
on march,and his brother,helder,filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and petition for writ of habeas corpus with stay of deportation in the district court for the district of connecticut,naming the department of justice and john weiss,the officer in charge of the immigration and naturalization service in hartford,connecticut,as defendants.a stay of deportation was granted that same day by the dominic squatrito,a motion for the review of bond was denied on march,and,for reasons unknown,the case was dismissed on march.
it may well have been the filing of that complaint that prompted the investigation of status and the affidavit of his girlfriend attesting to his trip to and from canada in april.based on that affidavit,on march,a warrant for deportation was issued with the notation that he was to be put in proceedings anew.query whether proceedings anew would have been necessary had the removal order not been invalidated.
in any event,for twelve years after the warrant for deportation issued and for fifteen years after reentered from canada,nothing relevant to his immigration least,nothing of which we to have happened.then,in april,immigration and customs enforcement ice issued a notice that it intended to reinstate the old order of removal,perhaps having been roused after all of those years when notified of one or more of with the law.the stated grounds for reinstatement were that voluntarily departed the united states pursuant to an order of removal when he left the country for the visit to canada,and that he illegally reentered the united states four days later.acting through an immigration officer,ice determined that order of removal was subject to reinstatement,and thus that he should be removed.this petition followed.
ii.discussion 
in,congress changed the manner in which reinstatements of orders of removal are handled.in relevant part,the new statute reads 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this act,and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
under the relevant regulation interpreting the statute,an alien subject to reinstatement has no right to a hearing before an immigration judge.a.to effectuate reinstatement,an immigration officer must find that the alien was subject to a prior order of removal the alien is the same person as the one named in the prior order,confirmation of identity and the alien unlawfully reentered the country.see id.a.in determining whether the alien unlawfully reentered the country,the immigration officer shall consider all relevant evidence,including statements made by the alien and any evidence in the alien possession.the immigration officer shall attempt to verify an alien claim,if any,that he or she was lawfully admitted id.a.the regulation also provides the alien with notice,and allows for him or her to make a written or oral statement contesting the determination.id.b.
a.the challenge to the reinstatement procedures 
challenges the reinstatement procedures on two grounds first,he asserts that the regulation promulgated by the attorney general constitutes an unreasonable and thus impermissible construction of a and second,he asserts that the regulation violates due process.
the regulation is a reasonable construction of the statute 
every court of appeals to have considered the issue has concluded that the regulation constitutes a reasonable construction of a we agree.under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,we are required to determine,as an initial matter,whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.congress has not done so here,for the statute does not specify the procedures to be used to reinstate a prior order of removal.accordingly,we proceed to the second prong of chevron,and determine whether the regulation promulgated by the attorney general is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
primary complaint is that the regulation does not provide for a hearing before an immigration judge.see a providing that an alien subject to a reinstatement determination has no right to a hearing before an immigration judge.he argues that the statutory scheme must be interpreted to provide for a hearing by an immigration judge because of the exclusivity clause of.indeed,does state that a n immigration judge shall conduct all proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.moreover,provides that u nless otherwise specified under this chapter,a proceeding under this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be admitted to the united states,or,if the alien has been so admitted,removed from the united states.
on their face,these statutory provisions would appear to govern reinstatement determinations,as such determinations involve the deportability of an alien and can result in his or her remov al from the united states.id.however,in line with the other courts that have considered this issue,see supra note,we conclude that a,the sole statute dealing with reinstatement determinations,is an otherwise specified exception to the exclusivity clause.
section a makes quite clear congress intent to expedite and streamline reinstatement determinations.see a providing that an order of removal is not subject to being reopened or reviewed at a reinstatement determination,disallowing relief under this chapter,and declaring that the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.the attorney general concluded that the goal of streamlining would be advanced by providing aliens with review only by an immigration officer.
this conclusion is reasonable in light of the circumstances presented by reinstatement determinations aliens subject to reinstatement have already bee
