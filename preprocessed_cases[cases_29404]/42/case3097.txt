at a hearing before an immigration judge,testified that in,at the age of,she illegally entered the united states with her mother.she asserted that from until,she and her mother resided in california in the home of a friend named luz rodriguez,along with rodriguez husband and three children,helping with the house work and making tamales.said that throughout those nine years she could not speak english,did not go to school,never saw a doctor,and left the house only to go to one nearby store,though she could not recall its name.

before issuing an oral ruling,the immigration judge notified and her attorney that he had serious doubts concerning whether she met the seven year continuous physical presence requirement to make her eligible for suspension relief.counsel proffered no further evidence or testimony on her physical presence other than own uncorroborated testimony.the record before the immigration judge contained no correspondence from any family or friends to support her testimony that she continuously resided in the united states prior to.while her mother was available to testify,counsel never called upon her to do so.
the immigration judge noted that statements in medical records were inconsistent with her assertion of continuous physical presence prior to.the statements indicated that she had used some medication from mexico and had been on some medication in mexico before she became pregnant in.the immigration judge found that in light of the lack of any documentary support for her claim and the contradictory statements in her medical records,had not established that she was continuously present in the united states for seven years immediately preceding her application for suspension of deportation.thus,on april,the immigration judge denied her request for suspension of deportation and granted her a voluntary departure,requiring to leave the united states within thirty days.
filed an administrative appeal.during the pendency of the administrative appeal,she also filed a motion to reopen or remand,attempting to present new evidence to corroborate her claim of continuous physical presence.her supposedly new evidence consisted of some correspondence allegedly from the.she also asserted that the immigration judge erred by not considering an affidavit from rodriguez,the woman in california with whom purportedly lived during the.the bia found no error in the immigration judge determination that did not meet the seven year continuous presence requirement.additionally,the bia denied the motion to reopen or remand,finding that the newly submitted letters were not new evidence and that in any event,all postmarks but one dated were illegible.the bia considered the affidavit of luz rodriguez but concluded that it was of little probative value in view of the apparent disappearance of the affiant.petitioner app.at.then sought judicial review in this court and simultaneously filed a motion to reconsider with the bia.we granted a stay of deportation pending our review of the case and held the initial petition for judicial review in abeyance pending the bia decision on the motion to reconsider.
in her motion to reconsider,urged the bia to reconsider whether she now met the seven year continuous presence requirement,having been in minnesota from through.relying on two of its own previous decisions,the bia denied the motion to reconsider.specifically,the bia determined that the amendments made by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,to codified as amended in scattered sections of and the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of nacara,stat,codified as amended in scattered sections of apply to stop the accrual of the seven years once an order to show cause has been served,citing matter of nolasco,interim decision bia.the bia also concluded that an alien may not begin to accrue the requisite seven years after the order to show cause has been served,citing matter of,interim decision bia.
sought judicial review of the denial of her motion for reconsideration.we consolidated this petition with her original petition for judicial review.
we examine the bia factual findings under a substantial evidence standard of review.tang ins,cir.first argues that the bia erred in affirming the immigration judge determination that she did not meet the seven year continuous physical presence requirement between the years of and.she argues that the bia should have given full weight to the affidavit of luz rodriguez,with whom she purportedly lived throughout that time.the affidavit states that carmen corona the petitioner mother and her daughter lived in rodriguez home from june to august.this affidavit was apparently used in relation to the mother removal proceedings and is dated august.in its opinion,the bia said that it did consider the affidavit,but we find that it has little probative value in view of the apparent disappearance of the affiant.petitioner app.at.
we find no reversible error in the bia decision to consider but grant little probative weight to this affidavit.for whatever reason,rodriguez could not be located.the affidavit had been signed in connection with another proceeding in,seven years before the bia decision in this case.additionally,no other evidence exists to corroborate assertion that she lived in california for those nine years in the.she said she went out only to go to one particular store during the entire time she lived there but she could not remember the name of the store,she never went any other places,and she never even went for a ride in a car with rodriguez.despite her allegedly secluded life,however,the record is clear that she conceived a child with a man from mexico city in,and her medical records bear indications that she may have been in mexico shortly before this.we see no reason to ascribe any more weight to the rodriguez affidavit than the bia was willing to give it.
mother was available to testify that she and her daughter lived continuously in california during the,but she was not called upon.blames this lack of evidence on the immigration judge,whom she asserts put off ruling on the matter.the bia found that the failure to present the mother testimony resulted in insufficient evidence supporting explanations of the medical material that contradicted her claim of continuous physical presence.
