venancio rojas pedroza challenges his conviction and sentence under a and b for being an alien found in the united states after removal.we hold that the district court was correct to reject rojas collateral challenge to the validity of the removal order underlying his b sentencing enhancement.we also reject rojas arguments that the district court violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation by admitting documents from his immigration file,and his claims that the district court erred procedurally and substantively in imposing a sentence.
we begin with an overview of rojas relevant immigration and criminal background before turning to the proceedings in this case.
rojas entered the united states illegally in,when he was fourteen.the record shows that since that time,he has lived intermittently in the united states,but never had legal status his parents and his two daughters live in mexico,although several of his siblings reside in the united states.
when in the united states,rojas was convicted of a number of criminal offenses.in october,he was convicted of unlicensed driving,possession of an open container while driving,and the failure to pay a fine.in april,he was charged with and later convicted of driving under the influence.in august,he was convicted of unlicensed driving.in march,he incurred a second conviction for driving under the influence.finally,in september,he was convicted of aiding and abetting the transportation of illegal aliens in violation of a a ii and a a v ii,which is an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.a n.as a result of that conviction he was sentenced to two years in prison and two years of supervised release 
in addition to these criminal convictions,rojas was removed or deported from the united states on five occasions june,february,november,may,and april.rojas illegally returned to the united states after each of these removals or deportations.
during the hearing for the june removal,rojas admitted to entering the united states illegally.after concluding that rojas was removable,the ij considered whether he was eligible for relief from removal,including voluntary departure.in response to the ij questions,rojas and his attorney stated that rojas did not have any convictions that he had never been to jail,that his special agricultural worker application had been denied,that he was unmarried,that he did not have any children,and that his family was in mexico.the ij ordered rojas removed and denied his request for voluntary departure based upon rojas lack of ties to the united states.
rojas reentered the united states illegally after the june removal and was detected in the country again in.at the hearing for his february removal,rojas correctly informed the ij that he had been kicked out in june,but he also erroneously stated that he had been granted voluntary departure instead of being removed.based on rojas illegal,the ij found him removable.the ij then asked rojas a series of questions to determine whether he was eligible for relief from removal.in response to these questions,rojas stated that his parents were not united states citizens or legal residents,that he was not married,and that he did not have children who were united states citizens.the ij ordered rojas removed,and determined that rojas was ineligible for voluntary departure because he had previously been granted voluntary departure,and then illegally returned.
rojas again returned to the united states illegally.in october,rojas removal order was reinstated and used as a basis for a subsequent removal in april.
we now turn to the proceedings in this case.after his april removal,rojas was again found in the united states illegally,and the government indicted him in august under a and b relevant here,a provides criminal penalties for an alien who was deported or removed from the united states and thereafter enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in,the united states without the express consent of the attorney general.section b establishes enhanced penalties for an alien who was described in a and whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.in other words,under a and b,an alien is guilty of illegal reentry and subject to enhanced penalties if the alien was convicted of an aggravated felony,subsequently removed from the united states,and thereafter illegally reentered or was found in the united states.see united states covian sandoval,cir.
the indictment charged rojas under a and b,and alleged that rojas was an alien who had been removed from the united states after december,and was subsequently found in the united states.these allegations supported both the government a charge which required proving that rojas was removed from the united states and subsequently found in the united states and its b charge which,under b,required proving that rojas removal from the united states occurred after his conviction for an aggravated felony in september.
before trial,rojas moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his april removal was invalid.because the april removal was the only removal that occurred after his conviction for an aggravated felony in september,it was necessary to support the sentencing enhancement under b.
after the district court denied this motion,rojas filed a second pretrial motion to bar the admission of documents from the individual case file maintained by the department of homeland security referred to as an alien file or a file for the purpose of proving alienage.the documents at issue here are a warrant of,a notice of to reinstate prior order,and an order of the immigration judge.the warrant of states that rojas,who entered the united states at otay mesa,ca on december,is subject to from the united states,based upon a final order by an immigration judge in exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings.the warrant is signed by an ins official.the back of the warrant contains information t o be completed by the service officer executing the warrant.it lists the port,date,and manner of removal,includes a photo and a fingerprint with the captions photograph of alien removed and right index fingerprint of alien removed,respectively,and is signed by a different ins official.
the second document at issue,the notice of to reinstate prior order,consists of two parts.the first part notified rojas that he was an alien subject to a prior order of deportation exclusion removal entered on february,that he was removed on may,and that he illegally entered in.it also contains rojas signature,indicating that he was not contesting this information.the second part of this document records the immigration officer final decision that rojas was subject to removal.
the third document at issue,the order of the immigration judge,summarizes the ij oral decision from rojas proceedings.the written order contains boxes indicating that rojas was ordered removed from the united states to mexico,and that his application for voluntary departure was denied.the document also states that rojas waived appeal.
the district court denied rojas motion to suppress these documents.rojas proceeded to trial and the jury convicted him on all counts.
at sentencing,rojas argued that he was entitled to a sentencing guidelines adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he admitted he was a mexican citizen when apprehended and later admitted to immigration agents that he had been previously deported or removed.the district court declined to make a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,stating that rojas did not accept responsibility,he elected to stand on his constitutional rights,hold the government to its burden of proof to establish beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements in the allegation.in particular,the district court noted that rojas had challenged whether he had actually been removed,given that the government agent who effectuated the removal and witnessed rojas cross the border had inadvertently failed to sign the witness of departure line in rojas warrant.
as a result of the conviction,rojas was sentenced to months imprisonment,followed by three years of supervised release.the district court also revoked rojas supervised release from his conviction for aiding and abetting the transportation of illegal aliens,and sentenced him to an additional months custody to be served consecutively to his sentence.rojas timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction over rojas appeal of his conviction and the district court revocation of supervised release under.united states vallee,cir.we have jurisdiction under to review rojas sentence.united states juan,cir.
we begin with rojas appeal of the district court denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.rojas challenge to the indictment is based on his claim that the april removal is invalid.he reasons as follows the april removal is a reinstatement of the removal order the removal order is invalid because the ij in the removal proceeding did not advise rojas of his eligibility to apply for relief under a generally referred to as voluntary departure and because the removal order is invalid,it can not support the april reinstatement.we review the district court rejection of this argument de novo.united states gonzalez valerio,cir.
as a threshold matter,we note that even if rojas succeeded on his collateral challenge to the april removal order,it would not affect the indictment a charge.
although rojas collateral challenge to his prior removal order,if successful,would preclude the government from relying on that removal at trial,united states medina,cir,it would not necessarily invalidate the indictment.generally,an indictment is sufficient so long as it sets forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense.united states milovanovic,cir en banc.however,where a defendant is successful in collaterally attacking the only prior removal that supported the government case,we have held that dismissal of the indictment is appropriate.see,united states camacho lopez,cir.this is because,under those narrow circumstances,there would be no question that the government lacked the evidence to convict the defendant.see united states phillips,cir noting that a district court may dismiss an indictment where the facts are undisputed see also united states mendoza lopez,d.
the result is different in this case.here,the indictment tracks a elements by alleging that rojas was an alien who was deported or removed from the united states and was subsequently found in the united states without authorization.the indictment does not rely on a particular removal for the a charge,and at trial the government introduced and relied on evidence of rojas removal order as well as the april removal to prove the elements of the a charge.because the government relied on removals other than the april removal to support its case,we reject rojas argument that the court erred in not dismissing the a charge in the indictment.
we must still consider,however,whether the district court erred in not dismissing the b charge in the indictment.see united states grace,cir recognizing that an indictment may be dismissed in part.
in order to subject a defendant to b enhanced penalties,the government must allege in the indictment and prove at trial that the defendant was removed after a particular date.united states contreras hernandez,cir to that end,the indictment alleged that rojas was removed from the united states subsequent to december.because it is undisputed that the april removal was the only removal that occurred after this date,the government can not prove the b charge if rojas successfully challenges that removal.accordingly,we turn to rojas collateral challenge to the april removal,which was based on a reinstatement of the removal order.
in order to make a collateral challenge to a prior removal or deportation order,a defendant must satisfy d,which requires the defendant to demonstrate that the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d 
under our case law,a defendant can meet all these requirements by establishing that the ij failed to inform the defendant of his or her apparent eligibility for relief as required by a and that the defendant had plausible grounds for relief.see united states vidal mendoza,cir.
we recently explained why an ij failure to inform an alien regarding apparent eligibility for relief fulfills the requirements of d and,and part of d.id.first,the ij error excuses the alien from the administrative exhaustion requirement of d,because we deem the alien waiver of the right to an administrative appeal to have been insufficiently considered and intelligent.id.at quoting united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.second,the same failure to inform an alien regarding apparent eligibility for relief also deprive s the alien of the opportunity for judicial review,d,because an alien who is not made aware that he has a right to seek relief necessarily has no meaningful opportunity to appeal the fact that he was not advised of that right.united states arrieta,cir.finally,this same error partially satisfies the requirement of d,that the entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair.a removal order is fundamentally unfair,if the alien due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.ubaldo figueroa,at internal quotation marks omitted.we have concluded that an ij failure to advise an alien of apparent eligibility to apply for relief is a due process violation,united states lopez yelasquez,cir en banc,and thus satisfies the first prong of d.
for purposes of this analysis,eligibility for relief is apparent where the record,fairly reviewed by an individual who is intimately familiar with the immigration laws,raises a reasonable possibility that the petitioner may be eligible for relief.lopez yelasquez,at internal quotation marks omitted.this inquiry focuse s on whether the factual circumstances in the record before the ij suggest that an alien could be eligible for relief.id.at.because ijs are not expected to be clairvoyant,we have explained that an ij need not advise an alien of possible relief when the record lacks such a factual basis.id as a result,u ntil the alien himself or some other person puts information before the judge that makes such eligibility apparent,the ij duty to advise the alien does not come into play.id.
where an ij failed to advise an alien of his or her apparent eligibility for relief,a,the alien must still establish prejudice under the second prong of d.this requires the alien to make an additional showing and demonstrate plausible grounds for relief.gonzalez valerio,at.where the relevant form of relief is discretionary,the alien must make a plausible showing that the facts presented would cause the attorney general to exercise discretion in his favor.united states barajas alvarado,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether the alien has made this showing,we apply a process.first,we identify the factors relevant to the ij exercise of discretion for the relief being sought.see id.at.next,we determine whether,in light of the factors relevant to the form of relief being sought,and based on the unique circumstances of the alien own case,it was plausible not merely conceivable that the ij would have exercised his discretion in the alien favor.id.at internal quotation marks,alterations,and citation omitted.in making this determination,we are not concerned with general statistics.id.instead,we focus on whether aliens with similar circumstances received relief.see id.at.
we applied this approach in barajas alvarado.there,the defendant argued that the ij erroneously failed to inform him about the opportunity to withdraw his application for admission.id.at.because an immigration officer authority to grant this relief is discretionary,we began by identifying the factors relevant to the exercise of such discretion.id.in this regard,we noted that the field manual applicable to immigration officers set forth six factors,including seriousness of the immigration violation,previous findings of inadmissibility,and intent to violate the law.id.at.we next considered the specific circumstances of the defendant case.there,the defendant had conceded that he deliberately presented false documents,had been removed twice,and had been subject to multiple findings of inadmissibility.id.at.applying the relevant factors to the specific circumstances of the defendant case,we concluded that it was not plausible that the ij would have exercised discretion in the defendant favor.id.at.in doing so,we rejected the defendant argument that it was plausible he would have received discretionary relief as a matter of statistics,id.at,and noted that we had previously considered statistical evidence that ijs grant discretionary relief applications fifty percent of the time to be insufficient to show plausibility of relief.id.quoting united states corrales beltran,cir.finally,we rejected as inapposite the alien citations to two cases in which an alien presented false documents and was granted withdrawal.id.at.because those cases involve d aliens in very different factual circumstances,and the courts in those cases neither addressed nor explained why the alien was granted withdrawal relief,we held that they did not help the defendant carry his burden of showing it was plausible he would have been granted relief in his unique circumstances.id.
we now apply d requirements to rojas challenge to his removal order.
pursuant to d,we begin by considering whether rojas adequately established that the ij failed to inform him of relief for which he claims he was apparently eligible.here,the record is ambiguous.during the proceedings,rojas informed the ij that,during the proceeding he had signed his voluntary deportation.based on this testimony,an individual who is intimately familiar with the immigration laws,lopez velasquez,at internal quotation marks omitted,could reasonably conclude that rojas was not eligible for voluntary departure in because he had previously received voluntary departure.see c nevertheless,the record also contained information suggesting that rojas had not received voluntary departure in.specifically,the government lawyer noted that rojas file reflects a removal on june.
in light of the ambiguity in the record regarding whether rojas had apparent eligibility for relief which would satisfy d and and the first component of d,we instead resolve rojas collateral challenge based on the more straightforward inquiry raised by the second component of d whether rojas was prejudiced by the ij failure to inform him of the possibility of applying for that relief.
because voluntary departure is a form of discretionary relief,we apply barajas alvarado test in determining prejudice.
under the first step of this test,we identify the factors relevant to a discretionary grant of voluntary departure.barajas alvarado,at.the bia has long established that i n exercising discretion on a voluntary departure application an ij should take into account both favorable and unfavorable factors.see matter of gamboa,bia citing cases.the bia has consistently maintained this approach.see matter of arguelles campos,bia explaining that in deciding whether an alien warrants a favorable exercise of discretion with respect to voluntary departure,an ij should weigh both favorable and unfavorable equities see also matter of loera,wl bia.favorable equities include long residence,close family ties to the united states,and humanitarian needs.arguelles campos,at accord gamboa,at loera,wl.unfavorable equities include the nature and underlying circumstances of the deportation ground at issue additional violations of the immigration laws the existence,seriousness,and recency of any criminal record and any other evidence of bad character or the undesirability of the applicant as a permanent resident.arguellos campos,at accord gamboa,at noting unfavorable factors including the alien prior immigration history,the nature of his entry or entries his violations of the immigration and other laws,and the like.
having identified the relevant factors,we now apply them to the unique circumstances of rojas case as of.barajas alvarado,at.although rojas came to the united states in,there is no evidence that he continuously resided in this country.to the contrary,rojas admits that he lived off and on in the united states.at the hearing,he stated that he had no immediate family who were united states citizens or residents.the record as of also showed that rojas had a number of negative equities.his immigration history would have reflected two illegal entries,one in and a second entry in july,just one month after his june removal.in addition,rojas had four misdemeanor convictions for driving offenses between and,including two convictions for driving under the influence.
based on these factors,it is not plausible that an ij would have exercised discretion in rojas favor at his hearing.the record showed no positive equities,other than rojas intermittent stays in the united states by contrast,the record showed numerous negative equities,including his illegal entries and convictions.in particular,the bia has noted that driving under the influence is a serious negative factor.matter of romero reyes,wl bia,matter of butt,wl bia june.
our review of bia cases supports the conclusion that rojas lacked a plausible case for relief we note that the bia has affirmed denials of voluntary departure in a number of cases in which the aliens had equities better than or similar to rojas equities.see,matter of posadas posadas,wl bia,affirming a denial of voluntary departure as a matter of discretion where the alien was arrested twice for driving on a suspended license and once for driving under the influence,but had family ties to the united states matter of martinez hernandez,wl bia,affirming a denial of voluntary departure as a matter of discretion where the alien had no criminal history but also no positive equities matter of herrera lopez,wl bia,affirming a denial of voluntary departure as a matter of discretion where the alien had convictions for public nuisance,domestic battery,and possession of an open container in a vehicle,and the alien misrepresented his criminal history to the ij matter of serna,bia affirming a denial of voluntary departure as a matter of discretion where the alien had a single conviction for the possession of an altered immigration document,but had been residing in the united states for seven years and intended to marry a united states citizen with whom he had a child matter of lemhammad,bia affirming a denial of voluntary departure as a matter of discretion where the alien had accepted money to take the exams of three college students and had a single assault conviction that resulted in a two day jail sentence,but had a united states citizen brother,desired to complete his education in the united states,and had entered the united states legally.
in cases where the bia reversed a denial of voluntary departure,the aliens equities were more favorable to them than rojas.see,matter of hernandez mata,wl bia,reversing a denial of voluntary departure where the alien was arrested for intoxication,but had two united states citizen children and other family in the united states matter of maldonado hernandez,wl bia,reversing a denial of voluntary departure when the alien was years old,had lived in united states for ten years,and had no criminal record matter of hernandez garcia,wl bia,reversing a denial of voluntary departure where the alien impersonated a united states citizen in attempt to procure a passport,but whose spouse and child were united states citizens.
although rojas points to cases in which aliens with serious criminal histories received voluntary departure,those cases involved aliens with significant family ties and other positive equities that rojas lacks.for example,in matter of gonzales figeroa,wl bia,an alien with multiple assault convictions was granted voluntary departure.but in addition to a long history in the united states,the alien in gonzalez figeroa also had a sister and two nieces who were united states citizens,a mother who was a permanent resident whom the alien helped with rent and medical expenses,no other adverse immigration history,and a pending visa application.id.similarly,in matter of battista,bia,an alien convicted of breaking and entering,grand theft,and possession of criminal tools was granted voluntary departure,but he had a united states citizen spouse who was pregnant at the time of the deportation hearing,united states citizen parents,and united states citizen siblings.
indeed,the history of this very case confirms our conclusion that rojas did not have a plausible claim for voluntary departure in.in june,the ij declined to grant rojas voluntary departure even though the ij was not aware of rojas criminal history and rojas had only one illegal entry at the time.by the hearing,rojas had an additional illegal entry,which occurred in july.given that the first ij declined to grant rojas voluntary departure,it is not plausible that the second ij,after learning of rojas additional unfavorable equities,would have granted rojas voluntary departure in.
in short,when considered in light of the relevant factors,rojas equities would not have caused an ij to grant him voluntary departure in.therefore,we conclude that rojas failed to carry his burden of establishing plausible grounds for relief.for this reason,rojas has failed to show he suffered prejudice as a result of the ij not informing him of the availability of voluntary departure.because rojas was not prejudiced,the removal order was not fundamentally unfair,and he can not satisfy d.see ubaldo figueroa,at.accordingly,the district court did not err in rejecting rojas motion to dismiss the b charge in the indictment.
we now turn to rojas challenge to the district court denial of his motion in limine to bar the admission of several statements contained in documents from his.he contends that these statements were testimonial and were thus admitted in violation of the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.we review the district court admission of the challenged statements de novo.united states nguyen,cir.
the confrontation clause provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.this means that testimonial statements are inadmissible in criminal prosecutions unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant.crawford washington,d.a statement is testimonial when it is made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.melendez diaz massachusetts,d internal quotation marks omitted.applying this principle to records in an alien,we have explained that the mere possibility that a record could be used in a later criminal prosecution does not render it testimonial.united states orozco acosta,cir.rather,there must be some additional showing that the primary purpose of the document is for use in litigation.see id.the primary purpose of a statement is determined objectively.michigan bryant,d.thus,the relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter,but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had,as ascertained from the individuals statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.id.
in orozco acosta,we held that warrants of removal are not made in anticipation of litigation but are prepared to record the movements of aliens.at.we have since extended orozco acosta to a number of other documents,concluding that they are likewise not made in anticipation of litigation and thus are.see united states valdovinos mendez,cir holding that the warrant of removal,warning to alien ordered deported,and order from the immigration judge,were.
rojas contends that orozco acosta approach is inconsistent with the supreme court subsequent decisions in bryant and bullcoming new mexico,d.according to rojas,orozco acosta erroneously applied a subjective test to decide whether documents are prepared in anticipation of litigation failed to take into account the formal context in which immigration records are prepared and improperly focused on the testimonial status of the documents as a whole.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
first,rojas claims that because bryant and bullcoming prescribe an objective test to determining whether documents are prepared in anticipation of litigation,they overruled orozco acosta,which,in his view,adopted a subjective test.we disagree,because orozco acosta applied the correct objective approach to determining the status of documents.as we explained in orozco acosta,because a warrant of removal must be prepared in every case resulting in a final order of removal and only a small fraction of these warrants ultimately are used in immigration prosecutions,at,w arrants of deportation are produced under circumstances objectively indicating that their primary purpose is to maintain records concerning the movements of aliens and to ensure compliance with orders of deportation,not to prove facts for use in future criminal prosecutions.id.at emphasis added quoting united states torres villalobos,cir.
second,rojas argues that bryant and bullcoming established a new rule that supersedes orozco acosta approach that courts should consider the formality of the circumstances in which a statement was made in determining whether its primary purpose was testimonial.rojas is incorrect,because the court focus on the formality of a statement as part of its confrontation clause analysis is longstanding,and was taken into account by orozco acosta.since crawford,the supreme court has noted that the formality of a statement is a relevant factor in determining whether the statement is testimonial.crawford,at an accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.see also davis washington,d explaining that formality is one factor that can be relevant to determining a statement primary purpose.bryant and bullcoming reaffirmed this approach,but did not hold that a statement formality,standing alone,is sufficient to establish that the statement is testimonial.see bullcoming.at bryant.at.orozco acosta acknowledged crawford holding that the core class of testimonial statements includes both formal and informal statements,at quoting crawford,at,and its approach to analyzing the immigration records at issue is consistent with bullcoming and bryant.we therefore remain bound by its holding.see miller gammie,cir.
finally,rojas argues that bullcoming and bryant require a approach to determining whether there is a confrontation clause violation,and claims that orozco acosta failed to follow this direction.we agree that the relevant question under the confrontation clause is whether an individual statement is testimonial,not whether an entire document is testimonial.see bryant.at indicating that trial courts should determine when a series of statements transition from nontestimonial to testimonial and exclude the portions of any statements that have become testimonial internal quotation marks omitted.but when an immigration record is prepared under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the record is,the ordinary contents of the record are likewise.as noted in melendez diaz,b usiness and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation because having been created for the administration of an entity affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial they are not testimonial.at.unlike the analysts certificates in melendez diaz,the immigration records at issue in orozco acosta were not prepared specifically for use at the defendant trial,and therefore we correctly determined that the ordinary contents of those records were.at.therefore,we reject this argument as well.
we now apply these principles to rojas contention that the district court erred in admitting statements from records in his.
rojas challenges two statements in the warrant of removal t
