opinion of the court 
anderson jude okeke,a native and citizen of nigeria,petitions for review of two orders from the board of immigration appeals bia.those orders affirmed the immigration judge ij decision that okeke could not demonstrate the requisite continuous physical presence in the united states in order to qualify for cancellation of removal.essentially,the bia found that the provision d,once triggered,precludes the accrual of a new period of continuous presence,which in this case would possibly commence with okeke lawful reentry into the united states.that lawful critical fact on after okeke committed a controlled substance offense,which,pursuant to d,clearly ended any prior period of continuous physical presence.the question presented in this appeal,therefore,is whether okeke is entitled to a new period of continuous physical presence,commencing upon his lawful reentry into the united states,so as to allow him to accrue the time required to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal.see.for the reasons stated herein,this opinion of the court concludes that the clock should have restarted upon okeke reentry.the petition for review will therefore be granted.
the facts on appeal are reasonably straightforward.okeke first entered the united states on september,pursuant to a student visa in order to attend touro college.in january of,after returning to nigeria for personal reasons,okeke attempted to reenter the united states at john kennedy airport,whereupon he was arrested for possession of marijuana.okeke has testified that he appeared before a court in queens,new york,where he pled guilty to possession of marijuana and received a sentence of five years probation.
after that incident,okeke returned to nigeria on two further occasions,once in december and then again in april.on both occasions,he was lawfully to the united states under his student visa.since returning from nigeria in may of,okeke has lived here without interruption.
on december,the immigration and naturalization service ins filed a notice to appear nta,charging okeke with removability under a c i,inasmuch as he failed to maintain or comply with the terms of his nonimmigrant admission to the united states,he no longer attended touro college this was the only ground of deportation charged in the nta.okeke admitted to the allegations in the nta,but filed an application for cancellation of removal 
at the removal hearing on july,the ij concluded that okeke could not demonstrate the requisite continuous physical presence in the united states to qualify for cancellation of removal.the ij found sufficient proof of the commission of a controlled substance offense a crime providing for inadmissibility.such an act would have triggered the provision,see d,and would have stopped okeke accrual of continuous physical presence well before he could establish the necessary ten years required by the cancellation of removal statute okeke entered the country in and committed the crime in.
on appeal to the bia,okeke contested the ij finding on two grounds.first,okeke argued that there was insufficient proof of conviction,precluding the application of the provision.the bia rejected this contention,finding that both the admissions and the ncic report were probative of okeke commission of a controlled substance offense.second,okeke challenged the ij decision that he failed to establish the requisite ten years continuous physical presence to qualify for cancellation of removal.
rejecting this contention as well,the bia concluded that the commission of a controlled substance offense is not simply interruptive of the period of continuous physical presence,but is a terminating event,after which no further continuous presence can accrue for purposes of cancellation of removal.the bia thus affirmed the ij decision,ordering okeke to voluntarily depart from the united states.
thereafter,okeke filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied by the bia on november,for failure to assert new legal arguments.okeke filed timely petitions for review of both bia decisions,which were consolidated for purposes of appeal on december.
appellate jurisdiction is derived from the court must review the bia statutory interpretation of the ina under the deferential standard of chevron,natural resources defense council,d.in fatin ins,cir,this court stated,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at quoting chevron,at.
okeke sought cancellation of removal under b inasmuch as the bia held that okeke failed to meet the first threshold requirement for consideration of cancellation of physical presence in the united states for not less than ten years,this opinion limits its discussion to that narrow issue.
a period of continuous presence is deemed to end either when an alien is served with a notice to appear placing him in immigration proceedings or when the alien commits an offense described in a that renders him inadmissible under that section or deportable under a or a,whichever is earliest.d.here,okeke commission of a controlled substance offense in is an offense referred to in a a i ii,which triggered the provision of the cancellation of removal statute,d 
okeke contends that his most recent admission to the united states on may,established a new and valid period of continuous presence.the government disagrees,relying on matter of,bia,for the proposition that once a triggering event of a controlled substance offense in this continuous physical presence clock does not start anew.
in,a majority of the en banc bia interpreted ina d,d,to mean that the continuous physical presence clock does not start anew after the service of an order to show cause.id.at.several courts of appeals have deferred to this interpretation.see ram ins,cir holding that alien does not begin a new period of continuous physical presence after being served with an order to show cause najjar ashcroft,at mcbride ins,cir afolayan ins,cir.
however,none of those cases,itself included,addressed the distinct issue of whether lawful reentry after commission of an offense,rendering the alien inadmissible,restarts the clock.indeed,none of those cases involved an individual who left the united states and reentered.in,the petitioner had been charged in an order to show cause and then had deliberately delayed or stalled all proceedings until seven years had elapsed in order to qualify for the requisite continuous physical presence was written to forestall reliance on a presence where the petitioner had sought to buy time.that is not the situation here.because okeke lawfully reentered the country twice after a previous event,this case is factually,indeed dramatically,different,and the government reliance on is misplaced 
this analysis is therefore informed by another published decision from the re ignacio,bia.in,the native and citizen of served with an order to show cause charging him with deportability as an alien who entered the united states without inspection,and he was deported to mexico the same day.he returned to the united states the very next day without being admitted or paroled,and had remained in this country since that time.he had thus ostensibly accrued the requisite ten years of continuous physical presence from the time of his unlawful.
distinguishing,quite properly states 
did not resolve the question,presented here,whether an alien who departed the united states after being served with a valid charging document can seek relief in a subsequent removal proceeding,based on a new period of continuous physical presence measured from the date of his return.applying the rule to an alien in these latter circumstances implicates ambiguities in the language and purpose of section d that were not present in matter of,supra.
at.at issue in cisneros,then,was whether an alien who departs the united states can,upon his subsequent return,even if illegal,accrue a new period of continuous physical from the date of his as to demonstrate statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal.the bia held that such an alien could establish the requisite continuous physical presence.id.at.
therefore,allows for the accrual of a new period of continuous physical presence upon an alien reentry into the united states.the bia,at the time of its ruling in this case,relied heavily on,lacking the benefit of the decision,which was issued after the bia decision.applying here,the clock started anew as soon as okeke reentered the country in.
it is true,involved two removal proceedings,where the clock stopped upon the filing of the notice to appear in the first removal proceeding.okeke,according to the record,had committed a crime of inadmissibility,but had not been served with a notice to appear until.however,the commission of a specified crime is the functional equivalent of the service of a notice to appear for purposes of triggering the provision.as stated earlier,a period of continuous presence is deemed to end either when an alien is served with a notice to appear placing him in immigration proceedings or when the alien commits an offense described in a that renders him inadmissible under that section or deportable under a or a,whichever is earliest.d.as a result,the difference in triggering events in no way precludes the application of.
what matters here is the reason for the recommencement of the accrual period for purposes of cancellation of removal.as in,okeke reentered the country,though the reentry in his case was lawful.the critical fact for restarting the clock in was the reentry,not the filing of the notice to appear in the first removal proceeding.where,as here,there is lawful reentry after a event,the commission of a controlled substance offense,the clock starts anew.indeed,okeke is an a fortiori application of the cisneros doctrine,particularly when one considers that okeke reentry was lawful and cisneros was cisneros was allowed to qualify for his continuous presence.
moreover,this case is not about deporting an alien who had committed a crime.the nta in this case made no reference to okeke alleged commission of the controlled substance offense.the court expresses no opinion as to okeke immigrant status had such a charge been made,either when the action was allegedly committed or when the nta was eventually filed.
the nta provides that okeke entered the united states on may,to attend touro college.it is significant that,although okeke had initially entered the united states in and had,after departing,reentered again in december of,the nta contained no charge respecting his alleged commission of a controlled substance offence in january of.rather,as note above reflects,the nta confines itself to the student status of okeke.and it is that status that is dealt with here.
pursuant to the express terms of the nta,then,it is that final entry that should be considered in calculating the ten years continuous physical presence.to focus on events occurring prior to that time,when the nta makes no mention of them,is both illogical and unjust.
okeke admitted to committing a controlled substance offense in an offense referred to in a a i ii,which implicated the provision of the cancellation of removal statute,d.yet,because okeke lawfully reentered this country after committing a crime of inadmissibility,this opinion holds that the accrual period should have recommenced.see matter of cisneros,supra.
accordingly,the court will grant the petition for review of the bia decisions,and remand this matter to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
okeke seeks cancellation of removal.to qualify,he must establish,among other things,continuous physical presence in the united states for ten years immediately preceding his application for that relief.b a a ny period of continuous physical presence is deemed to end when an alien commits a controlled substance offense.d a.the board of immigration appeals bia held that,under d,okeke controlled substance offense ended his period of continuous physical presence.the bia further held that,under in re,bia,a new period of continuous physical presence could not begin after an old period ends under d.it thus concluded that okeke had not accrued the required ten year period necessary to qualify for cancellation of removal under b,as he first entered the united states in and his period of continuous physical presence ended in with the commission of the drug offense in new york and could not start over.
okeke argues that,even assuming he committed a qualifying drug offense in,he began a new period of continuous physical presence on may,date of his most recent admission into the united states.because he was continuously physically present in the united states until he applied for cancellation of removal more than ten years later in,okeke contends he meets the ten year period requirement.
both judge garth and i agree with okeke.but we do so by traveling different paths of analysis.he believes the bia recent decision in in re,bia,limits the reach of mendoza and mandates the result here.i do not believe cisneros goes so far and instead conclude that mendoza is an impermissible reading of d,even after according the bia the deference called for under chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
cisneros does not hold that a new period of continuous physical presence begins whenever an alien reenters the united states.
as judge garth correctly notes,cisneros states that mendoza did not resolve the question,presented here,whether an alien who departed the united states after being served with a valid charging document can seek relief in a subsequent removal proceeding,based on a new period of continuous physical presence measured from the date of his return.cisneros,at.in fact,cisneros holds that an alien who departed the united states after being served with a valid charging document can seek relief in a subsequent removal proceeding,based on a new period of continuous physical presence measured from the date of his return.however,the reason the alien can seek relief in a subsequent removal proceeding is not because he or she left and reentered the united states.rather,the bia reasoned,it is because the notice to appear referred to in section d pertains only to the charging document served in the proceedings in which the alien applies for cancellation of removal,and not to charging documents served on the alien in prior proceedings hereinafter the cisneros rule id.at.
the cisneros rule,in context,applied as follows.cisneros received an nta for his first removal proceeding nta in.he was deported on january,and illegally returned the next day.he was present in the united states from then until he received an nta for his second removal proceeding nta on june,than years after his illegal return.when cisneros applied to cancel the removal order based on the proceedings begun on june,the bia held that only nta,not nta,ended his period of physical presence under d because,to repeat,the notice to appear referred to in d pertains only to the charging document served in the proceedings in which cisneros applie d for cancellation of removal that is,nta,and not to charging documents served on him in prior proceedings that is,nta.cisneros,at.
in this context,i do not believe that okeke can rely on cisneros,for it does not overrule mendoza determination that the clock can not be reset so that an alien accrues continuous physical presence after the commission of a specified crime.mendoza,at.cisneros does not change mendoza rule that,when an alien commits a crime specified in d or receives an nta specified in d,any period of continuous presence ends and no other period shall ever begin again.instead,cisneros merely clarifies which nta is specified in d only the nta served in the proceedings in which the alien applies for cancellation of removal.cisneros,at.under mendoza,and even after cisneros,okeke can not reset his clock and accrue continuous physical presence time because he committed an offense specified in d.the mere fact of his subsequent reentering whether lawful or unlawful does not change this situation.thus,if okeke is to prevail,i believe that we must conclude that mendoza interpretation of d is not permitted.for the following reasons,i believe we should do so.
ii.okeke began a new period of continuous physical presence after he committed a specified offense because mendoza interpretation of d is impermissible.section d must be interpreted to allow the continuous physical presence clock to restart after the commission of a specified offense.
mendoza interpretation of d that the clock can not be reset so that an alien accrues continuous physical presence after the commission of a specified incorrect.properly construing the statute,okeke began a new period of continuous physical presence after he committed the offense at issue.
we review the bia interpretation of d according to the standards set out in chevron.see katsis ins,cir.if congress has directly spoken on an issue,we give the bia no deference.chevron,at.if a statute is silent or ambiguous on the issue,we ask whether the bia interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.however,t he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.chevron,at.citations omitted.
perhaps the most fundamental principle of statutory construction is that words in a statute must be given their ordinary meaning whenever possible.see walters metro.educ,d.section d clause any period shall be deemed to end should be given its ordinary meaning any period ends.the ordinary meaning of this clause simply does not imply that future periods of continuous presence are barred.yet,mendoza not only interpreted it to mean any period ends,but also added whole cloth that no future period can begin anew.at.
another plain language argument for interpreting d to allow the continuous physical presence clock to restart focuses on its any period language.a ny indicates that there can be multiple periods of physical presence.as bia member guendelsberger dissent in mendoza notes 
the core statement that any period of continuous presence shall be deemed to end strongly suggests that there may be more than one period to be considered.although d clearly cuts off the accrual of a period of time prior to a specified event,it does not speak to periods of time after the event in question.the reference to ending any period of physical presence suggests that another period of physical presence ensues.
at guendelsberger,dissenting.
in addition,interpreting d to allow the continuous physical presence clock to restart avoids a logical conundrum,as mendoza interpretation requires periods of continuous physical presence to end before they even begin.bia member villageliu,dissenting in mendoza,pointed out this incongruity 
the word period means an interval of time.putting the words any period in context with the words continuous physical presence can not logically refer to a period of time whose continuity would be ended before the period of time even begins because,logically,continuity would not transcend its own ending.
at citation omitted villageliu,dissenting.
a further argument for interpreting d to allow the continuous physical presence clock to restart is that it preserves the concept of a period of continuous physical presence,explicitly described in the plain language of the statute,with regard to aliens seeking cancellation of removal under b who have committed a crime specified in d.otherwise,the concept of a period of continuous physical presence is destroyed because,as explained below,the effective rule under mendoza interpretation of d is that if you commit a specified offense you can never get a cancellation of removal under b regardless of any periods of continuous presence,no matter when or how long they were.if congress had meant this to be the rule,it would simply have stated it.
the reason the effective rule under mendoza interpretation of d is that if you commit a specified offense you can never get a cancellation of removal under b is as follows.section b requires that,for cancellation of removal,an alien must have been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than ten years immediately preceding the date of such application.b a emphasis added.thus,an alien can not use an old period that is,a past period that is not immediately preceding his or her application for cancellation of removal under b to support such an application.thus,for example,an alien filing an application in year,who arrived in the united states in year and committed a specified offense in year,could not use the period from year to year because that period does not immediately preced e the filing of the application in year.hence,if an alien can never use an old period,and under mendoza interpretation,the clock can never restart,mendoza,at,then as soon as an alien commits a specified offense he or she will never be able to show ten years of continuous physical presence immediately preceding the application for cancellation of removal.therefore,the effective rule under mendoza interpretation of d is that if you commit a specified offense you can never get a cancellation of removal under b.in this context,interpreting d to allow the continuous physical presence clock to restart preserves the concept of a period of continuous physical presence,otherwise destroyed under mendoza s interpretation of d,with regard to aliens seeking cancellation of removal under b who have committed a crime specified in d.
importantly,there is an event that bars an alien from receiving cancellation of removal under b,but it is not commission of a specified offense rather,it is conviction of a specified offense.section b c says that an alien can never get a cancellation of removal under b if he or she has been convicted of a specified offense if the rule was the same for commissions and convictions,why did congress make the distinction 
moreover,the forerunner statutory section to,of the immigration and nationality act ina codified at repealed was interpreted as allowing the continuous physical presence clock to restart,mendoza,at guendelsberger,dissenting,and congress never stated that should be interpreted differently.lindahl office of pers,d where congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of prior law,congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law,at least insofar as it affects the new statute.quoting lorillard pons,d pierce underwood,d of a statute generally includes the settled judicial interpretation thereof.therefore,we presume that congress also intended d to allow the clock to restart.
under the old statutory,duration of continuous physical presence an alien had to demonstrate in order to be eligible for suspension of deportation and adjustment of status depended on why the alien was deportable.an alien deportable on most noncriminal grounds had to demonstrate seven years of continuous physical presence immediately preceding the alien application for suspension of deportation.ina a,a.however,an alien deportable on most criminal grounds had to demonstrate ten years of continuous physical presence immediately following the commission of the act,or assumption of the status,constituting a ground for deportation.ina a,a.as bia member guendelsberger explained in his dissent in mendoza,the resetting of the physical presence clock upon the occurrence of particular events has been and remains inherent in the eligibility provisions for suspension of deportation.at guendelsberger,dissenting citing in re bufalino,bia finding that a respondent who is deportable under several grounds,one of which is listed in a,is ineligible for relief under a and must establish eligibility under a from the date of the commission of the last deportable act.that the forerunner to was interpreted to allow the continuous physical presence clock to restart supports interpreting that way.
a final reason mendoza interpretation of d is impermissible is that,because of the serious consequences of deportation,rules of statutory interpretation relating to immigration statutes require that ambiguities be
