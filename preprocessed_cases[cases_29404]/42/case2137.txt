background 
rreshpja grew up in the town of shkoder in northern albania.she attended high school in tirana,the country capital city,where she lived with her aunt.her parents and younger brother remained in shkoder.
in june of,an unknown man attempted to abduct rreshpja as she was walking home from school.she managed to escape.as she ran away,she heard her attacker say that she should not get too excited because she would end up on her back in italy,like many other girls.she understood that statement to be a threat that she would be kidnapped and forced to work as a prostitute.
rreshpja and her aunt reported the incident to the local police,but the police told rreshpja that the information she had provided was insufficient to identify or arrest the man who had attacked her.fearful for her safety,rreshpja family made arrangements for her to stay with her older brother,who lived in howell,michigan.they obtained an nonimmigrant visa for her to enter the united states.when she attempted to enroll at michigan state university after arriving in this country,however,she was informed that the documents that had been used to obtain her visa were fraudulent.
the ins now the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against rreshpja in june of.at a hearing before an ij in detroit,rreshpja conceded that she had been admitted to the united states without a valid nonimmigrant visa,but she submitted an application for asylum,the withholding of removal,and protection under the cat,claiming that she risked being forced into prostitution if she were required to return to albania.the ij denied rreshpja application.rreshpja appealed the denial to the bia,which affirmed the ij decision without issuing an opinion.she then timely filed a petition for review by this court.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
because the bia affirmed the decision of the ij without issuing an opinion,we review the decision of the ij directly.see denko ins,cir when the board adopts the decision of the ij in lieu of issuing its own opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency decision.i n order to reverse the bia factual determinations,we must find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it.klawitter ins,cir emphasis in original.
b.the ij did not err in denying rreshpja application for asylum,the withholding of removal,and protection under the cat 
rreshpja claims that she is entitled to a grant of asylum or,in the alternative,the withholding of removal and protection under the cat.she contends that the ij opinion contains errors of law and fact regarding her claims.
rreshpja argues that she faces persecution because she is an attractive young woman who risks being kidnapped and forced into prostitution if she returns to albania.the ij rejected this argument on the grounds that the social group as defined by rreshpja is not cognizable under the immigration and nationality act ina,a a,and even assuming that such a social group exists,rreshpja failed to demonstrate that her attempted kidnapping in june of or her fear of being forced into prostitution if she is returned to albania was the result of membership in that social group as opposed to the unfortunate consequences of widespread crime in albania.
pursuant to the ina,an applicant for asylum must show that she is a refugee.b.a refugee is an individual who is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.an applicant claiming to be a refugee must present specific facts demonstrating that she suffered past persecution or that she has a fear of future persecution.ins,d holding that the bia determination that was not eligible for asylum must be upheld if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole citation and quotation marks omitted.if the asylum applicant satisfies her burden of establishing past persecution,she is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.mikhailevitch ins,cir citing b i.the ins may rebut that presumption by establishing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that conditions in the applicant country have changed since the time of the persecution to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a fear of being persecuted if she were to return.mikhailevitch,at.
an applicant fear of persecution must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.perkovic ins,cir.she must therefore actually fear that she will be persecuted upon return to her country,and she must demonstrate an objective situation under which her fear can be deemed reasonable.id.quoting ins,d.
the bia has defined a social group to be a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic.in re acosta,bia holding that a salvadoran taxi cooperative did not constitute a particular social group,even though the members were being persecuted for refusing to participate in work stoppages,because the drivers could escape persecution by changing jobs,overruled on other grounds by in re mogharrabi,bia.w hatever the common characteristic that defines the group,it must be one that the members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.acosta,at see also ins,cir adopting the bia definition of a social group,and holding that tattooed youth fall outside of that definition.the bia,however,has never held that an entire gender can constitute a social group under the ina.
rreshpja does not explicitly state that she was or will be persecuted on account of her membership in a particular social group,but she suggests that the relevant group is young or those who appear to be young,attractive albanian women who are forced into prostitution.this demographic,however,does not constitute a social group under the ina for two reasons.first,almost all of the pertinent decisions have rejected generalized,sweeping classifications for purposes of asylum.see,raffington ins,cir ruling that mentally ill jamaicans did not qualify as a particular social group for asylum purposes gomez ins,cir holding that a salvadoran woman who had been beaten and raped by salvadoran guerillas during her youth was not for that reason a member of a particular social group for asylum purposes.
rreshpja,however,cites mohammed gonzales,cir,as support for her argument that a social group may in fact be broadly defined.in mohammed,the ninth circuit held that female genital mutilation constitutes persecution on account of membership in a particular social group and explained that the agency could define the social group as that of somalian females.id.at.the court noted that the practice of female genital mutilation in somalia is deeply imbedded sic in the culture throughout the nation and performed on approximately percent of all females.id.at.we do not necessarily agree with the ninth circuit determination that virtually all of the women in somalia are entitled to asylum in the united states.regardless,we find that mohammed is distinguishable from the present case because rreshpja did not introduce any evidence to
