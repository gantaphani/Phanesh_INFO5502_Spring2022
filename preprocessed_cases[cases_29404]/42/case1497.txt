opinion of the court 
much has been written about border searches and we will not break much new ground here.we believe it appropriate,however,particularly in light of the tragedy of september and the efforts being made in its aftermath,to reprise what has been written in the course of concluding that the border search at issue here was well within the bounds of law.the order of the district court will,therefore,be affirmed.
introduction 
yvette bradley,an woman,brought this bivens action against the united states,the united states customs service,and a number of customs inspectors,supervisors,and officials.she alleged that her constitutional rights were violated when,on april,customs inspectors subjected her to a search of her suitcase,purse and backpack,as well as a patdown,when she arrived at newark international airport on a nonstop international flight from the island of jamaica.bradley argued that she was selected because of her race and gender,in violation of her equal protection rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments,and that the patdown was an illegal search under the fourth amendment the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,and bradley now appeals.the district court had jurisdiction under and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.chisolm mcmanimon,cir.
the the fourth amendment 
while bradley refers in passing to the search of her luggage,her challenge is directed almost exclusively to the patdown,albeit what she describes as the intrusive patdown,to which she was subjected at an immigration checkpoint at the newark international airport.she argues that in granting summary judgment,the district court failed to construe the facts in the light most favorable to her as,of course,it was required to do given that she was the party.the facts as relevant to her fourth amendment claim are,however,largely undisputed.those facts,viewed against law,defeat that claim.
it is not disputed,for example,that jamaica is considered by customs to be a source country for narcotics and that jamaica airlines flight,on which bradley arrived,is considered by customs to be a high risk flight for narcotics,although bradley herself does not believe either to be so.it is also not disputed that bradley was subjected to a patdown,and not a strip search,a body cavity search,or any other type of highly intrusive search.it is not disputed that the patdown was done over bradley dress by a female inspector in the presence of a second female inspector and that bradley skin was not directly touched in any intimate area.it is not disputed that when the patdown reached what bradley calls her groin area,her internal genitalia were not penetrated through the dress.crediting her version of the facts,the touching that occurred involved the inspector us ing her fingers to inappropriately push on bradley breasts and into the inner and outer labia,bradley aff.p,the latter concededly part of the external genitalia of a woman bradley,we note,was not wearing underwear and does not dispute that had she been doing so,the additional layer of cloth would have reduced any intrusion that took place.and,of course,bradley does not dispute that no drugs or other contraband were found.
neither does bradley take issue with the law,nor could she,for courts,including our court,have long held that routine searches at our nation borders are presumed to be reasonable under the fourth amendment.see,united states ramsey,d united states hyde,cir united states ezeiruaku,cir.immigration checkpoints at international airports are the functional equivalent of national borders.united states,d.as a sovereign state,the united states has the right to protect itself by stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this country.ramsey,at since the founding of our republic,congress has granted the executive plenary power to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border,without probable cause or a warrant,in order to regulate the collection of duties and to prevent the introduction of contraband into this country.united states montoya de hernandez,d.for example,congress has empowered border officials to detain and search all persons coming into the united states from foreign countries.see also authorizing customs officials to search the baggage of persons entering the country authorizing customs officials to inspect and search all persons,baggage,and merchandise arriving from foreign countries.
it has,of course,also long been true that our nation historic concern for the integrity of its borders has been heightened by the veritable national crisis in law enforcement caused by the smuggling of illicit narcotics.montoya de hernandez,at citing united states mendenhall,d powell,concurring.and it is beyond peradventure,as the seventh circuit has noted,that the events of september,only emphasize the heightened need to conduct searches at our borders.united states yang,cir.
in montoya de hernandez,the supreme court most recent case on border searches,the court reiterated that,because the fourth amendment balance of reasonableness is qualitatively different at the international border than in the interior,routine searches of persons and their effects at the border are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion,probable cause,or warrant.at citing ramsey,at,at and carroll,at.the court had not previously determined what level of suspicion would justify the detention of an incoming traveler in a nonroutine border search and inspection.in montoya de hernandez,however,the court concluded that an alimentary canal search was not routine and is justified only if customs agents reasonably suspect that the traveler is smuggling contraband in his or her alimentary canal.reasonable suspicion was defined as a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person of smuggling contraband.id.at quoting united states cortez,d.the court explicitly declined,however,to determine,what level of suspicion,if any,is required for other nonroutine border searches such as strip,or involuntary searches.id.at emphasis added.
in the course of concluding that an alimentary canal search must be supported by reasonable suspicion,and that reasonable suspicion supported the search of the balloon swallower before it,the court bemoaned the subtle verbal gradations being developed by courts of appeals to enunciate the fourth amendment standard of reasonableness which may obscure rather than elucidate the meaning of the provision in question.at the second circuit viewed this statement as warning against the development of multiple gradations of suspicion to be applied to different types of border searches.united states charleus,cir.
while we have not had the occasion to address the question left open in montoya de level of suspicion,if any,necessary to conduct at least certain types of nonroutine court of appeals that have done so agree that reasonable suspicion is required.united states,cir united states yakubu,cir united states carreon,cir charleus,at united states oyekan,cir.
we are not,of course,dealing here with a strip search or a body cavity search or any of the other typical nonroutine searches,but,rather,with a patdown.while the supreme court has never articulated what makes a border search routine and has never explicitly classified patdowns as routine,of those courts of appeals which have addressed the patdown issue since montoya de hernandez,none has held that a standard patdown at the border is a nonroutine search requiring reasonable suspicion and all have held that such patdowns come within the routine border search category and,thus,require no suspicion whatsoever united states beras,cir,at luggage searches and patdowns are routine and do not require reasonable suspicion carreon,at oyekan at charleus,at the patdown in that case was a routine border search requiring no level of suspicion at all we now join those courts,although we do not foreclose the possibility that a patdown gone awry could become so intrusive as to become a nonroutine search requiring application of the reasonable suspicion standar
