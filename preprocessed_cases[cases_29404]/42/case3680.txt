discussion 
i.a conviction under a qualifies as an alien smuggling offense under b a.
we must decide whether prior conviction under a a ii qualifies as an alien smuggling offense for the purposes of b a.to do so,we look to a a and compare its elements to the definition of an alien smuggling offense under b a vii to determine whether the statutory definition substantially corresponds to the generic offense.see taylor united states,d.
when interpreting the sentencing guidelines,we apply the general rules of statutory construction.see united states valenzuela,cir citations omitted.under these rules,t he plain meaning of unambiguous language in a guideline provision controls.id.c ommentary in the guidelines manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.stinson united states,d.
a.the alien smuggling enhancement applies when the defendant has been previously convicted of violating a a.
we begin with the text of the relevant guideline,which provides,if the defendant previously was deported,or unlawfully remained in the united states,after an alien smuggling offense,increase the offense level by levels.b a vii emphasis added.the commentary to the guideline provides alien smuggling offense has the meaning given that term in section a n of the immigration and nationality act ina a n,cmt.app.b i.the ina defines alien smuggling offense as 
an offense described in paragraph a or of section a of this title relating to alien smuggling,except in the case of a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting,abetting,or aiding only the alien spouse,child,or parent and no other individual to violate a provision of this chapter.
a n emphasis added.
we find nothing ambiguous about the plain language of the guideline,its commentary,and the statutory definitions it incorporates by reference.the alien smuggling enhancement applies if there is a prior conviction for an offense described in a a or.see b a vii cmt.app.note b i a n.in this case,the offense for which was previously convicted and for which the district court applied the sentencing enhancement was a violation of a a ii.therefore,the alien smuggling enhancement applies unless can show that he falls within its limited exception.that is,a prior conviction under a a will qualify as an alien smuggling offense except in the case of a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting,abetting,or aiding only the alien spouse,child,or parent and no other individual to violate a provision of this chapter.see a n emphasis added 
at sentencing,did not argue and made no effort to show that his prior offense was a first offense that involved only members of his family in fact,raised no objections regarding the district court adoption of the psr and imposition of the enhancement.given the plain language of the statute and failure to show the applicability of the exception,it would appear that the district court did not commit plain error in imposing the enhancement under b a vii.
b.the family exception is not an element of the generic alien smuggling offense.
argues against this fairly obvious conclusion.although the generic alien smuggling offense is defined by express to a a,maintains that the district court nonetheless erred in concluding that a a is categorically an alien smuggling offense under b a vii.specifically,he contends that the family caveat to the enhancement is not merely an exception,but an element of the generic alien smuggling offense.because a a criminalizes alien smuggling regardless of whether it is a first offense involving a spouse,parent,or child,argues that the statute is too broad to categorically be an alien smuggling offense the generic offense contains an element that a a does not.we disagree.
to address argument,we must decide whether the family exception is an element of the generic alien smuggling offense.guided by the supreme court recent decision in nijhawan holder,d,we conclude that the family exception is not an element of the generic offense,but refers to the particular circumstances in which the defendant committed an alien smuggling offense on a particular occasion.see nijhawan.at,
in nijhawan,the supreme court held that the monetary loss requirement for generic aggravated felony offenses involving fraud or deceit was not an element of the generic fraud or deceit crime,but referred to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a more broadly defined fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion.nijhawan.at.at issue in nijhawan was the immigration law that provides that any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.id.at emphasis in original quoting a a iii.the definition of aggravated felony included an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.id.quoting a m i.nijhawan was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud,wire fraud,bank fraud,and money laundering,in violation of,and h.id.although none of the statutes underlying the fraud conviction required any finding of a particular amount of victim loss,the petitioner stipulated at sentencing that the loss exceeded million.id.
in the immigration proceedings that followed,the government claimed that the prior fraud conviction fell within the definition of aggravated felony,and therefore,the petitioner was deportable.id.the petitioner argued that the monetary loss requirement was an element of the generic fraud offe
