ling huang,a native and citizen of china,petitions for review of the denial of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat by the board of immigration appeals bia.because the record in this case does not compel the conclusion that huang testimony was credible and persuasive,we affirm the immigration judge determination that huang failed to carry her burden of proving her eligibility for relief.
huang entered the united states on may,on a student visa,and applied for asylum and withholding of removal on april.huang conceded her inadmissibility,and appeared before an immigration judge ij for a merits hearing on january.
huang testified as follows at the merits hearing.while attending an underground christian house church in china,she was arrested and taken to the police station.while in police custody,a female officer pulled her hair,pushed her to the ground,and kicked her.huang was then placed in a cell and forced to perform manual labor,such as cleaning toilets and moving bricks.after three days,huang family bailed her out of jail for rmb and she returned home.she provided a bail receipt from china for the crime of violating the management of public order with a mob,but it did not reference her participation in a house church or otherwise corroborate huang testimony.as a condition of her release,huang signed a document promising that she would not continue to participate in underground christian activities.she ceased attending underground churches after her arrest,but continued to practice christianity through private prayer.
following this incident,huang secured a student visa to the united states with the help of a private agency specializing in foreign study trips.upon her arrival in the united states,huang studied at merced college for six months,but ended her studies after running out of money to pay tuition.
huang claimed that she continued to practice christianity while in the united states.she stated she was baptized on april,and provided photographs which she claimed showed her baptismal ceremony,which was performed by another member of the church.according to her testimony,huang then began to attend a different church in modesto,california in august,but stopped going after a few months in order to help her uncle on the weekends.huang did not produce a baptismal certificate or any other evidence corroborating her church attendance in either the united states or in china.huang testified that she observed easter and christmas,and she recited the lord prayer and other christian prayers.
in a decision issued on january,the ij found that huang testimony was not credible.she noted two reasons for this conclusion.first,the ij found that huang demeanor undermined her credibility,noting that huang paused frequently while testifying as if to assess the impact of the answer she provided.further,the ij found that huang testimony was extremely superficial,and could easily have been memorized.second,the ij noted that much of huang testimony was unpersuasive and not supported by reasonably obtainable corroborating evidence.while the photographs and bail bond receipt provided some evidence that huang was a christian who had participated in a home church,they were insufficient to prove that she was eligible for asylum or other relief.because huang testimony was not credible,the ij held the evidence in the record was insufficient to meet huang burden of proof that she was eligible for asylum or withholding.in addition,the ij denied her protection under cat because there was no evidence that chinese authorities would torture huang on her return to china.
huang appealed the denial of her claim to the bia,which affirmed the ij ruling in full.huang then filed a timely petition for review on september.

in light of this statutory language,we have concluded that the real id act requires a healthy measure of deference to agency credibility determinations.shrestha,at see also fibril gonzales,cir explaining that under the real id act,only the most extraordinary circumstances will justify overturning an adverse credibility determination.this deference makes sense because ijs are in the best position to assess demeanor and other credibility cues that we can not readily access on review.shrestha,at.a n immigration judge alone is in a position to observe an alien tone and demeanor,to explore inconsistencies in testimony,and to apply workable and consistent standards in the evaluation of testimonial evidence.id.quoting,at,reprinted in,internal quotation marks omitted.by virtue of their expertise,ijs are uniquely qualified to decide whether an alien testimony has about it the ring of truth.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
