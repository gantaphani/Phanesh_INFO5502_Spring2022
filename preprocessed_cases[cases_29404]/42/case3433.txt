in,fernando arango was naturalized as a united states citizen.twenty years later,in,the united states instituted this action in arizona district court to strip arango of his citizenship.the complaint alleged that arango unlawfully procured his citizenship,and arango misrepresented and concealed material facts during the naturalization process.
the district court rejected arango argument that his incarceration in a federal prison in the central district of california at the time the government filed its complaint meant that venue was improper in the district of arizona.the district court then granted the government motion for summary judgment,concluding that because arango lawful permanent resident lpr status was unlawfully obtained,there was no material issue of fact as to whether he had procured his citizenship unlawfully.
although it is undisputed that arango acquired his lpr status on the basis of a fraudulent marriage,arango adduced evidence that he had entered into a cooperation agreement with the immigration and naturalization service ins permitting him to retain his status as an lpr and to naturalize.the district court improperly weighed the evidence in the record,however,and concluded that such a cooperation agreement did not exist.because there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the ins entered into an agreement permitting arango to retain his lpr status and to naturalize in exchange for cooperating in the investigation of a fraudulent marriage operation,summary judgment was improper,and we reverse.
because the district court did not permit arango to rebut the presumption that his place of residence remained where he lived prior to his incarceration,we also vacate the denial of arango motion to dismiss the complaint for improper venue,and remand with instructions for the district court to allow arango to argue that his residence is now his place of incarceration.
factual and procedural background 
arango is a native of colombia who was admitted to the united states as an lpr in.he acquired this status through a fraudulent marriage to a united states citizen arranged by a marriage broker,miguel diaz.arango sister,amparo valbuena,worked as a secretary for diaz,and valbuena acquired her own lpr status through a sham marriage arranged by him.
in,the ins began to investigate diaz fraudulent activities.as part of the investigation,three ins agents met with valbuena and arango and obtained sworn affidavits from both that detailed their involvement with the scheme.in arango affidavit,he admitted that he obtained his green card as a result of a sham marriage arranged by diaz.as a result of arango and valbuena assistance,the ins seized evidence of over immigration applications that were based on sham marriages arranged by diaz.the ins agents admit that valbuena was an important witness in their case against diaz,and that they met with her multiple times during the course of their investigation.
arango asserts that the ins agents promised both him and his sister that,in exchange for their cooperation with the investigation,their immigration status would be secure,and that both would be permitted to naturalize.both arango and valbuena remained lprs and naturalized without any complications.valbuena naturalized in,and arango naturalized in.arango later became a customs border protection officer in arizona.
in,arango was arrested on unrelated federal drug charges.after pleading guilty,he began to serve his sentence at the federal correctional institution in san pedro,california.in,the department of justice filed a civil action in the district of arizona to revoke arango citizenship pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act ina.the complaint alleged that arango citizenship should be revoked because his citizenship was procured unlawfully as his fraudulent marriage meant that he was never lawfully admitted as an lpr,and arango misrepresented and concealed material facts regarding his participation in the scheme during the naturalization process.
arango argued that venue was improper in the district of arizona because he had been living in california since his incarceration in san pedro,california in may of,and he retained no ties to arizona.the district court disagreed,concluding that arango last known residence was arizona and that a person does not acquire a domicil while imprisoned.
opposing the government motion for summary judgment,arango submitted a sworn declaration stating that he had entered into a cooperation agreement with ins that permitted him to retain his lpr status and to naturalize in exchange for his assistance with the agency investigation into the scheme.arango also swore that he had not misrepresented or concealed any facts during the naturalization process because he had reasonably assumed that the ins officer was aware of the contents of his immigration file,and his affidavit and evidence of the cooperation agreement was in his file.arango also submitted translated emails from his sister that suggested that the siblings had entered into some type of cooperation agreement with the ins.the government evidence in support of summary judgment included declarations denying the existence of an agreement from the ins agents who met with arango and valbuena in declarations from valbuena stating that she was not aware of an agreement between ins and her brother and a declaration from the ins agent who conducted arango naturalization interview indicating that,while she could not remember meeting with arango,she would not have granted his naturalization application if he had disclosed information about his sham marriage during his interview.
granting the government motion for summary judgment the court concluded that the government provides clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence that leaves no issue in doubt that defendant arango,a naturalized citizen,obtained his citizenship illegally.

iii.discussion 
summary judgment 
summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no genuine issues of material fact,entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby.although the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment,id.at,summary judgment is not warranted if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,id.at.
in a denaturalization proceeding,the government bears the heavy burden of providing clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that citizenship should be revoked.united states dang,cir quoting fedorenko united states.the government evidence justifying denaturalization must not leave the issue in doubt.id.quoting fedorenko,at.as the supreme court has recognized,the standard of proof should be taken into account in ruling on summary judgment motions anderson,at.thus,summary judgment for the government in a denaturalization proceeding is warranted in narrow circumstances if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the naturalized citizen,there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence supports denaturalization.
the government bears the burden of such a high degree of proof in denaturalization proceedings because of the importance of the right that is at stake.fedorenko,at see also id.at o nce citizenship has been acquired,its loss can have severe and unsettling consequences.schneiderman united states,citizenship once conferred should not be taken away without the clearest sort of justification and proof.thus,although summary judgment may be appropriate in certain circumstances,see,dang,at affirming district court grant of summary judgment when the evidence established that the citizen had committed criminal acts precluding a finding of good moral character during the relevant statutory time period,thus warranting denaturalization,it should not be granted lightly.
the denaturalization statute,a,permits the government to revoke citizenship if naturalization was illegally procured or procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.although the district court relied exclusively on illegal procurement of citizenship,the government contends that summary judgment was appropriate on either ground.the government argues that arango was not a lawful permanent resident at the time he applied for naturalization because of his fraudulent marriage,so his naturalization was illegally procured and arango willfully concealed and misrepresented the nature of his marriage in connection with his naturalization application.
the evidence submitted by arango,however,created genuine issues of material fact as to whether the government had met its burden of proving by clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence that arango was subject to denaturalization on either of these grounds.in deciding whether to grant summary judgment,the judge function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson,at.this is because c redibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge id.at.
illegal procurement of citizenship 
the evidence submitted by arango created a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a cooperation agreement permitting arango to retain his lpr status and to naturalize.arango sworn affidavit in opposition to summary judgment states that his sister entered into an agreement with the ins covering both her and him in exchange for her cooperation with the marriage fraud investigation.the affidavit references an agreement that pardoned both arango and his sister,and the agents assurances that this was a closed case and that there would be no problem in arango applying for naturalization.the emails from valbuena that arango submitted suggest the existence of a cooperation agreement in one email valbuena states that the ins agent told her that there was no problem for neither you arango or me his sister in applying for citizenship.arango affidavit also questioned why he would have been allowed to continue to reside in the after his meeting with the ins agents in manhattan,ny,become a citizen in,and eventually become employed to work for the government as a border protection agent if no cooperation agreement existed.
although the government submitted declarations from the ins agents and valbuena in an effort to disprove the existence of a cooperation agreement,these declarations do not show that there are no disputed issues of material fact warranting a trial.to the contrary the conflicting evidence submitted by the government and arango presented the district court with a genuine dispute of material fact as to the existence of the cooperation agreement.see chevron usa,cayetano,cir regarding conflicting affidavits.these statements were not conclusory,statements devoid of any factual support.see ftc publ g clearing house,cir a conclusory,affidavit,lacking detailed facts and any supporting evidence,is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.arango affidavit set forth a detailed description of the circumstances surrounding the cooperation agreement.a defendant sworn statements can not be disbelieved at the summary judgment stage simply because his statements are in his interest and in conflict with other evidence.see,leslie grupo ica,cir although we can understand the district court disbelief of the plaintiff assertions in his deposition and sworn declaration,such disbelief can not support summary judgment.mclaughlin liu,cir the defendant sworn statements are direct evidence of the central fact in dispute.he does not ask that inferences be drawn in his favor,but that his testimony be taken as true.to this he is clearly entitled under anderson.
moreover,the circumstantial evidence provides some support for arango claim that some type of agreement existed.despite having a signed affidavit from arango admitting to marriage fraud,the government did not attempt to revoke arango lpr status,and arango was permitted to naturalize in.his sister was also permitted to remain an lpr and naturalize,despite her more extensive involvement with the marriage fraud scheme.in addition,arango was later hired as a customs border protection officer,even though the ins had direct knowledge of his immigration fraud.
the existence of this agreement is a material issue of fact relevant to arango alleged illegal procurement of the district court,however,improperly weighed the evidence and gave full credence to the government version of the events,even though the court was required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to arango at the summary judgment stage.the district court weighing of the evidence was improper,especially given the government heavy burden to provide clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the grounds for denaturalization have been met.because there existed genuine issues of material fact,summary judgment was not warranted.
willful concealment or misrepresentation of a material fact 
the government,however,argues that the record supports affirming the district court grant of summary judgment on alternative grounds arango alleged willful concealment or misrepresentation of a material fact during the naturalization process.
the supreme court has stated that this ground for denaturalization plainly contains four independent requirements the naturalized citizen must have misrepresented or concealed some fact,the misrepresentation or concealment must have been willful,the fact must have been material,and the naturalized citizen must have procured citizenship as a result of the misrepresentation or concealment.kungys united states.we have previously held that an alien who seeks to obtain immigration status by misrepresenting a material fact has done so willfully if the misrepresentation was deliberate and voluntary.espinoza espinoza ins,cir.the government argues that arango willfully misrepresented and concealed the true nature of his prior marriage throughout the naturalization process by not disclosing his sham marriage to the ins agent during his naturalization interview,and listing the sham marriage on his naturalization application,which he signed under penalty of perjury.
arango,however,raised genuine issues of material fact as to whether any alleged concealment and misrepresentations were willful.during arango interview with the immigration officer,he asked her whether she had reviewed his immigration file,on the assumption that information regarding his prior admissions to ins would be contained in his file.the immigration officer who conducted arango naturalization interview does not contradict arango version of the events in her declaration.instead she relies on her own customary practices.she states that,while she can not remember arango interview,she knows that arango did not disclose this information about the prior sham marriage,because she is certain that if this information had been disclosed,she would not have permitted his naturalization.viewing these facts in the light most favorable to arango,his failure to bring up the topic of his sham marriage,when he reasonably assumed that the immigration officer already knew about it,does not show deliberate or voluntary concealment or misrepresentation.
on the naturalization application,arango indicated that he was married to vicky tirado from to,and he attested to this statement under penalty of perjury.the government argues that this was a material misrepresentation because he was never actually married to tirado.even if arango was not legally married to tirado during this time period,there are material issues of fact as to whether the misrepresentation wa
