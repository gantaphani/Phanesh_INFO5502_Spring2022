an na huang and zhou wu dong are both natives and citizens of china.they applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture,alleging that they had been persecuted and tortured on account of huang pregnancy prior to having obtained a legal marriage,and the couple refusal to pay the accompanying fine.the immigration judge found that petitioners asylum claims were untimely,and that the remainder of their claims failed due to lack of credibility and evidence.we agree,and therefore deny the petition for review.
background 
before coming to the united states,huang lived in lian jiang county,fujian province,china.she worked as a seamstress.on january,at age,she married dong in a traditional chinese ceremony.the couple did not register their marriage and obtain a license because she was underage at the time after huang and dong married,they lived in his parents home in the village of guantou town.huang testified that she remained registered with her parents household,and would occasionally visit them in the nearby village of dong xi.
in december,prior to their traditional marriage,huang claims that she learned that she was pregnant after a visit to a private doctor.a few months after their marriage,on march,at approximately am,huang testified that family planning officials arrived at her husband parents home.they told her that they knew she was culturally wedded to her husband and that she was eligible for a routine medical exam.alone at the time,huang submits that she was forcefully taken to the lian jiang county hospital where her pregnancy was discovered.she says that she was then pushed down on an operating table,made unconscious,and subjected to an abortion procedure.afterwards,she requested a certificate from the hospital stating that she had gone through this procedure and that she should be allowed to rest for seven days.huang testified that the entire the officials arriving at the home to her discharge from the hours.
two days later,huang claims to have received a notice of a fine from the guantou town birth control office demanding that she pay yuan renminbi rmb for violating the fujian province birth control policy.this to about about as much as the couple annual income.they decided to forgo paying the fine,and three days later,a public security bureau messenger delivered a summons to the home in dong name.while it does not state it,we assume that the summons was issued for failure to pay the fine.instead of reporting to the public security bureau as requested,dong went into hiding in fuzhou city.he returned on march,after hearing that his mother had fallen ill.thirty minutes after his arrival,at am,two officials from the public security bureau and one from the birth control office came to the house and arrested him.dong submits that he was taken to the lian jiang county jail where he remained for a year.during his detention,he claims that he was tortured,specifically by having electricity applied to his genitals.dong was released on march.huang asserts that she attempted to pay the fine earlier while dong was in jail,but authorities told her that he was to remain detained for a full year.the receipt from the payment to the birth control office indicates that dong was the payor,and that the reason for collection of payment was early birth without marriage.
after dong was released from prison,the couple continued to live in his parents home until june.at that time,dong paid to a member of the snakehead gang to be smuggled into the united states.huang followed suit and also paid to a snakehead to get smuggled into the united states in february.she claims that her precise date of entry was february.the couple has two children,both of whom were born in the united states.the first was born on january,and the second was born on march.
on august,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued dong a notice to appear,charging him with removability pursuant to a a.huang filed an application for asylum with the department of homeland security dhs on february,later,on march,she too was charged with removability.both huang and dong conceded that they were removable.their cases were consolidated,and a merits hearing on huang application for asylum was held on september.the immigration judge ij issued a decision denying all relief and ordering both huang and dong removed to china.the board of immigration appeals bia agreed with the ij,and huang and dong now present their petition for review.
ii.discussion 
huang and dong argue that the ij erred in denying their claims involving asylum,withholding of removal,and the convention against torture cat.we analyze each issue in turn.
the immigration and nationality act ina gives the attorney general discretion to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee,which refers to an alien who is unwilling or unable to return to her home country b ecause of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.but there are limits to this protection.the ina requires that asylum applications be filed within one year of an alien arrival in the united states.a b.the alien must prove that she has timely filed her application by clear and convincing evidence.id.the only exceptions to the deadline are changed circumstances materially affecting eligibility for asylum,or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing the application.id.at a d.
in this case,the ij found that each of the petitioners asylum applications were untimely.dong only explanation for filing three years after his arrival was that he did not know that asylum was available.on appeal,petitioners do not appear to argue that this is a valid justification for making an exception to the time bar.instead,they seem to implicitly rely on b a,which would allow dong to derivatively obtain asylum through huang.this of course assumes that huang proved by clear and convincing evidence that she timely filed her asylum application.we agree with the ij that she did not succeed in doing so.huang insists that she arrived in the on february,one day under the she knew that this was the date because she was told it was valentine day.a romantic notion no doubt,but in spite of the fact that she has now been living in the for a number of years since her arrival,she has not mustered any evidence evincing that she arrived on or around this date.there is no documentation,valid or counterfeit,to indicate when she may have arrived.indeed,when asked about the passport she used to enter the country,she stated that she gave it back to the smugglers.huang also claims that she used her own passport to leave china,but gave that to the smugglers too,thereby leaving doubt as to when precisely she left china.in lieu of documentary evidence,she could have provided anecdotal evidence from relatives or acquaintances about her date of arrival or departure.she failed to do this as well.thus we are left with nothing more than her own testimony that she knew she arrived on february,because she was told it was valentine day.this in and of given the amount of time she has now spent in the not add up to clear and convincing evidence regarding her date of arrival.
since petitioners can not pass this statutory bar,they argue in the alternative that the ij ruling on asylum raises a question of law,and so we are not precluded from having jurisdiction to hear their claim.indeed,under the ina,n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general regarding timeliness of applications for asylum.a.it is true that the real id act amended the judicial review provisions of the ina to allow review of constitutional claims and questions of law.see,ramos gonzales,cir.nevertheless,we have squarely held that an ij determination that an asylum application is untimely is a factual determination,and does not raise a question of law.see vasile gonzales,cir perhaps vasile would like to shoehorn his untimely asylum claim into the question of law category,but it simply does not fit there.
there is yet another threshold issue that keeps this
