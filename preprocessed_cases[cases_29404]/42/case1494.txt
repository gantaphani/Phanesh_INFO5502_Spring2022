facts and procedural history 
dyer,a jamaican national,legally entered the united states on december.in,he was arrested by the philadelphia police department with packets of cocaine,a small amount of marijuana,and a firearm.following conviction,the court of common pleas of philadelphia county sentenced dyer on september,to two to four years imprisonment for delivery of a controlled substance cocaine,and two years probation for simple assault.on january,as a result of this conviction,the immigration and naturalization service ins ordered dyer deported.dyer was deported and subsequently reentered the united states without permission from the united states attorney general.
on october,ins special agent patrick mccall encountered dyer at rising sun avenue in philadelphia.agent mccall was at that address with a member of the baltimore city police department to arrest a female jamaican national in a matter not involving dyer.upon entering the building,agent mccall encountered dyer,along with another jamaican national,in the basement.agent mccall identified himself as a special agent with the ins and asked dyer about his citizenship.dyer responded that he was a citizen of jamaica and provided agent mccall with an alien registration card.a computer verification check of the card revealed that dyer had previously been deported because of a drug distribution conviction.dyer admitted the deportation and the drug conviction.dyer also admitted a marijuana conviction.agent mccall presented dyer with a reinstatement of deportation notice,which reinstated his former warrant of deportation.according to agent mccall,dyer was taken into custody for two reasons.first,dyer admitted that he was currently on probation in the city of philadelphia for a marijuana conviction,a status which would make him deportable.second,the ins duty agent informed agent mccall that dyer had a conviction in the city of philadelphia for delivery of cocaine for which he had served one to three years.
the following day,october,agent mccall contacted the united states attorney office f or criminal prosecution for reentry after deportation.the united states attorney office did not respond to agent mccall until october.on october,agent mccall compared the fingerprints of the individual sentenced on september,for delivery of a controlled substance with the fingerprints obtained from dyer on october.the result of the comparison convinced agent mccall that dyer was the same individual who previously had been convicted of cocaine distribution.on october,agent mccall obtained a certificate of nonexistence of records,which showed no record that dyer had ever applied to the united states attorney general for permission to reenter the united states following his initial deportation.in a report dated november,agent mccall recommended that dyer be prosecuted for illegal reentry.on november,the united states attorney office accepted the case for prosecution.
dyer was indicted on november,for illegal reentry after deportation without the attorney general permission in violation of.dyer moved to dismiss the indictment pursuant to the speedy trial act.the district court held a hearing,at which agent mccall testified that an individual who illegally reenters the united states can be either prosecuted or deported without prosecution.while most illegal reentry cases are prosecuted,some are not,usually because paperwork was not properly filed or documents are missing from the file.agent mccall testified that he handles criminal and administrative matters at ins and that there is a separate deportation section.when an illegal reentrant is deported without prosecution,the deportation section,not the criminal and administrative section,arranges the deportation.
agent mccall testified at the speedy trial act hearing that,once dyer was taken into custody,the deportation section was notified.before the deportation section could deport dyer,it had to contact the jamaican consulate in order to obtain travel documents.agent mccall testified that he was aware that it typically takes six months to deport someone to jamaica.however,he was not familiar with the procedures followed by the deportation section,and,while he was investigating whether to recommend criminal prosecution or deportation without prosecution,he did not know what steps,if any,the deportation section was taking to arrange for dyer deportation.
agent mccall admitted that,at some time subsequent to the filing of the indictment,he became aware that the deportation section never obtained travel documents because this case became a criminal matter.on redirect examination,the following exchange occurred 
q okay.and the reason those documents were never requested by the ins is because this was a criminal matter that would then later on after the completion of a sentence or prosecution,then you would initiate the deportation procedure by asking for those papers,correct 
q and that has been done because this is a criminal matter 
the court do you know that those documents were requested 
the witness yes,your honor.he has not been formerly presented to the jamaican consulate for travel documents.
agent mccall also admitted that,shortly after taking dyer into custody,he subjectively came to believe that this case was a criminal matter.agent mccall testified that,while he intended that dyer be deported at the time he gave dyer the reinstatement of deportation notice,by the following day,he considered this case a criminal matter.during redirect examination by dyer attorney,the following exchange took place 
q and this case has always in your mind been a criminal matter 
a it was a criminal matter on october when i presented it to the attorney office.
however,even though agent mccall had subjectively thought this case might be a criminal matter since october,the case did not actually become a criminal matter until later.agent mccall testified that i thought it was a criminal matter shortly after dyer was taken into custody,but it did become a criminal matter until all the elements were received,one of which was the certification,no permission to reenter the united states,which i received on the of october.
following the speedy trial act hearing,the district court denied the motion to dismiss.dyer pled guilty but expressly reserved the right to appeal the district court denial of his speedy trial act motion.
on january,dyer was sentenced to months imprisonment,which is at the bottom of the sentencing guidelines range.at sentencing,dyer attorney made the following statement on dyer behalf 
he received a conviction a dozen years ago and he came back in the country to work in a legal sense.he was here illegally,but he was working in a legal sense.
it something that the court may consider,whether this case falls within the heartland of whether or not these laws were appropriate to dyer,the ones that are his sense they seem draconian because he comes back here to work and not to conduct himself in an illegal manner,and that why he getting a sentence which is percent greater than would otherwise be received,because we do want people to come in here and ply in illegal trade.
but dyer was not here to ply in illegal trade.he was here to work,albeit he was here illegally.i think that the court should take that into consideration when sentencing,and if the court did find that it was outside of the heartland of cases that we wish to approach with this percent increase,i believe the court is able to fashion a sentence below those guidelines.
if the court does not decide to do that,we would certainly ask the court to sentence dyer to at least at the bottom of the guidelines,which is months.
when dyer addressed the sentencing judge directly,he stated
