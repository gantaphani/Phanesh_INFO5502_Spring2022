opinion of the court 
in certain federal judicial districts,programs allow qualifying immigrant defendants to plead guilty while waiving,among other things,their appellate and rights.in turn,the government agrees to request a departure from the relevant sentencing guidelines range.none of the districts in the third circuit is a district.
pedro manuel arrelucea pled guilty to illegal reentry into the united states,in violation of a and b.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.arrelucea appeals his sentence,challenging,among other things,the court rejection of his argument for a downward variance based on the disparity in sentencing among immigration defendants in districts and districts 
the sentencing guidelines are advisory,and the supreme court decision in kimbrough united states,d,has rekindled discussion regarding districts and sentencing.the question before us is whether,it is an abuse of a sentencing judge discretion to consider varying from the sentencing guidelines in a jurisdiction based on the disparity created by lower immigration sentences in jurisdictions.prior to kimbrough we addressed this issue in united states vargas,cir.we take this opportunity to clarify vargas and expand on the issue in light of the supreme court recent guidance.we conclude that,under the logic of kimbrough,it is within a sentencing judge discretion to consider a variance from the guidelines on the basis of a disparity.
background 
arrelucea was born in peru,but moved to mexico with his wife and daughter in the late.he illegally entered the united states in,eventually living and working in new jersey,where he applied for residency.in he was convicted under new jersey law of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance,and was sentenced to years imprisonment.approximately four years later,however,he was deported to peru.
arrelucea illegally reentered the united states in december.he returned to new jersey and secured employment using his previously issued social security number.according to arrelucea,he supported his and two children living in the united states,and sent money to his mother and sisters living in peru.in june,at years old,arrelucea was arrested again in new jersey for possession with intent to distribute cocaine.this time,he was sentenced to five years in state prison.in september,after serving approximately months of his sentence,he was transferred to the custody of federal immigration and customs enforcement.
a federal grand jury indicted arrelucea on one count of illegal reentry,to which he pled guilty in may.at his plea colloquy,arrelucea admitted that he had been deported previously and had illegally reentered the united states.however,he did not make any admissions regarding his prior criminal history the government offered evidence of arrelucea and new jersey state felony convictions for possession with intent to distribute.
at arrelucea sentencing,he raised a facial constitutional challenge to the aggravated felony sentencing enhancement of the illegal reentry his prior convictions needed to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before the district court could enhance the normal calculation.the court rejected this argument and allowed certified copies of arrelucea prior convictions to establish his eligibility for an enhancement.
arrelucea also argued for a downward variance under a based on the disparity in sentence between and immigration districts.in his sentencing memorandum,he calculated his guidelines range in a district at to months imprisonment,rather than the higher to months imprisonment under his calculation,and advocated for a sentence of not more than months.the district court rejected this argument,concluding that our decision in vargas precluded consideration of a variance on this basis as a matter of law,and that the supreme court decision in kimbrough did not alter this analysis.
finally,arrelucea argued more generally that,based on his circumstances,the a factors supported varying down to impose a sentence below the guidelines range.for example,he stated that he only illegally reentered the country once to provide economic stability for his family and care for his daughters living in the united states,he worked and paid taxes while living in the united states,he suffers from ailments related to his age,he expressed remorse for his actions,and,after removal,he will no longer have the need to return to the united states because his children are grown and he has family in peru.the government opposed any downward variance.
the court declined to vary from the guidelines range,noting that arrelucea was deported initially after committing a serious drug offense and that when he returned he committed another serious drug offense.accordingly,it imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.
ii.standard of review 
we review a sentence for reasonableness under the deferential standard.gall united states,d.our review of procedural errors in sentencing includes a district court improper calculation of the guidelines,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.united states wise,cir.in reviewing for reasonableness,alleged factual errors are subject to a clearly erroneous standard,but purely legal errors,such as a misinterpretation of the guidelines or the governing caselaw,are reviewed de novo.id.
iii.discussion 
we begin with some historical background on programs,which are also known as early disposition programs.they sprang up in federal judicial districts along the mexican border,starting in southern california,in the.local attorneys instituted these programs as an administrative mechanism to address the increase in their immigration caseload,such as the rise in prosecution of illegal reentry offenses,and to create a process for faster and more efficient disposition of these cases.sentencing comm n,report to congress,downward departures from the federal sentencing guidelines,at hereinafter sentencing commission report.
in,congress took note of this growing pattern.through the protect act it sanctioned these programs under certain circumstances.protect act,m b,stat.at see also sentencing commission report,at.the act,passed,was part of a more general effort by congress to deal with a perceived increase in the rate of departures from the sentencing guidelines.protect act,m a,stat.at see also sentencing commission report,at explaining that congress amended c statement of reasons for imposing a sentence and review of a sentence to facilitate meaningful appellate review of sentences,particularly departure decisions.
specifically concerning districts,the act directed the sentencing commission to promulgate a policy statement authorizing downward departures of no more than levels if the government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general and the united states attorney.protect act,m b,stat.at.shortly thereafter,in october,the sentencing commission created guideline,which provides that,upon motion of the government,the court may depart downward not more than levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general and the united states attorney for the district in which the court resides.this language tracks that of the protect act essentially verbatim.
in response to the protect act,the attorney general issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors discussing department of justice policies relating to authorization and administration of programs.memorandum from john ashcroft,att y,dep t of justice,to attorneys,reprinted in fed.sent.attorney general memorandum.as part of a plea agreement,a qualifying defendant,at a minimum,must agree to the factual basis that accurately reflects his offense conduct,agree not to file any federal rule of criminal procedure b motions,alleging a defect in the indictment or to suppress evidence,and waive the right to appeal and right to file for a writ of habeas corpus under except for ineffective assistance of counsel.in return,the government may commit to recommend a guidelines departure of not more than levels,or may implement a charge bargaining program where the parties agreement adjusts the initial guidelines calculation downward by reducing the charge.see attorney general memorandum.as of february,the attorney general had authorized programs in districts,though only of those have illegal reentry programs thus,programs exist in approximately of the federal judicial districts.see memorandum of dep t of justice,reauthorization of early disposition programs.
sentencing discretion 
arrelucea argument concerns the extent of the district court discretion at sentencing.the sentencing guidelines are now advisory only.united states booker,d.in united states gunter,cir and confirmed by the supreme court in kimbrough.at,and gall.at,we provided sentencing judges with a process for determining the appropriate sentence to impose on a defendant 
courts must continue to calculate a defendant guidelines sentence precisely as they would have before booker.
in doing so,they must formally rule on the motions of both parties and state on the record whether they are granting a departure and how that departure affects the guidelines calculation,and take into account our circuit case law,which continues to have advisory force.
finally,they are required to exercise their discretion by considering the relevant a factors in setting the sentence they impose regardless whether it varies from the sentence calculated under the guidelines.
gunter,at alterations in original omitted internal quotations and citations omitted holding a sentencing judge can consider the cocaine differential under step because those guidelines are advisory.the statutory a sentencing factors that must be given meaningful consideration in step include 
the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant 
the need for the sentence imposed a to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense b to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct c to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and d to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,medical care,or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner 
the kinds of sentences available 
the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for a the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines i issued by the sentencing commission,subject to any amendments made to such guidelines by act of congress and ii that,except as provided in section g,are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced 
any pertinent policy statement a issued by the sentencing commission,subject to any amendments made to such policy statement by act of congress and b that,except as provided in section g,is in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced 
the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct and 
the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.
a see wise,at explaining that the applicable a factors must be given meaningful consideration by sentencing judges.the guidelines are only one of the factors for a district court to weigh in determining the appropriate sentence to impose,and in doing so the court may not presume that the guidelines range is reasonable.gall.at.
we have spoken previously on the issue in vargas,a case.at sentencing for vargas illegal reentry offense,he requested a variance at gunter step,arguing that a sentence within the guidelines range would create an unwarranted disparity in violation of a.id.at.in rejecting this argument,we followed the second and fourth through eleventh circuits to hold that a district court refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a program does not make a sentence unreasonable.id.at.focusing specifically on subsection a,we reasoned that any sentencing disparity authorized through an act of congress can not be considered unwarranted.id.at.prior to kimbrough,nearly every court of appeals to consider the issue had uniformly rejected arguments by defendants that any disparity created by these programs is unwarranted under this subsection.id.at citing cases from other courts of appeals.consequently,we concluded that vargas sentence was reasonable.
the supreme court added another landmark to the sentencing landscape when it addressed the cocaine sentencing guidelines disparity in kimbrough.the abuse act of,stat.adopted a ratio that treated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of grams of powder cocaine.kimbrough.at.the sentencing commission did not use an empirical approach in formulating the guidelines,as is part of its institutional role,but instead employed the congressional ratio scheme.id.at.the commission later criticized that ratio,concluding that the resulting disparity between crack and cocaine sentences fails to meet the sentencing objectives.id.at describing the commission criticism and congress rejection of amendments to the guidelines that would have replaced the ratio with,at various times,a,or even ratio,and the commission unilateral change that reduced the crack base offense level by two levels.
based on this background,kimbrough held that a district court may deviate from the guidelines range for crack cocaine offenses,even in a case,if it concludes that the disparity between ranges for crack and powder cocaine results in a sentence greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives of a.id.at.under booker,the cocaine guidelines,like all other guidelines,are advisory only,and courts err in concluding that the disparity reflected in the guidelines is effectively mandatory.id.at,see also gall.at holding it is procedural error to treat the guidelines as mandatory.
significantly,the court rejected the government argument that the cocaine sentencing disparity in the guidelines was binding on district courts because it accorded with a policy mandated by congress in the act.kimbrough.at.rather,it found that in the act congress explicitly mandated only statutory maximum and minimum sentences,not the ratio reflected in the guidelines for the full range of cocaine quantities.id.at.
this year,in spears united states,d,the supreme court reconfirmed and succinctly explained its holding in kimbrough.
the only fact necessary to justify such a variance is the sentencing court disagreement with the g policy view that the ratio creates an unwarranted disparity that was indeed the point of kimbrough a recognition of district courts authority to vary from the crack cocaine guidelines based on policy disagreement with them,and not simply based on an individualized determination that they yield an excessive sentence in a particular case.
id.at emphasis in original.
a district court sentencing discretion in a district remains the same at steps and.that is,for a sentence to be procedurally reasonable,a court that disagrees with the sentencing disparity created by programs can not alter the calculation of the guidelines at step to comport with the calculation in a district,nor do we understand that it could unilaterally grant a formal departure pursuant to guideline under step without the government recommendation we deal in this case only with a district court ability to consider a variance on the basis of a argument at step when fashioning an appropriate sentence to meet the a sentencing objectives.
vargas holding under step it is not an abuse of a sentencing judge discretion to decline to vary on the basis of viable after kimbrough.vargas,at.this accords with gunter,where we explained that a district court is under no obligation to impose a sentence below the applicable guidelines range solely on the basis of the cocaine differential.at.thus,in reviewing a district court sentence,we do not conclude that a sentence is per se unreasonable because the judge declined to vary from the guidelines range based on a defendant argument.
we must clarify vargas,however,to the extent that it has been the district court did prohibiting a sentencing court discretion to consider a disparity argument because such a disparity is warranted by congress under a.that interpretation is no longer the view of our court in light of kimbrough analytic reasoning 
the issue should not be confined to subsection a,which concerns avoid ing unwarranted sentencing disparities.instead,we hold that a sentencing judge has the discretion to consider a variance under the totality of the a factors rather than one factor in isolation on the basis of a defendant argument,and that such a variance would be reasonable in an appropriate case.
we analogize this issue to the crack cocaine question dealt with in kimbrough.in the cocaine guidelines context,the supreme court stated that a sentencing judge must include the guidelines range in the array of factors warranting consideration.the judge may determine,however,that,in the particular case,a sentence is greater than necessary to serve the objectives of sentencing.kimbrough.at.the court held that,i n making that determination,the judge may consider the disparity between the guidelines treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses,and,t o reach an appropriate sentence,disparities must be weighed against the other a factors.id.at.by logical extension we believe a judge may also consider the disparate treatment of immigration defendants that is created by programs in determining whether a guidelines sentence is greater than necessary under the a factors.
congressional policy 
three of our sister circuit courts of the fifth,ninth,and eleventh taken another approach in this issue after kimbrough,concluding that it has no effect on sentencing arguments united states,cir kimbrough,which concerned a district court ability to sentence in disagreement with guideline policy,does not control this case,which concerns a district court ability to sentence in disagreement with congressional policy.united states,cir same united states,cir same and refusing to apply kimbrough to disparity issue because kimbrough dealt with the cocaine guidelines.these courts of appeals focused on congressional policy expressed in the protect act as the sole factor distinguishing the issue from the crack cocaine question in kimbrough.because of this,they essentially concluded that the guidelines are binding on the question.
we disagree with this analysis.focusing on congressional policy here is illusory,as we will explain in more detail,and it does not justify prohibiting a district court discretion at sentencing moreover,we reject as superficial the factual distinction made by the eleventh circuit court in,at,that kimbrough dealt with cocaine sentencing disparity and not sentencing disparity.see united states,cir stating in an illegal reentry case that w e thus see no reason to limit the authority recognized in kimbrough and confirmed in spears to the cocaine context nor do we stand alone in that regard.citing cases from the first,second,fifth,ninth,and tenth circuit courts of appeals.
instead,we are more aligned with the view of the first circuit court expressed in united states rodriguez.cir holding that a district court can consider disparity as grounds for a variance see also united states stone,cir and our precedent has interpreted kimbrough as supplying this power even where a guideline provision is a direct reflection of a congressional directive.
there is no question that the guidelines are advisory only.the congressional policy argument attempts to carve out an exception to this booker norm by binding a district court sentencing discretion on the issue.the crux of the argument is that the protect act congressional directive sanctioning programs in certain judicial districts necessarily authorizes disparate sentencing of immigration defendants between and districts,so that the disparity is not unwarranted under a.thus,a district court can not vary from the guidelines range on the basis of a disagreement with the treatment of defendants in districts because it is mandated by congress.most courts took this position see,for example,vargas,at collecting cases,but it does not have continued vitality.
in kimbrough,the supreme court rejected the government argument that the cocaine ratio represented a specific policy determinatio n that congress has directed sentencing courts to observe,thus making it an exception to the general freedom that sentencing courts have to apply the a factors.at alteration in original internal quotations omitted.the court made clear that,absent an express directive from congress,it would not read any implicit directive into the abuse act of.id.at explaining that congress used the ratio to trigger the mandatory minimums and maximums.we think the supreme court rejection of the government argument in kimbrough crosses over to apply to the implicit congressional directive argument made to support sentencing disparities.
the protect act contains no express congressional directive that would constrain a sentencing judge discretion to vary from the guidelines.the first circuit court stated in rodriguez that 
by its terms,the guideline,which restates the protect act congressional directive,neither forbids nor discourages the use of a particular sentencing rationale,and it says nothing about a district court discretion to deviate from the g uidelines based on disparity under the a factors.the statute simply authorizes the sentencing commission to issue a policy statement and,in the wake of kimbrough,such a directive,whether or not suggestive,is not decisive as to what may constitute a permissible ground for a variant sentence.
at internal quotations and citation omitted.
as embodied in the guidelines,congress generally sanctioned programs as a matter of prosecutorial discretion and cabined the extent of a formal departure at step pursuant to these programs.the protect act did not reduce sentences for illegal reentry defendants in any specific districts,nor did it dictate the departure level in districts for similarly situated defendants.see united states,d,surveying various departure levels in districts.moreover,as with all departure motions,the act did not bind a sentencing court to accept the government motion,and a court can exercise its discretion to reject the departure.
the act also did not expressly stop an individual sentencing judge from granting variances at step in districts based on the congressionally mandated a factors,nor did it require courts to mete out higher sentences than courts in jurisdictions.see kimbrough.at discussing that congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms rodriguez,at noting that the protect act says nothing about the court capacity to craft a variant sentence within the maximum and minimum limits.by contrast,congress expressly defined that the statutory maximum for illegal reentry is years,and a district court can not exceed that maximum sentence.see b a prior aggravated felony triggers this maximum penalty.
in sum,a guideline is not a statute.if congress does not want district courts to exercise their judicial function to sentence defendants based on the facts and circumstances of each case under the guidance of the a factors,then it has the power to amend the pertinent statute.it has not done so here.indeed,to argue otherwise is an attempt to manipulate the advisory character of the guidelines thus,the attempt to distinguish programs from the sentencing guidance provided in kimbrough,and constrain a district court sentencing discretion solely on the basis of a congressional policy argument,is unpersuasive.see kimbrough.at indicating that when congress exercised its power to bar district courts from using a particular sentencing rationale,it did so by the use of unequivocal terminology.
paradoxically,the fifth circuit court case,which relied on the congressional policy rationale to differentiate the issue from kimbrough,appears to have curtailed a district court sentencing discretion more than it had before that decision.the court at first stated that it 
has never held that a district court may not consider and give effect to defendant argument for a reduced sentence on th e basis of a disparity.rather our cases have only concluded that a district court is not required to factor in,when sentencing a defendant,the sentencing disparity caused by early disposition programs to prevent a sentence from being unreasonable.
at internal quotations and citations omitted.yet it went on to say that it would be an abuse of discretion for the district court to deviate from the guidelines on the basis of sentencing disparity resulting from fast track programs that was intended by congress this deviation would result from an erroneous view of the law.id.at citation omitted.in light of kimbrough,this statement strays from the standard set by the supreme court.in its sentencing cases,the court has been clear that a sentencing judge has discretion to impose a sentence grounded in the a factors regardless whether it varies from the guidelines range.see,rita united states,d gall.at.
moreover,the existence of programs in several districts underscores that these alternative,programs operate outside the bounds of not only the protect act,but also guidelines.see,d at see also sentencing commission report,at indicating that these programs may be used to achieve sentencing outcomes below the otherwise applicable g uideline s range and the effect of charge bargaining on achieving the statutory purposes of sentencing is hard to analyze.the way these programs work is that,rather than recommending a departure via motion at step,the government at the outset reduces the more serious illegal reentry charge to one or two less serious entry,or eluding examination and inspection by an alien,in violation of a.the qualifying defendant pleads guilty to one or both of these lesser charges,and thus alters the guidelines range calculation at step.
as noted,this type of immigration protocol can result in a sentence that is lower than what would have been a departure from an illegal reentry offense.see,d at.programs are not part of the protect act,and are only incorporated into the attorney general policy memorandum.see,attorney general memorandum discussing programs.though these programs appear to be a permissible extension of prosecutorial discretion,there is nothing to show that defendants in districts are less culpable than those who have committed the same offense in districts.while brings even greater disparity to the system by fostering lower sentences for certain immigration offenses,it does not violate the protect act.because it is not included in the protect act and thus is not swept into the congressional policy argument,as part of a district court sentencing function,particularly a,the court could take into account such disparate treatment among these immigration defendants.
deference to the guidelines 
the supreme court explained in gall that the guidelines range is not presumptively reasonable,but generally acts as the initial benchmark in crafting a sentence.gall.at.a sentencing judge factors in the guidelines range to secure nationwide consistency,id.at,because the sentencing commission develops the guidelines to reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve a objectives in the heartland of cases.kimbrough.at quoting rita.at.in the normal course,the commission discrete institutional role is to formulate the guidelines through a detailed empirical approach by surveying national sentencing practices,sentencing practices,judicial decisions,other data,or comments from participants and experts in the field.see kimbrough.at citing rita.at explaining that the commission has the capacity the courts lack to make these empirical determinations.
however,if the commission does not act in its characteristic role,then a sentencing judge can give those guidelines less deference,even in a case,because they fail properly to reflect a considerations.kimbrough.at quoting rita.at.kimbrough concluded that the commission did not act in its institutional capacity in the crack cocaine context,and we believe that it similarly did not do so in the context.
the sentencing commission implemented congress directive at section m b of the protect act regarding early disposition programs by adding a new policy statement at guidelines,but in doing so it also openly expressed its criticism,specifically the potential for unwarranted sentencing disparity based on geography.sentencing commission report,at.the commission stated 
the department of justice requested that the commission implement the directive regarding the early disposition programs in section m of the protect act in a similar unfettered manner by merely restating the legislative language the commission notes that implementation of the directive in this manner has the potential to create unwarranted sentencing disparity defendants sentenced in districts without authorized early disposition programs,however,can be expected to receive longer sentences than defendants in districts with such programs.this type of geographical disparity appears to be at odds with the overall sentencing reform act goal of reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity among defendants.
t he commission can not determine the full impact of fast track programs on the departure rate because fast track departures are documented in various ways by the judicial districts that have such programs.
id.at,emphases added.kimbrough.at indicating that the sentencing commission immediately used the ratio to define base offense levels for all crack and powder offenses,but in a commission report later determined that the sentencing disparity is generally unwarranted and fails to meet the sentencing objectives set forth by congress in the sentencing reform act.indeed,it appears that,absent a downward variance,defendants sentenced in districts who would have been eligible for treatment in districts receive longer sentences then their counterparts simply by virtue of the geographic district where they are prosecuted.kimbrough.at noting that the ratio yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those for powder offenses involving equal amounts of drugs.
moreover,the implementation of districts appears to be uneven.see sentencing commission,sourcebook of federal sentencing statistics,at,sourcebook see also united states,d,stating that,based on statistical information provided by the government for fiscal year,the western district of washington,a district,has less than one illegal reentry case per prosecutor per year,and in other districts,such as oregon,idaho,nebraska,and north dakota,each ausa on average handles only two or three illegal reentry cases per year.for example,in the district of nebraska,which is a district,immigration offenses comprised of all sentences,while in the northern district of florida,which is a track district,immigration offenses comprised of all sentences.sourcebook,at,see also stephanos bibas,regulating local variations in federal sentencing,stan,discussing unjustified sentencing variations based on programs and noting that some districts that process large numbers of immigration cases employ programs,while other districts with similar or heavier loads,such as the southern district of florida,do not offer these programs jane mcclellan jon sands,federal sentencing guidelines and the policy paradox of early disposition programs,in some districts with a high rate of immigration cases,such as the district of nevada,the new york districts,certain florida districts,and certain divisions in the southern district of texas,there are still no plea offers.
these statistics lead us to question whether all approved districts actually have overwhelming immigration caseloads,which is what congress appears to have accepted as a given in enacting the protect act sanctioning of such programs.the sentencing commission has also observed that reliable data documenting the effect of these programs is difficult to ascertain.see,sentencing commission report,at.consequently,it does not appear to be clear to the commission based on its limited statistical analysis,nor is it evident to us,why some districts have programs while others do not 
like the cocaine ratio in kimbrough,the departure scheme do
