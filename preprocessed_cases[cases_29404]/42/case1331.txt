opinion of the court 
mohammad arif shardar seeks review of an order of the board of immigration appeals board or bia denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings.because we conclude that the board abused its discretion in denying the motion,we grant the petition for review and remand with instructions to reopen the proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
shardar is a native of bangladesh.he became a member,and later a local leader,of the jatiya party.that political party was formed by army chief of staff general ershad,who seized power in a bloodless coup in and ruled bangladesh until he was forced to resign in december.in,shardar became secretary of the jatiya party in demra,a suburb of the capital,dhaka.in the wake of ershad resignation,there was violence directed against those associated with ershad and the jatiya party.in demra,jatiya party headquarters were ransacked by members of rival political factions and shardar life was threatened.one of the rival political parties,the bangladesh nationalist party bnp,won national elections in february.
in january,shardar participated in a political demonstration in support of the jatiya party in jatrabari square in demra.during the demonstration,police dispersed the crowd with tear gas and arrested shardar and three others.shardar was charged with having weapons and explosives,but he testified in removal proceedings that the demonstration was peaceful and that the allegations against him were false following his arrest,shardar testified that he was severely beaten by police.the police struck him with canes and kicked him.they also told him that ershad time is over.now is bnp time.app.at.while in custody,shardar was forced to confess to the charges against him and to renounce the jatiya party in order to stop the beating and save his life.after three days in the police station and six days in a jail,shardar appeared before a judge and was released on bail.he was then taken by his father to a private medical clinic for nine days to receive treatment for the injuries he sustained while in police custody.
fearful of further police brutality and not confident in his ability to get a fair trial,shardar evaded the police who came looking for him on several occasions.eventually,a warrant was issued for his arrest because of his failure to attend a hearing.when the police discovered that he was hiding at a friend house,shardar decided to flee the country and procured a false passport.he entered the united states in august and filed an affirmative application for asylum in november of that year.
after initially denying his asylum claim,the government began removal proceedings shardar requested asylum relief and withholding of removal.a hearing was held before an immigration judge in february,at which shardar testified and presented evidence.in july,the ij denied his claim for asylum and for withholding of removal but allowed him to depart the united states voluntarily.the ij found shardar credible the respondent testified extremely credibly with regard to his incarceration and the beatings that he suffered,and specifically credited his testimony regarding the beatings he had received at the hands of the police.
nevertheless,while conceding that shardar could arguably show past persecution,the ij rejected his asylum claim after concluding that he had not shown that his arrest was pretextual or that he could not receive justice in the bangladeshi courts.the ij insisted that shardar feared prosecution,not persecution.in rejecting shardar contentions,the ij specifically relied on a state department report,which stated that jatiya party members who had been harassed by the bnp were able to defend themselves in court actions and have the same judicial rights as other bangladeshis.app.at.without some evidence that the judicial system was corrupt,the ij concluded that shardar could not sustain his burden of showing a fear of persecution.
in august,shardar appealed the ij decision to the board,and on june,he moved to reopen removal proceedings in order to seek relief under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,treaty doc.the board affirmed the ij decision and denied his motion to reopen in march,stating that it had no reason to conclude that the prosecution shardar may face if he returns to bangladesh is politically motivated,and there is no reason to find that he would be unable to establish his claimed innocence.shardar petitioned for review of the board decision in our court and,based on the record before us at that time,we denied that petition in august.shardar ashcroft,cir.
following our court denial of his petition for review,shardar filed a motion before the board in october to reopen his removal proceedings based on changed country conditions and new evidence.specifically,shardar presented evidence that the of the bnp as the ruling party in bangladesh in represented a change in country condition and that his position as a former local leader of the jatiya party made it likely that he would be persecuted if returned to bangladesh.the board denied his motion to reopen in a order,which concluded that shardar had not adequately demonstrated that his situation is appreciably different from the dangers faced by all his countrymen,and that he had failed to establish that materially changed country conditions exist in bangladesh.shardar filed a timely petition for review of the board order.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the bia has jurisdiction over motions to reopen removal proceedings under a.our court has jurisdiction over shardar petition for review under.cruz att y,cir congress has explicitly granted federal courts the power to review any final order of removal under a.implicit in this jurisdictional grant is the authority to review the denial of a motion to reopen any such final order.
we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion and review its underlying factual findings related to the motion for substantial evidence.filja gonzales,cir internal citation omitted.its denial of a motion to reopen may only be reversed if it is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.id.quoting sevoian ashcroft,cir.
iii.discussion 
introduction 
the resolution of this appeal turns on two related but analytically distinct issues whether shardar has presented evidence of changed country conditions sufficient to allow him to file a motion to reopen more than days after the board rejected his claims and whether the new evidence shardar has presented and the prior evidence in the record together show that he has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on his asylum claim,whether he has presented a prima facie case for asylum the first is a threshold question does the new evidence show a change in country conditions that would allow the motion to reopen to be brought the second then asks a question about the merits does the new and the old evidence together make out a prima facie case for asylum we conclude that the decision of the board answering no to these two questions is both irrational and arbitrary thus it abused its discretion.furthermore,to the extent the board decision is grounded in a factual finding that shardar situation is not appreciably different from the dangers faced by all his countrymen,that finding is not supported by substantial evidence.
governing legal standards 
under b,the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee.a refugee is defined as 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
a a.an applicant bears the burden of proving eligibility for asylum based on specific facts and credible testimony.guo ashcroft,cir.a fear of persecution is the key to eligibility.b.persecution includes threats to life,confinement,torture,and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a real threat to life or freedom.lukwago ashcroft,cir quoting lin ins,cir.the persecution must be committed by the government or forces the government is unable or unwilling to control.vente gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to qualify for asylum,the applicant must show that the persecution is on account of one of the statutorily recognized grounds,race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.lukwago,at.
if an applicant demonstrates past persecution on account of a protected ground there is a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution,as long as that fear is related to the past persecution.id.at b.this presumption may only be rebutted if the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that t here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution or t he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant country of nationality and it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.b i.
an applicant who fails to demonstrate past persecution may still qualify for asylum if he shows that he has a fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.lukwago,at.a fear includes both a subjective and objective component.id.at.an applicant must show that he has a subjective fear of persecution that is supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility.id.quoting abdille ashcroft,cir see also b i.
motions to reopen 
there are both procedural and substantive hurdles that must be overcome in a motion to reopen removal proceedings.under the governing regulations,an alien may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings and that motion must be filed no later than days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered.c.however,the time and numerical limitations shall not apply to motions to reopen that apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.c.therefore,if the asylum applicant presents material evidence of changed country conditions that could not have been presented during the hearing before the ij,his motion can be considered,even if there has been a prior motion to reopen or the motion is beyond the time limit for filing.see filja,at.
with regard to the substantive hurdle,a s a general rule,motions to reopen are granted only under compelling circumstances.guo,at.the board has held that in exercising its discretion to reopen proceedings we have been willing to reopen where the new facts alleged,when coupled with the facts already of record,satisfy us that it would be worthwhile to develop the issues further at a plenary hearing on reopening.in re,wl bia june,internal quotation marks omitted.as noted,a motion to reopen must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought.guo,at.in order to make a prima facie case,the applicant must produce objective evidence showing a reasonable likelihood that he can establish that he is entitled to relief.id.quoting sevoian,at alteration in original.for an asylum claim,this means merely showing a realistic chance that the petitioner can at a later time establish that asylum should be granted.id.at.facts presented in the motion to reopen are accepted as true unless inherently unbelievable.bhasin gonzales,cir.that said,the regulations provide that t he board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.a.but while the board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen notwithstanding a prima facie showing,when it denies a motion to reopen on the ground that the applicant has failed to make a prima facie showing,we yet review that determination to ensure that it is supported by substantial evidence and is not an abuse of discretion.sevoian,at.
changed country conditions 
shardar brought his motion to reopen in october,more than days after the board final administrative decision was rendered in march.therefore,because his motion to reopen is untimely it must be based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality and be supported by new evidence that was not available during his hearing before the ij.c ii.
to show changed country conditions,shardar presented evidence that since the bnp returned to power in,the situation for jatiya party supporters has become more dangerous.when shardar fled bangladesh in,the jatiya party,in which he had been a local leader,had recently lost power to the bnp.his beating by the police was a politically motivated action by bnp supporters against shardar because of his association with the jatiya party.see shardar,at the evidence indicates these beatings were politically motivated.the bnp was in power in bangladesh until,at which time the awami league became the ruling party.in october,the bnp returned to power.it was during the time of the awami league rule,in,that the ij decided shardar asylum claim.thus,the evidence of changed country conditions submitted by shardar with his motion to reopen was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.c ii 
as part of his motion to reopen,shardar submitted a detailed affidavit by john adams,an expert in the society,politics,and economics of south asian countries.the government has not challenged adams qualifications or the reliability of his affidavit,which at this stage of the proceedings we must accept as true.the affidavit states that,while members of the jatiya party remained under pressure during the rule of the awami league,the of the bnp caused a sharp change in country conditions,restoring the context from which the applicant fled,but in a form that is more intensive and predatory.app.at.the affidavit continued there is a consistent pattern of abuse of political rights and political persecution for holding the jatiya party political opinions,perpetrated by the bnp,the police forces under its control,and the bnp allies,including radical islamist elements,which has intensified since october,sufficiently to represent a change in country conditions.id.at.as adams notes,following the bnp t he climate for parties in opposition to the government is becoming increasingly chilly in bangladesh.id.at.state department documents cited in the adams affidavit and reporting on conditions after the bnp state that police employed excessive,sometimes lethal,force in dealing with opposition demonstrators,and the police routinely employed physical and psychological torture during arrests and interrogations.id.at.in addition,criminal laws are frequently used as a pretext to punish and harass members of the political opposition.id.
the of the political party responsible for the applicant prior persecution is the type of situation that would constitute a change in country conditions.see filja,at.in filja,we rejected the government argument that the applicants motion to reopen was not timely.although not essential to our holding which rejected the legal standard for timeliness applied by the board,we suggested that the filjas could likely demonstrate changed country conditions because,a lthough at the time of the ij hearing the democratic party was in power,w hen in the socialist party returned to power the position of those supporting the democratic party became more precarious.id.at.shardar situation is analogous while the bnp was not in power at the time of shardar hearing before the ij,its constitutes a material change in conditions for an individual like shardar,who was previously beaten by the police force.
indeed,the board itself has agreed that the of the bnp is a change in bangladeshi country conditions for a member of the jatiya party seeking asylum.in re hossin,bia,unpublished.it specifically concluded that c onsidering the respondent political affiliation as a member of the jatiya party,the of the bnp in bangladesh would qualify as changed country circumstances warranting further review.id.wh
