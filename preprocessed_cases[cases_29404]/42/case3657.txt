miguel moriel appeals the district court denial of his motion to dismiss his indictment for illegal reentry into the united states by a deported alien in violation of.on an earlier appeal,we reversed the district court by concluding that the immigration judge ij at moriel deportation hearing should have informed moriel of possible relief under sections c and h of the immigration and nationality act ina.we remanded to the district court to determine whether the government could show that the ij error did not cause prejudice.on remand,the district court concluded that there was no prejudice because a visa was not immediately available to moriel,a prerequisite to receiving such relief.the district court also rejected moriel new arguments that he could obtain section c relief without an immediately available visa and that the government denied his right to counsel at his deportation hearing.we affirm.
moriel is a mexican citizen who entered the united states with his parents as a permanent resident in at the age of twelve.in,moriel pleaded guilty to assault with a firearm,in violation of california penal code section a,after he fired several gunshots at two occupants of a car and continued shooting at them as they fled on foot.moriel served months of a sentence.
upon moriel release from prison in,the government initiated deportation proceedings against him.the government alleged that moriel was deportable because his conviction involved the use of a firearm,see a c and was an aggravated felony,see a a iii.
an attorney entered an appearance for moriel in october,but at his april hearing moriel appeared without counsel.moriel told the ij that he spoke english,and the ij conducted the hearing without a translator.the ij told moriel that he had a right to be represented by counsel and gave him a list of organizations.moriel asked for time to find an attorney,and the ij granted a continuance.the ij warned moriel,however,that if he returned without an attorney he would not again continue the case and would assume that moriel would proceed pro se.when the hearing resumed,moriel said that he did not have an attorney,and he answered,yes,when the ij asked him if would speak for himself that day.moriel did not at this hearing ask for more time to find an attorney or indicate that he made an effort to obtain one.
when the ij explained to moriel his possible eligibility for relief,moriel told the ij that his parents were legal residents but not citizens.moriel also told the ij that he was single and did not mention that he had a girlfriend.the ij ordered moriel deported for having committed a crime involving the use of a firearm and an aggravated felony,and he made an additional oral finding that moriel committed a crime involving moral turpitude.
about eight months after his deportation hearing,moriel married a citizen,and as of the couple was still married and had three children.according to a written declaration by moriel wife,the two met in the fall of and became engaged soon after.moriel wife said that she and moriel would have definitely been married a few months earlier if we had been properly advised of the impact upon my husband immigration status in this country.
after his deportation,moriel illegally reentered the united states on many occasions.moriel illegally reentered the united states in july and was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia in january.the government reinstated his deportation order and deported him on january.immigration officials discovered moriel in the united states on july,after his arrest for domestic violence.the government charged moriel with violating,which prohibits the unauthorized reentry of a removed alien.moriel pleaded guilty and was sentenced to thirty months in prison.following his release from custody in,immigration authorities reinstated moriel deportation order and deported him.moriel once again illegally reentered the united states,and immigration officials found him once again in july.the government then charged moriel with violating.
all of this sounds a bit like a repeating refrain,as if moriel was in a revolving door and continuously left the united states via deportation only very shortly thereafter to return illegally.however,something new was added in this case.this time moriel challenged his underlying deportation order and filed a motion to dismiss the government indictment on the ground that the ij violated his rights by not informing him of the opportunity to seek discretionary relief under sections c and h of the ina.the district court denied moriel motion.moriel then pleaded guilty,reserving his right to appeal the district court decision.moriel received a sentence for his illegal reentry.
in an unpublished disposition,we reversed the district court.united states.cir.we concluded that the record disclosed sufficient information to infer that moriel was eligible to petition for adjustment of status under ina a along with a petition for waiver of deportation under either former ina c or ina h and that the ij incorrectly informed moriel that he was ineligible to apply for any relief from deportation.id.at.we further held that moriel presented a prima facie case of prejudice from the ij error of not informing him of section c relief and remanded so the district court could determine whether the government can demonstrate that a visa was not immediately available,and thus moriel is not entitled to relief.id.at.without an immediately available visa,moriel could not adjust his status under section a.id.
on remand,and after a hearing to determine the facts,the district court again denied moriel motion to dismiss the indictment,this time on the ground that the government had proven any errors by the ij did not cause prejudice because there was no visa immediately available to moriel at the time of his deportation hearing.the district court concluded that a visa would not have been available for moriel unless he had applied for one in.the district court determined that mere speculation that moriel could have obtained a visa in the future if he married his girlfriend or if his parents later applied for citizenship did not show that a visa was immediately available at the time of his deportation hearing.
the district court also entertained two arguments that moriel raised for the first time on remand first,the district court rejected moriel argument that his state conviction did not establish a basis for deportation.second,the district court concluded that the ij did not deny moriel his right to counsel by proceeding with the deportation hearing after moriel did not hire an attorney during the continuance.
moriel timely appealed the district court denial on remand of his motion to dismiss the indictment.after considering the factual record and the dispositive legal principles,we affirm.
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment when the motion to dismiss is based on alleged defects in the underlying deportation proceeding.united states,cir.to prevail on such a motion,moriel must establish that defects in the deportation proceeding violated his rights and that he suffered prejudice as a result of those defects.id.at.although moriel need not conclusively demonstrate that he would have received relief to show prejudice,he must show that there were plausible grounds for relief.united states,cir.
as we previously held,at the deportation hearing the ij should have advised moriel that he might have been eligible for relief from deportation under the former section c of the ina,c.section c granted the attorney general discretion to admit a liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceed abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation even if the aliens would otherwise be excluded under a.by its terms,section c offers waivers only from a denial of admissibility,not from deportation.therefore,in order to be eligible for section c relief,moriel must also have applied for and received an adjustment of status,converting his deportation hearing into an admissibility hearing.then,in an admissibility hearing,moriel could have filed a petition to immigrate,allowing him potential relief via section c.to adjust status,however,an alien must show that an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.a emphasis added hernandez ashcroft,cir i n order for an applicant to be eligible for adjustment of status,an immigrant visa must be immediately available at the time of filing.
the district court determined that under the applicable regulations limiting the number of immigrant visas available to particular aliens,a visa would only have been available to moriel had he applied for one by march,approximately five years before his deportation hearing,which he had not done.moriel does not contest this part of the district court decision.instead,he argues that a visa could have been immediately available to him had he married his girlfriend or had one of his parents become a citizen during the deportation hearing.see b a i exempting immediate relatives of citizens from numerical limits on visas.moriel contends that the ij should have informed him of these potential paths to obtain a visa and granted a continuance of the hearing until one of his parents became or moriel married a citizen.we disagree.
moriel argument is unpersuasive because he did not make the ij aware of the engagement with his girlfriend or of the possibility that one of his parents might become a citizen.the ij was required to inform the alien of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for section c relief.emphasis added see also united states,cir.yet u ntil the alien himself or some other person puts information before the judge that makes such eligibility apparent,this duty does not come into play.ins,cir.we do not require ijs to speculate about the possibility of anticipated changes of circumstances and advise aliens of facts not suggested in the record.see id.ijs are not expected to be clairvoyant the record before them must fairly raise the issue.
upon direct questioning,moriel told the ij that he was single.he mentioned neither his girlfriend nor any pending engagement.he also told the ij that his parents were not citizens,and the record does not indicate that his parents applied for naturalization or were even eligible to apply at the time of the deportation hearing.this advice from moriel to the ij renders fatal his contention that he should have been advised of potential changes that might have rendered a visa immediately available.neither the likelihood of a marriage of moriel or the likelihood of parental citizenship was apparent on the record before the ij,and the ij was not required to inform moriel of these potential methods of making a visa immediately available to him see bui ins,cir the regulations do not require the ij to scour the entire record or to interrogate an alien regarding all possible avenues of relief.stated another way,our precedent requires that an ij advise an immigrant of potential avenues of relief that are apparent from the record before the ij.however,our precedent does not require that an ij act creatively to advise an immigrant of ways in which his legal prospects at forestalling deportation might improve with fundamental changes in his status.
as the district court stated,cites no authority for the proposition that the immediately available requirement can be satisfied by the future possibility that an individual could take some action to place himself in a position such that he would have a visa immediately available.nor does moriel cite any such cases on appeal instead,he relies on a written declaration by an immigration lawyer who states that ijs have regularly granted a continuance of their hearing to allow the to process a relative naturalization application,which if granted,would render the alien eligible for adjustment of status.yet even if the statement is true,it refers only to filed applications awaiting processing,not applications that have yet to be filed.because a visa petition had neither been filed on behalf of moriel at the time of his hearing nor could have been filed by either his girlfriend or his noncitizen parents,the government has persuasively shown that a visa was not immediately available.without an immediately available visa,moriel could not have adjusted his status under section a therefore,moriel could not obtain section c relief.the ij failure to inform moriel of his section c options did not prejudice him see,at.
moriel also argues that he suffered prejudice when the ij did not inform him of potential relief under ina h,which grants the attorney general discretion to waive admissibility restrictions if exclusion of an alien would result in extreme hardship to the united states citizen or lawfully resident spouse,parent,son,or daughter of such alien.h b.
section h,like section c,is capable of waiving only a denial of admissibility,not deportation.therefore,moriel needed to adjust his status to receive section h relief.moriel could not adjust his status because a visa was not immediately available consequently,he was ineligible for section h relief.
moriel submits that he did not have to adjust his status to receive section h relief.he relies on in re sanchez,which held that an alien may obtain a section h waiver nunc pro tunc to cure a ground for inadmissibility that exists during a deportation hearing but did not exist at the time of a previous entry into the united states,bia.moriel argues that had the ij informed him of possible h relief,he could have departed and reentered the united states before his deportation order became final and been eligible for a section h waiver without an adjustment of status.
moriel argument is misplaced.if moriel could have been eligible for section h relief without an adjustment of status by leaving and reentering the united states during his deportation hearing,then he also would have been eligible for section c relief by performing the same act.but by remanding moriel initial appeal on section c relief with instructions to determine whether a visa was immediately available,we implicitly rejected the possibility that moriel could receive section c relief without adjusting his status.moriel does not argue on this appeal that he is eligible for section c relief for this reason,and he cites no case holding that the government prejudiced an alien when the ij did not mention possible section c or h relief in a deportation hearing merely because the alien could have left and reentered but did not do so.the district court properly concluded that moriel was ineligible for section h relief,absent an adjustment of status,because he never attempted to leave and reenter the united states prior to the finalization of the deportation order 
for the first time on remand moriel further argued that he was eligible for section c relief without an adjustment of status because the government did not establish that his state conviction categorically satisfied the federal firearm statute.see taylor united states,d.
at the time of moriel deportation hearing,a deportable alien was eligible for section c relief if the applicable ground for deportation was substantially identical to a ground for exclusion.komarenko ins,cir,overruled by abebe mukasey,cir en banc per curiam.our precedential view of equal protection at the time of his deportation hearing required that the government extend section c relief to aliens facing deportation if those aliens would have been eligible for the same relief had they left the united states and attempted to reenter.ins,cir,overruled by abebe,at.
although his briefing is vague,when charitably construed,moriel argument is that his firearm offense was not a valid ground for deportation and the remaining,valid grounds for deportation are substantially similar to the crime involving moral turpitude exclusion ground in section a of the ina.
regardless of the merits of moriel claim moriel was still ineligible for section c relief without an adjustment of status.setting aside the ij conclusion that moriel was deportable for a firearm offense,the remaining ground for involving moral not the only ground for which moriel was deportable.the government charged moriel with deportation
