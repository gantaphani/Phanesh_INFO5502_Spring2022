following a bench trial on a record of stipulated facts,defendant appellant beth stewart was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the united states for participating in a sham marriage to secure a change in immigration status for her spouse.she appeals,arguing that the prosecution was because she committed no overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy within the period before the return of the indictment.we disagree,and affirm.
facts background 
on september,a grand jury returned a indictment charging stewart with conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of.the indictment was filed the following day.the indictment charged that stewart was a united states citizen,and that her spouse identified only by his initials,fn was a citizen of kenya who had entered the united states legally,but whose authorization to remain was set to expire.the indictment alleged that,f rom on or about march,and continuing until a date unknown but at least june,stewart knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed,with others both known and unknown to the grand jury,to participate in a sham marriage for the purpose of defrauding the united states.according to the indictment,the conspiracy had two objects for stewart to profit financially by accepting payments from,including fn,in exchange for participating in a sham marriage and helping fn obtain a change of his immigration status and for fn to acquire a change of united states immigration status to which he would not otherwise have been entitled by falsely representing to agencies of the united states government that the marriage into which fn had entered was bona fide when in fact it was not.
finally,the indictment alleged that stewart committed the following overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy she entered into a sham marriage with fn on march,knowing that the sole purpose of the wedding was to permit fn to apply for a change in immigration status to which he would not otherwise have been entitled between the wedding date and october,she traveled to massachusetts and obtained various documents to make it appear that she and fn were living together when in fact they were not,understanding that these documents would be filed in support of fn petition to have his immigration status changed on october,she and fn attended an interview at the boston offices of the citizenship and immigration service uscis in support of that petition,with fn being granted conditional residency on that date based upon the information they had provided and on june,she traveled to massachusetts and signed a form i,petition to remove conditions on residence,on fn behalf,which form was subsequently filed with uscis.
stewart filed a motion to dismiss the indictment as,arguing that the signing and filing of the form i the only overt act alleged within the statute of limitations period,see was not done in furtherance of the conspiracy.she contended that the object of the conspiracy had been achieved on october,when uscis granted fn lawful permanent resident lpr status on a conditional basis thus,she insisted,the form i was irrelevant to the conspiratorial objectives.the government argued that fn receipt of conditional lpr status was simply the first step toward unconditional legal permanent residence and eventually citizenship,and the filing of the form i was a further step in that process.the district court denied stewart motion,holding that the indictment was facially sufficient to put her on notice of the elements of the crime and the nature of the charge,and that it was not for the court to inquire whether the evidence would ultimately be sufficient to support that charge.
the matter then proceeded to a bench trial on a record of stipulated facts and associated exhibits.we summarize those stipulations here.fn was a kenyan national who entered the united states in on a visa that was set to expire in september of.through various third parties,stewart learned that a marriage arranger was looking for someone to marry a foreign national in return for.she agreed to participate in the sham marriage.on march,stewart met fn for the first time at the city hall in auburn,maine,where the two applied for and obtained a marriage license.they were married later that day,with stewart and fn both signing the marriage license and listing as their residence an address where neither had ever lived.stewart understood that the purpose of the marriage was to allow fn to stay in the united states and that she would be paid for her participation.after the ceremony,stewart was paid.in june,fn gave stewart a money order for,which she used to secure an apartment in lewiston,maine.fn never resided in that apartment,and in fact lived in massachusetts.stewart occasionally traveled to massachusetts after the marriage once,she went to what she understood to be fn apartment,where the two posed for photographs another time,she obtained a massachusetts identification card,listing as her residence a lowell,massachusetts,address where she had never lived yet another time,she and fn opened a joint bank account.in may,fn or someone acting on his behalf signed stewart name to several uscis forms,seeking to have fn immigration status changed on the basis of the marriage.fn also signed a form i seeking the same relief.in august,fn gave stewart an additional.stewart gave fn copies of her w forms for,which fn or someone acting on his behalf used to generate what purported to be stewart tax returns for those years.the marriage certificate,photographs,massachusetts identification card,and tax returns,as well as copies of checks drawn on their joint account,were all submitted to uscis along with their joint petitions.on october,stewart and fn attended an interview in support of the petitions at the boston office of uscis,where they both intentionally created the impression that they entered into their marriage in good faith,lived together,and intended to establish a life together.based on the written and verbal information they provided,uscis granted their petitions and granted fn conditional residency.in february of and march of,stewart and fn signed and filed joint tax returns for and,respectively,listing themselves as spouses and listing stewart daughter as a dependent.in june of,stewart signed a residential lease extension indicating that she and fn continued to live together in lowell,massachusetts in april of,she signed a lease indicating that she and fn had rented an apartment in dracut,massachusetts.on june,stewart and fn signed uscis form i,seeking to have the conditions on fn residency lifted.they submitted their and tax returns and the leases in support of their application.at some point,the i petition was withdrawn.in addition to the,fn provided stewart per month through at least november to help support stewart and her daughter.
neither party sought to introduce additional evidence aside from the stipulated facts and exhibits.in briefing,stewart argued that the government had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the object of the conspiracy consisted of anything beyond procuring the change in residency status and the payment of to stewart.she contended that,because the conspiratorial objective was achieved with fn attainment of conditional lpr status,the filing of form i was not in furtherance of the conspiracy.because,the argument continued,fn was granted conditional lpr status nearly six years before the grand jury returned the indictment,the government had not met its burden of proving that she had committed any overt act within the limitations period.the district court disagreed,and found her guilty as charged in the indictment.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the central question raised in this appeal is whether the district court correctly found that the filing of form i was an overt act committed in furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy as alleged in the indictment.stewart argues that the district court erred in denying her motion to dismiss on limitations grounds,a ruling we review de novo,see united states bucci,cir.
the conspiracy statute under which stewart was charged provides that 
if two or more persons conspire either to c
