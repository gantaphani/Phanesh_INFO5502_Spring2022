petitioner carrol morgan is subject to an order of removal pursuant to section a a iii of the immigration and naturalization act,a a iii,as a resident alien who has been convicted of drug offenses classified as aggravated felonies.petitioner contends that she is not removable because she obtained derivative united states citizenship upon her mother naturalization while her parents allegedly were separated.because petitioner can not establish that her parents were legally separated at the time her mother was naturalized,we will deny the petition for review.
under former section a of the immigration and naturalization act,a,a child born outside the united states automatically acquires united states citizenship if,while the child is under the age of eighteen,the parent with legal custody of the child is naturalized while that child parents are legally separated.a.
petitioner was born in jamaica in.her parents married in that country in.four years later,her mother,verna mae morgan,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident.in,petitioner joined her mother in the united states,also entering as a lawful permanent resident.on july,when petitioner was age sixteen,her mother was naturalized.her father,hopeton morgan,entered the united states on december,and lived with her mother in philadelphia,pennsylvania.neither petitioner nor her father have ever been naturalized.
in april,petitioner was charged with being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and therefore subject to removal.she applied for withholding of removal,asylum and relief under the convention against torture.
the ij refused the petitioner requests for a continuance of the proceedings and,after a hearing,denied asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture.the ij also rejected the petitioner contention that,because she was born out of wedlock,she was eligible for derivative citizenship under upon her mother naturalization.petitioner appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,again asserting derivative citizenship,but on this occasion she contended that she was eligible because her mother and father were legally separated at the time of the naturalization.
the bia dismissed petitioner appeal on july,finding that she had failed to establish derivative citizenship because there was no evidence that the petitioner mother was ever legally separated from her father.in reaching this conclusion,the board relied on case law that interpreted the statutory term legal separation to mean separation recognized or achieved through judicial proceedings.the board noted that the petitioner request for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,based on the same claim for derivative citizenship,had been denied.see ashcroft,wl.may.the board also rejected the petitioner complaint about the ij refusals of continuances because the motions lacked sufficient articulation of the facts or evidence that could have demonstrated that actual prejudice or harm resulted from the denials.
in this petition for review,petitioner has abandoned her claims for withholding of removal,asylum and relief under the convention against torture.she argues only that the ij erred in concluding that she had not obtained derivative citizenship and in denying her motions for continuance of the hearing.
b a grants us jurisdiction to review a claim of nationality if there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to that claim.a c,however,provides in relevant part,that except as provided in subparagraph d,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered by section a a ii.subparagraph d provides that we have jurisdiction to consider any constitutional and legal questions that may be presented in this petition for review,notwithstanding anything in subparagraph c.see a d.
though subparagraph d,as part of the real id act,did not become law until may,the act applies retroactively to any case,in which the final administrative order of removal,deportation,or exclusion was issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this division.real id act of b,stat.we have held that the real id act amendments restoring our jurisdiction apply to all pending or future petitions for direct review challenging final orders of removal,except as may otherwise be provided in.papageorgiou gonzales,cir.thus,we have jurisdiction to consider any constitutional or legal claims that may be presented in this petition for review.
the issue of derivative citizenship is a purely legal issue of statutory interpretation.see jordon attorney general,cir.we also have jurisdiction to consider the constitutional claim that the ij violated the petitioner due process rights.see papageorgiou,at.
the immigration and nationality act confers citizenship on children born outside of the united states to alien parents when certain statutory conditions are met.see miller albright,d citing united states wong kim ark,for the proposition that persons born outside of the united states may acquire united states citizenship only as provided by acts of congress minasyan gonzales,cir since the enactment of the first naturalization statute in,our immigration laws have conferred derivative citizenship on the children of a naturalized citizen,provided certain statutorily prescribed conditions are met.
the law applicable is that in effect at the time the critical events giving rise to the claim for derivative citizenship occurred.minasyan,at.the relevant times are the date of the child birth,the time of the child entry into the united states,and the date of the parent naturalization.see bagot ashcroft,cir listing relevant times for derivative citizenship claims.in this case,was in effect when all of the critical events occurred.
in relevant part,a provides that a child born outside of the united states of alien parents becomes a citizen of the united states upon t he naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents a.the child must also be under eighteen years of age at the time of the parent naturalization and be residing in the united states as a lawful permanent resident 
here,all of the time requirements have been satisfied and no dispute exists about legal custody of the child.the sole issue before us is whether the petitioner mother was legally separated from her husband at the time of her naturalization.
in jordon,we held that derivative citizenship had not been established because the legal separation in that case,a new york divorce,occurred after the naturalization proceeding.jordon,at.jordon specifically declined to decide the meaning of legal separation.id.at.
although this court has not yet expressed its views on the meaning of legal separation,we considered the related concept of legal custody in bagot.there,the panel concluded that in the absence of a judicial decree awarding custody,longstanding bia precedent defining legal custody as actual uncontested custody would apply.bagot,at.
bagot,however,clearly stated that legal separation was distinguishable from legal custody in the derivative citizenship context.see id.at.judge becker opinion observed that there is no inconsistency in requiring a court order for legal separation while allowing legal custody to be based on the consent of the parties or an undisputed physical custody.id.judge rosenn concurring opinion,joined by judge nygaard,agreed the opinion of the court also rejects the r espondent argument that legal custody like legal separation,requires a court decree.i fully agree with both propositions.id.at internal citations omitted.
courts of appeals have held that a,as part of the ina,is subject to the constitutional requirement of a uniform rule of naturalization provided for in article i,section of the constitution.see,brissett ashcroft,cir nehme ins,cir.
the statute,however,does not contain a definition of the term legal separation.that lacuna has led the courts to inquire to what degree state laws may provide the rule of
