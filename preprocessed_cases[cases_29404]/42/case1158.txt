before congress passed the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,legal resident aliens facing deportation for the commission of crimes were entitled to section c hearings,named for the section of the immigration and naturalization act authorizing them.at a section c hearing,deportees could win a discretionary waiver of deportation by arguing the equities weighed in favor of their remaining in the united states.section d of aedpa eliminated section c hearings for certain criminal aliens when it went into effect on april.congress simply chose not to afford those affected aliens any outlet to escape deportation.gyno domond came to the united states in from haiti with his parents and obtained legal resident alien status in.domond committed the offense of robbery in november,but connecticut state court did not convict him of the crime until he pleaded guilty on november,to robbery.the immigration and naturalization service ins subsequently issued an order to show cause,charging domond with being deportable because of his felony conviction.an immigration judge found domond deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,robbery in the second degree.domond request for a section c hearing was denied by an immigration judge,and the board of immigration appeals denied his subsequent appeal because domond guilty plea came after aedpa effective date,even though his criminal conduct predated aedpa enactment.domond filed a habeas corpus petition,pursuant to,which the united states district court for the district of connecticut granted.the district court held that the laws in effect at the time of domond criminal conduct,that is,the laws in effect before aedpa,should govern his deportation proceedings.see dunbar immigration naturalization,d.this appeal from the ins followed.for the reasons given below,we reverse.
background 
for most of the past century,lawful permanent resident aliens convicted of certain crimes were deemed deportable,but they were able to apply for some form of discretionary relief from deportation.see cyr immigration naturalization,cir citing francis immigration naturalization,cir cert.granted,d prior to the enactment of aedpa in,discretionary relief was available via a waiver of deportation,which allowed the attorney general to waive the grounds for deportation under certain conditions in the case of a lawfully admitted permanent resident in deportation proceedings.cyr,at see also immigration and nationality act c,c repealed.aliens were eligible to apply for these section c waivers once they accrued seven years of lawful,permanent residence in the united states.see c repealed.so long as aliens met the residence requirements and were not convicted of an aggravated felony,as defined in the statute,the attorney general could chose to exercise her discretion to waive deportation.id.
congress decided to change the immigration statutory scheme by passing aedpa,in part to increase the number of criminal aliens deported.see,conf,at,reprinted in.at issue here is aedpa d,which eliminated section c hearings for aliens convicted of certain crimes.see aedpa d pub,stat.et supp.iv.subsequently,in september,congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,pub,stat.et.iirira repealed section c altogether and replaced it with a different form of discretionary relief from deportation,known as cancellation of removal.see iirira b,stat.at codified at west.
caught in this web of statutory transition is domond.as noted previously,immigration officials denied domond discretionary relief from deportation because his conviction took place after aedpa enactment.domond filed his habeas corpus petition in federal court,which the court heard in tandem with two similar habeas petitions.domond argued that section d should not apply to aliens whose criminal conduct occurred prior to aedpa effective date of april.applying the retroactivity analysis set forth in landgraf usi film,d,the district court held petitioners should have their deportation proceedings governed by the laws that were in effect at the time they committed their crimes and granted the writ.dunbar,d at.the ins appealed,and we review these matters of law de novo.see united states figueroa,cir.
discussion 
effect of cyr 
shortly before oral argument in the matter before us,this court issued its opinion in,which held that aedpa bar to a section c hearing does not apply to aliens who pleaded guilty or nolo contendere prior to iirira and aedpa effective dates.see,at.as a preliminary matter,we noted in cyr 
i t is difficult to argue that barring eligibility for discretionary relief on the basis of criminal opposed to a plea going to the guilt of a deportable an impermissible retroactive application of a statute.indeed,we agree that,
it would border on the absurd to argue that these aliens might have decided not to commit drug crimes,or might have resisted conviction more vigorously,had they known that if they were not only imprisoned but also,when their prison term ended,ordered deported,they could not ask for a discretionary waiver of deportation.
id.at citations omitted.although cyr involved a different factual situation than the one before us,we reach the same result as the cyr panel.we write to expand the analysis.
retroactivity 
we turn now to the issue of whether elimination of section c hearings for those whose criminal conduct predates aedpa effective date but whose convictions it is impermissively retroactive the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.landgraf,at.elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.id.at.unless congress clearly expresses its intent to the contrary,we presume that a law has no retroactive application to conduct predating it.see hughes aircraft united states,d.retroactivity analysis requires two steps.first we ask whether congress expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.martin hadix,d citation omitted.if not,we proceed to the second step and determine whether applying the law to conduct would have a retroactive effect.see id.if so,then in keeping with our traditional presumption against retroactivity,we presume that the statute does not apply to that conduct.id.citation omitted.
the district court below extended our holding and discussion of retroactivity principles in henderson immigration naturalization,cir,to the instant case.at issue in henderson was the retroactive application of section d to those aliens whose deportation cases began before aedpa enactment.see henderson,at.we held section d posed no bar to section c hearings when the deportation proceedings began before aedpa enactment.see id.at.as the district court recognized,we expressly declined in henderson to reach the issue we face today whether section d applies to criminal conduct.see id.at.the district court then extended our holding in henderson,and held that congress knew how to make section d explicitly apply retroactively but did not do so.see dunbar,d at.the district court then inferred that congress did not intend to apply the section retroactively,as we did in henderson.see see also henderson,at.
we hold that the district court extension of henderson was erroneous because domond case raises a different issue than the one in henderson.here,the question is whether the lack of discretionary relief applies to aliens whose criminal conduct enactment of aedpa.as this and other circuits have concluded,w hen the past conduct under the landgraf analysis changes from the commencement of removal proceedings to the conviction or criminal conduct congress intent whether to apply section d retrospectively is ambiguous.cyr,at see also pasquarell,cir desousa reno,cir greene,cir.because different provisions in aedpa allow one to draw a negative implication in favor of and against applying aedpa d retroactively,the statute is ambiguous,at.
having found the statute ambiguous,we next determine if the statute has a retroactive effect.see landgraf,at.statutes
