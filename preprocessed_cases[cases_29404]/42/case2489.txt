vissinto kouassi ayi applied for asylum,contending that he had been persecuted in togo for his extensive political activities on behalf of the opposition movement.ayi is a native of togo and was an active member of both the togolese league for human rights and the union des forces du changement.both of these organizations are established political and human rights groups opposed to the ruling government.after ayi had endured two incidents of extended captivity and torture,he learned that a summons had been issued for his arrest.because he feared for his life,he arranged for his family to go into hiding and he fled the country with the help of his cousin.he entered the united states legally on december.ayi applied for asylum on november.because the immigration judge adverse credibility finding is speculative and not based on substantial evidence,we grant ayi petition for review.
background 
ayi was born in togo and is a member of the mina ethnic tribe.he was an engineer,a businessman,and a member of academia.from early through the fall of,ayi worked on various political activities in opposition to the dictatorial regime of president gnassingbe eyadema.ayi wrote articles that were published in opposition newspapers and he joined the togolese league for human rights ltdh,a human rights group.ayi also traveled throughout togo to educate others about democracy and human rights.
as a result of his political activities,ayi was arrested by togolese security forces on september.he was detained for days and during this detention,he was interrogated,beaten,deprived of food,subjected to electrical shocks,and was forced to kneel on broken palm nuts which,ayi explained,is like kneeling on broken glass in the hot sun for hours,which caused an infection in his knees and resulted in permanent scarring.although ayi was eventually released,he was warned by his captors not to report his detention to the press.he was hospitalized for five days after the detention due to the injuries he sustained while in captivity.
after such a traumatic experience,ayi was not openly political again until.in,he joined the union des forces du changement ufc,which was also an opposition organization that raised awareness and educated people about democracy in togo.ayi became active and went campaigning on behalf of the ufc presidential candidate.on march,ayi was again arrested and detained.togolese security forces shoved ayi in a car at gunpoint and took him to an undisclosed location for two days.during his detention,ayi was interrogated about his ufc activities,deprived of food and water,and forced into a cesspool of mud and dead animals.when ayi tried to escape,guards stomped on his hands,causing permanent scarring.he was also forced to bathe in a red liquid that burned his skin and eyes.the guards threatened to kill him repeatedly before his release and warned that he would be harmed if he reported any part of the incident to the press.
ayi continued his political activities using different means at the center for technological and professional training cnpp by encouraging and recruiting to join an independent union,the confederation of syndicole travailers du togo,rather than the government controlled union.he also wrote articles in opposition to eyadema regime.specifically,ayi authored two articles,both published in,one in le parole,and a second in le combat du people.in,the director of the cnpp and the nephew of president eyadema,kadaring,confronted ayi about his work for opposition political parties.ayi had appeared on television denouncing someone and the next day he drafted an article that he submitted to be printed.somehow,kadaring received the handwritten article and confronted ayi about it,asking whose handwriting it was on the article.kadaring told ayi that the handwritten article made it clear to him that ayi had written the articles about eyadema and his family.ayi of course denied the charges.on may,colonel takougnadi,the general manager of the police and kadaring cousin,called ayi and said that it appeared ayi had not learned anything from his previous detentions.colonel takougnadi told ayi to stop making problems.
in november,vandals broke into ayi office at cnpp on two separate occasions.on november,his car was vandalized and set on fire.after the second breakin,ayi cousin,asheni,told him that a summons had been issued for ayi arrest.ayi sought to leave the country because he feared for his life.with the assistance of asheni,who was the commander of togo airport security,ayi was able to avoid security problems at the airport and fly to the united states on december.ayi wife continued to receive serious threats.given the nature of these threats,ayi arranged for his wife to go into hiding with their children near the benin border.two days after they had gone,the ayis home was searched and many of their personal possessions were confiscated.
ayi believes that if he were to return to togo,he would be automatically arrested and imprisoned for his opposition to eyadema and his family.since ayi left,eyadema son,faure gnassingb√©,has taken over as president of togo.ayi family tells him that he is still in danger and that government forces have been looking for him.ayi brother,virgil kouassi ayi,went to benin to visit vissinto ayi wife and children.virgil was arrested at the border control because the officers though that he was vissinto kouassi ayi.virgil was held for hours before the border control finally believed that he was vissinto brother.
ayi filed for asylum on november,which is within the statutory deadline required by a b.following an agency interview,immigration and naturalization service ins rejected ayi asylum application.the ins then referred ayi application to an immigration court,together with a notice to appear that charged ayi with unlawfully remaining in the united states after his visa had expired.ayi opposed his removal under the previously filed asylum application and sought withholding of removal,relief under the convention against torture,and alternatively,voluntary departure.he appeared before the ij for a merits hearing on his asylum application on march.the merits hearing was continued until september,and ayi again attempted to present testimony and documents in support of his case.on november,the ij issued a written ruling denying all requested relief.the ij concluded that ayi was not credible because there were inconsistencies about ayi political involvement that the ij believed undermined his claim.ayi appealed the ij decision and the board of immigration appeals adopted and affirmed the ij ruling on july.this appeal timely followed.
ii.analysis 
we focus on the ij credibility finding since the remaining issues on appeal depend on this adverse ruling.when the bia does not issue an opinion,but rather,as it does here,summarily affirms and adopts the ij opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency determination.georgis ashcroft,cir.since ayi filed his asylum application prior to passage of the real id act,stat,that statute does not affect the credibility analysis in this case.diallo gonzales,cir.we will affirm an adverse credibility determination only where it is supported by specific cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.uwase ashcroft,cir.while we give great deference to the ij credibility determination,adverse credibility determinations should not be grounded in trivial details or easily explained discrepancies because such bases lack a legitimate nexus to the finding.korniejew ashcroft,cir citation omitted.
the ij concluded that ayi testimony was unconvincing as to his detention.ayi explained that he was targeted in for writing an article critical of president eyadema and for his political activities.the ij was critical of ayi testimony and wanted ayi to provide a clear and convincing explanation for how his persecutors knew he authored articles critical of president eyadema government.yet,our precedent understands that ayi is not capable,nor is expected,to testify to the knowledge of other persons,particularly when called to testify about the knowledge of his oppressors.gontcharova ashcroft,cir denial of asylum overturned where decision was partly based on absence of documents not reasonably available to petitioner and described as corroboration from the persecutor.for an ij to deny an asylum claim for lack of corroboration and demand such evidence from the applicant,the ij must first make an express credibility finding.diallo,at citation omitted.the ij must also explain why it is reasonable to expect corroboration and explain why the applicant reason for not supplying corroboration is inadequate.see also gontcharova,at.
the ij improperly expected ayi to explain how his persecutors knew he was the one who had written the article critical of eyadema government.his persecutors may or may not have known that ayi was the ghostwriter of the opposition articles,but their targeting of him may have been the result of his education and outreach efforts on behalf of the ltdh.ayi testified that he was persecuted in for political activities that included traveling throughout togo to educate others about democracy and human rights,which singled him out as an opposition political activist.despite the fact that ayi offered thorough and consistent testimony that in june he had written an article opposing the government,and that he was unable to provide a copy of the article because the police seized all of the opposition papers and the publisher is no longer in business,the ij questioned the veracity of ayi testimony.ayi,however,provided corroborating evidence in the form of a letter from lucien messan,the director of the publication itself.for reasons unclear to us,the ij discredited the letter from messan,where he stated that ayi wrote opposition articles for his publication.messan letter also gave the pen name that ayi used,rodrigue,which corresponds with the author of the articles that ayi submitted in his application.without basis in law,the ij determined that messan letter should have provided the exact dates and titles of ayi articles in order to establish that ayi had written them.ayi also offered the affidavit of marcel adjalla,the former executive secretary of the ltdh,which stated that ayi wrote for various independent newspapers and that he was an active member of the ltdh.given the seizure of the articles and the subsequent closing of the publication,ayi testimony and explanations are not incredible and,actually,appear to be the types of easily explained discrepancies that should not be the basis for an ij adverse credibility finding.korniejew,at.
the ij next doubted ayi belief that he would be persecuted if he was forced to return to togo.noting that ayi took a business trip to the united states in,the ij questioned why ayi did not apply for asylum then if he suffered such terrible persecution in.ayi uncontroverted testimony is that his detention and the torture he endured during it scared him to the point that he stopped his political activities for five years.when ayi was asked why he did not apply for asylum when he was in the united states in,ayi explained that at the time of his business trip he did not feel openly harassed.the ij disregarded,without explanation,the fact that ayi had ceased his political activities after his detention in.discrediting ayi testimony for speculative reasons,the ij concluded that if ayi torture was as terrible as he claimed,he would have applied for asylum in regardless of how much time had passed since ayi was openly political and targeted.
what the ij fails to understand is that ayi hiatus from political thus from not diminish his credibility.avoiding persecution for even an extended period of time is not relevant to a credibility determination.hor gonzales,cir vacating credibility determination based on ij own suspicion regarding length of time between dangerous encounters with persecutors.see also dong gonzales,cir it is not relevant to applicant credibility that she avoided persecution during the four years she remained in china.
moreover,the ij failed to mention the fact that ayi second detention came after the business trip to the united states.ayi became politically active again in and was detained and tortured on march.the second detention subjected ayi to horrific torture.significantly,ayi was submerged in a cesspool of mud and dead animals and when he tried to escape,the guards stomped on his hands,which caused permanent scarring.he ultimately fled togo when he was notified that a summons had been issued for his arrest in november of.the ij needed to view ayi entire history of political activity as a seamless story,not as finite periods of time that were mutually exclusive of each other.as the board of immigration appeals has explained,t estimony is not a discrete,unit of evidence examined and weighed without context it is a part of the body of evidence which is intertwined and considered in its totality.lin gonzales,cir quoting in re,i n,bia.
the ij also discredited ayi testimony about his employment at a educational institution.he concluded that ayi had not produced evidence proving that university officials were responsible for breaking into his office on several occasions and eventually vandalizing and setting fire to his car.the ij also held that ayi had not produced evidence proving that university officials were aware of his political activities,including whether the officials knew he had written articles in opposition newspapers.he also wondered how ayi was able to keep his job if his employers were really targeting him for his political activities.
the ij findings regarding ayi job amount to conjecture and speculation rather than conclusions that are grounded in the record.the ij conclusions about ayi employer illustrate this point.ayi offered consistent and detailed testimony regarding his political activities at work,and the threats he received from the director of the cnpp as well as others in the government.
specifically,ayi testified that he was confronted and threatened about his political activities by kadaring,the cnpp director and nephew of president eyadema.kadaring asked ayi if he had written the opposition articles and ayi denied authoring them because he feared for his safety.in addition,colonel takougnadi,the general manager of the police and kadaring cousin,called ayi and told him that it seemed that ayi had not learned anything from his previous detentions.despite this testimony,the ij questioned how ayi employers knew that he was involved in the opposition,stating that,t here is no evidence to suggest that the director suspected that the respondent wrote the articles against eyadema because the respondent denied writing them to the director.this statement is breathtaking in its contradiction with the record.given the threats that ayi received from the director and the general manager of the police about authoring opposition articles and political activity,it is considerably clear that ayi was suspected as a political activist and writer.additionally,the ij claimed that if ayi superiors truly wanted to punish him,surely he would have been fired.yet,ayi explained that the cnpp could not run the school without him because he had specialized training and education.the ij dismissed this explanation,stating that ayi testimony is undermined by the fact that after ayi fled togo,he was replaced by someone that the cnpp had sent to be trained in germany to gain the same set of skills as ayi.while ayi was replaced,we fail to see how the ij disregarded the fact that in order to replace ayi,the cnpp needed to send someone to germany for specialized training.this fact in the record demonstrates that ayi skill was hard to come by.essentially,it seems that the ij credibility assessments are the kind we can not uphold because they are unmoored from the record,and are based on nothing but the ij personal speculation or conjecture.tabaku gonzales,cir.
in his findings,the ij also discredited ayi testimony as to how he fled togo.the ij wondered how ayi was able to leave togo unimpeded if there was a summons for his arrest.the ij placed significant weight on a letter ayi had received from his cousin,asheni,warning him to leave immediately but asking ayi not to contact him.during his test
