defendant blanca jimenez,a citizen of mexico,pleaded guilty to the charge of illegally the united states after having previously been deported following an aggravated felony conviction.the district court sentenced her at the low end of the advisory sentencing guidelines range to a prison term of months.defendant contends on appeal that the district court miscalculated the guidelines range by relying on findings that were not supported by sufficient evidence.she also contends the sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court relied on an impermissible purpose in imposing the prison,to promote rehabilitation.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of sentence.
background 
on july,defendant blanca jimenez pleaded guilty to having illegally reentered the united states after having been removed following a conviction for an aggravated felony.a and b.during the plea hearing,defendant counsel explained that defendant had,at some unknown time,been struck by a car as a pedestrian and had suffered head injuries that resulted in memory difficulties.counsel also explained that defendant had been the victim of a brutal rape six months earlier in nashville.further,although jimenez had complained about the adequacy of medical care she had received at the local jail,her attorney represented that she wished to and was competent to proceed with the plea hearing.the district court made inquiry of jimenez and assured itself that she was competent to proceed and knowingly and voluntarily waived her right to trial.
in establishing the factual basis for the plea,immigration and customs enforcement ice special agent jeremy ridenour,under oath,explained that defendant came to the attention of authorities in davidson county,tennessee after she was arrested for public intoxication that she had been removed to mexico,her native country,on april,that in,she had been convicted in arizona of forgery and assisting a criminal syndicate,each considered an aggravated felony and that ice records were devoid of evidence that defendant had applied for or received permission to the united states.defendant confirmed the accuracy of ridenour statement.the district court reserved acceptance of the plea pending sentencing.
the sentencing proceeded on november.the district court first addressed defendant objection to the proposed finding that jimenez had the united states by december,as evidenced by the fact that she was arrested on that date in salinas,california and charged with assaulting her boyfriend with a ceramic statue.defendant did not directly challenge the notion that she had by december,but argued the government failed to prove she remained continuously in the united states after that date.defendant proposed that she might have left the united states again since december and illegally as recently as august.if so,then she would not be subject to assessment of an additional criminal history point pursuant to e for a prior sentence imposed within ten years of the commencement of the instant illegal offense,sentence imposed in maricopa county,arizona on may,for solicitation to commit forgery.the district court overruled defendant objection,observing that the psr showed jimenez had had numerous interim brushes with law january,september,july,march,may,october,and february had neither challenged this showing nor presented any support for a finding that she had left again and more recently than december.the district court concluded that the preponderance of the evidence weighed in favor of finding that jimenez came back in december and never left again.
next,the district court considered defendant objection to the sufficiency of the government proof of two other convictions for which the psr recommended assessment of two additional criminal history points.the convictions,in salinas,california,were for petty theft guilty plea,march,and for inflicting corporal injury on her boyfriend nolo contendere plea,april.because monterey county superior court records regarding these convictions had been purged pursuant to california law,the government substantiated the convictions with certified copies of disposition records from the california department of justice,plus fingerprint verification by the fbi through the criminal justice information system.defendant argued these records were insufficient to satisfy the requirements set forth in shepard united states,because they did not include the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,or some comparable judicial record of this information.id.at.again,the district court overruled the objection,holding that the admitted exhibits were sufficiently reliable,being unrefuted,to confirm the accuracy of the psr information.
the district court went on to formally accept defendant guilty plea.the court also accepted the contents of the psr as its findings of fact and conclusions of law,over defendant objections.accordingly,in its calculation of the governing advisory guidelines range,the court concluded that defendant had a total offense level of and a criminal history category of v,producing a sentencing range of to months.
defendant jimenez did not exercise her right to allocution,preferring to allow her attorney to speak for her.counsel began her remarks by acknowledging that her client criminal history,viewed in the abstract,could justify the month sentencing range.however,she characterized jimenez as a unique individual with a personal history distinguishing her as a victim a victim of memory loss,of criminal assault,of continuing untreated physical ailments,of flawed immigration policy,of homelessness such that a prison sentence represented unnecessary overkill.counsel requested a sentence of time served,nine months plus immediate removal to mexico.if a prison term were imposed,counsel asked that jimenez be recommended for placement in a bureau of prisons medical facility where her medical needs could be addressed.the assistant attorney responded by acknowledging that defendant medical care needs represented a valid sentencing consideration,but reminded the court that defendant illegal conduct warranted punishment and requested a sentence of months imprisonment.
in pronouncing sentence,the district court began by summarizing the sad profile of defendant life.in light of this background,the court viewed the recommended prison sentence not as a lengthy sentence,but as the compassionate thing to do.the court found no compelling reason to depart or vary from the advisory guidelines range and found that a prison term would meet the purposes of sentencing prescribed at a,reflecting the seriousness of the offense,promoting respect for law,representing just punishment,and protecting the public from other crimes.moreover,the court observed that this period of incarceration would provide jimenez with the medical and mental health treatment she so desperately needed.id.at.the sentence included credit for time served.
on appeal,defendant asserts three claims of error.first,she contends the district court miscalculated the applicable guidelines range by adding criminal history points based on inadmissible proof of her convictions for petty theft and spousal battery.second,she challenges the district court finding that she the united states in and stayed here continuously thereafter as not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.third,defendant contends the sentence is substantively unreasonable because longer than necessary and because it was motivated by the improper purpose of rehabilitating her health,contrary to a.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court sentencing is reviewed for both procedural and substantive reasonableness under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.gall united states.a district court will be deemed to have abused its discretion if it committed significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.id.at.the standard for evaluating whether a sentence is substantively unreasonable is summarized in gall as follows 
when conducting this review,the court will,of course,take into account the totality of the circumstances,including the extent of any variance from the guidelines range.if the sentence is within the guidelines range,the appellate court may,but is not required to,apply a presumption of reasonableness.rita united states.but if the sentence is outside the guidelines range,the court may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness.it may consider the extent of the deviation,but must give due deference to the district court decision that the a factors,on a whole,justify the extent of the variance.the fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.
gall,at.in the sixth circuit,a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness applies to sentences within the properly calculated guidelines range.united states vonner,cir.
proof of prior convictions 
defendant contends the district court committed procedural error by improperly calculating the guidelines range.specifically,defendant argues the court improperly relied on inadmissible evidence of prior convictions in assessing criminal history points.in reviewing the lower court calculation of the guidelines range,factual findings are reviewed for clear error and legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.united states brattain,cir.defendant argument that the district court improperly relied on inadmissible evidence arguably poses a pure legal question that warrants de novo review.see united states carter,applying de novo review while refraining from deciding whether a more deferential standard could be applicable.
the federal rules of evidence do not apply in sentencing proceedings.d united states hamad,cir.the bounds of admissibility in sentencing proceedings are defined by due process.see stewart erwin,cir.due process in this context prohibits the sentencing court from relying on materially false or unreliable information and requires that the defendant be afforded the opportunity to rebut adverse information demonstrably relied on by the sentencing court.id.
defendant does not contend the evidence of the two prior convictions here relied on by the district court is materially false.she made no effort in the district court to rebut the correctness of the certified records from the california department of justice substantiating the petty theft and spousal battery convictions.she does not argue that she was denied the opportunity to rebut the her attorney argued that jimenez simply had no recollection of much of her criminal history.nor has defendant argued on appeal that the information is materially false.instead,her sole challenge was and is that,irrespective of the facial validity of the records relied on,they should be held unreliable because they fail to meet the requirements set forth in shepard united states.
in shepard,the court stated its holding as follows 
we hold that enquiry under the acca armed career criminal act to determine whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document,the terms of the plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,or to some comparable judicial record of the information.
id.at.defendant thus argues that because the government in this case did not present the actual charging documents or plea agreements or plea hearing transcripts to substantiate the specifics of the convictions,the evidence presented was necessarily unreliable and insufficient to support enhancement of her criminal history level.
defendant also cites united states,cir,where the court,following shepard,rejected the government use of a preliminary examination transcript to establish the nature of a prior conviction.the court held that the transcript,even assuming it might otherwise be deemed reliable,was insufficient because it did not reveal whether the defendant necessarily admitted the facts necessary to support a finding that his prior conviction was for a qualifying drug trafficking offense,warranting a criminal history enhancement under b a.similarly,here,defendant contends,the certified records introduced by the government fail to identify the conduct she necessarily admitted when she was convicted of petty theft and spousal battery,the convictions used to enhance her criminal history level.
in response,the government correctly contends that shepard and are inapposite.the criminal history enhancements applied by the district court based on the convictions were made pursuant to c,based on the two prior sentences.as such,the nature of the prior convictions is of little consequence,as long as the sentences imposed for the convictions represent qualifying prior sentences,which they undisputedly do.see,cmt.and.in other words,the information furnished by the california department of justice was provided by the government and accepted by the district court to establish the fact of the prior convictions and the resulting sentences imposed,not to establish the nature of the convictions or the specific offense conduct.
this distinction is recognized in a uniform and growing body of case law.in united states sanders,cir,the court held that shepard does not govern the distinct,antecedent inquiry whether the government has furnished sufficient evidence to prove merely that a conviction exists.see also united states caswell,cir shepard prohibitions held not to come into play where the district court relied only on fact of prior convictions and made no findings regarding the circumstances of the convictions united states carter,collecting cases and explaining that the shepard requirements relate only to proof of the facts underlying a conviction and do not apply in evaluating the sufficiency of the government proof of the existence of a prior conviction.
it follows that the requirements enforced in shepard and do not apply to the instant criminal history enhancement based on the convictions.in evaluating the sufficiency of the government proofs,the district court was constrained only by the requirements of due process.the court was prohibited from relying on materially false or unreliable information and was obliged to give defendant the opportunity to rebut the information.defendant has not challenged the sufficiency of the government proofs on any of these grounds.she has not argued that the information furnished by the california department of justice was materially false.she has not offered any reason to find the information otherwise unreliable.nor does she contend that she was denied fair opportunity to rebut the information.
the california department of justice records introduced by the government are certified by the custodian of the records and accompanied by fbi fingerprint verification that the records pertain to defendant jimenez.in short,the exhibits relied on by the district court bear adequate indicia of reliability.the district court was entitled to rely on them in evaluating the appropriateness of the recommended criminal history point assessments.further,the district court findings that the convictions involved qualifying prior sentences under c are supported by a preponderance of the evidence.we therefore reject this claim of procedural error.
proof of and continuous stay 
next,defendant contends the district court finding that she the united states in december and remained here continuously thereafter is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.defendant does not contest the finding that she had reentered by december,but contends the government failed to show that she remained here continuously until her eventual arrest for public intoxication in march,when ice officials learned of her presence.defendant cont
