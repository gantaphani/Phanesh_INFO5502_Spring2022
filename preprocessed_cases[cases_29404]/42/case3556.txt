petitioner su hwa she petitioner or she seeks review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge ij denial of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.upon due consideration,we grant the petition for review in part,deny it in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
su hwa she was born in burma where she and other members of her family were allegedly persecuted by ethnic burmese officials from the until,when she traveled to hong kong.she entered taiwan shortly thereafter,at the age of.she stayed with a family friend there and her name was put on a household register that was used to help her obtain a taiwanese passport.br.at.she remained in taiwan for some eighteen months,ultimately gaining recognition as a citizen of the republic of china,taiwan.on may,she entered the united states on a visitor visa with a expiration date.she overstayed her visa and,several years after entering the united states,filed an asylum petition in los angeles.she also applied for withholding of removal to burma and relief under cat id.her asylum petition was referred to the immigration court in after an asylum officer opined that she treatment in burma did not amount to persecution and that she had firmly resettled in a third country before entering the united states.the record indicates that she repeatedly renewed her taiwanese passport for over twenty years,but remained in the united states since her entry,never returning to taiwan or burma.
the immigration court designated burma,taiwan,and the people republic of china for purposes of removal.the ij thereafter heard argument along with she testimony,including testimony about her time in taiwan.the ij decision notes that 
in taiwan she lived with family friends or people who put her on their family list.and by being placed on their family list,or what is commonly known as the household registration,she was able to get a passport.the respondent testified that she was not related to the people who befriended her by blood or in any manner.but it seems to reason if the respondent would pretend to be a member of that family it quite likely she might embellish other facts as well.
nonetheless,the ij continued the court in this case makes no comment on her credibility as yet.but suffice it to say that the respondent claim of asylum as to burma is moot and she can return to taiwan as she was a citizen of taiwan.the ij therefore pretermitted her applications,noting that she has a country to which she can return,and all that is necessary is that dhs establish that there is a country that she could reside in.id.notwithstanding the fact that the ij decision does not mention the term firm resettlement,the bia affirmed the immigration court decision without argument,stating we agree with the immigration judge that the respondent is ineligible for asylum because she was firmly resettled in taiwan prior to entering the united states if taiwan refuses to provide valid travel documents allowing she to return there,she may seek reopening to assert claims as against return to burma.

asylum may not be granted to an alien who the attorney general determines to have firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the united states.b a vi c i b.an alien is considered to be firmly resettled if,prior to arriving in the united states,she entered another country with,or while in that country received,an offer of permanent resident status,citizenship,or some other type of permanent resettlement.the definition of firm resettlement does not encompass an alien who can demonstrate that his or her entry into that country was a necessary consequence of his or her flight from persecution,that he or she remained in that country only as long as was necessary to arrange onward travel,and that he or she did not establish significant ties in that country.id.at a.so far as we are aware,based on the parties briefs,department of homeland security dhs regulations do not define significant ties or otherwise elaborate on the interpretation of this exception.dhs bears the initial burden of showing that the government of the third country issued to the alien a formal offer of some type of official status permitting the alien to reside in that country indefinitely.maharaj,cir see also ali ashcroft,cir.if the government establishes firm resettlement,the burden shifts to the alien to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the nature of his stay and ties was too tenuous for her to be firmly resettled.maharaj,at,cheo ins,cir a duration of residence in a third country sufficient to support an inference of permanent resettlement in the absence of evidence to the contrary shifts the burden of proving absence of firm resettlement to the applicant.see also c ii mussie ins,cir.firm resettlement does not preclude eligibility for withholding of removal.siong ins,cir.
she first argues that the bia and ij improperly concluded that she had firmly resettled in taiwan because she fraudulently obtained her taiwanese passport and household registration.she points to ali for the proposition that a person unlawfully in a third country can not be found to be firmly resettled there.at.but she miscasts ali,wherein the petitioner testified that she never received an offer of permanent residence.id.at.in ali,a panel of this court explained that the fact that petitioner ali fortuitously evaded detection by the government while living illegally in ethiopia does not allow for a finding that ali was firmly resettled in ethiopia absent some government dispensation,an immigrant who surreptitiously enters a nation without its authorization can not obtain official resident status id.at emphasis added citation and internal quotation marks omitted.here,there has been some government dispensation she recognition as a national of taiwan.she argument that her status in taiwan should be disregarded because it was fraudulently obtained is hence unfounded.she also argues that the bia erred on the taiwan resettlement question by ignoring her testimony before the immigration court,although that testimony must be accepted as true.more specifically,petitioner argues that she satisfied the burden of establishing that she falls under an exception to firm resettlement definition.in support of this argument,petitioner cites her testimony that her entry into taiwan was a necessary consequence of her flight from persecution,she remained there only long enough to obtain a passport and arrange onward travel,and she did not establish significant ties in taiwan.
for its part,the government emphasizes that she remained in taiwan longer than the one year necessary to obtain a passport and arrange onward travel,pointing out that by staying an additional six months,she was able to obtain status as a taiwanese national.duration of residence is undoubtedly an important consideration in the firm resettlement analysis,cheo,at,but it must be weighed against petitioner testimony that she remained just long enough to arrange travel to the un
