teresita ching and her husband,brooke joseph,claim that their procedural due process rights and their rights under the administrative procedure act apa were violated during the adjudication of joseph i visa petition for an immediate relative.under the circumstances of this case,we conclude that their rights under the apa were not violated,but their procedural due process rights were.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
teresita ching,a native of china and citizen of the philippines,lawfully entered the united states on november,as a nonimmigrant visitor.ching claims that she came to the united states intending to stay for one month,but then began dating elden fong,a citizen,whom she met on a dating website.ching and fong married on january,and fong filed an i visa petition on her behalf.eventually,ching withdrew the i application for permanent residence and informed uscis that she no longer wished to proceed as a beneficiary of fong petition because she planned to divorce fong,and uscis denied the petition for abandonment.a year later,on december,fong and ching divorced.
on january,ching married her current husband,brooke joseph,also a citizen,and joseph filed an i petition on ching behalf.after their interview at a uscis office,uscis issued a notice of intent to deny,which provided in relevant part 
uscis officers conducted a site visit at fong place of residence,and he was interviewed in regards to his marriage to ching.during that interview,fong confessed and provided a sworn statement admitting the following my name is elden fong and teresita ching were married in oakland on january,in oakland,ca.teresita and i never had sex.teresita and i never lived together.was offered and was paid in cash installments.teresita and i did not marry for love.i regret in full marrying teresita.
the six sentences quoted above compose the entirety of fong statement.ching was not informed of the circumstances under which fong was visited or his statement was taken.
joseph and ching responded to fong very terse statement in the notice of intent to deny with a,paragraph sworn declaration from ching describing in excruciating detail her intimate relationship with fong.refuting fong assertion that the couple never consummated the marriage,ching stated that they had sex for the first time on their wedding night.she then proceeded to describe in vivid detail how the two would sleep in on weekends,have sex,and share intimate conversations.she described his underwear and recounted some of their pillow talk.she also went on to explain why the marriage deteriorated and eventually ended in divorce.in addition,to corroborate her claim of a bona fide marriage,she furnished photographs of the couple,joint utility bills,an apartment lease,and a letter fong had previously written to uscis stating that he and ching truly loved each other.
on november,uscis denied joseph i,stating that the beneficiary first marriage was not entered into in good faith,but was a sham,entered into for the sole purpose of evading immigration laws.though it reviewed the evidence joseph had submitted,uscis found the evidence submitted by joseph to be self serving.
joseph appealed to the bia,which agree d that the record supports a finding that the beneficiary prior marriage was entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.the bia explained that we have considered the arguments and evidence presented by the petitioner both in response to the notice of intent to deny and on appeal,and we must agree that these do not overcome the detailed affidavit of the beneficiary prior spouse,which was given against his own interest.
on august,joseph and ching filed their complaint in district court,claiming that uscis acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the apa and the due process clause of the constitution by denying joseph i petition without affording them the opportunity to fong regarding his statement.both parties filed motions for summary judgment,and the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs.
the district court held that there is no statutory right to an adjudicatory hearing,that the opportunity to respond in writing to fong statement was sufficient for due process,and that there was no protected liberty or property interest in the adjudication of joseph i petition.finally,the district court held that e ven if plaintiffs had demonstrated that they have a protected property or liberty in an i visa petition which they have not they have failed to show prejudice.
the district court correctly held that there is no statutory right of in i visa adjudications.joseph and ching claim that citizenship and immigration services uscis acted arbitrarily and capriciously and violated section b of the immigration and nationality act ina,b,in denying joseph i petition without affording joseph and ching an opportunity to fong regarding his sworn statement.joseph and ching rely on ina b,which provides that during removal proceedings,the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien,to present evidence on the alien own behalf,and to witnesses presented by the government b b.they argue that once a beneficiary of a visa petition is in removal proceedings,the i petitioner is statutorily entitled to the same due process rights as an alien in removal proceedings,and that it is arbitrary and capricious to deny those protections.
however,visa petitions are distinct from removal proceedings.see elbez,cir any determination regarding ins conduct during a visa petition proceeding is collateral to a deportation order.the statutory protections provided in removal proceedings do not apply to adjudications of i visa petitions.
to the extent that the plaintiffs claim that uscis violated ina b,which applies only to removal proceedings,the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider that claim because a petition for review with the court of appeals is the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal a.furthermore,because ching removal proceedings are currently pending,there is no agency action for this court to review.
the district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.
plaintiffs also argue that the denial of joseph i visa petition violated their fifth amendment due process rights because they were not afforded the opportunity to cross examine ching first husband,elden fong,or the uscis officer who took fong statement.we agree.
the due process clause of the fifth amendment provides that no person shall be deprived of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.a threshold requirement to a substantive or procedural due process claim is the plaintiff showing of a liberty or property interest protected by the constitution.of,city of phoenix,cir.plaintiffs contend that their interest in the i visa petition is such an interest because the approval of the petition is nondiscretionary.
to have a property interest in a benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.supreme court cases recognize that a benefit is not a protected entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion.town of castle rock gonzales,d.instead,a reasonable expectation of entitlement is determined largely by the language of the statute and the extent to which the entitlement is couched in mandatory terms,at internal quotation marks omitted.
where a petitioner of an immediate relative petition proves that his marriage meets the requirements for the approval of an i,he is entitled,as a matter of right,to the approval of his petition.section b of the ina provides that after an investigation of the facts in each case,the secretary of homeland security secretary shall,if he determines that the facts stated in the petition are true and that the alien in behalf of whom the petition is made is an immediate relative,approve the petition b emphases added.the decision of whether to approve an i v
