rolando hernandez,a native and citizen of guatemala,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,denying his application for asylum,withholding of removal,protection under the convention against torture cat,and asylum on humanitarian grounds humanitarian asylum,as well as his request to administratively close or continue his case.we deny the petition in part,grant the petition in part,and remand for further proceedings.
rolando hernandez was born in quezaltenango,guatemala,on august.hernandez entered the united states without inspection on september,after fleeing guatemala to escape from the organization for people in arms orpa,which had forced him into its service.in may,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause against hernandez,alleging that he was deportable for having entered the united states without inspection under former section a b of the immigration nationality act ina,a b hernandez conceded deportability but applied for asylum under section of the ina,a,and withholding of deportation pursuant to former section h of the ina he contended that he was unable to return to guatemala where he faced persecution by orpa members because of his public opposition to orpa.
in june,hernandez had an individual merits hearing before immigration judge cuevas ij cuevas.hernandez testified through a translator.ij cuevas found that hernandez credibly established that he had been forcibly recruited into orpa by coercion and misrepresentations,that he had not supported the guerrillas,and that,as soon as he became aware of their goals,he informed the leaders of his disagreement with them and attempted to leave the group.ij cuevas concluded that hernandez was entitled to asylum because his credible testimony established a fear of persecution by leaders of orpa,who knew that he had deserted orpa after announcing his opposition to the group,and hernandez had established that it would be more likely than not that he would be persecuted if he returned to guatemala.ij cuevas then granted hernandez application for asylum and withholding of deportation.
the ins appealed.in october,the bia held that hernandez was statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of deportation pursuant to the persecutor bar,under which any person who has assisted or otherwise participated in persecution of any person on account of a protected ground is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.see a ineligible for asylum id.b b i ineligible for withholding of removal.therefore,the bia ordered hernandez deported as statutorily ineligible for relief from deportation.the bia did not overturn the credibility findings of ij cuevas and did not reach the issue of whether,absent the persecutor bar,hernandez was otherwise entitled to asylum.
hernandez petitioned this court for review,asserting that the bia applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that he had not met his burden of proving that the persecutor bar did not apply.this court agreed and vacated the bia order,remanding for its full consideration of the issue of eligibility for the type of relief requested by hernandez.hernandez reno,cir.
on remand,the bia held that hernandez was not ineligible for asylum under the persecutor bar.however,the bia observed,t hese events transpired years ago,in.it is not clear on the record whether the guerillas would still be interested in the respondent.further,in,the parties to the guatemalan civil war signed peace accords.app.therefore,the bia determined that in light of the passage of time and the changed circumstances in guatemala,the best course at this point is a remand to the immigration judge for a further hearing on the respondent application for asylum.id.
on remand from the bia,hernandez case was assigned to immigration judge dierkes ij dierkes.ij dierkes presided over hernandez preliminary hearing on october.at the hearing,hernandez objected to the substitution of ij dierkes and requested that ij cuevas order granting hernandez asylum be reinstated.although he did not use the term nunc pro tunc at the hearing hernandez characterizes this as a request for a grant of asylum nunc pro tunc.ij dierkes denied the request.
on november,hernandez filed a motion,requesting that ij cuevas handle the remand of his case.ij dierkes presided at the next preliminary hearing held on january,and stated that he had forwarded the motion to the office of the chief immigration judge in washington,following the hearing,ij dierkes issued an order denying the motion.the order stated 
judge cuevas was on detail when he heard this matter in.he no longer comes to minnesota on detail.this case was assigned to me when it was remanded from the bia.i have discussed the respondent motion with assistant chief immigration judge michael rahill,and he has advised me that judge cuevas will not be coming to minnesota for further details.accordingly,judge cuevas is considered unavailable within the meaning of cfr b.the case will remain on my docket.
as an alternative to his asylum application,hernandez filed an application for both suspension of deportation and cancellation of removal.on november,hernandez filed a motion for administrative closure and,in the alternative,a continuance for purposes of repapering the motion provides respondent once again respectfully restates his position that this court has independent authority,should it deny pretermit respondent and suspension applications,to postpone these proceedings for good cause while the proposed repapering rules are finalized.app.the motion references a june,telephone conversation between ij dierkes and dhs counsel id.at.the motion further states 
w ith respect to the asylum application,we continue to insist that this court has ample basis for granting it,including on an equitable nunc pro tunc basis given the extraordinary circumstances of the case and the manifest injustice that denial would cause respondent and his family.as we have observed before,hernandez could easily have been a citizen by now but for the errors and delays caused by the government in this case.see edwards ins,cir.
on january,ij dierkes conducted hernandez individual merits hearing.ij dierkes asked dhs counsel to respond to the motion for administrative closure and,alternatively,a continuance.dhs counsel responded,
t he government is not willing to agree to administrative closure,that simply an attempt to indefinitely continue the proceedings and in light of the lack of any regulations and frankly,being the same status as it has many years,the government seeks the court to fulfill its duty and go forward with the adjudication of the case.
app.ij dierkes rendered an oral decision at the hearing,denying hernandez 
applications for asylum and related relief because there ha ve been major changes in your country since you were there my ruling in your case is in no way a negative reflection on you in any way.it just that i think the situation in guatemala has changed since you were there.so i do want you to think that this is a matter of i do find you a credible person.i found your testimony to be generally credible.sometimes these cases are overtaken by events.
id.at.ij dierkes denied hernandez alternative motions for administrative closure and a continuance,observing that the court does not believe that it has authority to administratively close this case on its own,without the consent of both parties.id.at.ij dierkes further stated 
t he court would reiterate that it does not believe that it has authority on its own to administratively close this case for.the proposed regulation makes it clear that it is entirely within the discretion and authority of the immigration service to determine whether or not should take place.the government has consistently refused to agree to administrative closure in this case,which reflects in my opinion the attitude of the department of homeland security towards whether or not it should grant the discretionary relief of to this respondent t his court can not on its own go ahead and administratively close the case.
id.at.ij dierkes did not separately address the request for a continuance which was also premised on the finalization of the repapering regulations.
with regard to whether circumstances in guatemala had changed since hernandez was granted asylum,ij dierkes stated 
t he court believes that there have just been too significant changes in guatemala to allow the court to find that this respondent still has a fear of returning there.for these reasons,the court will deny the respondent application for asylum and withholding of deportation.no evidence has been offered that the government of guatemala or those acting with the consent or acquiescence of the government would have any reason to harm the respondent.accordingly,the torture convention claim is denied.
id.at.ij dierkes also denied hernandez application for suspension of deportation.finally,ij dierkes ordered hernandez removed from the united states to guatemala.
hernandez appealed to the bia.the bia rejected hernandez contention that the assignment of ij dierkes violated hernandez due process rights,stating that t here is no due process right to adjudication by the immigration judge of one choice and there is no evidence in the record supporting a conclusion that the immigration judge decision was decided on some basis other than his understanding and knowledge of the applicable laws and regulations and what he adduced from his participation in the case.id.at.the bia also affirmed the denial of hernandez motion for administrative closure and,alternatively,a continuance for purposes of repapering,stating 
the immigration judge correctly ruled that he did not have the authority to agree to administrative closure over the objection of dhs.an immigration judge can not administratively close deportation proceedings over the objection of either party.matter of,i n,bia.the respondent argues on appeal that the dhs opposition to administrative closure constitutes an abuse of discretion.we have no jurisdiction over appeals from the dhs exercise of discretion.
app.the bia further explained that the immigration judge did not err in not granting a continuance,as the possibility of a future promulgation of regulations that might represent a favorable change to one party or the other does not generally constitute good cause for a continuance.id.at.
concerning hernandez argument that ij dierkes should have issued a decision on the humanitarian asylum claim,the bia determined 
upon review of the record,we see no legitimate comparison between the facts in this case and the facts in a case where a grant of humanitarian asylum would be appropriate.see,matter of chen,i n bia.thus,the respondent request for humanitarian asylum does not constitute a basis for reversal of the immigration judge decision or for a remand of the record.
the bia denied hernandez request for a nunc pro tunc grant of asylum,observing that there were no special considerations in this case which would warrant such an extraordinary remedy.id.the bia explained 
in a decision,the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit held that the board did not apply the proper standard in concluding that the respondent was barred from asylum as a persecutor.see hernandez reno,cir.upon remand,the board held that the respondent was not subject to the persecutor bar,but did not make a finding that the respondent was otherwise eligible for asylum.the record was remanded for further findings.see bia decision,dated july,see also immigration judge written order denying respondent motion to exclude evidence,dated february.the mere fact that the respondent is not an individual who is barred from asylum as a persecutor does not support,on its own,a conclusion that he is eligible for asylum.there has been no point in these proceedings where the respondent eligibility for asylum was not contested by the dhs,and,more importantly,the respondent has never benefitted from a final order determining that he fully met the standards for eligibility for asylum.while we acknowledge that there have been unfortunate delays in this case,we conclude that this case does not present circumstances which would warrant the extraordinary measure of a nunc pro tunc grant of relief.
app.finally,the bia determined that hernandez argument for suspension of deportation was precluded by matter of,bia.therefore,the bia dismissed the appeal and adopted and affirmed ij dierkes decision.hernandez now petitions this court for review.
in hernandez petition for review,he asserts that the substitution of ij dierkes violated b,the regulation applicable to the withdrawal and substitution of immigration judges,and hernandez due process rights,the bia abused its discretion in rejecting his request for a grant of asylum nunc pro tunc,the bia violated b iii and abused its discretion in denying remand for consideration of hernandez claim of humanitarian asylum,and the bia abused its discretion and violated hernandez due process rights by refusing to administratively close his case for repapering or continue his deportation proceedings.we address each in turn.
hernandez asserts that the substitution of ij dierkes for ij cuevas during hernandez remanded immigration proceedings violated b and hernandez due process rights.b provides that 
the immigration judge assigned to conduct the hearing shall at any time withdraw if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified.if an immigration judge becomes unavailable to complete his or her duties,another immigration judge may be assigned to complete the case.the new immigration judge shall familiarize himself or herself with the record in the case and shall state for the record that he or she has done so.
although ij cuevas traveled to minnesota on detail when he conducted hernandez hearing in,ij cuevas no longer did so when hernandez case was remanded by the bia in july app.accordingly,ij cuevas was unavailable within the meaning of section b.therefore,the fact that ij dierkes was substituted for ij cuevas was not in violation of section b.
in addition,hernandez cites no authority,and we have found none,establishing that he had a due process right to a particular immigration judge.the fifth amendment due process clause mandates that removal hearings be fundamentally fair.al khouri ashcroft,cir.for a removal hearing to be fair,the arbiter presiding over the hearing must be neutral tun gonzales,cir see ahmed gonzales,cir it is undisputed that petitioners in immigration proceedings are entitled to an unbiased arbiter who has not prejudged their claims.thus,hernandez has a due process right to an immigration judge who is fair and impartial,but he does not have a due process right to a particular immigration judge.the record in this case does not suggest that ij dierkes approached the case with a closed mind or that he was not impartial.therefore,the substitution of ij dierkes did not violate hernandez due process rights.
hernandez asserts that the bia abused its discretion in rejecting his request for a grant of asylum nunc pro tunc because the equities his case presents demonstrate that he is entitled to such relief.we note that we are not unmoved by the equities in this case.ij cuevas did conclude that hernandez had made the requisite showing for asylum although not in a final order,and this determination was rendered invalid by the change in circumstances in guatemala that took place in the ten years that passed before the matter was revisited by ij dierkes.in addition,hernandez has three children who are united states citizens.moreover,as when this court first considered hernandez asylum claim eight years ago,t here is nothing in the record apart from his immigration status to suggest that hernandez has been anything other than a law abiding resident of this country since his entry in september.hernandez,at.
hernandez states,without citation,that we review the bia denial of his request for a grant of asylum nunc pro tunc for abuse of discretion the government does not address the standard of review.the ninth circuit has stated that abuse of discretion is the proper standard of review for the denial of an application to reapply nunc pro tunc for admission into the united states and that the petitioner has the burden of establishing that he or she merits a favorable exercise of discretion.dragon ins,cir.however,hernandez is not seeking to apply for asylum but a grant of asylum,and dragon does not address the standard of review for the denial of such a request.whatever the standard of review,this case does not present the sort of circumstances where nunc pro tunc relief is appropriate.
the federal courts have ordered nunc pro tunc relief,i n the immigration context,where agency error would otherwise result in an alien being deprived of the opportunity to seek a particular form of deportation relief.edwards,at see iouri ashcroft,cir.in edwards,the second circuit granted nunc pro tunc relief to aliens who were erroneously denied the opportunity to apply for ina c relief at see snajder ins,cir allowing petitioner to file applications for c relief and adjustment of status,despite spending more than five years in prison,because he had been eligible for relief during the time of his original hearing but the ij failed to properly advise him of his right to counsel and counsel would have advised him to seek such relief see also batanic ins,cir ordering the bia to allow the petitioner to apply for asylum to remedy the ij error in proceeding with hearing without the petitioner attorney present.this case is distinguishable from edwards,snajder,and batanic on the basis of the relief sought.while the petitioners in those cases sought the restoration of a deprived opportunity to apply for deportation relief,hernandez seeks a grant of asylum.see roman ins,cir distinguishing petitioners request for asylum nunc pro tunc with relief sought in batanic because there the petitioner was unequivocally barred from seeking asylum.
furthermore,the speculative nature of hernandez request for asylum nunc pro tunc demonstrates that he is not entitled to such relief.hernandez argues that the bia should have granted him asylum nunc pro tunc because,but for agency error and the extraordinary delay caused by the agency,hernandez could have and would have applied for permanent residence in,and could easily have become a citizen years ago.pet r br.in roman,the petitioners argue d that the bia delay in rendering its decision denied them due process and,as a consequence,they should be granted asylum retroactively to the date of their application.at.the seventh circuit rejected this argument,noting that the petitioners argument that they would have been granted asylum had the bia rendered its decision earlier is no more than mere speculation.id.similarly,the second circuit stated that nunc pro tunc relief is not appropriate where a court must necessarily play the role of prognosticator,and divine whether,had the error not occurred,the petitioner would have likely obtained immigration relief but is proper to where petitioners were erroneously denied the opportunity to apply for relief,and that,but for nunc pro tunc relief,this denial would be irremediable.edwards,at.
under roman and edwards,nunc pro tunc relief is not appropriate in this case where any argument that hernandez would have ultimately received a grant of asylum is speculative because,as the bia observed,hernandez has never benefitted from a final order determining that he fully met the standards for eligibility for asylum.app.it is true that the bia incorrectly applied the persecutor bar and did not disturb ij cuevas determination that hernandez had given credible testimony.however,even absent the persecution bar and viewing hernandez testimony as credible,the bia may have reversed the ij grant of asylum.therefore,hernandez speculation that he could easily have become a citizen years ago,pet r br.does not warrant a grant of asylum nunc pro tunc.
hernandez next contends that he is entitled to humanitarian asylum because there is a reasonable probability that he may suffer other serious harm upon removal to guatemala.b iii provides for humanitarian asylum in the absence of a fear of persecution subject to the decisionmaker discretion,section b iii provides for asylum where t he applicant has demonstrated compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution,b iii a,or t he applicant has established that there is a reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country,id.b iii b.
generally,we review the bia denial of a petitioner request for humanitarian asylum for abuse of discretion.mambwe holder,cir see b d providing that we may overturn a discretionary denial of asylum only if it is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.here,however,hernandez does not argue that the bia abused its discretion in denying his humanitarian asylum claim.rather,he asserts that the bia violated d iv in failing to remand the claim for further factfinding as ij dierkes ignored the claim and the bia erred because it only considered whether such relief would be appropriate under section b iii a which focuses on past harm,whereas he sought humanitarian asylum under section b iii b in light of the future harm he alleges that he faces if removed to guatemala.
on april,hernandez submitted a response to ij dierkes request that the parties direct attention to relevant evidence in the record.admin.at.in the response,hernandez notes that he is restating his position at a prior hearing that the evidence in the record would also support a grant of asylum pursuant to b iii sic,even in the absence of a fear of persecution.id.hernandez further states 
the evidence cited above would also support a humanitarian grant of asylum under b iii sic and consistent with the principles of matter of h,int.bia,and matter of pula,i n bia.a humanitarian asylum grant is justified by all of the evidence contained in exhibits and,and the ins resource information center ins ric question and answer series report,guatemala hardship considerations,at exhibit,pages.the ins ric report reflects the truly deplorable economic,educational and social conditions that persist and are worsening in guatemala.the consequences of these conditions for respondent and his family members,especially his three citizen children,should be of the greatest concern to this court should it reach this discretionary analysis.the court should not fail to weigh the bia inexplicable,delay in deciding the ins appeal of.
id.at.hernandez made no other submissions to ij dierkes with regard to his claim for humanitarian asylum.ij dierkes did not issue a ruling on hernandez humanitarian asylum claim.the bia determined that remand of the humanitarian asylum claim was not warranted and that hernandez was not entitled to such relief.the bia explained,
the respondent argues that his claim for humanitarian asylum should have been assessed by the immigration judge.upon review of the record,we see no legitimate comparison between the facts in this case and the facts in a case where a grant of humanitarian asylum would be appropriate.see,matter of chen,i n bia.thus,the respondent request for humanitarian asylum does not constitute a basis for reversal of the immigration judge decision or for a remand of the record.
here,hernandez asserts that he is entitled to humanitarian asylum under section b iii b because he would face other serious harm if returned to guatemala.other serious harm means harm that is not inflicted on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,but is so serious that it equals the severity of persecution.see.this is clearly a very high standard for relief.see mehmeti att y,cir per curiam providing that humanitarian asylum is reserved for the most extraordinary cases see also cutaj gonzales,cir unpublished given the high standard that must be met in order to justify a grant of humanitarian asylum,we can not say that the immigration judge abused his discretion in denying such relief in this case furthermore,the petitioner has not established a reasonable possibility that she will suffer other serious harm if she is removed to albania.no evidence exists in the record that her family has suffered serious harm by remaining in
