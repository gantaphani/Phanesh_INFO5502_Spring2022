background 
factual history 
mekhtiev was born in ashgabad,turkmenistan to his father,tofik mekhtiev and his russian mother,ivanova alla nikolaevna.his parents divorced and mekhtiev was raised in turkmenistan by his mother and grandmother.after marrying,mekhtiev began a business in buying and selling different goods.in,mekhtiev father emigrated to the united states pursuant to the diversity visa lottery program.
neither mekhtiev nor any of his family members have ever belonged to or been associated with any organizations or political parties.rather,mekhtiev premises his asylum claim on encounters he had with the general prosecutor office of the turkmen government in early.he contends that he fears persecution by the general prosecutor office if he returns to turkmenistan.
in november,an assassination attempt was made against the president of turkmenistan.inspector derya ataev,an investigator with the general prosecutor office,made inquiries in connection with the assassination attempt.on january,mekhtiev was called to the general prosecutor office for questioning regarding his father.the purpose of this interrogation,according to mekhtiev,was to enlist mekhtiev help in convincing his father to return to turkmenistan to testify against guvanch djumaev,an individual accused of orchestrating the attempted assassination.mekhtiev father knew djumaev fairly well because they had been classmates and worked together on projects involving their businesses.mekhtiev himself did not know guvanch djumaev,but he did have an relationship with djumaev son,timur djumaev.he met timur in the through a mutual friend and occasionally encountered him at the bank where they each maintained accounts.
during the january interrogation,ataev questioned mekhtiev about trips mekhtiev made to the united states and moscow in and also inquired regarding mekhtiev relationship with timur djumaev.mekhtiev asserted to the immigration judge in this case that f rom the very beginning they hinted that i was a member of the opposition and involved in the assassination attempt.however,mekhtiev also admitted that he was never accused of or charged with being a member of the opposition.
after the interrogation,mekhtiev was detained overnight.mekhtiev stated that while in custody he was kicked,beaten with heavy bottles containing water,and knocked unconscious.he also said that he,and possibly his family,were threatened with injections of something that would induce them to tell the authorities the truth.in documents submitted to the immigration court,mekhtiev claimed that he needed stitches after the beating and also that he required two weeks of bed rest to recover.at the conclusion of his overnight incarceration,mekhtiev passport was confiscated and he claims that he was coerced into signing a document pledging that he would not leave turkmenistan.
the general prosecutor office conducted meetings with mekhtiev.in february,ataev convinced mekhtiev to persuade his father to return to turkmenistan.ataev returned mekhtiev passport after mekhtiev signed another document stating that he would not leave the country.mekhtiev stated at his hearing that he was threatened with jail for the rest of his life if he did not get his father back to turkmenistan to facilitate the criminal investigation of djumaev.mekhtiev was apparently not detained or injured during these subsequent meetings.
mekhtiev and his family left turkmenistan soon after the february meeting and arrived in the united states on march.they were authorized to remain in the united states until september.before their stay expired,mekhtiev and his family filed a request for asylum with the asylum office.mekhtiev contended that if he returned to turkmenistan he would be arrested for violating his agreement that he would not leave the country and that the government would fabricate a criminal case against him by planting drugs on him or placing a gun in his suitcase.mekhtiev also surmised that the government suspected him of involvement in the assassination attempt and might charge him with treason.after an interview with an asylum officer it was determined that mekhtiev and his family were not eligible for asylum and their case was referred to the immigration court.
mekhtiev testified at his hearing that he did not think turkmenistan authorities were any longer making arrests connected to the assassination attempt.mekhtiev did state that his aunt was convicted of unlawful possession of firearms in her home in january,and that he believed that the charges were fabricated by the government to induce his father to return to turkmenistan.however,mekhtiev offered no statement from his aunt or any other evidence related to the conviction.
procedural history 
on february,an immigration judge ij denied petitioners application for asylum and ordered them removed to russia or alternatively turkmenistan the ij determined that the treatment mekhtiev experienced when he was held overnight by the general prosecutor office did not amount to past persecution as contemplated by the relevant case law.the ij also found that any interest the turkmenistan government had in questioning or harming mekhtiev in order to gain his assistance in the criminal investigation of the djumaevs appeared to be moot because djumaev and his son had both by that time been convicted in connection with the assassination.the ij concluded that mekhtiev difficulties stemmed from a discrete criminal investigation.since mekhtiev had been able to live in peace in turkmenistan before the investigation,the judge concluded that the evidence did not reflect an objective basis for finding a fear of future persecution.
the ij also found that mekhtiev claim was undermined by the lack of any protected ground for asylum.in its order,the ij noted that mekhtiev incarceration and beating did not occur because of mekhtiev activities but rather occurred as the result of the political upheaval following the presidential assassination attempt.the ij did not believe that mekhtiev experiences were connected to any political opinion but rather were the result of mekhtiev personal relationship with two people supposedly involved in the assassination attempt who had since been convicted.
on appeal to the bia,mekhtiev asserted that the ij erred in finding no nexus between mekhtiev fear of returning to turkmenistan and a protected ground for asylum.specifically,he argued that the ij failed to recognize that he feared persecution based on an imputed political opinion.he also argued that the ij failed to consider his whole circumstance.
the board upheld the ij decision and dismissed the appeal.the board concluded that the record only revealed that the government sought to pressure mekhtiev to cooperate in getting his father to return to turkmenistan to testify against djumaev and that the record did not demonstrate that the government imputed a political opinion to mekhtiev.the board observed that mekhtiev had suffered no harm after the january incarceration,was never charged or arrested for any crime,and that his passport had been returned to him at a time when other individuals were being arrested based on perceived political opinions.the board stated that any harm mekhtiev experienced could qualify as harassment or intimidation but was not so extreme as to rise to the level of persecution.finally,the board also rejected mekhtiev claim that he had a fear based on his membership in a particular social group of individuals targeted for their association with members of the opposition.
