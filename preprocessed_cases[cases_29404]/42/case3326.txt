kaleena leah morales appeals her convictions for one count of conspiracy to transport aliens who unlawfully came to or entered the united states,and three counts of transporting such aliens,in each case for private financial gain.see.among other claims,she challenges the admissibility of certain forms filled out by border patrol agents in the field,which included statements by the smuggled aliens that they were in the united states illegally we hold that the admission of the forms did not violate the confrontation clause,but the aliens admissions included in the forms were inadmissible hearsay.nonetheless,this error was harmless because the erroneously admitted hearsay did not materially affect the verdict.
according to the evidence adduced at trial,on july,morales picked up her friend sharae jakaub in order to clear up the title to a car morales had recently purchased from jakaub.while on the highway,jakaub mentioned that she was broke and reminded morales about a debt morales owed to her.morales proposed a deal if jakaub agreed to help her pick up five aliens who were in the country illegally,she would give jakaub half of the she had been promised by an unknown third party.jakaub readily agreed.the pair eventually exited the highway and arrived at a site filled with trailers,one of which contained the five individuals morales had agreed to transport.morales opened the trailer door,arranged the five people in the back of her truck,and drove back the way she came.
a few hours later,arizona department of public safety officer steve kroeger observed morales truck driving more slowly than the rest of the highway traffic.he also noticed that her windshield was cracked.after pacing the vehicle for a few miles to determine its speed,he stopped the truck for suspected violations of two traffic ordinances.when officer kroeger approached to ask morales for her license and registration,he spotted several other individuals lying down horizontally and attempting to hide in the backseat of the truck.when asked how many people were hiding in the backseat,morales refused to answer.officer kroeger suspected that morales and jakaub might be involved in alien smuggling and called the border patrol.
the border patrol agents ascertained that none of the five individuals in the backseat of the truck was a united states citizen or otherwise authorized to be in the united states.the agents arrested three of the aliens,and agent brian peacock completed a field encounter form a field,now referred to as form i for each arrested alien.
the field contains three sections the first section requires the border patrol agent to record the date and location of the alien arrest,the funds found in the alien possession,and basic biographical information about the alien,such as the alien name,gender,and date and place of birth.the second section contains a notice of rights,and advises the alien of the reason for the arrest and corresponding rights,such as the right to a hearing,the right to obtain legal representation,and the right to communicate with legal representatives or consular officials.the third section contains a request for disposition,and asks the alien to initial next to one of three options i request a hearing before the immigration court to determine whether or not i may remain in the united states i believe i face harm if i return to my country.my case will be referred to the immigration court for a hearing or 
i admit that i am in the united states illegally,and i believe i do not face harm if i return to my country.i give up my right to a hearing before the immigration court.i wish to return to my country as soon as arrangements can be made to effect my departure.i understand that i may be held in detention until my departure.
in this case,an agent filled out the first section on each form.all of the aliens selected the third option in the request for disposition section and signed on the line provided for the alien signature,thus admitting they were in the united states illegally and requesting to be returned to their country.
morales was ultimately arrested and charged with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens who unlawfully came to or entered the united states,and three counts of transporting such aliens,in each case for private financial gain.a a v i,a a ii a b i,a a ii a b i.in order to sustain morales conviction for illegal transportation of aliens for private financial gain under a a ii a b i,the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the persons morales was transporting were aliens,a a ii the aliens were not lawfully in the united states,morales knew or acted in reckless disregard of the fact that the aliens were not lawfully in the united states,morales transported the aliens in order to help them remain in the united states unlawfully,and morales did so for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain,a b i.
after the aliens apprehension,the government deposed them on videotape and deported them pursuant to the federal material witness statute,rather than attempting to bring them back to the united states to testify,the government sought to introduce the recordings of their depositions.the district court declined to admit this deposition testimony because the government was unable to prove that the aliens were unavailable for purposes of the confrontation clause.
four witnesses testified at the bench trial jakaub and three border patrol agents,agent benjamin wycoff,agent shawn brewer,and agent peacock.jakaub described how she and morales agreed to share the profits from transporting the aliens and how they transported them until they were stopped by officer kroeger.next,agent brewer and agent peacock testified about their encounter with morales and the aliens in her vehicle.finally,agent wycoff,the case agent for morales case,testified about the immigration status of the individuals found in morales car,including the information reported in the field.he first testified that he was responsible for consulting three databases used to keep track of aliens and maintained by the immigration service in the ordinary course of its business.his search of those databases yielded no documentation allowing the aliens to be present.agent wycoff then testified about the nature and purpose of the field.he noted that agents in the field fill out the form for every individual apprehended by the border patrol,and that the forms are typically used to verify entries in the border patrol databases because the information in these forms comes directly from the apprehended individual.agent wycoff further testified that physical copies of the field were sent to the for each person who has contact with immigration as part of the normal course of the border patrol business,and that the information he obtained from the databases was consistent with the information recorded on the field.
morales objected to the admission of the field on the grounds that they violated her confrontation rights,were inadmissible hearsay,and had been admitted without an adequate foundation.the district court overruled these objections.the court held that the forms were nontestimonial because they were not made in anticipation of litigation.further,the court held that the forms qualified for a hearsay exception under rule of the federal rules of evidence,which provides that business records which meet certain criteria are not excluded by the rule against hearsay.see.
the district court found morales guilty on all four counts and sentenced her to months in custody for each count,all of which were to be served concurrently.morales timely appealed.
