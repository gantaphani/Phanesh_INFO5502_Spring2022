john kerry,secretary of state,et,petitioners fauzia din 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia announced the judgment of the court and delivered an opinion,in which the chief justice and justice thomas join.
fauzia din is a citizen and resident of the united states.her husband,kanishka berashk,is an afghan citizen and former civil servant in the taliban regime who resides in that country.when the government declined to issue an immigrant visa to berashk,din sued.
the state action of which din complains is the denial of berashk visa application.naturally,one would expect him not din to bring this suit.but because berashk is an unadmitted and nonresident alien,he has no right of entry into the united states,and no cause of action to press in furtherance of his claim for admission.see kleindienst mandel.so,din attempts to bring suit on his behalf,alleging that the government denial of her husband visa application violated her constitutional rights.see app,complaint.in particular,she claims that the government denied her due process of law when,without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial,it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the united states with her spouse.there is no such constitutional right.what justice breyer dissent strangely describes as a deprivation of her freedom to live together with her spouse in america,post,at,is,in any world other than the artificial world of constitutional rights,nothing more than a deprivation of her spouse freedom to immigrate into america.
for the reasons given in this opinion and in the opinion concurring in the judgment,we vacate and remand.
under the immigration and nationality act ina,stat,as amended,et,an alien may not enter and permanently reside in the united states without a visa.a.the ina creates a special process for aliens sponsored by immediate relatives in the united states.b,a.under this process,the first files a petition on behalf of the alien living abroad,asking to have the alien classified as an immediate relative.see f,a.if and when a petition is approved,the alien may apply for a visa by submitting the required documents and appearing at a united states embassy or consulate for an interview with a consular officer.see a.before issuing a visa,the consular officer must ensure the alien is not inadmissible under any provision of the ina.
one ground for inadmissibility,a b,covers t errorist activities.in addition to the violent and destructive acts the term immediately brings to mind,the ina defines terrorist activity to include providing material support to a terrorist organization and serving as a terrorist organization representative.a b i,iii vi.
fauzia din came to the united states as a refugee in,and became a naturalized citizen in.she filed a petition to have kanishka berashk,whom she married in,classified as her immediate relative.the petition was granted,and berashk filed a visa application.the embassy in islamabad,pakistan,interviewed berashk and denied his application.a consular officer informed berashk that he was inadmissible under a b but provided no further explanation.
din then brought suit in federal district court seeking a writ of mandamus directing the united states to properly adjudicate berashk visa application a declaratory judgment that b,which exempts the government from providing notice to an alien found inadmissible under the terrorism bar,is unconstitutional as applied and a declaratory judgment that the denial violated the administrative procedure act.app,complaint.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss,but the ninth circuit reversed.the ninth circuit concluded that din has a protected liberty interest in marriage that entitled her to review of the denial of her spouse visa,and that the government citation of a b did not provide din with the limited judicial review to which she was entitled under the due process clause,at.this court granted certiorari.
the fifth amendment provides that n o person shall be deprived of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.although the amount and quality of process that our precedents have recognized as due under the clause has changed considerably since the founding,see pacific mut.life ins.haslip,scalia,concurring in judgment,it remains the case that no process is due if one is not deprived of life,liberty,or property,swarthout cooke,per curiam.the first question that we must ask,then,is whether the denial of berashk visa application deprived din of any of these interests.only if we answer in the affirmative must we proceed to consider whether the government explanation afforded sufficient process.
the due process clause has its origin in magna carta.as originally drafted,the great charter provided that n o freeman shall be taken,or imprisoned,or be disseised of his freehold,or liberties,or free customs,or be outlawed,or exiled,or any otherwise destroyed nor will we not pass upon him,nor condemn him,but by lawful judgment of his peers,or by the law of the land.magna carta,ch,in coke,the second part of the institutes of the laws of england emphasis added.the court has recognized that at the time of the fifth amendment ratification,the words due process of law were understood to convey the same meaning as the words by the law of the land in magna carta.murray lessee hoboken land improvement,how.although the terminology associated with the guarantee of due process changed dramatically between and,the general scope of the underlying rights protected stayed roughly constant.
edward coke,whose institutes were read in the american colonies by virtually every student of law,klopfer north carolina,thoroughly described the scope of the interests that could be deprived only pursuant to the law of the land.magna carta,he wrote,ensured that,without due process,no man may be taken or imprisoned disseised of his lands,or tenements,or dispossessed of his goods,or chattels put from his livelihood without answer barred to have the benefit of the law denied the franchises,and priviledges,which the subjects have of the gift of the king exiled or of life,or limbe,disherited,or put to torture,or death.coke,supra,at.blackstone description of the rights protected by magna carta is similar,although he discusses them in terms much closer to the life,liberty,or property terminology used in the fifth amendment.he described first an interest in personal security,consist ing in a person legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life,his limbs,his body,his health,and his reputation.blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england.second,the personal liberty of individuals consist ed in the power of,of changing situation,or removing one person to whatsoever place one own inclination may direct without imprisonment or restraint.at.and finally,a person right to property included the free use,enjoyment,and disposal of all his acquisitions.at.
din,of course,could not conceivably claim that the denial of berashk visa application deprived her or for that matter even berashk of life or property and under the above described historical understanding,a claim that it deprived her of liberty is equally absurd.the government has not taken or imprisoned din,nor has it confine d her,either by keeping her against h er will in a private house,putting h er in the stocks,arresting or forcibly detaining h er in the street.at.indeed,not even berashk has suffered a deprivation of liberty so understood.
despite this historical evidence,this court has seen fit on several occasions to expand the meaning of liberty under the due process clause to include certain implied fundamental rights.the reasoning presumably goes like this if you have a right to do something,you are free to do it,and deprivation of freedom is a deprivation of liberty never mind the original meaning of that word in the due process clause.these implied rights have been given more protection than life,liberty,or property properly understood.while one may be dispossessed of property,thrown in jail,or even executed so long as proper procedures are followed,the enjoyment of implied constitutional rights can not be limited at all,except by provisions that are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.reno flores.din does not explicitly argue that the government has violated this absolute prohibition of the substantive component of the due process clause,likely because it is obvious that a law barring aliens engaged in terrorist activities from entering this country is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.she nevertheless insists that,because enforcement of the law affects her enjoyment of an implied fundamental liberty,the government must first provide her a full battery of protections.
i think it worth explaining why,even if one accepts the textually unsupportable doctrine of implied fundamental rights,din arguments would fail.because extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest place s the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action,washington glucksberg,and because the guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and,collins harker heights,t he doctrine of judicial requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,ibid.accordingly,before conferring constitutional status upon a previously unrecognized liberty,we have required a careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest,as well as a demonstration that the interest is objectively,deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if it was sacrificed.glucksberg,supra,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
din describes the denial of berashk visa application as implicating,alternately,a liberty interest in her marriage,brief for respondent,a right of association with one spouse,at,a liberty interest in being reunited with certain blood relatives,at,and the liberty interest of a citizen under the due process clause to be free from arbitrary restrictions on his right to live with his spouse,ibid.to be sure,this court has at times indulged a propensity for grandiloquence when reviewing the sweep of implied rights,describing them so broadly that they would include not only the interests din asserts but many others as well.for example without doubt,the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract,to engage in any of the common occupations of life,to acquire useful knowledge,to marry,establish a home and bring up children,and to worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience meyer nebraska.but this court is not bound by dicta,especially dicta that have been repudiated by the holdings of our subsequent cases.and the actual holdings of the cases din relies upon hardly establish the capacious right she now asserts.
unlike the states in loving virginia,zablocki redhail,and turner safley,the federal government here has not attempted to forbid a marriage.although din and the dissent borrow language from those cases invoking a fundamental right to marriage,they both implicitly concede that no such right has been infringed in this case.din relies on the associational interests in marriage that necessarily are protected by the right to marry,and that are presuppose d by later cases establishing a right to marital privacy.brief for respondent.the dissent supplements the fundamental right to marriage with a fundamental right to live in the united states in order to find an affected liberty interest.post,at breyer,dissenting.
attempting to abstract from these cases some liberty interest that might be implicated by berashk visa denial,din draws on even more inapposite cases.meyer,for example,invalidated a state statute proscribing the teaching of foreign language to children who had not yet passed the eighth grade,reasoning that it violated the teacher right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children.at.pierce society of sisters,extended meyer,finding that a law requiring children to attend public schools interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.moore east cleveland,extended this interest in raising children to caretakers in a child extended family,striking down an ordinance that limited occupancy of a house to members of a nuclear family on the ground that d ecisions concerning child rearing long have been shared with grandparents or other relatives.and griswold connecticut,concluded that a law criminalizing the use of contraceptives by married couples violated penumbral rights of privacy and repose protecting the sacred precincts of the marital bedroom rights which do not plausibly extend into the offices of our consulates abroad.
nothing in the cases din cites establishes a and categorical liberty interest in marriage or any other formulation din offers sufficient to trigger constitutional protection whenever a regulation in any way touches upon an aspect of the marital relationship.even if our cases could be construed so broadly,the relevant question is not whether the asserted interest is consistent with this court line of cases,but whether it is supported by this nation history and practice.glucksberg,at emphasis deleted.even if we might imply a liberty interest in marriage generally speaking,that must give way when there is a tradition denying the specific application of that general interest.thus,glucksberg rejected a claimed liberty interest in and personal autonomy that extended to assisted suicide when there was a longstanding tradition of outlawing the practice of suicide,at,internal quotation marks omitted.
here,a long practice of regulating spousal immigration precludes din claim that the denial of berashk visa application has deprived her of a fundamental liberty interest.although immigration was effectively unregulated prior to,as soon as congress began legislating in this area it enacted a complicated web of regulations that erected serious impediments to a person ability to bring a spouse into the united states.see abrams,what makes the family special chi.
most strikingly,perhaps,the expatriation act of provided that any american woman who marries a foreigner shall take the nationality of her husband.ch,stat.thus,a woman in din position not only lacked a liberty interest that might be affected by the government disposition of her husband visa application,she lost her own rights as a citizen upon marriage.when congress began to impose quotas on immigration by country of origin less than years later,with the immigration act of,it omitted fiances and husbands from the family relations eligible for preferred status in the allocation of quota spots.d,stat.such relations were similarly excluded from the relations eligible for nonquota status,when that status was expanded three years later.immigration act of,a,stat.
to be sure,these early regulations were premised on the derivative citizenship of women,a legacy of the law of coverture that was already in decline at the time.bredbenner,a nationality of her own.modern doctrine casts substantial doubt on the permissibility of such asymmetric treatment of women citizens in the immigration context,and modern moral judgment rejects the premises of such a legal order.nevertheless,this practice repudiates any contention that din asserted liberty interest is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.glucksberg,supra,at citations and internal quotations marks omitted.
indeed,the law showed little more solicitude for the marital relationship when it was a male resident or citizen seeking admission for his fiancee or wife.the immigration act of granted nonquota status only to unmarried,minor children of citizens,a,while granting fiancees and wives preferred status within the allocation of quota spots,d.in other words,a citizen could move his spouse forward in the line,but once all the quota spots were filled for the year,the spouse was barred without exception.this was not just a theoretical possibility as one commentator has observed,f or many immigrants,the family categories did little to help,because the quotas were so small that the number of family members seeking slots far outstripped the number available.abrams,supra,at.
although congress has tended to show a continuing and kindly concern for the unity and the happiness of the immigrant family,hutchinson,legislative history of american immigration policy,this has been a matter of legislative grace rather than fundamental right.even where congress has provided special privileges to promote family immigration,it has also written in careful checks and qualifications.ibid.this court has consistently recognized that these various distinctions are policy questions entrusted exclusively to the political branches of our government,and we have no judicial authority to substitute our political judgment for that of the congress.fiallo bell.only by diluting the meaning of a fundamental liberty interest and jettisoning our established jurisprudence could we conclude that the denial of berashk visa application implicates any of din fundamental liberty interests.
justice breyer suggests that procedural due process rights attach to liberty interests that either are created by nonconstitutional law,such as a statute,or sufficiently important so as to flow implicit ly from the design,object,and nature of the due process clause.post,at.
the first point is unobjectionable,at least given this court case law.see,goldberg kelly,and collins,at.but it is unhelpful to din,who does not argue that a statute confers on her a liberty interest protected by the due process clause.justice breyer attempts to make this argument for din,latching onto language in wilkinson austin,saying that a liberty interest may arise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies.such an expectation has been created here,he asserts,because the law surrounds marriage with a host of legal protections to the point that it creates a strong expectation that government will not deprive married individuals of their freedom to live together without strong reasons and in individual cases without fair procedure,post,at.but what wilkinson meant by an expectation or interest was not that sort of judicially unenforceable substantial hope,but a present and legally recognized substantive entitlement.as sole support for its conclusion that nonconstitutional law can create constitutionally protected liberty interests,wilkinson cited wolff mcdonnell,which held that a prisoner could not be deprived of statutory credit without procedural due process.that was not because a prisoner might have a strong expectation that the government would not deprive him of credit without strong reasons or fair procedure,but because the state itself has not only provided a statutory right to good time credit but also specifies that it is to be forfeited only for serious misbehavior,at emphasis added.the legal benefits afforded to marriages and the preferential treatment accorded to visa applicants with citizen relatives are insufficient to confer on din a right that can be deprived only pursuant to procedural due process.
justice breyer second point that procedural due process rights attach even to some nonfundamental liberty interests that have not been created by statute is much more troubling.he relies on the cases discussed above to divine a right of spouses to live together and to raise a family,along with a citizen right to live within this country.post,at.but perhaps recognizing that our established methodology for identifying fundamental rights cuts against his conclusion,see part,supra,he argues that the term liberty in the due process clause includes implied rights that,although not so fundamental as to deserve protection,are important enough to deserve protection.post,at.in other words,there are two categories of implied rights protected by the due process clause really fundamental rights,which can not be taken away at all absent a compelling state interest and rights,which can be taken away so long as procedural due process is observed.
the dissent fails to cite a single case supporting its novel theory of implied nonfundamental rights.it is certainly true that vitek jones,and washington harper,do not entail implied fundamental rights,but this is because they do not entail implied rights at all.vitek concerned the involuntary commitment of a prisoner,deprivation of the expressly protected right of liberty under the original understanding of the term,see part,supra.among the historic liberties protected by the due process clause is the right to be free from,and to obtain judicial relief for,unjustified intrusions on personal security.vitek,supra,at.the same is true of harper,which concerned forced administration of psychotropic drugs to an inmate,at.arguably,paul davis,also addressed an interest expressly contemplated within the meaning of liberty.see blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england the right of personal security consists in a person reputation but that case is of no help to the dissent anyway,since it found no liberty interest entitled to the due process clause protection.paul,supra,at.finally,the dissent points to goss lopez,a case that recognize d as a property interest a student right to a public education conferred by ohio express statutory creation of a public school system and further concluded that the student suspension implicated the constitutionally grounded liberty interest in a person good name,reputation,honor,or integrity.
ultimately,the dissent identifies no case holding that there is an implied nonfundamental right protected by procedural due process,and only one case even suggesting that there is.that suggestion,in smith organization of foster families for equality reform,is contained in dictum in a footnote,at.the holding of the case was that the procedures provided by new york state and by new york cit y are adequate to protect whatever liberty interests appellees may have.at emphasis added.
the footnoted dictum that justice breyer proposes to elevate to constitutional law is a dangerous doctrine.it vastly expands the scope of our jurisprudence by setting it free from the requirement that the liberty interest be objectively,deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,glucksberg,at internal quotation marks omitted.even liberties would,thanks to this new notion of rights,qualify for judicially imposed procedural requirements.moreover,justice breyer gives no basis for distinguishing the fundamental rights recognized in the cases he depends on from the nonfundamental right he believes they give rise to in the present case.
neither din right to live with her spouse nor her right to live within this country is implicated here.there is a simple distinction between government action that directly affects a citizen legal rights,or imposes a direct restraint on his liberty,and action that is directed against a third party and affects the citizen only indirectly or incidentally.town court nursing center.the government has not refused to recognize din marriage to berashk,and din remains free to live with her husband anywhere in the world that both individuals are permitted to reside.and the government has not expelled din from the country.it has simply determined that kanishka berashk engaged in terrorist activities within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act,and has therefore denied him admission into the country.this might,indeed,deprive din of something important,post,at,but if that is the criterion for justice breyer new pairing of substantive and procedural due process,we are in for quite a ride.
because fauzia din was not deprived of life,liberty,or property when the government denied kanishka berashk admission to the united states,there is no process due to her under the constitution.to the extent that she received any explanation for the government decision,this was more than the due process clause required.the judgment of the ninth circuit is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
it is so ordered.
kennedy,concurring in judgment 
john kerry,secretary of state,et,petitioners fauzia din 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kennedy,with whom justice alito joins,concurring in the judgment.
the respondent,fauzia din,is a citizen and resident of the united states.she asserts that petitioner government officials collectively,government violated her own constitutional right to live in this country with her husband,an alien now residing in afghanistan.she contends this violation occurred when the government,through state department consular officials,denied her spouse immigrant visa application with no explanation other than that the denial was based on a b,the statutory provision prohibiting the issuance of visas to persons who engage in terrorist activities.
the plurality is correct that the case must be vacated and remanded.but rather than deciding,as the plurality does,whether din has a protected liberty interest,my view is that,even assuming she does,the notice she received regarding her husband visa denial satisfied due process.
today disposition should not be interpreted as deciding whether a citizen has a protected liberty interest in the visa application of her alien spouse.the court need not decide that issue,for this court precedents instruct that,even assuming she has such an interest,the government satisfied due process when it notified din husband that his visa was denied under the immigration statute terrorism bar,a b.see ante,at.
the conclusion that din received all the process to which she was entitled finds its most substantial instruction in the court decision in kleindienst mandel.there,college professors all of them citizens had invited ernest mandel,a revolutionary marxist,to speak at a conference at stanford university,at.yet when mandel applied for a temporary nonimmigrant visa to enter the country,he was denied.at the time,the immigration laws deemed aliens who advocate d the economic,international,and governmental doctrines of world communism ineligible for visas.a d ed.aliens ineligible under this provision did have one opportunity for recourse the attorney general was given discretion to waive the prohibition and grant individual exceptions,allowing the alien to obtain a temporary visa.d.for mandel,however,the attorney general,acting through the immigration and naturalization service ins,declined to grant a waiver.in a letter regarding this decision,the ins explained mandel had exceeded the scope and terms of temporary visas on past trips to the united states,which the agency deemed a flagrant abuse of the opportunities afforded him to express his views in this country.at.
the professors who had invited mandel to speak challenged the ins decision,asserting a first amendment right to hear his views and engage him in a free and open academic exchange.at.they claimed the attorney general infringed this right when he refused to grant mandel relief.see ibid.
the court declined to balance the first amendment interest of the professors against congress plenary power to make rules for the admission of aliens and to exclude those who possess those characteristics which congress has forbidden.at,citation omitted.to do so would require courts in each case to weigh the strength of the audience interest against that of the government in refusing a visa to the particular applicant,a nuanced and difficult decision congress had properly placed in the hands of the executive.at.
instead,the court limited its inquiry to the question whether the government had provided a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for its action,at.finding the government had proffered such a reason mandel abuse of past visas the court ended its inquiry and found the attorney general action to be lawful.see ibid.the court emphasized it did not address w hat first amendment or other grounds may be available for attacking an exercise of discretion for which no justification whatsoever is advanced.ibid.
the reasoning and the holding in mandel control here.that decision was based upon due consideration of the congressional power to make rules for the exclusion of aliens,and the ensuing power to delegate authority to the attorney general to exercise substantial discretion in that field.mandel held that an executive officer decision denying a visa that burdens a citizen own constitutional rights is valid when it is made on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason.at.once this standard is met,courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion,nor test it by balancing its justification against the constitutional interests of citizens the visa denial might implicate.ibid.this reasoning has particular force in the area of national security,for which congress has provided specific statutory directions pertaining to visa applications by noncitizens who seek entry to this country.
like the professors who sought an audience with mandel,din claims her constitutional rights were burdened by the denial of a visa to a noncitizen,namely her husband.and as in mandel,the government provided a reason for the visa denial it concluded din husband was inadmissible under a b terrorism bar.even assuming din rights were burdened directly by the visa denial,the remaining question is whether the reasons given by the government satisfy mandel facially legitimate and bona fide standard.i conclude that they do.
here,the consular officer determination that din husband was ineligible for a visa was controlled by specific statutory factors.the provisions of a b establish specific criteria for determining inadmissibility.the consular officer citation of that provision suffices to show that the denial rested on a determination that din husband did not satisfy the statute requirements.given congress plenary power to suppl y the conditions of the privilege of entry into the united states,united states ex rel.knauff shaughnessy,it follows that the government decision to exclude an alien it determines does not satisfy one or more of those conditions is facially legitimate under mandel.
the government citation of a b also indicates it relied upon a bona fide factual basis for denying a visa to berashk.united states chemical foundation.din claims due process requires she be provided with the facts underlying this determination,arguing mandel required a similar factual basis.it is true the attorney general there disclosed the facts motivating his decision to deny mandel a waiver,and that the court cited those facts as demonstrating the attorney general validly exercised the plenary power that congress delegated to the executive.at.but unlike the waiver provision at issue in mandel,which granted the attorney general nearly unbridled discretion,a b specifies discrete factual predicates the consular officer must find to exist before denying a visa.din,moreover,admits in her complaint that berashk worked for the taliban government,app,which,even if itself insufficient to support exclusion,provides at least a facial connection to terrorist activity.absent an affirmative showing of bad faith on the part of the consular officer who denied berashk a visa which din has not plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity mandel instructs us not to look behind the government exclusion of berashk for additional factual details beyond what its express reliance on a b encompassed.see,at.
the government,furthermore,was not required,as din claims,to point to a more specific provision within a b.to be sure,the statutory provision the consular officer cited covers a broad range of conduct.and din perhaps more easily could mount a challenge to her husband visa denial if she knew the specific subsection on which the consular officer relied.congress understood this problem,however.the statute generally requires the government to provide an alien denied a visa with the specific provision or provisions of law under which the alien is inadmissible,b but this notice requirement does not apply when,as in this case,a visa application is denied due to terrorism or national security concerns.b.notably,the government is not prohibited from offering more details when it sees fit,but the statute expressly refrains from requiring it to do so.
congress evaluated the benefits and burdens of notice in this sensitive area and assigned discretion to the executive to decide when more detailed disclosure is appropriate.this considered judgment gives additional support to the independent conclusion that the notice given was constitutionally adequate,particularly in light of the national security concerns the terrorism bar addresses.see fiallo bell,see also ins.and even if din is correct that sensitive facts could be reviewed by courts in camera,the dangers and difficulties of handling such delicate security material further counsel against requiring disclosure in a case such as this.under mandel,respect for the political branches broad power over the creation and administration of the immigration system extends to determinations of how much information the government is obliged to disclose about a consular officer denial of a visa to an alien abroad.
for these reasons,my conclusion is that the government satisfied any obligation it might have had to provide din with a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for its action when it provided notice that her husband was denied admission to the country under a b.by requiring the government to provide more,the court of appeals erred in adjudicating din constitutional claims.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice breyer,with whom justice ginsburg,justice sotomayor,and justice kagan join,dissenting.
fauzia din,an american citizen,wants to know why the state department denied a visa to her husband,a noncitizen.she points out that,without a visa,she and her husband will have to spend their married lives separately or abroad.and she argues that the department,in refusing to provide an adequate reason for the denial,has violated the constitutional requirement that n o person be deprived of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.amdt.
in my view,din should prevail on this constitutional claim.she possesses the kind of liberty interest to which the due process clause grants procedural protection.and the government has failed to provide her with the procedure that is constitutionally due.see swarthout cooke,per curiam setting forth the court inquiry for procedural due process claims.accordingly,i would affirm the judgment of the ninth circuit.
the plurality opinion which is not controlling concludes that din lacks the kind of liberty interest to which the due process clause provides procedural protections.ante,at.justice kennedy opinion assum es that din possesses that kind of liberty interest.ante,at opinion concurring in judgment emphasis added.i agree with justice kennedy assumption.more than that,i believe that din possesses that kind of constitutional interest.
the liberty interest that din seeks to protect consists of her freedom to live together with her husband in the united states.she seeks procedural,not substantive,protection for this freedom.compare wilkinson austin,due process clause requires compliance with fair procedures when the government deprives an individual of certain liberty or property interests,with reno flores,due process clause limits the extent to which government can substantively regulate certain fundamental rights,no matter what process is provided smith organization of foster families for equality reform,liberty interests arising under the constitution for procedural due process purposes are not the same as fundamental rights requiring substantive due process protection.
our cases make clear that the due process clause entitles her to such procedural rights as long as she seeks protection for a liberty interest sufficiently important for procedural protection to flow implicit ly from the design,object,and nature of the due process clause,or nonconstitutional law a statute,for example creates an expectation that a person will not be deprived of that kind of liberty without fair procedures.wilkinson,supra,at.
the liberty for which din seeks protection easily satisfies both standards.as this court has long recognized,the institution of marriage,which encompasses the right of spouses to live together and to raise a family,is central to human life,requires and enjoys community support,and plays a central role in most individuals orderly pursuit of happiness,meyer nebraska.see also,griswold connecticut,zablocki redhail,moore east cleveland,plurality opinion smith,supra,at.similarly,the court has long recognized that a citizen right to live within this country,being fundamental,enjoys basic procedural due process protection.see ng fung ho white,baumgartner united states.
at the same time,the law,including visa law,surrounds marriage with a host of legal protections to the point that it creates a strong expectation that government will not deprive married individuals of their freedom to live together without strong reasons and in individual cases without fair procedure.turner safley,noting various legal benefits of marriage b a i special visa preference for spouse of an american citizen.justice scalia response that nonconstitutional law creates an expectation that merits procedural protection under the due process clause only if there is an unequivocal statutory right,ante,at is sorely mistaken.his argument rests on the distinction that this court rejected almost five decades ago,in the seminal case of goldberg kelly.see generally board of regents of state colleges roth,t he court has fully and finally rejected the wooden distinction between rights and privileges that once seemed to govern the applicability of procedural due process rights at in a constitution for a free people,there can be no doubt that the meaning of liberty must be broad indeed 
justice scalia more general response claiming that i have created a new category of constitutional rights,ante,at misses the mark.i break no new ground here.rather,this court has already recognized that the due process clause guarantees that the government will not,without fair procedure,deprive individuals of a host of rights,freedoms,and liberties that are no more important,and for which the state has created no greater expectation of continued benefit,than the liberty interest at issue here.see,wolff mcdonnell,prisoner right to maintain goodtime credits shortening term of imprisonment procedurally protected liberty interest based on nonconstitutional law paul davis,right to certain aspects of reputation procedurally protected liberty interest arising under the constitution goss lopez,student right not to be suspended from school class procedurally protected liberty interest arising under the constitution vitek jones,prisoner right against involuntary commitment procedurally protected liberty interest arising under the constitution washington harper,mentally ill prisoner right not to take psychotropic drugs procedurally protected liberty interest arising under the constitution see generally goldberg,supra,at right to welfare benefits procedurally protected property interest based on nonconstitutional law.but ante,at plurality opinion making what i believe are unsuccessful efforts to distinguish these cases.how could a constitution that protects individuals against the arbitrary deprivation of so diverse a set of interests not also offer some form of procedural protection to a citizen threatened with governmental deprivation of her freedom to live together with her spouse in america as compared to reputational harm,for example,how is din liberty interest any less worthy of due process protections 
the more difficult question is the nature of the procedural protection required by the constitution.after all,sometimes,as with the military draft,the law separates spouses with little individualized procedure.and sometimes,as with criminal convictions,the law provides procedure to one spouse but not to the other.unlike criminal convictions,however,neither spouse here has received any procedural protection.ingraham wright,availability of alternative procedures can satisfy due process.compare shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei,no due process protections for aliens outside united states,with zadvydas davis,such protections are available for aliens inside united states.and,unlike the draft justified by a classic military threat,the deprivation does not apply similarly to hundreds of thousands of american families.investment state bd.of equalization of.
rather,here,the government makes individualized visa determinations through the application of a legal rule to particular facts.individualized adjudication normally calls for the ordinary application of due process clause procedures.londoner city and county of denver.and those procedures normally include notice of an adverse action,an opportunity to present relevant proofs and arguments,before a neutral decisionmaker,and reasoned decisionmaking.see hamdi rumsfeld,plurality opinion see also friendly,some kind of a hearing.these procedural protections help to guarantee that government will not make a decision directly affecting an individual arbitrarily but will do so through the reasoned application of a rule of law.it is that rule of law,stretching back at least years to magna carta,which in major part the due process clause seeks to protect.hurtado california.
here,we need not consider all possible procedural due process elements.rather we consider only the minimum procedure that din has requested namely,a statement of reasons,some kind of explanation,as to why the state department denied her husband a visa.
we have often held that this kind of statement,permitting an individual to understand why the government acted as it did,is a fundamental element of due process.see,goldberg,at perry sindermann,morrissey brewer,wolff,supra,at goss,supra,at mathews eldridge,cleveland bd.of ed.loudermill,wilkinson,at hamdi,supra,at plurality opinion.
that is so in part because a statement of reasons,even one provided after a visa denial,serves much the same function as a notice of a proposed action.it allows din,who suffered a serious loss,a fair opportunity to meet the case that has produced separation from her husband.see joint refugee comm.mcgrath,frankfurter,concurring see also hamdi,supra,at plurality opinion wolff,supra,at friendly,supra,at notice must provide the grounds for the relevant action.properly apprised of the grounds for the government action,din can then take appropriate action whether this amounts to an appeal,internal agency review,or as is likely here an opportunity to submit additional evidence and obtain reconsideration,cfr e.
i recognize that our due process cases often determine the constitutional insistence upon a particular procedure by balancing,with respect to that procedure,the private interest at stake,the risk of an erroneous deprivation absent the protection,and the government interest in not providing additional procedure.eldridge,supra,at but hamdi,supra,at plurality opinion suggesting minimal due process requirements can not be balanced away.here balancing would not change the result.the private interest is important,the risk of an erroneous deprivation is significant,and the government interest in not providing a reason is normally small,at least administratively speaking.indeed,congress requires the state department to provide a reason for a visa denial in most contexts.b.accordingly,in the absence of some highly unusual circumstance not shown to be present here,see infra,at,the constitution requires the government to provide an adequate reason why it refused to grant din husband a visa.that reason,in my view,could be either the factual basis for the government decision or a sufficiently specific statutory subsection that conveys effectively the same informatio
