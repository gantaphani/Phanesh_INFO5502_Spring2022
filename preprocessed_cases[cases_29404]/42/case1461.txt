opinion of the court 
in this appeal we consider the question of whether a conviction for filing a false tax return,in violation of of the internal revenue code,is an aggravated felony as defined by section a m i of the immigration and naturalization act,a m i.we conclude that it is not,and,therefore,that the petitioners convictions do not render them removable.accordingly,we will grant the petition for review of the decision and vacate the order of removal against the petitioners.
background 
the relevant facts are not complicated.the petitioners,ki se lee and hyang mahn yang,are husband and wife.they are both natives and citizens of korea,but they have resided in the united states as lawful permanent residents since the they have grown children who are united states citizens.
for many years,the petitioners operated a dry cleaning business in philadelphia.in may,they pled guilty to a information,which charged them with filing false income tax returns for,and,all in violation of the information further alleged that,in the three tax years at issue,petitioners understated their income by,causing a tax deficiency of.departing downward substantially,each petitioner was sentenced to three years probation,a condition of which was three months home confinement,with permission to leave for work,medical services,one hundred hours of community service,and the payment of all taxes,interest and penalties due to the irs ar.
thereafter,in november,the ins charged petitioners with being removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,as defined by section a m i and ii of the immigration and naturalization act.see a m.section a m includes in the felonies classified as aggravated for purposes of deportation 
an offense that 
i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds or 
ii is described in of the internal revenue code of related to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds 
a m i ii.the petitioners moved to terminate removal proceedings on the ground that a conviction for violating section of the internal revenue code was not an aggravated felony under either subsection m i or m ii.the immigration judge denied their motion,ruling in july that petitioners convictions rendered them removable under either subsection.app.he ordered each petitioner removed to the republic of south korea.app.
on december,the board of immigration appeals affirmed the immigration judge decision without opinion,making it the final agency decision.see e.the petitioners seek review.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the petitioners challenge the immigration judge order of removal on the ground that their convictions for violating do not qualify as aggravated felonies under either a m i or ii,and,therefore,that they are not removable pursuant to a a iii as the government now concedes that subsection m ii does not apply,we need only consider whether the petitioners convictions meet the definition of aggravated felony in subsection m i.
jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,we consider the government contention that under a c we lack jurisdiction to review the petitioners order of removal.that provision states that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a a iii.as recently explained,however,this provision comes into play only when two facts exist the petitioner is an alien who is deportable by reason of having been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses.drakes zimski,cir.we necessarily have jurisdiction to determine whether these jurisdictional facts are present.see valansi ashcroft,cir.we are thus not precluded from reviewing the petitioners argument that they have not been convicted of an enumerated offense.if the petitioners are right,judicial review of the removal orders is not precluded,and they will be vacated for failing to allege a removable offense.if the petitioners are wrong,we lack jurisdiction to inquire any further into the merits,and the removal order will stand.
have the petitioners been convicted of an aggravated felony 
the petitioners argue that no conviction under section for filing false tax returns can satisfy the definition of aggravated felony in a m i.we apply de novo review to this purely legal question of statutory interpretation that governs our own jurisdiction.see valansi,at.
the first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.id.at quoting marshak treadwell,cir.if the statutory meaning is clear,our inquiry is at an end.id.if the statutory meaning is not clear,we must try to discern congress intent using the ordinary tools of statutory construction.see ins,d.if,by employing traditional tools of statutory construction,we determine that congress intent is clear,that is the end of the matter.valansi,at quoting bell reno,cir.if we are unable to discern congress intent using the normal tools of statutory construction,we will generally give deference to the board interpretation,so long as it is reasonable.id.
we thus begin our analysis with the statutory language of subsection m i.it may be argued that the petitioners convictions under section for filing false tax returns clearly involve fraud and deceit,as required by subsection m i,and that we need look no further.however,the precise question before us is whether the statutory language makes it plain and unambiguous that subsection m i covers convictions for violating section.this question can not be answered solely by looking at the language itself we must also be cognizant of the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.id.at united states bank of oregon independent ins.agents of america,d a statute plain meaning must be enforced,of course,and the meaning of a statute will typically heed the commands of its punctuation.but a purported analysis based only on punctuation is necessarily incomplete and runs the risk of distorting a statute true meaning.along with punctuation,text consists of words living a communal existence,in judge learned hand phrase,the meaning of each word informing the others and all in their aggregate tak ing their purport from the setting in which they are used.over and over we have stressed that i n expounding a statute,we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.internal citations and quotations omitted.
here,these broader considerations,specifically the presence of subsection m ii,preclude a conclusion that the statutory language of subsection m i clearly and unambiguously covers a section conviction.subsections m i and m ii were enacted simultaneously in.subsection m i has a general gamut of state and federal crimes involving fraud and deceit causing losses over.subsection m ii zeroes in on the crime of federal tax evasion,as described in section of the internal revenue code,it is silent about any other criminal tax offenses.gross examination of m leaves obvious questions why does subsection m include both a general provision encompassing fraud and deceit and specific provision directed solely at the offense of federal tax evasion if subsection m i applies to tax offenses,what is the purpose of subsection m ii does the juxtaposition of subsections m i and m ii signal an intent to exclude other tax offenses from the definition of aggravated felonies in m i that subsection m i raises these questions demonstrates that its language does not have a plain and unambiguous meaning,at least not as applied to a conviction under section of the internal revenue code therefore,we must turn to the traditional tools of statutory construction to see if they assist in discerning congress intent.
we start with the principle that if at all possible,we should adopt a construction which recognizes each element of the statute.see acceptance ins.sloan,cir recognizing that it is an axiom of statutory construction that whenever possible each word in a statutory provision is to be given meaning and not to be treated as surplusage internal quotations omitted.the only construction that satisfies this principle is the one suggested by the petitioners that subsection m i does not apply to tax offenses.if the government proposed construction were adopted,and we were to hold that any tax offense involving fraud and deceit over was an aggravated felony under subsection m i,subsection m ii would be mere surplusage.we have considered the government contention that there could be a case where a conviction for tax evasion would not involve fraud or deceit,in which case subsection m ii would exist simply to catch any cases not covered by subsection m i,but the government has not identified,and we are unable to envision,what that case might be.indeed,in addressing what conduct might constitute tax evasion under section,the supreme court has stated that an affirmative willful attempt to evade may be inferred from any conduct,the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.spies united states.emphasis added.accordingly,the goal of avoiding surplusage in construing a statute is satisfied only if subsection m i does not apply to tax offenses.
another commonplace rule of statutory construction is that the specific governs the general.doe national bd.of medical examiners,cir quoting morales trans world airlines,d see also fourco glass transmirra products,d the law is settled that however inclusive may be the general language of a statute,it will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment,quoted in doe national bd.of medical examiners,at.as explained by the supreme court,where congress includes particular language in one section of the statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion,at.see also albright oliver,d.moreover,t his principle has special force when congress has targeted specific problems with specific solutions in the context of a general statute.doe national bd.of medical examiners,at.and it applies particularly when the two provisions are interrelated and closely positioned,both in fact being parts of the same statutory scheme.id.internal quotations omitted.
the statutory section at issue here is a perfect example of this phenomenon.subsections m i and m ii were adopted at the same time,appear adjacent to each other,and are the only two parts of subsection m,within a statute with many,many subsections.subsection m i is a general provision covering fraud and deceit subsection m ii is a very specific provision that only applies to federal tax evasion.accordingly,the principle that the specific governs the general also favors the interpretation that subsection m ii identifies the only removable tax offense,tax evasion,while subsection m i does not apply to tax offenses 
while the legislative history of the immigration and naturalization act offers no help in discerning congress intent in enacting subsection m i the history and structure of the criminal tax laws persuade us that in enacting subsection m ii,congress intended to single out tax evasion as the only tax crime that is a removable offense.see united states bank of or.indep.ins.agents of america,d statutory construction is a holistic endeavor and,at a minimum,must account for a statute full text,language,as well as punctuation,structure,and subject matter.internal quotations and citations omitted,quoted in tineo ashcroft,cir.
as the supreme court explained many years ago,tax evasion is the capstone of tax law violations.see spies,at.a felony since at least,it has long been recognized as the gravest of offenses against the revenues.id.at.in his opinion for the court in spies,justice robert jackson a former general counsel for the bureau of internal revenue,assistant attorney general for the tax division,solicitor general,and attorney general,after outlining the then civil and criminal penalties imposed by congress to enforce the tax laws,id.at,concluded that t he climax of this variety of sanctions is the serious and inclusive felony,defined to consist of a willful attempt in any manner to evade or defeat the tax,id.at.emphasis added.thus,for congress to select tax evasion as the aggravated tax felony,justifying removal of an alien who committed it,while sparing lesser tax felons,is thoroughly consistent with the history and structure of criminal tax offenses.
in the end,after considering various tools of statutory construction,we believe that congress intent is clear in enacting subsection m ii,it intended to specify tax evasion as the only deportable tax offense it follows that it did not intend subsection m i to cover tax offenses to the extent that any ambiguity lingers,we note that there is a longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien.ins,d principle is a corollary to the rule of lenity that applies in construing criminal statutes see also ins cyr,d see also valansi this rule of construction may be applied as a canon of last resort to determine the intent of congress on an ambiguous issue.the facts of the present case highlight the reason this principle exists it is a plain fact that in reality neither the prosecution,nor the sentencing judge involved in the prosecution,plea and sentencing of petitioners,treated their offense as aggravated.the prosecution acquiesced in,if it did not negotiate,a plea agreement,and the judge imposed a sentence characteristic of a misdemeanor,not a less an aggravated one however it be defined.see francis reno,cir noting that the importance of this principle is highlighted given the changes in immigration law effectuated by the amendments to the immigration and nationality act.
accordingly,we conclude that the petitioners conviction for violating section of the internal revenue code is not a removable offense under a m i.that decision makes it unnecessary to consider the petitioners argument that the record does not establish a loss of.
iii.conclusion 
the petition for review of the decision of the bia approving the removal order of the ij is granted with directions to vacate the removal orders with respect to the petitioners.
i must respectfully dissent because i believe that the offense of filing a false tax return and thereby causing a tax loss of more than falls squarely within the definition of an aggravated felony in a m i.accord ins,cir,withdrawn on other ground,cir.
the term aggravated felony is defined to include 
m an offense that 
i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds or 
ii is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds 
m emphasis added.
thus,subsection m i sets out two requirements.first,the offense must involve fraud or deceit.this means that the offense must include fraud or deceit as a necessary component or element.valansi ashcroft,cir.second,the loss to the victim or victims must exceed.
the offense of filing a false tax return and causing a tax loss of more than satisfies these elements.fraud or deceit is a necessary element of,which makes it a crime to make or subscribe any return,statement,or other document that the defendant does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter.in addition,causing a tax loss of more than results in a qualifying loss to the victim,the united states treasury.
despite the clarity of subsection m i,the majority concludes that this provision does not apply to tax offenses.invoking two venerable canons of statutory interpretation,that statutes should be read if possible to avoid surplusage and that the specific should take precedence over the general,the majority reasons as follows.the provision that directly follows subsection m i,m ii,specifically provides that the offense of tax evasion is an aggravated felony.this specific provision would not have been needed if m i applied to tax offenses,because tax evasion is an offense that involves fraud or deceit.therefore,congress must have in
