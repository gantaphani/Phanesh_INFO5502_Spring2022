jin,a native and citizen of china,entered the united states in april as a visitor authorized to stay for a month.in october,jin filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal with the department of homeland security.jin subsequently received a notice to appear,charging him with failure to comply with the conditions of his admission to the united states.jin conceded removability,and appeared in front of a los angeles immigration judge in january,where he confirmed the los angeles residence in his application.in april,jin filed an unopposed motion to change venue to tucson,arizona,and submitted a tucson address in support of his venue change motion.the los angeles court granted jin motion.in june,jin filed a second unopposed motion to change venue to las vegas,nevada,including a declaration that he moved to las vegas,and it would be inconvenient for him to travel to tucson for his immigration proceedings.the tucson court granted jin second motion to change venue.
in his asylum application,jin submitted a written affidavit that described jin first encounter with christianity,and an alleged incident with chinese police at a christian family church.jin portrayed the events as follows 
jin was introduced to christianity on a trip to malaysia in june,where he met zhao xiaodong.zhao passed the gospel to jin and told jin the bible story.after their return to china,zhao gave jin a bible and invited jin to attend zhao family church,which met at zhao home.jin joined zhao family church in september,and was baptized on christmas that year.
on november,three policemen broke into zhao house,confiscated bibles and gospel materials,and took jin and other members to the local police station,where they interrogated jin about alleged activity.the police demanded that jin confess the identities of other family church agitators.jin said that he did not know,and the police beat him with batons,and then took him to a detention center where he was confined until november.jin was again interrogated and beaten at the detention center.jin felt dizzy and weak because he was starving.his wife paid renminbi to gain his release.before he departed,police told jin to write a letter of repentance and to report weekly.jin was hospitalized for seven days,during which time he learned that he had lost his job.jin eventually obtained a united states visa.after jin arrived in the united states,his wife,who was still in china,told him that police came to their house and said that they would punish jin severely if they caught him.
jin case was heard by a las vegas immigration judge in july.on direct examination,jin testimony repeated the facts from his application affidavit,apart from stating the date of arrest as november,which jin later said was november.on about his introduction to christianity,jin testified that zhao told me some bible stories and spread gospel to me during his trip to malaysia.jin testified that he did not practice any religion before because he thought there was no purpose,but that the christians in zhao church moved him because they were gentle,kind and gracious.
on about his contact with the family church members after their arrest,jin testified that he was separated from everyone else and did not know what happened to zhao or to the other members.jin stated that neither he nor his family had further contact with the church members after his release because he was under surveillance.jin said that he never heard what happened to the other members.when asked if he was concerned for them,jin said that he could only think of himself at the time.
the government also jin about his residence since arriving in the united states.jin said that he first lived in los angeles,then moved to tucson.this prompted the following exchange 
government do you remember the address 
jin west ina street ina road,tucson.
government is that actually a shopping plaza in tucson 
jin it not a shopping plaza.
government are you sure it not a business named new china super buffet 
jin i do quite know because i do not have any recollection.
jin then testified that he lived in tucson for a few days and left when there were no jobs,noting that his life at that time was not stable.jin testified that he would stay with friends in tucson.the ij requested clarification about whether jin lived in tucson for a few days or for a year,as set out in his application,to which jin responded w ell,i stay there,for about one year but,when there no work there,i return to los angeles.
the government submitted a photo of the tucson address jin had given,as well as documents indicating that the address belonged to a commercial shopping center with a restaurant.the government returned to the question of whether jin had lived at the tucson address and jin said that he was not sure.
jin then explained that he moved his case to tucson b ecause the attorney office said that it easier to have a lawsuit there.when asked directly whether he ever lived in arizona,jin replied that he did not live in arizona but stayed with friends.the government again asked why jin moved his case to arizona when he was not living there,to which jin responded,at that time,my friends told me that i could find a job there,but i could.the ij interjected that jin answer was,and jin then said that he was told his immigration case would follow him to arizona.jin testified that he received the west ina road address in tucson from a friend.when again asked whether he moved his case to get an easier immigration judge for his asylum claim,jin conceded,well,these kind of thoughts,more or less,play as a factor.
the government then asked jin what evidence he had to prove that he lived in las vegas,to which jin responded,well,i live in las vegas.jin did not have a valid nevada driver license,and his expired license showed a california address.when asked about the last time he lived in los angeles,jin testified i live in two places.i just coming back and forth.the ij again questioned jin about transferring his case out of los angeles,and jin confirmed that he sought the venue transfer because his attorney told him that it would be easier to get his asylum application approved in another state the ij asked jin where he spent most of his time living,to which jin again responded that he went back and forth between los angeles and las vegas.when told his answer was not responsive,jin said that he spent most of his time in los angeles,at the address he used to get his work authorization and his last driver license.jin stated that the percentage was half and half because there was no work in los angeles,but also no work in las vegas.jin further testified that if his case was not transferred to las vegas,he would not come to las vegas because he did not know the city.
jin had previously testified on direct that he attended church in las vegas.in support,jin had submitted a may,certificate of membership in the korean evangelical church of america praise church of las vegas,in which the senior pastor of the las vegas church stated that jin attended worship services on sundays and had been a member since july.jin testified that he had asked his pastor to come to his immigration hearing back in may,but his pastor was too busy.because his pastor could not appear,jin had obtained his pastor certification as proof.
after jin admission that he went back and forth between los angeles and las vegas,the ij questioned whether jin was a regular member of the las vegas church.jin in answer responded,well,i told my pastor,i begged her to help me out i begged him to help me out because i told him that what was said on my materials,that i came here around that time period.the ij struck the answer as,and asked again about jin church membership in las vegas.jin then said that he went to church in las vegas for the last two months,but for most of the time he had been at the ch
