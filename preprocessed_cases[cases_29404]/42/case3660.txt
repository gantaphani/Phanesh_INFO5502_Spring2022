carlos zarate liera liera was convicted of two counts of bringing aliens into the united states for financial gain and aiding and abetting,in violation of a b ii and.liera was also convicted of two counts of bringing aliens into the united states without presentation,in violation of a b iii.on appeal,liera primary argument is that the district court erred by not suppressing incriminating statements liera made to law enforcement officers during the time they unreasonably and unnecessarily delayed presenting him before a magistrate judge for arraignment we have jurisdiction under.we agree and vacate liera convictions and remand for a new trial.
on february,at about,liera entered the united states from mexico at the calexico west port of entry.liera was driving a chevrolet pickup truck with mexican license plates.during a border search of the truck,customs and border protection cbp officers found two unrelated aliens,le chen and wu chen,under the truck hood lying in separate compartments located on each side of the engine cbp officers also found a cell phone.it is unclear whether the cell phone was found in the truck or whether the cell phone was found in one of liera pockets during a search.
following liera arrest,cbp officer figueroa interrogated liera on two separate occasions at,about five hours after liera arrest,officer figueroa interrogated liera for the first time.during this first interrogation,liera denied knowing that le chen and wu chen were under the truck hood.liera told officer figueroa that the truck belonged to his uncle neighbor,raul gonzales,and that he borrowed the truck because his truck had two flat tires and he needed to get to work.liera also told officer figueroa that he was an agricultural field worker in calipatria,california,and was on his way to work.
at,officer figueroa interrogated material witnesses le chen and wu chen.neither identified liera as part of a scheme to bring le chen,wu chen,or any other aliens into the united states.
at,officer figueroa discovered that the video recording equipment used in the first set of interrogations malfunctioned.liera,le chen,and wu chen interrogations were recorded without sound because of a battery problem.officer figueroa then contacted the united states attorney office.an assistant united states attorney gave officer figueroa the green light to interrogate liera,le chen,and wu chen a second time.
at,more than ten hours after liera arrest,officer figueroa interrogated liera for a second time.during the second interrogation,officer figueroa asked liera questions regarding the cell phone found during liera arrest.these questions were not asked during the first interrogation.in particular,officer figueroa asked liera if the phone was his and if he was able to access the phone electronic information using an access code.liera answered yes,and entered the phone access code.officer figueroa reviewed the log of received,missed,and outgoing calls and learned that liera phone had received three calls from a phone number stored in the phone internal memory under the name pollos.in spanish slang,pollos or chickens refers to people who are illegally smuggled into the united states.during the interrogation,liera confirmed that the three calls occurred on february and.liera also acknowledged that one meaning for pollos was smuggled aliens.liera,however,claimed that the pollos entry in his cell phone referred to a friend of his who sold chickens.in closing argument,the government referred to the pollos entry in liera cell phone as a smoking gun.
the chambers of magistrate judge peter lewis are located at the united states courthouse in el centro,california,about fifteen miles from the calexico west port of entry where liera was arrested.because officer figueroa interrogated liera for a second time,liera was not arraigned during magistrate judge peter lewis calendar call.instead,liera was arraigned at on february,more than thirty hours after his arrest 
before trial,liera moved to suppress the statements he made during the second interrogation.the district court denied his motion.in particular,the district court noted that the delay that led up to the second interrogation was justified by the need to get recorded statements from both liera and the material witnesses and that the delay was necessary given the failure of the recording equipment.
after a jury trial,liera was convicted of two counts of bringing aliens into the united states for financial gain and aiding and abetting,in violation of a b ii and.liera was also convicted of two counts of bringing aliens into the united states without presentation,in violation of a b iii.the district court sentenced liera to months concurrent imprisonment for each of the two financial gain and aiding and abetting counts,and months concurrent imprisonment for each of the two failure to present counts.all four sentences were to run concurrently.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.the district court failure to suppress liera incriminating statements made during his second interrogation 
the primary issue here is whether the district court erred by not suppressing the incriminating statements liera made to law enforcement officers during his second interrogation.liera argues that any evidence obtained during his second interrogation must be suppressed because of an unnecessary or unreasonable delay under federal rule of criminal procedure a,c,and the rule.we agree.
a.the rule,federal rule of criminal procedure a,and c 
we first provide background information regarding the rule,federal rule of criminal procedure a,and c.
mcnabb united states,and mallory united states,d generally rende r inadmissible confessions made during periods of detention that violat e the prompt presentment requirement of federal rule of criminal procedure a the rule.corley united states,d quoting united states,d alteration in original.federal rule of criminal procedure a states that a person making an arrest within the united states must take the defendant without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge.a.
in response to the supreme court rulings in mcnabb and mallory,congress enacted c.section c states that a confession made by a defendant,while under arrest,shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay in bringing such person before a magistrate judge if such confession is found by the trial judge to have been made voluntarily and within six hours of arrest.c.section c also provides that the time limitation shall not apply in any case in which the delay in bringing the defendant before a magistrate judge beyond such period is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest available such magistrate judge.c.
on april,the supreme court reaffirmed the applicability of the rule in corley united states.at.the supreme court held that if a confession occur s before presentment and beyond six hours the court must decide whether delaying that long was unreasonable or unnecessary under the cases,and if it was,the confession is to be suppressed.id.e ven voluntary confessions are inadmissible if given after an unreasonable delay in presentment exceeding six hours.id.at citing upshaw united states.
here,it is undisputed that liera second interrogation occurred before presentment and beyond six hours.id.it is also undisputed that the delay was not a result of the distance needed to travel to the nearest magistrate,since the nearest available magistrate,magistrate judge lewis,was located only fifteen miles away.
accordingly,our analysis in this case turns on whether delaying liera arraignment to conduct a second interrogation was unreasonable or unnecessary under the cases.id.
unreasonable or unnecessary delay 
we review a district court finding that a delay was reasonable for clear error.see united states,cir.although in corley the supreme court specifically declined to address what constitutes an unreasonable or unnecessary delay,the court noted that delay for the purpose of interrogation is the epitome of unnecessary delay.corley.at quoting mallory,at.
we recently addressed what constitutes an unreas
