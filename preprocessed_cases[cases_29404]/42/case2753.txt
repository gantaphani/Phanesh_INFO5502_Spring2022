this case involves the government repeated efforts to remove from the country a former drug informant who has helped the government successfully prosecute and imprison several mexican drug traffickers at great risk to his own life.guillermo ramirez peyro,a mexican native and citizen,petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia to deny him deferred removal under the convention against torture cat.ramirez peyro claims that the bia improperly interpreted one of the cat implementing regulations,a,when denying him relief from removal and that,if removed to mexico,he will be tortured or killed in retribution for his actions as an informant.we grant ramirez peyro petition for review.
this is not the first time that ramirez peyro has petitioned this court for review of a bia decision to deny him relief under cat.the facts of his case are set out in our prior opinion,gonzales,cir,and we recite here only those facts relevant to this particular appeal.
ramirez peyro became involved in the mexican trade after leaving his job with the mexican highway police in.while involved in the trade,he oversaw the warehousing and distribution of large amounts of cocaine and was involved in other illicit activity in mexico.in,ramirez peyro became a confidential informant for the immigration and customs enforcement ice and infiltrated the carillo fuentes cartel cartel,also known as the juarez cartel,in mexico on ice behalf.as an ice informant,ramirez peyro testified that he witnessed mexican police officers murder individuals at the behest of the cartel,saw cartel members participate in many other killings in the presence of mexican police officers,and further witnessed police of those crimes.
based on his observations during his tenure as an informant,ramirez peyro facilitated the government arrest of approximately fifty individuals,including heriberto santillan,a top lieutenant in the cartel.in addition to helping efforts to curtail the drug trade,ramirez peyro provided a statement to a representative of the mexican government implicating santillan in murders of the cartel rival drug traffickers.in that statement,ramirez peyro confessed to his involvement in numerous criminal activities while in mexico.
it is undisputed that based on his work with the government there have been two attempts on ramirez peyro life.one attempt occurred in el paso,texas,and the other attempt occurred in juarez,mexico.following the second attempt on his life,and believing him to be an integral part of its case against santillan,the united states placed ramirez peyro into protective custody in.while detaining him,the government has taken efforts to ensure that ramirez peyro is from the general prison population,and the record includes a list of over individuals in prison who may wish to harm him based on his work for the united states.
to date,the government has paid ramirez peyro approximately for his work.additionally,in exchange for his help,the government has provided ramirez peyro with immunity from prosecution,and,as the government acknowledges,the united states paroled ramirez peyro and his family into the country for their safety.see d a authorizing the attorney general to parole into the country persons for urgent humanitarian reasons.
ramirez peyro testimony from and hearings before an immigration judge ij indicates that there was some discussion regarding a grant of immunity from prosecution in mexico,but there is no written documentation to that effect and there are no details of that alleged offer in the record.in the opinion granting cat relief,the ij stated that ramirez peyro believes that he was promised immunity in mexico regarding his statement to mexican authorities.in the opinion,the ij similarly indicated that ramirez peyro states that he was offered immunity from prosecution in mexico by an trafficking authority there.the ij did not determine that ramirez peyro was,in fact,offered such immunity or the precise parameters of that grant.the ij only determined that ramirez peyro believed there was some agreement.furthermore,unlike the united states,the mexican government has not offered ramirez peyro protection from those who wish to harm him,and the ij found there is no effective program in place that would shield ramirez peyro from harm.
while ramirez peyro was paroled into the united states in connection with his work for agencies,he has never been admitted within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act.as a result,ramirez peyro was placed into expedited removal proceedings when his parole permit expired on january.ramirez peyro claims that ice had agreed orally to give him status in the united states in consideration for his work as an informant,so he was surprised when he was placed in removal.
first hearing before the agency 
during ramirez peyro first hearing before an ij in,he conceded removability.he also conceded that he was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because of his criminal record.see b b iii.he maintained,however,that he was entitled to deferral of removal under the cat,asserting that he feared torture and death at the hands of the cartel and of mexican law enforcement acting on the cartel behalf.ramirez peyro alleged that all levels of the mexican police have illicit connections to drug trafficking and that mexican authorities,including mexico federal agency of investigation,regularly reveal the identities of informants to the drug cartels,which has led to at least one informant assassination.
in addition to ramirez peyro testimony at the hearing,both parties submitted extensive documentary evidence confirming the close relationship between mexican law enforcement,politicians,and drug cartels the frequent involvement of police officers and military personnel in violent crimes ramirez peyro relationship with ice the government concern for his safety both in mexico and while in protective custody in the united states and ramirez peyro role as an ice informant and the resulting threat that he now faces.
on august,the ij found ramirez peyro to be a credible witness and granted deferral of removal under the cat.see c,a.on appeal,the bia did not find any error with the ij credibility or factual determinations but nevertheless reversed the ij on two bases.first,the bia found that ramirez peyro was not entitled to relief because he had failed to establish that the harm he faced would more likely than not be inflicted by government officials or with their consent or acquiescence.and,second,the bia determined that the threat to ramirez peyro was localized.
ramirez peyro appealed to this court,claiming that the bia had incorrectly reviewed the ij findings of fact de novo and improperly engaged in its own fact finding.see,at.we held that the bia had,in fact,applied an erroneous standard of review and engaged in improper fact finding with regard to ramirez peyro ability to relocate within mexico.id.at.we then remanded the case for specific factual findings regarding the plausibility of internal relocation in mexico and the mexican government acquiescence to drug traffickers and those public officials helping them.id.at.on remand from this court,the bia,in turn,remanded the case to the ij to perform the requisite fact finding.
second hearing before the agency 
to address this court concerns,in the ij heard additional testimony and conducted additional fact finding based on the parties submissions of supplemental evidence on the country conditions in mexico and the mexican president attempts to control drug traffickers.in its october,opinion,the ij extensively outlined all of the documentary evidence both parties had submitted on remand.it discussed,in particular,the state department country report on mexico report,which the ij believed evidenced a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and corruption in mexico government,particularly at the state and local level.
the ij noted that mexican police and security forces had been involved in unlawful killings and that there were numerous reports of executions carried out by rival drug cartels,whose members allegedly included both active and former federal,state,and municipal security forces.the ij further indicated that the report provided support for ramirez peyro claim that police were involved in kidnaping,extortion,and providing protection for,or acting directly on behalf of,drug traffickers.the ij also outlined evidence indicating that the mexican president had begun efforts to curtail drug trafficking,its accompanying violence,and the corruption within the police and military forces.the ij determined,however,that despite the mexican government good intentions,the success of such efforts remained to be seen.i n light of the serious consistent documentation submitted,the ij again found ramirez peyro testimony to be credible.
addressing this court concerns specifically,the ij found that internal relocation within mexico was not an option because of the nationwide reach of the cartel and its affiliates,the publicity surrounding ramirez peyro case,and the fact that his return to mexico would be known to mexican officials based on normal deportation procedures.the ij further concluded that it was more likely than not that ramirez peyro would be tortured within the meaning of the cat by government officials or with the acquiescence of such officials.specifically,the ij concluded that while 
the current government of mexico at its highest levels does oppose narcotic trafficking and corruption,there is not a requirement that the head of a government be involved or acquiesce in torture before cat relief can be granted the regulation does not limit what public official we are talking about.it does not require that the public official be carrying out the official policy of the government.rather,this acquiescence language is in the regulation to protect an individual from abuse by governmental authorities,whether they are acting in carrying out the policy of the government or not.
the ij then determined that the program in mexico was inadequate to protect ramirez peyro and that people within the mexican law enforcement community would either harm him themselves or acquiesce in placing him into a position where he would be killed by the cartel.
the government appealed,and on july,the bia again reversed the ij.the bia explicitly found no clear error in the ij positive credibility finding or his other factual findings,but it concluded that ramirez peyro had failed to show that the torture or harm he fear ed would be the result of a public official or officials in mexico acting in an official capacity or under color of law.the bia further opined that,even assuming that public officials did not actually conduct the torture but consented to or acquiesced in the cartel use of torture,the officials consent or acquiescence would likewise not be under the pretense of law.rather,the officers would be following a purely personal pursuit,completely unrelated to the law enforcement powers and responsibilities entrusted to them by mexico.
the bia relied on an attorney general decision equating acting in an official capacity to under color of law,and it looked to case law interpreting under color of law to define more precisely the applicable legal standard in the cat context.see in re,ag.in conducting its analysis,the bia determined that action under color of law will be found where a public official possesses the authority or something akin to but broader than apparent authority to act but exceeds such authority in a given case,even where the excessive nature of the action is so great as to constitute a crime.applying that definition to the facts of ramirez peyro case,the bia determined that,even assuming involvement in ramirez peyro torture and assassination,the officials would lack the pretense of authority to torture or assassinate or acquiesce in the torture or assassination of ramirez peyro because there is no actual or purported relationship between an officer collusion with a drug cartel and such officer duties as a police officer.absent this relationship,the bia found that the officers would not be acting under the color of law in a manner that implicated the cat.
to support the absence of such a nexus,the bia focused heavily on its conclusion that the mexican government had provided ramirez peyro with immunity from prosecution in mexico.the bia stated,notably,the evidence does not support the conclusion that it is more likely than not that an official in mexico would arrest ramirez peyro he has provided a statement to the mexican authorities regarding his work as an informant in the united states and was promised immunity in mexico regarding this statement.because of this immunity,the bia concluded that there would be no legal basis upon which mexican officials could detain ramirez peyro under the pretense of law.according to the bia,any detention or harm visited upon ramirez peyro would thus necessarily fail to be within the detaining officers official capacities.this timely appeal followed.
we review the agency conclusions of law de novo,with substantial deference to interpretations of statutes and regulations administered by the agency.habtemicael ashcroft,cir.
article iii of the united nations convention against torture,as implemented in the united states,prohibits this country from removing an alien to a nation where it is more likely than not that the person will suffer torture.c see generally id.the regulations implementing cat,in relevant part,define torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed.id.a.the pain or suffering must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.id.
the regulations define acquiescence of a public official as requir ing that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.id.a.we have held that the inquiry into whether a government acquiesces centers upon the willfulness of a government,stating a government does not acquiesce in the torture of its citizens merely because it is aware of torture but powerless to stop it,but it does cross the line into acquiescence when it shows willful blindness toward the torture of citizens by third parties.mouawad gonzales,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
in sum,based on this standard,there are two ways ramirez peyro could prevail on his cat claim.first,he could show that public officials,acting in their official capacities,will more likely than not actually inflict or instigate the harm.alternatively,he could show that public officials,again acting in their official capacities,will more likely than not have awareness of the torturous actions of private individuals or of public officials acting in their personal capacities and breach their responsibility to intervene to prevent those actions,whether because they accept the practices or are willfully blind to their commission.
as explained below,we find reasonable the bia legal conclusion that official capacity is analogous to under color of law.we hold,however,that the bia misunderstood and misapplied the parameters of under color of law,leading it to conduct improper factual findings when applying that standard to ramirez peyro case.further,we believe that this misstep,in part,caused the bia to give inadequate treatment to the acquiescence prong of ramirez peyro claim.
legal standard for acting in an official capacity.
to resolve this appeal we must first address the meaning of acting in an official capacity under a.while the regulations do not define the term,as noted above,the attorney general has interpreted that phrase to mean under color of law.see in re,at.as support for this conclusion,the attorney general cited a sixth circuit case,id.at,outlining the legislative history of cat implementation in the united states.see ali reno,cir.that case,in turn,noted that the convention applies only to torture that occurs in the context of governmental authority,excluding torture that occurs as a wholly private act or,in terms more familiar in united states law,it applies to torture inflicted under color of law.id.at quoting message from the president of the united states transmitting the convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,treaty doc,at internal quotation omitted see also id.a cquiescence includes only acts that occur in the context of governmental authority.quoting regulations concerning the convention against torture.
if the agency interpretation of its regulation is reasonable,we can not replace it with our own judgment.miranda ins,cir see also ashcroft,cir the attorney general acts within his authority delegated by congress when he creates and interprets regulations to accomplish his immigration management task.habtemicael,at providing for substantial deference to the agency interpretation of its regulations.we need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction,or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.ashcroft,cir quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
while our circuit has yet to adopt the agency interpretation of in an official capacity as the equivalent of under color of law as used in the context as reasonable,we do so now.accord ahmed mukasey,cir unpublished to prove entitlement to the cat,the applicant must demonstrate that it is more likely than not he would be tortured by,or with the acquiescence of,government officials acting under color of law.emphasis added bankole ins,cir unpublished referring to color of law under cat analysis.we thus consider the meaning of under color of law to outline the parameters of relief available to ramirez peyro under cat.
a public official acts under color of law when he misuses power possessed by virtue of law and made possible only because he was clothed with the authority of law.united states colbert,cir citing west atkins,d see screws united states.it is clear that under color of law means under pretense of law acts of officers who undertake to perform their official duties are included whether they hew to the line of their authority or overstep it.it has been firmly established that a public official acts under color of law when that official abuses the position given to him by the state.west,at.in essence,to find whether an official acts under color of law,we look to see whether a sufficient nexus exists between the official public position and the official harmful conduct.see colbert,at roe humke,cir whether a police officer is acting under color of state law turns on the nature and circumstances of the officer conduct and the relationship of that conduct to the performance of his official duties.absent any actual or purported relationship between the officer conduct and his duties as a police officer,the officer can not be acting under color of state law.roe,at.
this nexus inquiry is necessarily fact intensive,and,in the context of police officers,includes considerations such as whether the officers are on duty and in uniform,the motivation behind the officers actions,and whether the officers had access to the victim because of their positions,among others.see colbert,at roe,at finding an officer actions were not under the color of law when the officer was not on duty,was not in uniform or wearing his badge,did not specifically invoke his status,was not in a place where only officers had authority to be,and did not threaten to use official authority in the future see also united states christian,cir surveying cases and outlining relevant factors.
additionally,the rule does not require that the public official be executing official state policy or that the public official be the nation president or some other official at the upper echelons of power.rather,as we and the supreme court have repeatedly held,the use of official authority by officials,such a police officers,can work to place actions under the color of law even where they act without state sanction.see screws,at.it is because of this that we find flawed the government argument that because the record reflects that the mexican government opposes corruption and collusion with drug cartels at its highest levels,these officials could only be acting for personal gain.undoubtedly,it is not contrary to the purposes of the cat and the standard to hold mexico responsible for the acts of its officials,including ones,even when those officials act in contravention of the nation will and despite the fact that the actions may take place in circumstances where the officials should be acting on behalf of the state in another,legitimate,way.
improper application of official capacity analysis 
the government argues that the bia correctly applied the standard outlined above when determining that law enforcement officers harm of ramirez peyro would not be in their official capacities.ramirez peyro counters that,even assuming the bia correctly determined the legal standard for acting in an official capacity,it too narrowly construed that standard and erred in applying that standard to the facts because the bia determination was based on improper fact finding and a misstatement of the ij factual findings regarding the likelihood of ramirez peyro arrest and whether he had immunity from prosecution in mexico we agree with both of ramirez peyro arguments.
the ij explicitly found that people within the mexican law enforcement community would harm ramirez peyro,and the bia accepted this finding.the ij specifically outlined two situations supported by substantial evidence in the record in which ramirez peyro could be harmed by public officials.first,as ramirez peyro explained,he not only feared that mexican officials would themselves harm him,but he also feared that they would turn him over to the cartel,whose members perhaps including the same police officers would then harm or kill him.the ij found this fear credible and indicated that the record supported a finding that mexican officials could use their positions to learn of ramirez peyro location and reveal that information to the cartel,thereby allowing that entity to intercept and harm ramirez peyro.again,this finding was uncontested by the bia.in an extension of that scenario,the ij also found that because ramirez peyro would be submitted to the normal deportation process from the united states,mexican officials would have information about his only obtainable by virtue of their government,using that information,would make his presence known to the cartel.
as a result of employing too narrow a definition of under color of law,the bia disregarded these ij findings and improperly made its own determinations regarding the nexus between the officers official duties and the harm that they would likely inflict upon ramirez peyro.more specifically,the bia overly emphasized the importance of an official arrest in determining the nexus between the officers duties as government officials and their actions when engaging in harmful behavior.and,as a result,the bia improperly focused on and opined on the likelihood of ramirez peyro lawful arrest 
we agree with the bia that the likelihood of ramirez peyro arrest may have been a factual finding relevant to his cat claim because if the harm to ramirez peyro were to occur under the pretext of a lawful arrest in mexico,then it is likely that the officials actions would be under color of law.see,united states price,d.we caution,however,that a lawful arrest is but one of several possible circumstances suggested by the record that could impart color of law to the actions of the officers who may be likely to harm ramirez peyro.as outlined above,our case law is not so limited,and it contemplates finding actions where there is a lesser nexus between the public official position and the harm that he or she inflicts.colbert,at finding that an officer acted under color of law when his status provided him with access to the victim at the jail and the authority to remove the victim from his cell.in focusing only on the likelihood of whether ramirez peyro would be taken into off
