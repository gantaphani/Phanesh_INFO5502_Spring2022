antchineche tsegaw ayele seeks review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia summarily upheld the denial of ayele application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.the bia affirmed the finding of the immigration judge ij that although ayele was credible and her subjective fear of future persecution was reasonable,she failed to prove her fear was objectively reasonable.we believe the ij did not fully analyze ayele family ties claim because he failed to address whether her family constituted a social group,did not discuss the treatment of her mother and uncles,and relied on country reports to deny her claim despite finding ayele and her witness credible.because of these deficiencies,we grant her petition for review,vacate the bia order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
asylum applicant antchineche tsegaw ayele is an ethnic amhara born in addis ababa,ethiopia on march.the amhara tribe has been associated with the mengistu regime which ruled the country before its overthrow by the ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front eprdf in may.mengistu haile mariam led the former military government,which has been accused of property confiscation and the killing of thousands of opponents since the regime came into power in.when eprdf forces invaded addis ababa in,members of the mengistu regime and their families fled into exile.many were captured by eprdf forces and detained,and many former officials were charged with war crimes committed against civilians during the mengistu administration.
ayele,her mother,yeshibrget belihu,and her two sisters were among those who fled ethiopia before the eprdf imminent invasion.belihu and ayele father,tsegaw ayele,were members of the workers party of ethiopia wpe,which was mengistu political party.ayele also had served as the president of the national olympic committee and senior vice president of the association of african national olympic committee,as well as minister of regional affairs during the mengistu regime since.although ayele did not want the minister role with the government in fact,he cried when he learned of his appointment,president mengistu appointed ayele and he believed that if he refused it,he or his family may have faced punishment 
one april night in,when ayele was,her parents told her and her younger sisters to pack their things because they were leaving the country before the rebels invaded the capital.as she,her mother and sisters prepared to depart on a morning flight to kenya,her father told them he would join them later,but he never did.
ayele,her mother and her sisters arrived in kenya to a very different lifestyle.because of ayele prominent position in the mengistu government,the family had lived a privileged life in ethiopia.they lived in a villa,had maids and a chauffeur,traveled frequently,and the girls attended private schools.in kenya,ayele and her sisters and mother lived on money sent by a family friend in europe.belihu kept the girls secluded and told them to never disclose to anyone who their parents were.during their time in kenya,ayele claimed that they were mistreated by ethiopian infiltrators,and her mother was asked to show her passport everywhere she went.in,ayele left kenya and headed to the united states.sometime after she left,ayele learned that her mother had been arrested in by kenyan officers,who ayele alleges were bribed by ethiopian infiltrators that targeted individuals who had been involved in the mengistu regime.ayele mother eventually was released,and her mom and sisters went to london.
ayele arrived in the united states in september on an visa,which allowed her to attend defiance college,where she eventually earned a bachelor degree in biology.while working on an visa,ayele attended ball state university,where she received dual biology and physiology master degrees.in,ayele filed an asylum and withholding of removal petition,which was denied,but her status was eventually reinstated.ayele fell out of status when she stopped working in december.despite attempts to find employment as an visa holder,ayele did not find a job or an employer who would petition for her permanent residency based on employment.in march,ayele renewed her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.
meanwhile,ayele mother,belihu,gained permanent status in the united kingdom in while in kenya,belihu had become a member of the all amhara people organization aapo,a political group opposed to the government.in kenya,belihu was discreet about her activities with the group,but when she moved to the,she became more openly involved and serves as treasurer and a member of the executive committee of a aapo branch.in,ayele joined a washington,branch of the aapo,called the all amhara people relief and development association.ayele provides financial support to the group and writes letters on behalf of the group to embassy officials and united states senators.
although ayele,and eventually her mother and sisters,adjusted to life in their new countries,other members of ayele family were not so fortunate.when they were living in kenya,ayele and her mother and sisters learned from an aunt that after they had fled their home,the eprdf targeted ayele father and confiscated ayele guns and arrested him.ayele was imprisoned from june to august or september,during which time he was interrogated and tortured.eventually ayele was released on bail,according to ayele,due to pressure from international contacts he made while working with the african national olympic committee and red cross.ayele was never formally charged with any criminal offenses.since his release from prison,he remains under government surveillance,he can not leave the country,and he has been unable to obtain a job,despite his efforts to find employment.his extended family pays his living expenses.
ayele uncle,negussie tegegne,who testified on ayele behalf at her removal hearing,faced a fate similar to ayele father tegegne served as a physician at a government hospital during the mengistu administration.while living in ethiopia after the fall of the mengistu regime,tegegne was denied employment as a physician and was imprisoned because of his aapo membership and his activism in providing medical care to refugees in addis ababa.in september,while attending the trial of professor asrat woldeyes tegegne and other aapo attendees were arrested.tegegne was incarcerated for a month and endured torture and interrogations.he was arrested again in december.the next year,tegegne escaped ethiopia and was granted asylum in the united states.
tegegne was not the only other family member harmed by the ethiopian government.tegegne testified that ayele other uncle,yigremachew belihu,who is the biological brother of ayele mother,disappeared in october,never to be heard from again tegegne also testified that his brother,a school principal,was killed by oromo nationalists because the government instigated animosity against ethnic amharas,and another of tegegne friends was killed after the government accused him of being part of a rebel group.
after reviewing documentary evidence and hearing testimony from ayele and tegegne during a removal hearing held on august,the ij denied ayele renewed asylum,withholding of removal and cat application in a decision dated june.the ij found both ayele and her uncle to be credible,but determined that ayele did not sufficiently demonstrate that her fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable given the current country conditions.on january,the bia affirmed,without opinion,the ij decision and allowed ayele to voluntarily depart the united states.ayele petitions for review of the bia decision ordering her removal 
ii.analysis 
we review directly the ij decision where,as here,the bia summarily affirms the decision of the ij without opinion.balliu gonzales,cir.our review is one of deference.musollari mukasey,cir.we review to see if the determination was supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ogayonne mukasey,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.to reverse a bia decision,the petitioner must show that the evidence compels,not merely supports,a different result.id.
asylum claim 
the immigration and nationality act ina defines a refugee as someone who is unable or unwilling to return to her homeland because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see a a see also musollari,at the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to an alien refugee.refugee status can be proven through past persecution or fear of future persecution.id.an applicant who demonstrates past persecution is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.ingmantoro mukasey,cir.without evidence of past persecution,an applicant must demonstrate a fear of future persecution.id.at.the applicant must satisfy both the objective and subjective prongs of the fear standard.id.at.
ayele admits that the government never personally persecuted her,so to succeed on her asylum petition she must show a fear of future persecution.based on ayele credible testimony,the ij found that ayele established a subjective fear of future persecution.thus,only the objective component remains at issue.see bolante mukasey,cir reviewing court should not ordinarily disturb credibility finding.while the subjective component often depends upon the applicant own credibility and testimony,the objective prong requires evidence that there is a reasonable probability that the applicant will be singled out individually for persecution or that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of an identifiable group,to which the applicant demonstrates he belongs,such that the applicant fear is reasonable.capric ashcroft,cir internal citations omitted.to be objectively reasonable,an applicant must show only that persecution is a reasonable possibility,not that persecution is definite or even likely.see ahmed ashcroft,cir see also kllokoqi gonzales,cir the applicant may establish a reasonable possibility of future persecution by showing that there is even a percent chance that he will be shot,tortured,or otherwise persecuted.an asylum applicant must show a nexus between her fear of future persecution and one of the five protected grounds race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.torres mukasey,cir see also a a.
ayele presents three grounds for her asylum claim her amhara ethnicity her involvement in the aapo political organization and her family as a social group.first,she contends that because she is an ethnic amhara,she fears future persecution because of the current government disdain for amhara people.the ij denied ayele ethnicity claim based on state department country reports demonstrating that ethnic amharas currently thrive in ethiopia and specifically pointed to a country report indicating that amharas serve in the executive cabinet of the current government.ayele argues that although members of the current administration have amharic names,they are not ethnic amharas.during the removal proceedings,ayele uncle,tegegne explained that ethnic amharas are easily identified based on their accent.second,ayele maintains that she fears persecution based on her political opinion because if she returned to ethiopia she would continue her involvement with the aapo and would not remain silent.in his decision,the ij pointed to country reports indicating that aapo members are not being targeted by the government.
we can not say that the record compels the conclusion that ayele fear of future persecution on the account of her ethnicity or political opinion is objectively reasonable.the ij pointed to case law and country reports explaining why he believed ayele fear of future persecution based on her ethnicity and political opinion was unfounded.he explained that amharas serve in government positions and that as long as political opposition groups denounce violence,the government will not harm them.he further concluded that ayele had not proven she will be singled out from other amharas and aapo members.see chatta mukasey,cir.the ij provided reasoned analysis that is supported by substantial evidence.see medhin ashcroft,cir.therefore,we can not reverse the bia decision on these grounds.
ayele argument that she may face persecution if she returns to ethiopia because of her family ties fares better than her other two grounds.ayele made it apparent in her asylum application and in her attorney closing argument before the ij that she feared persecution on account of the treatment of her family and her family prominent position in the mengistu regime.
nonetheless the ij failed to fully analyze ayele claim that she may face persecution on account of her familial ties.even the government concedes that the ij wholly failed to discuss whether a family can constitute a social group.the only reference to ayele family in the ij analysis was the following 
in addition,if the government desired to target the respondent because she is the daughter of a former minister in the mengistu regime,or because she is amhara,it would stand to reason that the government would also seek to persecute the respondent father.however,based on the respondent own testimony,since her father release in,he has not been physically harmed,rather,only placed under surveillance.thus,the fact that the respondent father has been living in ethiopia relatively unharmed for over a decade after her departure significantly diminishes her claim of future persecution.
this cursory explanation causes us to question whether the ij fully considered ayele familial ties claim.see ins,cir remand required because unclear whether claim fully understood or analyzed.indeed,it seems that the ij was merely using the treatment of ayele father to show that she would not be singled out because of her ethnicity or political opinion,rather than as an analysis of whether ayele would face persecution based on her family history.there is no reference in the ij opinion to ayele fears that she will be specifically targeted because her mother,a political activist,lives abroad and outside of the government reach.moreover,despite finding ayele and her uncle credible,the ij failed to discuss the past treatment of ayele two uncles.see sosnovskaia gonzales,cir determining that the ij erroneously failed to discuss arguments and evidence presented.
our circuit recognizes a family as a cognizable social group under the ina,see torres,at citing iliev ins,cir,as do our sister circuits.see,jie lin ashcroft,cir gebremichael ins,cir there can,in fact,be no plainer example of a social group based on common,identifiable and immutable characteristics than that of the nuclear family.without even a mention of this principle in the ij opinion,we can not know for certain that he assessed this ground for ayele asylum request.see,at.
every member of ayele immediate family either is in exile,has disappeared,has been imprisoned and tortured,or is under house arrest her father was a prominent member of the mengistu regime,and her mother is an aapo activist.during her removal proceedings,ayele uncle testified that her family name was recognizable and that people would realize her father was a minister in the mengistu administration.her mother,and her uncle who was imprisoned and tortured based on his political activism,are outside of the reach of the government,making ayele particularly vulnerable.see mema gonzales,cir oft times persecutors target children of political dissidents not because they have imputed the parents political opinion to the children,but as a means of harassing,intimidating,and influencing the behavior of the parent.the ij failed to discuss any of this evidence in light of ayele claim.
as noted earlier,an asylum applicant can establish a fear of persecution by proving either a pattern or practice of persecution of a social group,of which the applicant has proven she is a member,or by proving the applicant will be singled out personally.b iii.the regulation states
