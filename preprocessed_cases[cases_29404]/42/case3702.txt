background 
in,as part of the immigration reform and control act irca,congress enacted the special agricultural workers program saw,a amnesty program to stabilize the agricultural workforce by legalizing undocumented aliens already working in agriculture.see.through the saw program,an alien who had resided in the united states and performed seasonal agricultural services for at least during the period ending on may,could obtain temporary legal resident status,which would automatically adjust to permanent resident status after some period of time.a.the saw statute specified that the applications would be accepted during the period beginning on june,and ending on november.a a c.
one of the beneficiaries of the saw program was edmundo,a native and citizen of mexico,who came to the united states in the early and held a number of seasonal agricultural jobs in oregon.he applied for legal status under the saw program in october of,and his application was granted in march of the following year.
in,married a united states citizen,with whom he eventually had two children,both of whom are united states citizens.he was living with his wife and children when he was arrested for delivery of a controlled substance in.he pled guilty and was sentenced to eight months in state prison.the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated deportation proceedings based on this conviction.
on february,was brought before an ij for a group deportation hearing he was not represented by counsel.the ins attorney,after reviewing file,informed the ij that gained temporary residence in october of and permanent residence in december of.after asking each alien about the circumstances of his case,the ij asked the ins attorney whether he was aware of any form of relief available for any of these individuals,and the attorney responded,i do believe so,judge.the ij then ordered that all aliens at the hearing be deported to mexico without advising of any potential eligibility for relief.the ij also told the members of the group that they had the right to appeal the decision by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days.apparently waived his right to appeal,and was deported.at that time,his american citizen daughter was five years old and his american citizen son was four.
subsequently returned to the united states and more than ten years later,in october,was indicted for knowingly and unlawfully reentering in violation of he moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the original deportation order was invalid because the ij failed to inform him of the availability of c relief,and thus violated his due process rights.the district court granted the motion.we review de novo its dismissal of the indictment based on due process defects in the underlying deportation proceeding,see,united states,cir,and affirm.
ii.analysis 
judicial review of a prior deportation order is appropriate in any subsequent proceeding in which the result of the deportation proceeding is used to establish an element of a criminal offense.united states,d.to succeed in such a collateral attack,the defendant must demonstrate that he exhausted any administrative remedies available to him to appeal the removal order,the underlying proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review,and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d.
we have held that where the defendant waiver of the right to appeal a removal order in the underlying removal proceeding was not considered and intelligent,he satisfies the first two requirements of d because he was effectively deprived of the right to administrative appeal and the opportunity for judicial review.see united states,cir.the defendant waiver can not be considered or intelligent if the record contains an inference that the alien is eligible for relief from deportation,but the ij fails to advise him of this possibility and give him the opportunity to develop the issue.id.internal quotation marks omitted,at.as to the third requirement,an underlying removal order is fundamentally unfair if a defendant due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.united states,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the district court held that waiver of his right to appeal the deportation order was invalid because the ij failed to advise him of the possibility of his eligibility for relief under section c of the ina.at the time of the deportation,c authorized the attorney general to grant discretionary relief from deportation to permanent resident aliens who had established seven consecutive years of lawful unrelinquished domicile and had not served more than a term of imprisonment for an aggravated felony.c 
the government concedes that would have been eligible for the exercise of the attorney general discretion but for the legal residency requirement for c relief.it argues,however,that because only six years and four months had transpired from the date that submitted his saw application to the date of his deportation hearing,he had not met the residency requirement and thus the ij did not violate due process rights by failing to inform him of his possible eligibility for c relief 
the government errs by framing the pertinent question as whether was definitively eligible for c relief at the time of his hearing before the ij.aliens in removal proceedings will often not have the wherewithal to make a complete showing of eligibility.ins,cir.the ina regulations therefore require that,where the record,fairly reviewed by an individual who is intimately familiar with the immigration ijs no doubt a reasonable possibility that the alien may be eligible for relief,the ij must advise him of this possibility and give him the opportunity to develop the issue.id.emphasis added.where the record contains an inference that the alien is eligible for relief from deportation,but the ij fails to advise him of this possibility,united states arrieta,cir internal quotation mark omitted,the alien waiver of his right to appeal is not considered or voluntary.see id.we have held that the record lacked an inference of eligibility of relief only when the possibility of relief was remote.see,valencia mukasey,cir holding that the ij did not need to advise valencia of the eligibility for asylum when she did not suggest any basis for fear of returning to mexico.
the record in proceeding raised a reasonable possibility of eligibility for c relief.as the government has conceded,the only doubt with regard to eligibility for relief was whether he had accumulated seven years of residency in the united states.as to that issue,the record,as recited by the ins attorney at his removal proceeding,showed that gained temporary residency in october of when he applied for the saw program and his application was approved.this fact raised the inference that he had been living in the country for over seven years,as he was required to have performed agricultural services in the united states for at least prior to may,at least since february,in order to be eligible for saw amnesty.february,is,of course,more than eight years before the date of deportation hearing.
the likely length of presence in the united states,along with changes in immigration laws brought about by irca and its amnesty programs,made it reasonably possible that in fact had satisfied the seven year requirement of lawfu
