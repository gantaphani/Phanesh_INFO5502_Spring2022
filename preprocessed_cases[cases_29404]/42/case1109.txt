kewen langhorne immigrated to the united states as a child over twenty years ago and has spent the last thirteen years in and out of jail.after his most recent criminal conviction in new york state,the immigration and naturalization service ins successfully initiated removal proceedings against langhorne.after losing an administrative appeal of his removal order,langhorne sought habeas corpus relief pro se in the united states district court for the western district of new york schroeder,alleging that the ins lacked jurisdiction to remove him because he enjoyed derivative citizenship through his father,who was naturalized in when langhorne was fifteen.the ins invoked b,which vests the court of appeals with jurisdiction to review citizenship determinations,and moved to transfer the case to the second circuit.the district court denied the ins motion,and dismissed langhorne petition for failure to state a valid claim of citizenship.
after langhorne appeal was first argued in this court on may,we construed it as cured of various jurisdictional defects,and ordered appointment of counsel to argue the merits.the question presented is whether a conferred derivative citizenship on langhorne by virtue of the following undisputed facts langhorne legally immigrated to the united states when he was ten his father became a naturalized citizen when langhorne was fifteen his mother never acquired citizenship his parents divorced when langhorne was nineteen and he remained in the legal custody of his father after the divorce.the derivative citizenship statute that was in effect throughout these events,a,is referred to here and in the briefs of the parties as section a.it was repealed by the child citizenship act of,title i,a,stat.cca.there is little doubt that langhorne would have acquired derivative citizenship if the cca had been in force.
we conclude that the plain text of section a would have conferred derivative citizenship on langhorne only if both the naturalization of his father and the legal separation of his parents had occurred before his eighteenth birthday since langhorne was nineteen when his parents separated,he did not acquire derivative citizenship.
background 
langhorne legally immigrated to the united states from guyana in at age ten.since,he has committed a variety of offenses,ranging from the sale of cocaine to attempted robbery.most recently,on march,langhorne was convicted in new york state supreme court of two counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument and chose a intensive shock program in lieu of a two to prison sentence.after completing the program,langhorne was detained by the ins,which initiated removal proceedings on september.
during removal proceedings,langhorne claimed that he had acquired derivative citizenship through his father and that the ins therefore lacked jurisdiction to remove him.the immigration judge ij rejected this defense and issued an order of removal.on october,the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij determination based on its reading of the text of section a of the immigration and naturalization act ina.on october,langhorne filed a petition in united states district court under on the ground that the ins erred in failing to recognize his citizenship,and the parties consented to resolution by a magistrate judge.
the ins challenged the district court jurisdiction and moved to transfer the case under permitting transfer rather than dismissal in the interests of justice where the court lacks jurisdiction to this court as a petition for review brought under b.the magistrate denied the ins motion to transfer,and proceeded to dismiss the petition on the merits.
when the appeal was argued on may,we decided that the jurisdictional and statutory issues raised had likely merit.by order,we ruled that the court below lacked jurisdiction to decide the petition on the merits and could have transferred the petition to this court for consideration under b.to cure these jurisdictional problems,we deem ed the petition transferred and constru ed it as a petition for review under b a.as to langhorne statutory claim of derivative citizenship,we ordered appointment of counsel to represent the petitioner and further briefing the panel retained jurisdiction over the petition for review.the merits of langhorne statutory argument were argued before this court on may.
discussion 
as we recently stated in another interpretation of section a,this court accord s substantial deference to the bia interpretations of the statutes and regulations that it administers.brissett ashcroft,cir citing chevron natural resources defense council,d and diallo ins,cir.in such circumstances,where the relevant statutory provision is silent or ambiguous,a court may not substitute its own construction for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
before repeal in,section a of the ina provided that a child born outside the united states of alien parents who legally entered the acquired derivative citizenship upon fulfillment of the following conditions 
the naturalization of both parents or 
the naturalization of the surviving parent if one of the parents is deceased or 
the naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents or the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child has not been established by legislation and if 
such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years and 
such child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent last naturalized under clause of this section,or the parent naturalized under clause or of this section of thereafter begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
a emphases added,repealed by child citizenship act of,title i,a,stat.the ina statutory definition of child has been deleted,added,and altered many times over the last two decades.at the time relevant to this appeal,the term child meant,in relevant part,an unmarried person under years of age.c.
the salient facts are undisputed.langhorne legally immigrated to the united states at age ten.langhorne father became a naturalized citizen when langhorne was fifteen but his mother never acquired citizenship.langhorne parents divorced when he was nineteen,and afterwards langhornes remained in the legal custody of his father in the united states.
langhorne argues that he acquired derivative citizenship through the statutory mechanism laid out in section a for the children of parents who have separated,because at the time his parents separated he was a child of nineteen,an unmarried person under years of age,c,and because the phrase such naturalization in section a,as applied to section a,refers to the simple act of naturalization of the parent having custody of the child.langhorne claims to be the beneficiary of such naturalization because the parent who acquired custody of him was naturalized before langhorne turned eighteen.
the government argues that the phrase such naturalization in section a refers to all of the conditions specified,as the case may be,in sections a,a,this case a.under the government reading of section a as applied to section a,both the naturalization of the parent retaining legal custody langhorne father and the legal separation of langhorne parents needed to occur before langhorne turned eighteen.since langhorne was nineteen when his parents legally separated,the government argues he did not acquire derivative citizenship under the statutory mechanism laid out in sections a and a.
the cca repealed section a and replaced it with wording that is more easily construed however,the cca does not apply retroactively.drakes ashcroft,cir.we therefore construe the derivative citizenship statute as it was written when langhorne was covered by it.in so doing,we work within the framework of chevron.
under chevron,we first consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question
