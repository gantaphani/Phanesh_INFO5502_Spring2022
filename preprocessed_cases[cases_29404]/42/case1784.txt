in response to the petition for panel rehearing filed by the government,and having duly considered the response,we grant the petition and withdraw the prior panel opinion,in its entirety and substitute the following 
the defendant juan appeals his sentence of months imprisonment based on his conviction for unlawful reentry of an alien after removal in violation of.gonzalez argues that the district court committed plain error in applying a sentencing enhancement pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines b a ii for gonzalez alleged commission of a crime of violence based on his prior conviction under california law for residential burglary,code west.for the following reasons,we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing 
gonzalez was removed from the united states in february.in,he was found in el paso,texas.he did not have permission to reenter the united states.gonzalez was charged with and pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry following removal in violation of.prior to his removal,gonzalez was convicted of residential burglary in violation of california penal code.because of that conviction,gonzalez presentence report psr recommended a enhancement under b a.this enhancement resulted in a guideline range of months to months imprisonment.the district court adopted the recommendation and sentenced gonzalez to months imprisonment.gonzalez appeals.
gonzalez argues that the district court plainly erred in applying the enhancement because,under this court decision in united states,cir,a conviction under california penal code for residential burglary does not constitute a crime of violence for the purposes of b a.
we review the district court application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states,cir united states villegas,cir.as gonzalez concedes,because gonzalez failed to object to the district court imposition of the enhancement,we review this issue for plain error.see united states,cir.plain error occurs when there was an error the error was clear and obvious and the error affected the defendant substantial rights.villegas,at citing united states olano,d.if each of these conditions is satisfied,we may exercise our discretion to correct the error only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,at internal quotation marks omitted.
applying the plain error analysis,we must first determine whether there was an error.section b a ii provides for a sentencing enhancement for a defendant deported after other crime of violence.the application notes to define crime of violence to include burglary of a dwelling or any felony that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.see,at.the only question here is whether gonzalez conviction under california law for residential burglary constituted the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling under the categorical approach.see id.under this court decision in,it is clear that it did not.
in,this court analyzed the california offense of residential burglary under california penal code,applying the categorical approach,and concluded that it did not constitute the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling under.id.at.in answering the question,the court look ed to the generic,contemporary meaning of burglary of a dwelling,employing a common sense approach.id.at quoting united states,cir.the court reasoned that the california offense of residential burglary was not equivalent to the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling under because burglary of a dwelling,as defined in the guidelines,requires an unprivileged or unlawful entry,while the california offense simply requires proof of an entry,even a lawful entry.id.at.as such,because the burglary offense under california penal code is not the burglary of a dwelling,and because the government concedes that does not have as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force,a offense does not constitute a crime of violence.
acknowledging this court decision in,the government concedes that the burglary offense defined by california penal code does not constitute the enumerated offense of burglary under because,on its face,the california offense does not require that entry into the residence be without consent.nonetheless,the government argues that the criminal complaint against gonzalez modified the entry element of by including an allegation that gonzalez did willfully and unlawfully enter an inhabited dwelling house emphasis added.according to the government,the state complaint allegation that gonzalez willfully and unlawfully entered the dwelling narrowed his california conviction to activity within the definition of the enumerated offense of burglary under.therefore,the government contends that gonzalez prior burglary conviction was in fact a crime of violence under.
however,the government has not demonstrated that this case falls within that narrow range of cases in which a district court may look beyond the elements of an offense to classify that offense for sentence enhancement purposes.this court uses a categorical approach to determine whether an offense qualifies as an enumerated offense for sentence enhancement purposes under.see united states,cir citing taylor united states,d,at.using this approach,a district court looks to the elements of a prior offense,rather than to the facts underlying the conviction,when classifying a prior offense for sentence enhancement purposes,at.however,in a narrow range of cases the district court may go beyond the elements of the offense to make this determination.id.specifically,if the statute of conviction contains a series of disjunctive elements,this court may look to the indictment and,if necessary,the jury instructions,for the limited purpose of determining which of a series of disjunctive elements a defendant conviction satisfies,at citing united states,cir en banc.we have referred to this latter approach,looking beyond the elements of the offense,as the modified categorical approach.see,united states,cir.
in,this court noted that we use the modified categorical approach only to determine of which subsection of a statute a defendant was convicted.at.regarding the california burglary offense at issue in this case,the court noted that california penal code has no subsection requiring unlawful entry.id.in this way,the court in recognized that the modified categorical approach,as applied by this circuit,does not apply to the entry element of california penal code 
the government attempts to dismiss the court discussion of this point as dictum because the court went on to conclude that i n any event,unlawful entry was not a part of ortega indictment or conviction.id.the footnoted language,however,was not dictum it was one of two alternative holdings,and each is binding.see united states wright,cir i t that alternative holdings are binding,they are not dicta.
in light of,the district court erred in applying the enhancement based on the defendant prior conviction under california penal code.
turning to the second prong of the plain error analysis,we must determine whether this error was clear and obvious.we conclude that this error was clear and obvious in light of our decision in.although was decided after gonzalez was sentenced,the error need only be plain at the time of appellate consideration.see johnson united states,d see also united states,cir t he supreme court has made clear that we determine whether the error was plain at the time of appellate at the time of trial.
finally,applying the last prong of the plain error analysis,we conclude that the error affected the defendant substantial rights because there is a reasonable probability that,but for the district court misapplication of the guidelines,gonzalez would have received a lesser sentence,at.with the erroneous enhancement,gonzalez faced a guideline range of to months imprisonment.without the enhancement,gonzalez faced a guideline range of to months.this significant disparity in guideline ranges based on the erroneous enhancement is
