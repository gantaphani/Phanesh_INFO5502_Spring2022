alex rife,his wife yulia,and their daughter yola entered the united states from israel in and remained past the period authorized by their tourist visas.the rifes applied for asylum and withholding of removal.after a hearing,the immigration judge ij denied the application,granting them permission to voluntarily depart the united states at their own expense.see b.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed without opinion.the rifes petition for judicial review of the denial of asylum and withholding of removal.they urge in the alternative that they be permitted to voluntarily depart,and yola rife moves to dismiss her appeal on the condition that she is granted voluntary departure.the government urges us to affirm the agency decision and argues that we lack jurisdiction to extend the rifes voluntary departure beyond the period ordered by the bia,which has now expired.we affirm the denial of asylum and withholding of removal.we resolve the voluntary departure issue in the rifes favor.
background 
alex rife was born in baku,azerbaijan in.his father is jewish,but he was raised as a russian orthodox christian,his mother faith.yulia rife was born in baku in to a russian orthodox father and a jewish mother.they married in.yulia was baptized in the russian orthodox church in.yola rife was born in november in moscow,where alex,a cameraman,had been sent to film the olympic games.the rifes returned to baku and remained until.
in,when both armenia and azerbaijan were republics of the soviet union,conflict erupted over the disputed territory of,an azerbaijan province populated primarily by armenians.violence against armenians occurred in baku and other azerbaijan cities.the hostilities were both ethnic and religious,as armenians are predominantly apostolic christians and azeris are predominantly muslims.many christian churches in baku were destroyed,including the russian orthodox church the rifes attended.in late,the rifes hid an armenian christian mother and her children in their home for ten days.during the stay,shots were fired at the rifes home,they received threatening phone calls,and their roof was damaged by unknown assailants.
in january,the soviet union declared martial law and deployed troops in azerbaijan.when alex rife filmed the resulting demonstrations in baku,his camera was smashed and he was beaten and detained for hours in a government building.a day or two later,the rifes fled to moscow on an airplane carrying russians away from the hostilities in baku.prior to fleeing to moscow,the rifes had applied to many countries for permanent visas.only israel had responded favorably,offering them citizenship and permanent resettlement visas under israel law of return because yulia rife mother is jewish.upon arriving in moscow,alex applied to soviet authorities for permission to leave.permission was granted in june,and the rifes moved to israel.
when the rifes arrived in israel,the government issued oleh certificates and offered a basket of absorption,government benefits available to jewish immigrants.the rifes accepted some benefits but declined others,allegedly because their goal was to come to the united states.both alex and yulia obtained employment in haifa,and the family continued to receive government benefits.however,when yulia declared her interest in attending a christian church,their initially friendly neighbors in haifa insulted the family and threw stones at them,and yola was teased by her school classmates.many students in yulia music class withdrew upon learning she is a christian.the rifes moved and enrolled yola in a new school,where she was more severely harassed about her religious beliefs.
the rifes lived in israel for three years.in may,they received israeli passports.yulia and yola entered the united states on visas in.alex remained in israel to repay israeli government benefits totaling.he then sold their remaining assets in israel and entered the united states on a visa in october.the rifes arrived with nearly,intending to remain permanently,and currently reside in missouri.alex and yulia have had two more children while in the united states and have become active evangelical christians.proselytizing is an important part of their new religion.
the rifes applied for asylum and withholding of removal in november.the ij denied the applications,finding them ineligible for asylum because they firmly resettled in israel before entering the united states,and finding that they failed to demonstrate past persecution or a fear of future persecution in either israel or azerbaijan.because the rifes declined to designate a country of removal or citizenship,and because the ij was unable to determine with certainty the country of which alex and yulia are natives,subjects or citizens,the ij ordered them removed to the country where they last habitually resided,israel,and if israel refuses to accept them,to the country which has control over the territory where they were born,azerbaijan.the bia affirmed without opinion in april.
on appeal,the rifes first argue that the bia abused its discretion in affirming without opinion because the agency misapplied its own regulation.see e.however,the bia decision whether to employ this procedure in a particular case is committed to agency discretion and not subject to judicial review.ngure ashcroft,cir.when the bia affirms without opinion,the ij decision becomes the final agency action,which we must affirm if it is supported by substantial evidence on the administrative record as a whole.see tawm ashcroft,cir.when the agency has denied asylum and withholding of removal,the petitioner bears the heavy burden of showing that his evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.ashcroft,cir,quoting ins,d.that standard is now codified in b b.
the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee.b.a refugee is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his country of origin because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.the rifes argue they are eligible for asylum as refugees from both azerbaijan and israel.
a.did the rifes firmly resettle in israel the attorney general may not grant asylum to an alien who firmly resettled in another country before coming to the united states.see c i b the regulations provide that a n alien is considered to be firmly resettled if,prior to arrival in the united states,he or she entered into another country with,or while in that country received,an offer of permanent resident status,citizenship,or some other type of permanent resettlement.the circuits differ somewhat in the importance placed on whether the government establishes that the country of prior resettlement formally offered citizenship,permanent resident status,or some form of permanent resettlement.see generally salazar ashcroft,cir abdille,at.we agree with the third circuit in abdille that the text of makes this an important factor and,indeed,the proper place to begin the firm resettlement analysis.but in some cases it will not be dispositive.for example,in our only decision resolving a firm resettlement issue,we affirmed the bia determination that the alien stay in spain constituted firm resettlement even though his application for refugee status in spain was still pending when he came to the united states.farbakhsh,cir accord cheo,cir.
in this case,the israeli government offered the rifes permanent resettlement under the law of return,issued certificates evidencing citizenship when they arrived and issued passports in.the rifes argue that their israeli citizenship and permanent visas are invalid because,though part jewish by birth,they are practicing christians.however,although israel has apparently denied citizenship under the law of return to ethnic jews who converted to another religion,the rifes offered no evidence that israel has ever revoked the citizenship of an oleh upon learning that he or she converted to christianity.the record includes a state department advisory opinion stating,it is our understanding,after speaking with the consular affairs department at the israeli embassy in washington,that persons with israeli passports are israeli citizens and may return to israel.the rifes argue that their passports have expired and the israeli government did not respond to their renewal request.the ij discounted the because the passport renewal request was only sent at the ij insistence and made many unnecessary references to the rifes intent to convert others to evangelical christianity.see ali reno,cir,and cases cited.
the rifes further argue that they fall within the exception to the firm resettlement asylum bar found in a.they contend that their entry into israel was a necessary condition of their flight from persecution because israel was the only country that offered them refuge from azerbaijan,they stayed in israel only long enough to earn and save enough money to secure onward travel,and they have no familial,property,or employment ties to israel.the ij rejected this contention,finding that the wife departure from the soviet union culminated in their admission to israel where they were resettled as refugees and granted israeli citizenship,which was recognized by their procurement of israeli passports.we agree.prior to their arrival in the united states,the rifes lived and worked in israel for three years,receiving substantial government benefits,before leaving of their own accord.their stay in israel was not a stopover en route to refuge in the united states.farbakhsh,at.substantial evidence supports the ij finding that the rifes firmly resettled in israel before coming to the united states.the exception for refugees in transit does not apply,and therefore the firm resettlement regulation bars their application for asylum as refugees from azerbaijan.
are the rifes refugees from israel the rifes may not be granted asylum as refugees from azerbaijan because they firmly resettled in israel.however,firm resettlement does not preclude them from establishing that events following resettlement constitute past persecution or create a fear of future persecution,entitling them to asylum as refugees from the country of resettlement,israel.see abdille,at.the rifes argue they are refugees from israel.the ij found that the rifes established neither past persecution nor a fear of persecution in israel.substantial record evidence supports these findings.
the rifes claim of past persecution in israel is without merit.the israeli government allowed them to enter on permanent visas with financial assistance,issued them certificates evidencing citizenship,took no adverse action when they openly exhibited their christianity,and provided israeli passports when they wished to leave.as for slurs and harassment from private individuals,these do not constitute persecution.see fisher,cir.
the rifes allege a fear of future persecution if they return to israel,based primarily upon an bill pending in the israeli knesset that would impose a criminal penalty of up to a year in prison for religious proselytizing.the department of state country report on human rights practices for explained at 
israel law provides for freedom of religion,and the government generally respects this right missionaries are allowed to proselytize,although the church of jesus christ of saints has agreed not to do so under an agreement with the government.a law prohibits anyone from offering or receiving material benefits as an inducement to conversion,but the law has not been applied for several years.in a bill was introduced to impose restrictions on proselytizing including a ban on the distribution of written materials encouraging conversions.a more restrictive bill that would ban virtually all forms of proselytizing passed a preliminary reading in the knesset in april with significant government support.
neither bill is expected to be enacted.christian and other evangelical groups assert that the draft bills are discriminatory and serve to intimidate christian groups.
persecution is the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom on account of a statutory ground such as religion,cir.in this case,the israeli government did not punish the rifes for proselytizing during their three years in israel because they did not convert to an evangelical branch of christianity until they came to the united states.the record on this issue is not so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution from the ambiguous evidence in the country report that israel may be less than receptive to proselytizing by its evangelical christian residents.compare valioukevitch,cir.thus,the rifes are ineligible for asylum from israel.
iii.withholding of removal 
the rifes seek withholding of removal to israel or azerbaijan.removal to a specific country must be withheld if the alien establishes a clear probability of persecution in that country.see b ngure,at.clear probability is a more rigorous standard than the fear of persecution that makes one eligible for asylum.see,at.thus,the rifes are not entitled to withholding of removal to israel.their firm resettlement in israel does not bar the rifes from claiming withholding of removal to azerbaijan.see salazar,at,and cases cited.this issue is potentially significant because,if israel refuses to accept the rifes,the ij has ordered them removed to azerbaijan.
the rifes argue that they are entitled to withholding of removal to azerbaijan because it is clearly probable they will be identified,intimidated,attacked,and possibly even killed by muslim extremists the government can not control.before they fled baku,the rifes were threatened and their roof damaged because they sheltered a family of armenians from the ethnic and religious hostilities between armenians and azeris.however,the ij found that they were targeted for sheltering refugees rather than for a protected statutory ground.the rifes are not ethnic armenians,and they suffered no further harassment after the family left.nothing in the record suggests that the rifes would now be the targets of ethnic or religious persecution because of this isolated incident in.
the rifes fled baku for moscow during chaotic times.ethnic and religious hostilities between armenia and azerbaijan caused the soviet union to intervene,which in turn prompted local demonstrations against the arriving russian troops.alex rife was beaten and detained while filming the demonstrations.he believes the perpetrators were kgb.this incident falls well short of establishing a clear probability of persecution if they return to azerbaijan.since january,the soviet union has collapsed,and azerbaijan is now an independent country.at the removal hearing,alex rife could not explain to the ij why he would be persecuted by the present government for this january incident.moreover,i t is a principle that minor beatings and brief detentions,even detentions lasting two or three days,do not amount to political persecution,even if government officials are motivated by political animus.eusebio ashcroft,cir.
the rifes further argue it is clearly probable the azerbaijan government will persecute them for proselytizing on behalf of their evangelical christian beliefs.though azerbaijan citizens are predominantly muslim,the azerbaijan constitution allows people of all faiths to practice their religion without restrictions.department of state country report on human rights practices for at.the country report notes that n christian groups have complained of official harassment and have been attacked by opposition newspapers for missionary activity,but all christian groups may hold services and conduct religious activities.in an earlier report,the justice department reported that azerbaijan enacted a law on religious freedom in that permits limitations on religious freedom in necessary cases,an undefined phrase.this ambiguous record fails to establish a clear probability that the rifes would suffer religious,ethnic,or political persecution if removed to azerbaijan.thus,the denial of withholding of removal to azerbaijan must be affirmed.
iv.voluntary departure 
at the conclusion of removal proceeding
