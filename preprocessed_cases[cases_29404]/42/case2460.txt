ilya petrovich gutnik is a native and citizen of ukraine who came to live in the united states with his parents as a legally admitted refugee in when he was years old.twenty months later,he adjusted his immigration status and became a lawful permanent resident,the first of many steps on the path to becoming a citizen.unfortunately for gutnik,his path was interrupted by convictions for four violations of illinois law between and.these matters prompted the and naturalization service ins now the department of homeland security to institute removal proceedings against him.when the immigration judge ij,later affirmed by the board of immigration appeals bia,found gutnik removable as charged but granted his application for withholding of removal,gutnik filed this petition for review,challenging both the application of particular removal grounds to some of his convictions and the ij conclusions as to the unavailability of certain forms of relief from removal.
gutnik is jewish,and during his time in ukraine both before and after the collapse of the former soviet union,he and his family were on the receiving end of substantial persecution for their ethnicity and religious beliefs.the family gutnik,his parents,and his younger brother fled ukraine and entered the united states as refugees under the lautenberg amendment.see foreign operations,export financing,and related programs appropriations act of,stat.after the waiting period under a expired,gutnik adjusted his immigration status and became a lawful permanent resident.because the adjustment of status by a refugee operates retroactively,see id.a,gutnik was regarded as admitted for permanent residence as of august,the exact date when he arrived in the united states.this backdating is significant because it enables a noncitizen to seek citizenship at least a full year earlier than would otherwise be possible.rather than waiting years from early when he adjusted his status,gutnik could have undertaken the naturalization process as soon as august,so long as he maintained his residency and stayed out of trouble until that time.ultimately,his parents and younger brother completed the naturalization process and became citizens.
but gutnik had problems.not long after those years passed,he pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia in cook county,illinois.this started a habit of running into trouble with the law.he was convicted of that crime on february.three other convictions followed on may,for retail theft on march,for possession of a controlled substance grams of heroin and on may,for a second retail theft.as we said,these activities brought gutnik to the attention of ins,and in early it served him with a notice to appear for deportation proceedings.
ins ultimately charged that gutnik was removable on three separate grounds the two retail theft offenses were multiple convictions for crimes of moral turpitude under a a ii his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia and heroin possession offense each constituted crimes relating to a controlled substance under a b i and his conviction for heroin possession was also an aggravated felony under a a iii.in response,gutnik disputed the ina characterization for immigration purposes of his heroin and paraphernalia offenses and applied for several deferrals from removal asylum,cancellation of removal,withholding of removal,relief under the convention against torture cat,and a c waiver of inadmissibility in conjunction with an adjustment of status to permanent residency.
in,following a hearing,an ij ordered gutnik permanent resident status terminated and denied his applications for asylum,cancellation of removal,and a waiver of inadmissibility.the ij held that gutnik heroin possession conviction is an aggravated felony under a a iii rendering him ineligible for asylum that the conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia constitutes a controlled substance offense under a b i and that gutnik was ineligible to apply for the waiver of inadmissibility available to refugees under c because his adjustment of status to a permanent resident in terminated his refugee status.at the same time,the ij found gutnik testimony to be credible,noting that he had suffered past persecution on the basis of his ethnicity and religious beliefs and would be likely to do so again if he was returned to ukraine he therefore granted gutnik request for withholding of removal.having done so,the ij declined to address gutnik application for relief under the cat.on appeal,the bia issued a brief order in accordance with the streamlining procedures of e that adopted,affirmed,and supplemented the ij decision.
so as things stand now,gutnik is relieved,at least until conditions improve,from being returned against his will to ukraine.but without a grant of asylum or a c waiver of inadmissibility,his is a limited victory.withholding of removal does not prevent the government from removing him to some other country,nor does it offer him any avenue to regain his permanent resident status.with this in mind,gutnik appeals the bia order affirming the decision of the ij.our jurisdiction is provided by a d authorizing review of constitutional claims and questions of law raised in a petition for review of removal proceedings.the ij decision,as supplemented by the bia,serves as the basis for our review.niam ashcroft,cir.
gutnik filed his opening brief on september.he now admits that all of his illinois crimes constitute convictions under the immigration laws and that he is eligible for removal from this country on the basis of two separate statutory grounds his two convictions for retail theft are multiple crimes involving moral turpitude under a a ii,and his heroin possession conviction is a controlled substance offense under a b i.but he challenges several other conclusions of the ij,as affirmed by the bia.
gutnik first argues that his heroin possession conviction,a felony in illinois,is not an aggravated felony under a a iii because at the federal level that crime is punishable as a misdemeanor.at the time of gutnik brief,this circuit had yet to adopt this hypothetical federal felony approach for characterizing violations of state law as aggravated felonies for the purposes of a a iii.but in achim,cir,we did just that.the government concedes the direct application of,which removes the bar to gutnik asylum claim.we must therefore remand to the bia for further proceedings 
in fact,it appears that gutnik has already demonstrated his eligibility for asylum as we have said,the ij grant of withholding of removal indicates that gutnik established that he is more likely than not to be persecuted upon return to ukraine.the standard of proof to demonstrate refugee status,and therefore eligibility for asylum,see a a b b i a fear of persecution is lower.ins,d.it remains for the government to favorably exercise its discretion in granting asylum to eligible refugees.ghebremedhin ashcroft,cir.
gutnik next asks us to review the ij conclusion that his illinois conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia is a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance under a b i 
any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of a state relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of the controlled substances act,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,is deportable.
the government defends the ij view and points to the case upon which the ij relied,ins,cir,where the ninth circuit found that an arizona drug paraphernalia statute was indeed covered by this ina provision.
we find it strange that under the interpretation of the statute a noncitizen caught with a small article of paraphernalia used to consume a tiny quantity of marijuana could be removable,while a noncitizen actually caught with the drug,so long as it was less than grams,would be in no such danger because of the express exception a b i provides for marijuana offenses.this is not merely some abstract may well describe this case.the ij asked gutnik about his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia 
and where were you arrested at that time how was it that you were charged with possession of drug paraphernalia 
i was in a car smoking a joint,and a police officer pulled up.
this description of the events,if true,suggests that whatever paraphernalia gutnik was caught with was clearly for his personal use of less than grams of marijuana.unfortunately,the record provides no further details about the conduct behind gutnik paraphernalia conviction,and the illinois statute in question,ilcs,does not limit its application to offenders holding paraphernalia that will be used with more than grams of marijuana.
what we do know is that gutnik pled guilty to the possession of drug paraphernalia charge.knowing this,and based on his testimony regarding his conduct,we might deduce that he agreed to plead to the lesser paraphernalia charge rather than face conviction for marijuana possession.yet,under the approach to a b i urged by the government,gutnik became deportable by pleading to the lesser crime.had he instead taken his chances with the more serious conviction for marijuana possession,he would have faced no immigration consequences.talk about absurd results.
but neither side tells us why it is necessary to decide this issue at this time.the ij was concerned with whether the drug paraphernalia offense relates to a controlled substance because of the effect he believed the resolution of that question would have on gutnik application for cancellation of removal.one of the requirements to be eligible for that form of relief is to have continuous physical presence in the for years.see a.under d,continuous physical presence ends when a noncitizen commits a deportable offense or when he or she is served with a notice to appear,whichever occurs earlier.gutnik was served with a notice to appear in,but all of his convictions preceded that time,and the first of these was the drug paraphernalia offense in early.in other words,because gutnik arrived in the in august of,the effect of the ij ruling that the drug paraphernalia offense made him deportable was to preclude his eligibility for cancellation of removal.
but gutnik has since conceded that he is ineligible for cancellation of removal based upon his two retail theft convictions,regardless of whether possession of drug paraphernalia is a deportable offense.beyond that,we can find no other reason why the issue now matters.as we have said,gutnik has already conceded deportability on other grounds.his eligibility for asylum is also unaffected the ij has already held that none of his convictions constitute a particularly serious crime under b a ii,and there is no serious argument after that possession of drug paraphernalia in illinois is an aggravated felony.neither is the exercise of discretion upon review of his asylum application at stake criminal activity is taken into account as an adverse discretionary factor in asylum application proceedings whether or not that activity also happens to make a noncitizen removable.see ins,cir describing adverse factors properly considered at discretionary stage of asylum proceedings dhine slattery,cir seven convictions over seven seven furnish a rational basis for the attorney general exercise of discretion.
none of this is to suggest that gutnik four convictions should outweigh his fear of future persecution if returned to ukraine,his strong family ties to the,and any other discretionary factors that weigh in his favor.it is for the bia to make that determination on remand,exercising the authority given it by the attorney general.see ins,d.but we simply see nothing that will change for gutnik by our addressing this aspect of the ij decision,and so we decline to do so.
finally,gutnik appeals the ij decision that he is ineligible at this time to apply for a nunc pro tunc waiver of inadmissibility under c in conjunction with an adjustment of status.whether or not the bia grants gutnik application for asylum on remand,his criminal convictions render him inadmissible to the united states under a,meaning that he is precluded from successfully adjusting his status to lawful permanent residency absent some form of waiver.see generally.if gutnik can apply for and be granted that waiver now notwithstanding his asylum application,he can immediately try to adjust his status to lawful permanent resident status under a,backdated to his initial date of entry in.this result would also make him immediately eligible to naturalize and become a citizen.
but if he is not eligible to apply for that waiver now,gutnik must hope for a grant of asylum and wait one year before he can apply.if a waiver is then granted,he may adjust status under b,but he will be subject to two less favorable conditions.first,his adjustment of status will be subject to the annual numerical limitation on the number of adjustments for asylees,see b a vi.because history suggests that the number will be exceeded,gutnik will be placed on a waiting list.second,whenever he is finally able to adjust status,his lawful permanent residency will only backdate one year from the date of approval of the application.b.in other words,it will be some time before he can seek citizenship.
eligibility for the more desirable a adjustment requires that a noncitizen have been admitted to the united states as a refugee under.we have already said that gutnik meets the definition of refugee under a.but in order to achieve refugee status,a noncitizen must do more than simply meet that definition.he must undergo an application process,which requires among other things that he have a sponsor,fill out and file a form,and undergo an interview.gutnik went through this when he came to the united states the first time.but the government argues,and the ij agrees,that gutnik formal refugee status ended when he adjusted to lawful permanent residency.
gutnik disagrees.he contends that he continues to maintain refugee status in perpetuity because a contains no temporal limits and the ina and subsequent regulations provide formal procedures by which the government may terminate refugee status,see c,c,and none of those procedures have been undertaken here.he also points to a,which explains that refugees under who adjust status shall be regarded as lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence.a emphasis added.under gutnik reading,the regarded as language says it all after he adjusted status,he was,in legal effect,a refugee regarded as a lifetime permanent resident.once the government successfully terminated his lawful permanent resident status,gutnik simply reverted to being a mere refugee.in his view,the government must take a further formal step,which it has not,to strip away that status.
the government counters by pointing out that adjustment of status under a only applies to noncitizens who have not acquired permanent resident status.id.a c.gutnik may have lost his permanent resident status,but that does not negate the fact that he has already acquired it.the government has also unearthed some favorable legislative history that suggests a congressional intent for refugee status and lifetime permanent residency to exist exclusively of one another.see,cong.rec,describing how new refugee status will end after one year,after which the refugee can adjust to permanent resident status.
where the language of the ina is ambiguous,we will ordinarily accord chevron deference to the bia reading if it is based on a permissible construction.ins,d.the wrinkle here is that the bia decision was issued under the streamlined procedures of e.those procedures direct a single bia member rather than the panel traditionally used to dispose of appeals either by affirming the ij opinion without order,see e,or by supplementing that opinion with a brief order,see e.
here the bia followed e and issued a brief order agreeing with the immigration judge and supplementing his reasoning 
although the respondent was admitted to the united states as a refugee under section of the act,his status was subsequently adjustment sic to lawful permanent resident.the respondent contention that he remains eligible for a section c waiver under these circumstances places him at an unfair advantage over
