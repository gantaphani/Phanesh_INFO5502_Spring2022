hernan hernandez zavala petitions for review of the board of immigration appeal bia order affirming the immigration judge ij pretermission of hernandez zavala application for cancellation of removal.the bia concluded that substantial evidence in the record indicated that hernandez zavala had committed a crime of domestic violence as defined under section a e i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a e i.given this,the bia found that hernandez zavala was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under ina b,b.for the reasons set forth below,we deny hernandez zavala petition.
on march,hernandez zavala,a native and citizen of mexico,was charged with several misdemeanor offenses under north carolina law.on march,he pleaded guilty in the district court of mecklenburg county,north carolina,to the offense of assault with a deadly weapon in violation of.c.that statute provides as follows 
unless the conduct is covered under some other provision of law providing greater punishment,any person who commits any assault,assault and battery,or affray is guilty of a class misdemeanor if,in the course of the assault,assault and battery,or affray,he or she inflicts serious injury upon another person or uses a deadly weapon 
c.this offense covers general assault and battery it does not specifically cover incidents of domestic violence or require proof of a domestic relationship.in this case,it is undisputed that the victim of the assault was a woman hernandez zavala described in his brief as his partner,with whom he resides and shares a child.petitioner br.at.
on march,the department of homeland security dhs served hernandez zavala with a notice to appear.because hernandez zavala had been neither admitted nor paroled when he entered the united states,dhs charged him with removability under ina a a i,a a i.hernandez zavala conceded removability and applied for cancellation of removal 
on february,dhs moved to pretermit hernandez zavala application,asserting that he had been convicted of a crime of domestic violence under a e i.under this provision,a ny alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of domestic violence is deportable.a e i.the same provision defines a crime of domestic violence as 
any crime of violence as defined in section of title against a person committed by a current or former spouse of the person,by an individual with whom the person shares a child in common,by an individual who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the person as a spouse,by an individual similarly situated to a spouse of the person under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction where the offense occurs,or by any other individual against a person who is protected from that individual acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the united states or any state,indian tribal government,or unit of local government.
id.asserting that hernandez zavala had committed such a crime,dhs argued that he was therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal under b c.hernandez zavala contested this assertion,claiming that his assault conviction does not constitute a crime of domestic violence.
on march,the ij granted dhs motion to pretermit hernandez zavala application for cancellation of removal.applying a e i,the ij first determined that the offense for which hernandez zavala was convicted was categorically a crime of violence under,a finding that hernandez zavala does not challenge on appeal.
next,the ij considered whether the north carolina conviction was a crime of domestic violence under the ina.the ij considered the offense of conviction as well as the underlying evidence and found that hernandez zavala conviction constituted a crime of domestic violence under both a modified categorical approach and a approach.the ij thus concluded that hernandez zavala was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.
on april,hernandez zavala appealed the ij decision to the bia,arguing that the ij should not have considered any underlying evidence and that his conviction was not categorically a disqualifying offense under a e i.he did not contest the ij finding with respect to his domestic relationship with his victim.the bia,adopting the approach,concluded that the ij properly found that hernandez zavala conviction constituted a crime of domestic violence,rendering him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.hernandez zavala subsequently filed a petition for review with this court.
the question presented in this case is a purely legal one whether a conviction under a state law that does not have a domestic relationship as an element of the offense can constitute a crime of domestic violence under a e i.this is a matter of first impression in this circuit.
on appeal from the bia,this court reviews legal questions de novo.salem holder,cir.where,as here,the bia and the immigration judge both issue decisions in a case,we review both decisions upon appeal.kourouma holder,cir.this court has jurisdiction over this petition for review pursuant to ina a,a.
under a e i,a crime of domestic violence has two requirements it must be a crime of violence as defined by,and the crime must have been committed by an individual who was in a domestic relationship with the victim.
there is no dispute in this case that hernandez zavala north carolina assault conviction constitutes a crime of violence under or that hernandez zavala was in a domestic relationship with his victim.the only question is whether the domestic relationship requirement in the statute must be an element of the underlying offense of conviction,triggering the categorical approach,or if it must merely be an attendant circumstance of the underlying conviction,triggering the approach.
hernandez zavala argues that the categorical approach should apply,while dhs argues that the approach should apply.under the categorical approach,one need only look to the statutory definition of the north carolina offense to see if it contains the necessary elements of a crime of domestic violence under the ina.if the elements do not correspond,the inquiry stops there.under the approach,the court may also consider underlying evidence of the conviction to determine if a domestic relationship existed between hernandez zavala and his victim.
to determine which approach should apply,we first consider the previous uses of,and the rationales behind,the categorical approach and the approach.we then address the specific crime of domestic violence provision at issue in this petition.we conclude that when assessing whether an underlying state conviction qualifies as a crime of domestic violence under the ina,the use of the approach is proper in determining whether the requisite domestic relationship existed.accordingly,we find that hernandezzavala conviction for assault with a deadly weapon against a woman with whom he was in a domestic relationship indeed constitutes a crime of domestic violence,rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal.
although the categorical approach had its beginnings in the criminal context,it has a long pedigree in immigration law.moncrieffe holder.it is r ooted in congress specification of conviction,not conduct,as the trigger for immigration consequences.mellouli lynch.
under the categorical approach,we look not to the facts of the particular prior case,but instead to whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding crime.moncrieffe.at quoting gonzales duenas alvarez,quotation marks omitted.the court clarified that b y generic,we mean the offenses must be viewed in the abstract,to see whether the state statute shares the nature of the federal offense that serves as a point of comparison.id.
a generic federal offense and a state offense categorically match only if a conviction of the state offense necessarily involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.id.quoting shepard united states,quotation marks omitted alterations in original.consequently,we make no factual inquiry into the particular circumstances of the conviction mellouli.at.this approach is a practical one,desi
