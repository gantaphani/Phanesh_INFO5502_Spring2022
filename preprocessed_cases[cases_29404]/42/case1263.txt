opinion of the court 
in these consolidated appeals,jose lopez,pedro esparza diaz,pedro arrelucea zamudio,and silvestre brito hernandez appellants challenge the constitutionality and reasonableness of the sentences they received after pleading guilty to illegal reentry,in violation of a and b appellants claim that their fifth amendment rights were violated as a result of the department of justice doj implementation of early disposition programs in select judicial districts.section of the united states sentencing guidelines permits a district court to depart not more than four levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general for the particular district.in districts where programs are in place,qualifying defendants have the option to plead guilty immediately,in exchange for the government filing of a motion to depart pursuant to.none of the districts within the third circuit have a program.
although appellants acknowledge that programs are defensible in districts with a high volume of immigration cases,such as districts along the southwest border of the united states,they challenge the reasoning behind authorizing these programs in districts with a low volume of immigration cases and in districts.appellants maintain that programs have been approved in an arbitrary manner,creating a disparity among similarly situated defendants that violates their fifth amendment right to equal protection.additionally,appellants challenge the reasonableness of their sentences.we determine that the doj implementation of programs is rationally related to several legitimate governmental interests and does not violate appellants fifth amendment rights.further,the sentences imposed were procedurally and substantively reasonable.we will affirm the judgments of sentence entered by each district court.
background 
programs were initially established in the mid in federal judicial districts along the border between the united states and mexico in texas,new mexico,arizona,and california.faced with an influx of immigration cases,local united states attorneys sought to manage their caseloads by offering shorter sentences,in the form of a motion for downward departure or some other benefit,in exchange for the defendant agreement to plead guilty immediately and waive appellate and other rights.see generally jane mcclellan jon sands,federal sentencing guidelines and the policy paradox of early disposition programs a primer on fast track sentences.
in,congress explicitly authorized downward departures in programs when it passed the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act protect act,stat.the protect act was part of a more general effort by congress to deal with a perceived increase in the rate of departures from the sentencing guidelines.united states arrelucea zamudio,cir.as such,congress directed the sentencing commission to promulgate a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than levels if the government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general and the united states attorney.protect act,m b,stat.at.in response,the sentencing commission created,which states that,u pon motion of the government,the court may depart downward not more than levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general of the united states and the united states attorney for the district in which the court resides.
following passage of the protect act,the attorney general issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors discussing the authorization and administration of programs.see memorandum from john ashcroft,att y,dep t of justice,to attorneys,reprinted in fed.sent.ashcroft memo while the ashcroft memo highlighted the need for programs in districts with a high volume of immigration cases,it also made clear that there may be some other exceptional local circumstance,other than the high incidence of a particular type of offense,that could conceivably warrant treatment.id.at.as of december,the attorney general has approved programs in seventeen judicial districts fourteen programs are authorized for illegal reentry cases the district of new jersey does not have any kind of program.appellants constitutional argument concerns the disparity in treatment between defendants in districts and defendants in districts,insofar as defendants in districts are eligible to obtain a downward departure as authorized in,whereas defendants in districts are not afforded this opportunity.

office prepared a presentence investigation report psr recommending a base offense level of eight,pursuant to a,and a sixteen level increase,pursuant to b a because lopez was previously deported after a conviction for a felony which is a crime of violence,namely the arson.after subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility,the psr recommended a total offense level of and a criminal history category of ii,yielding a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
lopez argued that the district court should vary from the guidelines range because the availability of programs in some judicial districts but not others creates an unfair disparity.the district court refused to do so,and sentenced lopez to months imprisonment.lopez filed a timely notice of appeal.
pedro esparza diaz 
pedro esparza diaz is a native and citizen of mexico.in,he was convicted in california superior court of a felony drug offense and sentenced to three years probation and three months imprisonment.in,esparza diaz was again convicted of drug possession and sentenced to three years probation and nine months imprisonment.his probation was subsequently revoked in,and he was sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment for the conviction and two years imprisonment on the conviction,to be served concurrently.he was deported to mexico in.years later,he illegally returned to the united states where he was arrested in new jersey in for traffic violations.thereafter,esparza diaz pled guilty to illegal reentry,in violation of a and b.
the psr recommended a base offense level of eight,pursuant to a,plus a increase pursuant to.b a because esparza diaz was previously deported after he was convicted of a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded thirteen months imprisonment as a result,the total offense level was,after a adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.with a criminal history category of iv,the psr recommended a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
at sentencing,esparza diaz argued that the district court should vary from the guidelines range based on the absence of a program in the district of new jersey.the district court declined to exercise that discretion and also refused to vary based on the time that esparza diaz spent in custody awaiting indictment.esparza diaz was sentenced to sixty months imprisonment and filed a timely notice of appeal.
pedro arrelucea zamudio 
pedro arrelucea zamudio is a native and citizen of peru.in,he was convicted in new jersey superior court of drug possession and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment.in,arrelucea zamudio was deported to peru.years later,he illegally reentered the united states.in,he was convicted in new jersey superior court of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.after serving a portion of the prison sentence,he was charged with and pled guilty to illegal reentry,in violation of a and b.
the psr recommended a base offense level of eight,in accordance with a,and a increase,pursuant to b a because arrelucea zamudio was previously deported after being convicted of a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded thirteen months imprisonment.with a adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,the total offense level was and the criminal history category was iii,resulting in a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
at sentencing,arrelucea zamudio requested a variance on the grounds that the absence of a program in the district of new jersey caused a disparity among similarly situated defendants.the district court rejected this argument,believing that our decision in united states vargas,cir,prohibited consideration of the disparity.the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.
on appeal,we vacated arrelucea zamudio sentence because the district court misapprehended its authority to consider the disparity.see arrelucea zamudio,at holding that after the supreme court decision in kimbrough united states,a district court has discretion to consider the absence of a sentencing option and vary on that basis.on remand,arrelucea zamudio argued that the enhancement for illegal reentry set forth at b a is inherently unreasonable.additionally,he renewed his argument that the district court should vary on the basis of the disparity.the district court considered the arguments relative to and the disparity,but declined to vary on either basis.the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment and arrelucea zamudio filed a timely notice of appeal.
silvestre brito hernandez 
silvestre brito hernandez is a native and citizen of the dominican republic.he entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in,he was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,and deported to the dominican republic.brito hernandez illegally reentered the united states in.shortly thereafter,he was arrested,pled guilty,and was sentenced to five years imprisonment for drug possession.while serving his state prison sentence,he was indicted and pled guilty to illegal reentry,in violation of a and b.
the psr recommended a base offense level of eight,as set forth in a,and a increase pursuant to.b a because brito hernandez was previously deported after being convicted for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded thirteen months imprisonment.with a adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,the total offense level was and the criminal history category was iii,generating a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
during the sentencing hearing,brito hernandez requested a variance on the basis that the enhancement to the offense level set forth at b a was unreasonable and that the system created an unfair sentencing disparity between similarly situated defendants.the district court rejected these arguments and sentenced him to months imprisonment.
on january,we summarily vacated brito hernandez sentenced,as a result of our ruling in arrelucea zamudio,because,as in that case,the district court did not believe it had discretion to vary based on the disparity argument.on remand,brito hernandez renewed his arguments with respect to and the disparity.the district court declined to exercise its discretion to vary,and imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.brito hernandez filed a timely notice of appeal.

while we generally review constitutional claims de novo,see united states gordon,cir,constitutional challenges not raised before the district court are subject to plain error review.see.b see also united states olano.we review sentences for procedural and substantive reasonableness under an standard.gall united states.in addition,we review factual findings relevant to the guidelines for clear error.united states grier,cir en banc 
iii.discussion 
constitutionality of the doj implementation of 
appellants assert that the program produces a wholly arbitrary sentencing discrepancy and violates their fifth amendment right to be free from arbitrary sentencing practices.br.of appellant jose lopez at.because the distinction in treatment between defendants in and judicial districts does not implicate a suspect class,nor burden a fundamental right,we determine and appellants concede id.at that rational basis review is appropriate here if a statute neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class,it does not violate equal protection so long as it bears a rational relationship to some legitimate end.doe.bd.of probation parole,cir.under rational basis review,a classification will be upheld if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.heller doe.the party challenging the classification bears the burden to negate every conceivable basis which might support it.id.at oral argument,appellants conceded that they did not raise this constitutional claim before the district court.thus,we apply plain error review.see olano,at.plain error exists only when an error was committed that was plain,and that affected the defendant substantial rights.united states lessner,cir.
every court of appeals to have considered the issue has upheld the doj implementation of programs on a basis under rational basis review.see united states rodriguez,cir united states lopez velasquez,cir united states llanos agostadero,cir united states andujar arias,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states rodriguez,cir united states marcial santiago,cir united states campos diaz,cir united states melendez torres,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states anonymous defendant,cir.
these courts of appeals have identified a number of rational bases for the difference in treatment of defendants in and districts.in marcial santiago,the ninth circuit upheld the program against an equal protection challenge,ruling that the government has a legitimate interest in conserving prosecutorial and judicial resources in districts with large numbers of immigration cases,and programs are rationally related to that interest.at.similarly,the fifth circuit determined that t he current structure of the program is rationally related to,among others,the goals of promoting judicial efficiency,preserving prosecutorial discretion,and limiting downward departures overall.lopez velasquez,at.the eleventh circuit has reached the same conclusion.see campos diaz,at the program is rationally related to the legitimate government interest of conserving prosecutorial and judicial resources and easing congestion in judicial districts with a high volume of immigration cases.decisions of the first circuit are in accord.see andujar arias,at w e find that programs have not been implemented in a manner that is so attenuated as to render the congressionally established distinction arbitrary or irrational.internal quotation marks omitted melendez torres,at noting that prosecutorial discretion and resource allocation constitute a reasonably conceivable set of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification internal quotation marks omitted.
appellants concede that there is a rational basis for establishing programs in judicial districts with a high volume of immigration cases.br.of appellant jose lopez at.the crux of their claim,however,targets the implementation of programs in districts with a low volume of immigration cases namely,in the western district of washington and the district of nebraska.appellants rely on the volume of cases per district and the number of cases per assistant united states attorney to argue that the doj approval of programs lacks a rational basis.specifically,appellants point to statistics demonstrating that immigration offenses compose only and of the criminal docket in the district of nebraska and the western district of washington,respectively.id.at.moreover,they highlight that immigration cases make up of the criminal docket in the district of nevada,yet that district has no program.id.at.appellants argue that the fact that the district of nebraska and the western district of washington have programs,while no such program is in place in the district of nevada,demonstrates that the doj has implemented programs in an unconstitutional manner.we are not persuaded.
the ashcroft memo makes clear that the presence of a high volume of immigration cases is not the only reason to authorize a program.rather,programs may be sanctioned when the district confronts some other exceptional local circumstance with respect to a specific class of cases that justifies expedited disposition of such cases.fed.sent.at.even where a district does not confront a high volume of immigration cases,the ashcroft memo states that this does not foreclose the possibility that there may be some other exceptional local circumstances,other than the high incidence of a particular type of offense,that could conceivably warrant treatment.id.to that end,we determine that the endorsement of programs in districts with a low volume of immigration cases is rationally related to,among other things,the purposes of efficiently prosecuting illegal reentry cases and dealing with demands regarding allocation of prosecutorial resources.if a particular district is to handle illegal reentry prosecutions due to,for example,an influx of cases or a recurring type of case,a program will enable that district to manage its caseload efficiently.the fact that some districts with a high volume of immigration cases do not have programs does not mean that the program is operated in an unconstitutional manner.those districts,such as the district of nevada,may be better prepared to prosecute immigration cases and have no need for such a program.the doj implementation of the program is rationally related to the objective of managing shortages in prosecutorial resources and enforcing the immigration laws,not only dealing with the challenge of a large volume of immigration cases.
the first circuit reached the same conclusion in andujar arias,at.there,the defendant argued that the existence of programs in districts such as the western district of washington and the district of nebraska where immigration cases account for a low percentage of the caseload demonstrated that the programs were implemented in an unconstitutional manner.the court refused to strike down the program based on statistics regarding the number of cases alone.notably,the court reasoned that w hen congress authorized the attorney general to approve programs,it did not restrict the criteria for such programs to the mere proportion of each district caseload but instead allowed the attorney general to evaluate such factors as the number and type of immigration cases encountered by each district and the quality and variety of resources each district could marshal in response.id.at.we agree.evaluating only the percentage of immigration cases obscures the fact that different types of cases may require different types and amounts of resources.id.this is because judgments regarding resource allocation can rarely be reduced to a single variable or calculation.id.at.appellants statistical references do not establish that programs are administered unlawfully.
appellants seize on language from our decision in arrelucea zamudio where we stated that it does not appear to be clear to the sentencing commission based on its limited statistical analysis,nor is it evident to us,why some districts have programs while others do not.at.thus,appellants claim that a n unidentifiable basis for a sentencing discrepancy is not a rational one.br.of appellant pedro arrelucea zamudio at.appellant reliance on arrelucea zamudio is misplaced in arrelucea zamudio,we held that a district court may consider the disparity and exercise its discretion to vary from the guidelines range when sentencing a defendant for illegal reentry.at.the case did not involve a constitutional challenge to the program,nor did we hold that the doj implementation of lacked a rational basis.even if programs are not authorized in an easily identifiable manner,it does not render the doj operation of such programs unconstitutional.to the contrary,our inquiry is limited to evaluating whether there is any conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.heller,at emphasis added.as we have already noted,the doj authorization of programs is rationally related to the permissible goals of efficiently enforcing the immigration laws and allocating prosecutorial resources where they are most needed.
there are several justifiable reasons for allowing the united states attorney general and the united states attorney for each judicial district to evaluate the distribution of prosecutorial resources in enforcing the immigration laws.appellants fall far short of their burden to demonstrate that there is no conceivable basis for the doj endorsement of programs in some districts but not others.having identified no constitutional error,appellants can not demonstrate that the district courts committed plain error by not striking down congress directive regarding implementation of programs by the doj.see united states castro,cir noting that defendant could not establish plain error when no court has held that the limited availability of the departure violates equal protection.thus,appellants fifth amendment argument lacks merit.
reasonableness of sentences 
having determined that appellants fifth amendment challenge to the doj implementation of provides no basis for relief,we turn to appellants arguments regarding the reasonableness of the sentences they received.our framework for reviewing sentences is.first,we determine whether the sentencing court correctly calculated the guidelines range.united states fisher,cir.next,we determine whether the trial court considered the a factors and any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit and factual support in the record.id.internal quotation marks omitted.then,we ascertain whether those factors were reasonably applied to the circumstances of the case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.after confirming that the district court followed the proper procedural requirements,we review the resulting sentence to ensure that it is substantively reasonable.id.we will review each appellant sentence individually.
jose lopez 
lopez argues that the district court committed procedural error by refusing to give meaningful consideration to the disparity.br.of appellant jose lopez at.specifically,lopez insists that the district court simply declined to accept the validity of the disparity.id.at.we disagree.
in arrelucea zamudio,we held that a sentencing judge has the discretion to consider a variance under the totality of the a factors rather than one factor in isolation on the basis of a defendant argument,and that such a variance would be reasonable in an appropriate case.at.in sentencing a defendant for illegal reentry in a district a sentencing court must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented,and judge their import under a.id.at quoting gall,at.we did not conclude that a district court must consider the disparity and vary on that basis.rather,we determined that if a district court chooses to exercise its discretion because it has a policy disagreement with,then it must evaluate the disparity with regard to the totality of the a factors to ensure that the resulting sentence will be reasonable.see id.in fact,we emphasized that our previous holding in united states vargas,cir,that it is not an abuse of a sentencing judge discretion to decline to vary on the basis of the disparity remains viable after kimbrough.id.at.the procedural error in arrelucea zamudio was the district court mistaken belief that it did not have discretion to vary based on the disparity.see id.at.that is not what occurred here.
the district court correctly calculated a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.at sentencing,the district court noted 
l ooking at the arguments that are made by the defense which i referred to before,starting out with the fact that some jurisdictions have a program and that new jersey does not,i do not think that is an appropriate basis to exercise my discretion under a or otherwise.indeed,to do that would be to take what seems to be a rather unique program and make it nationwide.we have an obligation really to avoid unwarranted disparities.i think we be creating unwarranted disparities i do not think that the variance on the basis of a lack of a program would be an appropriate exercise of discretion here.
app.of appellant jose lopez at.the district court acknowledged that it could vary based on the disparity when it stated that it would not exercise its discretion,id,on that basis.in doing so,it explained why it believed a variance was inappropriate,even though it was permitted,thereby meaningfully considering lopez request.lopez argument on this point lacks merit.
next,lopez asserts that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court ignored the need to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary,as stated in a the record belies this contention.the district court specifically noted that the sentence at the bottom of the advisory guideline range is reasonable and no greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purpose.we have a serious offense that needs to be dealt with seriously.id.at.the district court explicitly found that a guidelines range sentence was necessary,taking into consideration lopez background.we can not say that no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.united states tomko,cir en banc.the district court reasonably concluded that a sufficient sentence in a district would not be sufficient in lopez case thus,we determine that a sentence of months imprisonment is reasonable.
pedro esparza diaz 
esparza diaz asserts that the district court committed procedural error in relying on clearly erroneous factual findings in denying his request for a variance to account for the time he spent in custody awaiting indictment for illegal reentry.a district court commits significant procedural error and thus abuses its discretion when it bases its calculation of the advisory guidelines range on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.united states starnes,cir.in that regard,a factual finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing body on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
pursuant to b,a defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences.the definition of official detention is provided in bureau of prisons program statement 
official detention does not include time spent in the custody of the immigration and naturalization service ins under the provisions of pending a final determination of deportability.an inmate being held by ins being a civil deportation proceeding is not being held in official detention pending criminal charges.
bop.esparza diaz was arrested for traffic violations on february.an agent from immigration and customs enforcement ice interviewed him on february.on february,the ice agent returned for another interview with esparza diaz.in the record of sworn statement completed on that day,the ice agent described the matter as in the case of reentry prosecution usc or,in other words,a criminal illegal reentry prosecution.esparza diaz was indicted on june.
before the district court,esparza diaz requested a variance on the grounds that he should be given credit for the time he spent in ice custody from february to june,because he was in official detention pending an illegal reentry prosecution.the district court declined to formally grant the variance,finding that the record of sworn statement did not make certain that esparza diaz would be prosecuted for illegal reentry.the district court noted that while the individual ice agent intent may have been clear,any criminal prosecution would have to be approved by the united states attorney office.although the district court did not grant the request,it did state that it was not going to give him the maximum under the guideline top of the range and that defense counsel arguments do have some merit,particularly the fact that he been in custody for months before this prosecution began.app.of appellant pedro esparza diaz at.
the district court finding that esparza diaz was not in official detention during this time period was not clearly erroneous.aside from the ice agent statement,there is no record from the government to indicate that a definitive decision regarding criminal prosecution was made.because the record does not leave us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,starnes,at,there is no clear error.moreover,the record reflects that the district court did give some consideration to esparza diaz argument because it sentenced him at the bottom of the guidelines range.the district court correctly calculated a guidelines range of to months imprisonment,and did not commit procedural error.
like lopez,esparza diaz contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it violates the provision in u.a instructing courts to impose a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary.at sentencing,the district court expressed the concern that a sentence would not be sufficient punishment after evaluating the specific characteristics of esparza diaz.significantly,the district court noted that it had the authority under the law to vary downward because of the disparity,but i choose not to because of his criminal record and history.app.of appellant pedro esparza diaz at.thus,the district court exercised its discretion to impose a sentence it believed was sufficient,but not greater than necessary.a.because the record as a whole reflects rational and meaningful consideration of the factors enumerated in a,grier,at,we determine that esparza diaz sentence was reasonable 
pedro arrelucea zamudio silvestre brito 
both arrelucea zamudio and brito hernandez maintain that their sentences are substantively unreasonable because the district court relied on the enhancement to the offense level set forth at b a in calculating their guidelines ranges specifically,they claim that b a was enacted with no apparent justification and results in guidelines ranges that are disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense of illegal reentry.thus,they assert,the district court abused its discretion in relying on it.
we addressed a similar argument in united states lopez reyes,cir.in that case,lopez reyes pled guilty to illegal reentry after previously being convicted of a crime of violence.after the district court calculated his offense level pursuant to b a,it imposed a range sentence.on appeal,lopes reyes argued,inter alia,that the enhancement in b a is unreasonable and that the district court failed to independently analyze the potential problems with the guideline.in determining that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying b a,we reiterated that kimbrough does not require a district court to reject a particular guidelines range where the court does not,in fact,have a disagreement with the guideline at issue.id.at.after concluding that the district court engaged in an appropriate exercise of discretion with regard to the a factors,we emphasized that t he applicable guidelines range here is not rendered unreasonable simply because estab
