opinion of the court 
the government appeals from an order of the district court granting andrea duvall habeas corpus petition.the district court ruled that the board of immigration appeals bia erred when it held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not bar the immigration and naturalization service service from relitigating duvall alienage during a different proceeding involving two new crimes she committed.
we do not reach the merits of the collateral estoppel question decided in duvall favor by the district court.instead,we hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain duvall habeas corpus petition.accordingly,we will vacate the district court judgment and remand with a direction that the district court dismiss duvall habeas petition.
the district court held that it had jurisdiction over this habeas action pursuant to.we have jurisdiction under and.we have plenary review over a district court grant of a habeas corpus petition,see yang maugans,cir,and a district court subject matter jurisdiction.see growth horizons,delaware county,cir.
andrea duvall is a native and citizen of jamaica who,in october,became a lawful permanent resident in the united states.since arriving in the united states in,she has been no stranger to crime.in,she pled guilty to crimes of petit larceny and retail theft,and was convicted of another incident of retail theft.also in that year,she pled guilty to three other for retail theft and one for felony theft by receiving stolen property.these pleas did not account for all of the other criminal offenses with which she was charged.other charges were dropped in exchange for her testimony against a.in,duvall again pled guilty to separate instances of shoplifting and retail theft.in the early,she was convicted on two more unrelated charges of retail theft and for possession of burglar tools.
these convictions led to a november deportation hearing.at that hearing,duvall refused to answer questions about her alienage.the service then sought to introduce her application for permanent residence.in that application,duvall admitted her alienage,but the immigration judge ij excluded the document from evidence as the service had failed to comply with local rules,which required that the document be submitted ten days prior to hearing.accordingly,the ij held that the service could not prove alienage and thus ended the hearing.
undaunted,duvall continued her criminal exploits,acquiring two additional felony convictions by following these convictions and after having been informed of her right to remain silent,on march,she offered a voluntary sworn statement with the service admitting her alienage.subsequently,the service initiated new removal proceedings against her on march,charging that she was an alien subject to removal for having been convicted for two new crimes involving moral turpitude,a a ii,and for being convicted of an aggravated felony involving a theft offense for which a term of imprisonment of at least one year was imposed,a a iii.
the ij terminated proceedings on june,granting duvall motion to collaterally estop the service from relitigating the alienage issue.on december,the bia reversed the ij collateral estoppel ruling and remanded for proceedings to continue before the ij.the bia denied duvall motion for rehearing on march.
subsequently,duvall filed a habeas petition in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on june.the district court granted her petition on august.duvall elwood,no,wl,unpublished.in granting her petition,the district court focused wholly on the collateral estoppel issue and held that the service was barred from relitigating the issue of alienage.accordingly,the district court entered an order which directed duvall release from the service.in granting duvall petition,the district court gave short shrift to the question of the court jurisdiction and indeed erred in holding that duvall did not have to exhaust administrative remedies.
our analysis begins with the immigration and naturalization act ina d,d,which provides,in pertinent part,that a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right emphasis supplied.
notwithstanding this provision,the district court concluded,without analysis,that it had habeas jurisdiction under to entertain duvall claim.in so doing,the district court stated that e xhaustion of administrative remedies is not required here and defendant has not raised it as a defense.mccarthy madigan,d exhaustion is a matter of judicial discretion unless mandated by statute.duvall,wl,at 
it is settled that where congress has clearly required exhaustion,mccarthy,at,or where congressional intent is at least fairly discernible,massieu reno,cir citation omitted,exhaustion will be deemed statutorily mandated.
the predecessor to d,which is the relevant statute here,was c section c was repealed in and replaced by the current d.the predecessor statute,just as the current statute,denied review of orders of deportation or removal where an alien had not exhausted administrative remedies.
section d reads,in relevant part a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right d emphasis supplied.
section c states the same requirements in essentially the same language 
c exhaustion of administrative remedies 
an order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right every petition for review or for habeas corpus shall state whether the validity of the order has been upheld 
c repealed emphasis supplied 
because both statutes in their review clauses are virtually identical and because c was the subject of our massieu opinion,we find massieu s analysis and discussion instructive and controlling here.we held in massieu that the exhaustion requirement of c was statutory and thus jurisdictional,thereby barring a petition for habeas corpus in the district court where there was no final order and no exhaustion of administrative remedies.we also held that massieu the provision of the ina under which he was deportable was not provide an exception to the jurisdictional requirements of c because such a claim was not collateral to his deportability and because he could receive meaningful review of his claims in this court after final administrative action.massieu,at.
in massieu,we acknowledged that the immigration courts are not authorized to consider the constitutionality of their own governing statute,but we were persuaded by the fact that exhaustion could well resolve any controverted matter without the need for involvement by the federal courts.we also relied on the fact that we could consider any constitutional challenge upon completion of the administrative proceedings.we allowed that there was one exception to our jurisdictional holding.that exception involved an issue entirely collateral to the merits,id.at,an exception that has no relevance to duvall petition.
based on our detailed analysis in massieu,including consideration of congress stated purpose,the statute legislative history and the overall structure of the administrative process with due consideration given to a petitioner securing meaningful review of his claims after exhaustion,see id.at,we held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain massieu petition in that massieu had failed to obtain a final order of removal and had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.id.at.while massieu,as we have recited,was concerned with c,whereas here we are concerned with its successor,d,the identity of the two statutes compels us to conclude that d also requires exhaustion as a prerequisite for federal jurisdiction in this connection,although massieu did not dwell on the final order element of the statute,we also conclude that a final order of removal is a requisite for jurisdiction.parenthetically,we note that neither in massieu,nor in the present case involving the petitioner duvall,was there a final order of removal.indeed,
