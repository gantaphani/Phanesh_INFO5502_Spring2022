background 
patel is a native and citizen of india who entered the united states on february,as a permanent resident.the ij ordered patel removed on the grounds that his conviction in illinois for aggravated criminal sexual abuse,see.comp.stat.constitutes a conviction for an aggravated felony as well as a conviction for a crime of moral turpitude within the meaning of the removal statute.see a a iii and i.
a.the criminal proceedings against patel in illinois 
on august,a grand jury in lake county,illinois,indicted patel on three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault,in violation of.comp.stat,for sodomizing a mentally and physically handicapped woman.patel pled not guilty to all charges but waived his right to a jury trial.after a bench trial,the judge convicted patel of aggravated criminal sexual abuse,a lesser included offense of aggravated criminal sexual assault.the judge sentenced patel to five years in prison but he apparently served less than the full sentence.see brief of petitioner at 
b.the removal proceedings 
on march,the and naturalization service ins served patel with a notice to appear,in which it charged that patel was removable under a a iii because he had committed an aggravated felony.on march,the ins added an additional basis for removal,alleging that patel illinois conviction rendered him removable under a a i,which authorizes removal for those convicted of crimes of moral turpitude.
at the removal hearing,patel admitted that he had been convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in illinois but denied that the conviction qualified him for removal under either section of the removal statute.in the event the ij held him removable,patel sought relief under former ina c,c,and the convention against torture cat.section c,as interpreted by the ins,permitted a deportee to make an application for a waiver of deportation as long as he served less than years of prison time for his conviction.because congress repealed that provision with the enactment of the iirira in the ij rejected patel claim for relief.nonetheless,patel argued that under ins cyr,d,he was entitled to rely on c because he was convicted in,prior to the statute repeal.thus patel challenged the retroactive application of iirira to his case.the ij declined to extend cyr,which involved a deportee who had pled guilty to a crime in reliance on the expectation that he would receive a sentence low enough to merit c relief,to patel,who had gone to trial on the charges against him patel did not pursue his claim for relief under the cat and on december,in an oral decision and order,the ij ordered him removed to india under both a a i crimes involving moral turpitude and a a iii aggravated felonies.
c.the bia final order 
patel timely appealed the ij decision.just as the ij had,the bia determined that patel was precluded from seeking c relief because his conviction was the result of a trial,rather than a guilty plea.patel did not appeal the ij determination that he had committed a crime of moral turpitude and was therefore removable under a a i.however,patel continued to challenge the ij determination that his conviction constituted an aggravated felony under a a iii 
the bia affirmed the ij determination that patel conviction for the illinois crime of aggravated criminal sexual abuse constituted a conviction for an aggravated felony and dismissed patel appeal.although patel did not apply for cancellation of removal,see a,the bia observed that he would not be eligible for that form of discretionary relief from removal in any event.under,which congress enacted as part of iirira to replace c,a permanent resident alien facing an order of removal may apply for cancellation of removal.see a.to be eligible for cancellation of remedy that is discretionary at all alien must show that he has been lawfully admitted as a permanent resident for not less than years has resided in the united states continuously for years and has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.id.
the bia determined that patel is not eligible for the remedy.it concluded that even assuming arguendo that patel crime is not an aggravated felony,patel has not resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted see a.under d,any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end a when the alien is served a notice to appear under section a of this title,or b when the alien has committed an offense referred to in section a of this title that renders the alien removable from the united states under section a or a of this title,whichever is earliest.id.the ins served patel with a notice to appear in march,years after his admission to the united states.however,patel was convicted of his crime in,only years after his admission.furthermore,the crime renders him removable from the united states under section a and is an offense referred to in section a.see a a i i rendering inadmissible any alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude other than purely political offenses id.a a i rendering deportable any alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after the date of admission if the crime could result in a sentence of more than one year.
in sum,because patel does not challenge the conclusion that he was convicted in of a crime involving moral turpitude,which crime was committed within years of his entry,and resulted in a sentence of years,patel period of continuous residence was capped at years.consequently,the bia concluded that he is ineligible for cancellation of removal.
initial proceedings before this court 
on june,patel timely filed a petition for review of the bia final order.on june and,the government moved to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction on the grounds that a c strips the federal courts of jurisdiction to review final removal orders issued under a a iii.on june,patel moved for a stay of removal.on july,a motions panel of this court issued an order denying the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,referred the question of jurisdiction to this panel,and granted patel a stay of removal.on october,patel moved the court to withdraw the stay of removal and this court granted the motion on october.on january,the government again moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,this time specifically conceding that the court has jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction,to determine whether the illinois crime of aggravated criminal sexual abuse constitutes an aggravated felony.on march,this court denied the government second motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
ii.discussion 
a.the scope of our jurisdiction 
initially,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider patel petition and,if so,whether our jurisdiction extends to all of the issues patel raises.we conclude that this court retains jurisdiction to consider the limited question of whether patel conviction constitutes grounds for removal under a a iii,whether his offense was an aggravated felony.
in,with the enactment of aedpa and iirira,congress placed significant limits on the courts jurisdiction over immigration matters.see a.under the provision relevant to this case,the judiciary is instructed that notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a a iii id.a c.the supreme court has upheld this provision insofar as it deprives aliens convicted of aggravated felonies of the ability to petition the court of appeals for review of removal orders.see ins,d.the court has further held,however,that although congress expressed its unequivocal intent to divest the court of appeals of jurisdiction over direct petitions for review of immigration decisions,see,the courts nonetheless retain habeas jurisdiction over aliens challenges to removal orders.see ins cyr,d.because patel presents a petition for review of the bia decision affirming the order that he be removed pursuant to a a iii,this court ostensibly lacks jurisdiction under a c.see,at.see also a c.
however,there is a narrow exception to a c divestment of jurisdiction.in,the petitioners conceded that they were removable under a a iii but challenged removal on constitutional grounds.at.in subsequent cases in which a petitioner disputes the bia finding of removability for commission of an aggravated felony or for other offenses listed in a c,our sister circuits have uniformly held that they retain jurisdiction to consider the limited question of whether the petitioner is removable as a matter of law.see,flores ashcroft,cir acosta ashcroft,cir jobson ashcroft,cir omar ins,cir.this court recognized as much in its two dismissals of the government motions to dismiss patel petition for lack of jurisdiction.see patel ashcroft,order cir,patel ashcroft,order cir.july.in any event,to the extent there was any confusion among the various courts of appeal as to whether they retain jurisdiction to determine whether they have jurisdiction,it was resolved by the supreme court decision this term in leocal ashcroft,d,in which the court reviewed the eleventh circuit denial of a petition on the grounds that a state conviction for driving under the influence was a conviction for an aggravated felony.
finally,we note that a strips us of jurisdiction to independently consider patel claim that he is entitled to be exempt under cyr from the retroactive application of iirira.the court of appeals has jurisdiction to consider such a claim only in two circumstances.first,if on direct review of the bia the court determines that it has jurisdiction under a c because the alien is not removable for an offense referred to therein,the court may ostensibly consider any other claims presented in the alien petition for review.see,flores,at.second,the court of appeals has jurisdiction to consider all claims presented in an alien petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see ins cyr,d consistent with these principles,we have made clear that constitutional challenges to removal proceedings,standing alone,are cognizable only when brought in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see pulice ins,cir dismissing a petition for review of a removal order for lack of jurisdiction because the petitioner presented only constitutional claims and observing that p etitioner is free to pursue his claims on habeas review in the district court.accordingly,the government apparent belief that on direct review of the bia,the court of appeals may consider constitutional claims standing alone,see brief of respondent at,is contrary to the supreme court controlling interpretation of a c see,at.see also pulice,at mansour ins,cir.indeed,a recent opinion of the ninth circuit well expresses the reality of immigration jurisdiction in the court of appeals 
b oth and the government assert that we may consider his constitutional claims regardless of the fact that this court is divested of jurisdiction to review his order of removal.we conclude that the court of appeals,having no jurisdiction to review removal order because he was convicted of an aggravated felony,lacks jurisdiction to consider his constitutional challenges as well.as the supreme court has indicated and we have previously held,constitutional claims by aliens who are subject to removal as aggravated felons must be raised in the district court through habeas corpus proceedings.
ashcroft,cir.
in sum,we may entertain patel cyr claim only if the bia erred in determining that he is removable for having committed an aggravated felony thus,we have jurisdiction to review whether a c applies,whether patel offense constitutes an aggravated felony.as the seventh circuit recently observed,w e have jurisdiction to determine whether flores has committed a removable offense,but if he has done so then we lack jurisdiction to review any other issues.flores,at citations omitted.accordingly,if we determine that patel conviction for aggravated criminal sexual abuse in illinois constitutes a conviction for an aggravated felony,we must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
removability under a a iii 
the question whether patel conviction renders him removable under a a iii is a,purely legal question the courts of appeal ordinarily must review such questions de novo.see,leocal,at.at reviewing removability under a a iii de novo chery ashcroft,cir same.where appropriate,however,the courts must defer to reasonable bia interpretations of the statutes they are charged with implementing.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.however,the bia ultimate conclusion that a particular state conviction amounts to an aggravated felony conviction within the meaning of a a iii is reviewed de novo because such a conclusion depends upon interpreting state statutes and federal statutes unrelated to immigration.see,chery,at.
as indicated supra,a a iii renders removable any alien convicted of an aggravated felony.id.section a of the ina defines aggravated felony as,inter alia,a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f.section of title,in turn,defines a crime of violence as 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
in this case,the bia concluded that t here is no issue in the present case that patel conviction falls within the purview of a.likewise,there is no dispute that the respondent conviction is a felony.thus,the sole issue before us is whether the conviction is a crime of violence under b.at.accordingly,because there is also no dispute that patel sentence was years,see a f requiring that a sentence of more than one year is imposed,this question reduces to whether patel offense is a crime of violence under b 
although we have previously considered cases involving removal for aggravated felonies defined elsewhere in a,such as removal for drug offenses defined in a b,see united states,cir kayrouz ashcroft,wl.cir,unpublished order,we have not yet considered a case involving removal for an aggravated felony as defined in a f.however,the supreme court has considered such a case,see leocal ashcroft,d holding that a florida conviction for dui does not amount to a crime of violence under b,as have some of our sister circuits.see,chery ashcroft,cir holding that a connecticut conviction for sexual assault is a crime of violence under b jobson ashcroft,cir holding that second degree manslaughter in new york is not a crime of violence under b flores ashcroft,cir examining a state domestic abuse conviction partly under a ins,cir holding that an illinois misdemeanor conviction for criminal sexual abuse is an aggravated felony.
moreover,courts have considered whether sexual assault or sexual abuse constitute crimes of violence under b.see,chery,at zaidi ashcroft,cir holding that the oklahoma crime of sexual battery is a crime of violence under b.and the sixth circuit has held,in a similar context,that the ohio crime of sexual battery through deception is a crime of violence.see united states mack,cir,cert.denied,d interpreting the armed career criminal act,e b ii.with these cases as a guide,we conclude that patel offense clearly constitutes a crime of violence under b.unde
