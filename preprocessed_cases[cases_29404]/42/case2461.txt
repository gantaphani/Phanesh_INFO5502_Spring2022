petitioners john gomes,his wife jessie,and their two minor children,natives and citizens of bangladesh,are seeking asylum in this country because of severe mistreatment they received as catholics in the midst of that prominently islamic country.first an immigration judge ij,and then the board of immigration appeals bia,affirming without opinion,rejected their application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture cat.the first petition for review before this court seeks relief from those rulings.in addition,the gomes family unsuccessfully sought reconsideration and reopening of their case before the bia.the second petition for review before us challenges that ruling.we have consolidated the two petitions for argument and decision.because we conclude that the ij did not adequately support his decision denying the gomeses application for asylum,we grant their petition for review and remand their case to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on december,gomes entered the united states with a visitor visa.he was authorized to remain in the country until june,but he stayed well beyond that date.the rest of his family joined him on march,also entering with visitor visas.while living in the united states,the gomeses had a third child,kimberly,on april.
the government brief indicates that some time in,the gomeses applied for political asylum with the former immigration and naturalization service ins,whose functions were largely taken over by the department of homeland security in.although this means that gomes application must have been filed more than one year after his arrival,the time limit for such applications was added by title vi of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,title vi,a,codified at a b.it therefore did not apply to any of the gomeses petitions.because the gomeses had overstayed their visitors visas,the ins referred their asylum application to the immigration court and placed them in removal proceedings.they received their notices to appear before the immigration court on april.
at the removal hearing,the gomeses admitted that they had stayed in the united states longer than their visas permitted and conceded that they were subject to removal.gomes,however,sought relief in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat based on his claim that he and his family had been persecuted by muslim extremists in bangladesh because of their active involvement with the roman catholic church.at the hearing,gomes testified that he was born into a staunchly catholic family and had been both an active member of the catholic community and a volunteer with a number of christian organizations since the.
on april,while riding his motorcycle to a meeting at the holy cross church in bangladesh,he was struck from behind and rendered unconscious.he was seriously injured in the attack his jaw was broken,he required twenty stitches in his head,his lips were stitched together,and he spent a little over a week in the hospital.as proof,gomes submitted dental records that indicated that he had suffered permanent damage as a result of this attack,and he presented a certificate of discharge confirming when he was in the hospital.since the attack,he testified,he has suffered from memory loss.when ij john brahos asked him how he knew that his attackers were muslim fundamentalists,he replied that his neighbors,who were eyewitnesses to the attack,told him that four or five muslim extremists pulled up in a car behind him and attacked him with what appeared to be an iron rod and a hockey stick.these witnesses identified gomes attackers as muslim extremists based upon their dress.again gomes submitted corroborating evidence to the ij,this time letters from witnesses who supported his account.gomes indicated that muslim fundamentalists in bangladesh would always try to stop him from preaching his religion.prior to the attack,he had received anonymous telephone calls at his job threatening that if he did not stop doing what he was doing he would be hurt.these callers also told him to change his religion.
matters did not improve after he was released from the hospital.on april,shortly after he returned home,muslim fundamentalists broke down his door and ransacked his house.again,he was able to identify the perpetrators as muslim fundamentalists because of their dress.while in his home,the perpetrators set fire to his curtains,pushed him and his wife to the ground,and physically threatened him with a large knife.they took his television and other personal belongings.before leaving they told him n ext time we come we kill you.this is the last chance.are you legal christianity or you death sic gomes reported both of these incidents to the police,but the police did not conduct any meaningful investigations.gomes concluded his testimony by telling the ij that he feared he would lose his life if he returned to bangladesh.
gomes also testified at the removal hearing.she told the ij that muslim fundamentalists often harassed her.for example,on her way to work,muslim extremists would stop her and question her about the whereabouts of her husband.almost every night someone would throw stones at her window to scare her.she also testified that,shortly after gomes came to the united states,her family members suffered persecution because they are roman catholics.her brother and were attacked on their way home from a mass during easter season by a group of muslim extremists.during the attack,her brother was cut on his elbow and knee,and her was cut on the head.her family members identified their attackers as muslim fundamentalists because of their dress.another brother was robbed by muslim extremists while at work.both his arm and his tongue were sliced with a knife,and the robbers put a gun to his head.this incident was reported in a local newspaper,and the article was submitted to the ij.additionally,gomes testified that a more distant relative,who was an active christian,was murdered in her home by muslim fundamentalists after returning from a prayer meeting.this event also made the local papers,and a copy of the article was submitted to the ij for the record.
in addition to this testimony,more than twenty documents were admitted into evidence documenting both the physical harm to gomes and his family members and the persecution suffered by christians in bangladesh in general.these documents included a number of letters from various priests and heads of religious organizations corroborating gomes account of the attack on his person and the invasion of his home by muslim fundamentalists.the record also included various newspaper reports of recent attacks on christian institutions in bangladesh,including an attack by muslims on a catholic girls school in dhaka,two separate bombing incidents involving a church and a missionary school,and a terrorist attack against christians.finally,the record included the department of state annual reports on international religious freedom in bangladesh for and and the country report on human rights practices in bangladesh.
in a decision dated may,ij brahos denied the gomeses asylum application,finding that they had not established past persecution or a fear of future persecution as required under the statute.see ina a a,a a.based on his conclusion that the gomeses did not qualify for asylum,the ij also denied their request for withholding of removal and protection under the cat.the judge did,however,grant them the privilege of voluntary departure.the gomeses appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij decision without opinion on july.
on august,the gomeses filed a motion to reconsider.shortly thereafter,they filed a motion to reopen the proceedings,in which they asserted that they had previously unavailable evidence supporting their claims for relief.in support of the motion,they submitted a june report from the international christian concern organization,which detailed more recent attacks against christians in bangladesh.in addition,they furnished more newspaper articles describing acts of violence against christians,including an article that reported the stabbing death of a christian evangelist and an article recounting the kidnapping of a gospel for asia missionary.they also submitted documents that reported on a attack against other members of the gomes family and on an attack of a christian mission on good friday,april.in an affidavit accompanying the motion to reopen,gomes added that he feared that his two daughters would be subjected to female genital mutilation if forced to return to bangladesh.
the bia denied both of these motions on december.in denying the motion to reconsider,the bia opined that the gomeses were just rehashing arguments that it had already considered when it originally affirmed the ij decision.with respect to the motion to reopen,the bia ruled that the evidence was cumulative,given that the administrative record already contained evidence describing similar acts of violence against christians in bangladesh.the bia also found that the gomeses had failed to explain how this new evidence would change the result in their case.finally,the bia rejected the female genital mutilation argument,because it had not been raised earlier at the removal hearing.
as they were required to do,the gomeses filed separate petitions for review from the bia denial of their petitions on the merits and its denial of their motions to reopen and reconsider.because the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion,we review the ij decision directly.see,sosnovskaia gonzales,cir.
our review is,of course,deferential.we must affirm the ij decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.ins,d mansour ins,cir mitev ins,cir.under the statute,the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.ina b b,b b.the bia decision to grant or deny a motion to reconsider or a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion.dandan ashcroft,cir.in considering the gomeses petition for review,our role is not to conduct a de novo inquiry into the merits of the case.see gonzales thomas,d ins ventura,d.we may,however,remand a case to the agency for additional explanation or investigation,if the bia or the ij,in a case like this one that was affirmed without opinion has not adequately explained its result and it seems possible to us that the agency might be compelled to reach the opposite conclusion depending how it evaluates the record after remand.see thomas.at ventura,at.
in their petition for review,the gomeses argue that the ij erred in denying gomes application for asylum.section b a of the ina,b a,empowers either the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security to grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees.see,koval gonzales,cir.a refugee is any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ina a a,a a see also zheng gonzales,cir.an applicant for asylum bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she qualifies as a refugee as defined by the statute.sosnovskaia,at citing a.
a n applicant who is determined to have suffered past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future persecution,id.at,and a rebuttable presumption arises in favor of granting asylum.angoucheva ins,cir.in order to rebut this presumption,the government bears the burden of proving,again by a preponderance of the evidence,that there has either been a fundamental change in circumstances in the applicant country such that the applicant fear of future persecution is no longer or that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocati ng to another part of the country.sosnovskaia,at quoting b i b bace ashcroft,cir.the ina does not specifically define persecution,but we have described it,without contradiction from the bia,as punishment or the infliction of harm for political,religious,or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate as we have also indicated,persecution means more than harassment and may include such actions as detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,or torture.toptchev ins,cir all internal quotation marks and citations deleted.see also mitev,at.
in determining that gomes had not shown past persecution in bangladesh,the ij did not make any credibility determinations.instead,he said that even assuming that the respondent claims are true,the harassment the respondent endured by muslim fundamentalists,without more,simply does not rise to the level of past persecution as contemplated under the act.he did not,however,give any reason for that conclusion,or for why the events that gomes described failed to meet the definition of persecution.his attackers whose deeds the police ignored repeatedly proclaimed that they were targeting gomes because of his religion and they were trying to force him to abandon christianity for islam.as we wrote in kantoni gonzales,a credible threat that causes a person to abandon lawful political or religious associations or beliefs is persecution.bucur ins,cir it is virtually the definition of religious persecution that the votaries of a religion are forbidden to practice it krotova gonzales,cir mamouzian ashcroft,cir,cir.
in reading the ij decision,we can not tell what definition of persecution he was using or how he was applying it to gomes case.we recognize,of course,that at some point a line must be drawn between harassment and persecution,and it is for the agency to draw that line.nor is there any question about the fact that the conduct in question must rise above the level of mere harassment to constitute persecution,asani ins,cir.nonetheless,the agency has never expressed disapproval of the definition of persecution we have been following,and so it is appropriate for us to use it in our assessment of the ij opinion.from that point of view,there can be no doubt that gomes described far more than general harassment,which he endured because he was a catholic.we have described this testimony already,and it tells a tale of severe physical abuse and terrorism inside his home,when his curtains were set on fire as muslim fundamentalists held a knife to his throat and confiscated his property.see,capric ashcroft,cir noting that persecution can include confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,torture,and behavior that threatens the same citations omitted.the bangladeshi government was responsible for this persecution,according to the testimony the ij was willing to credit,because the police were either condoning these attacks or were unable to prevent them.see guchshenkov ashcroft,cir,citing bace,at.
according to gomes,he was harshly beaten on one occasion.there is no requirement,naturally,that a person must endure repeated beatings and physical torment in order to establish past persecution.although multiple incidents create a more compelling case for finding persecution the number of times that an applicant has been subjected to physical abuse is merely one variable in the analysis of the whole of the petitioner claim of past persecution.dandan,at.in vaduva ins,cir,for example,this court noted that a single beating in which strangers punched the petitioner in the face and broke his finger was sufficient evidence of past persecution.in asani,we remanded a case to the bia to determine whether a detention that involved a single beating in which the petitioner two front teeth were knocked out constituted past persecution.at.although broken bones are not the sine qua non of persecution these specifics indicate the severity of the beating and support its claim to be considered persecution.dandan,at.
another problem with the ij opinion,given the fact that he was apparently crediting all of gomes testimony,was his conclusory statement that there was no clear evidence that gomes or his family had been targeted because of their religious beliefs.we can not see how one could come to that conclus
