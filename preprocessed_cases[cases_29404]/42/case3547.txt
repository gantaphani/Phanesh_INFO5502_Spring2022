we address an alien right to see his during proceedings against him.
the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against dent on the ground that he was not an american citizen or national,and had been convicted of an aggravated felony.he has lived in the united states since,but according to the government,he is a citizen of honduras and has been a lawful permanent resident rather than a citizen.he was convicted on a guilty plea in the superior court of arizona of possession or use of narcotic and escape in the third degree both felonies,and sentenced to one year of imprisonment.
dent defended pro se against his removal,arguing that he had been adopted by an american citizen when he was a child,and was an american citizen himself.he also argued that his convictions did not suffice to make him an aggravated felon under the statute the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision that he be removed.
dent at first conceded,at a hearing before the ij,that he was not a citizen of the united states.subsequently,when the ij found that his escape,though on foot and for only half a block,was a crime of violence,and that the charge of removal had been proved,dent said i was adopted,you know that.you guys know that.the ij said he knew nothing about it.
in a previous hearing,government counsel had referred to dent alien file the might have had a different a number on because we had to numbers on this case.in an earlier separate proceeding the government filed a motion to change number from to,consolidating the two files for dent,also using his name,cesar augusto.the government had not given copies of the to dent or to the ij in dent removal case.an is the file maintained by various government agencies for each alien on record.contents include,but are not limited to passport,driver license,other identification cards,and photographs immigration history prior record and all documents and transactions relating to the alien 
after dent told the ij he had been adopted by an american citizen,the ij reminded him that you admitted that you a native and citizen of honduras.dent replied yes.but i no sic i do know anybody over there.i been here since i was years old so i do know.he went on,i have my adoption papers to show you,if you want to see them.the ij understood dent to mean that he was claiming united states citizenship and asked dent if he had the adoption papers with him.dent did not,so the ij gave him a continuance so that he could produce them.
dent succeeded.he wrote the lawyer in arkansas who had handled his arkansas adoption twenty years before,and produced not only his adoption decree,but his school records showing his elementary and high school attendance and his grades.but then government counsel pointed out that he had not proved that his adoptive mother,roma dent,was herself an american citizen.the ij asked dent if he had his mother birth certificate.dent did not,so the ij gave him three weeks to get it and produce it.dent wrote the arkansas adoption lawyer again.the lawyer replied that he would be unable to find a death certificate because dent had died in honduras,and a birth certificate would be a problem because she was born before the central registry of birth certificates were issued.i have contacted the labette county courthouse in kansas and due to a fire,they have lost all birth certificates before.dent was born in.he was working on getting her passport,difficult since she had died on a trip to honduras.nevertheless the adoption lawyer sent dent other persuasive evidence of his adoptive mother citizenship her application for a social security number,in which she had represented that she was born in morehead in labette county,kansas june,of arley riggs and irma riggs nee ross.
dent wrote a statement to the ij explaining that dent had taken him,a child abandoned at age five or six,under her wing on her annual trips to help poor people in honduras,brought him to america,and adopted him when he was fourteen 
i was born in honduras,central america,i was abandoned at an early age by my biological parents.probably when i was or yrs.old,one american woman by the name of roma riggs dent,used to travel to honduras then in the mid to help the poor people,with clothes,food,and education,etc,she was not connected or affiliated to any church,organizations,group,etc,she did this on her own time,own financial support,etc 
i was a very poor and a needy orphan she treated me very nice and would let me in her house and we got closer to each other until i would miss her when she would leave for the united states,she would do this every year be in honduras months and come back to,for another months,any ways sic i started calling her mom as time went by until finally she brought me to the united states in and finally adopted me as her legal son,now i was yrs.old when the adoption was final in.
i believe i inherited citizenship through this adoption,now i seem to meet all of the requirements for qualifying for it,exept sic for her birth certificate,because she was born in and records started being kept on files only since.
however,i do have her ssi birthdate and name,etc,she had a passaport sic also,all of the archives with the are in memphis,that she had to give the in order for her to bring me to the states.so i know that the government really knows that she was a born citizen by birth not any other kind of citizenship.she outlived her klan,sic she died at age,the embassy in honduras has her passport.
dent pointed out in this statement that the government really knows that she was a born citizen by birth.
noting that dent had still not produced his mother birth certificate despite continuances and that he could pursue his citizenship claim from honduras,the ij found that respondent has been unable to make a prima facie showing of citizenship in the united states and ordered him removed to honduras.
dent appealed to the bia,and won a remand on the ground that the record it received lacked the adoption decree and the criminal judgment.on remand,the government lodged an additional charge,that dent was removable not only for the escape but also for his controlled substance violation.the ij again found dent removable because his escape violation was a crime of violence,and also because of his controlled substance violation.dent again appealed to the bia,and the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision.
unknown to dent,documents existed in dent related to dent claim of united states citizenship.these documents were always in the government control,but never given to dent.the documents consisted of a naturalization application dent adoptive mother filed on dent behalf on january,when dent was fourteen,and an application to file petition for naturalization dent filed on his own behalf on february,when he was eighteen.the does not include any document purporting to adjudicate either application.we now know about the only because of a peculiar course of subsequent proceedings discussed below.dent was not given these documents,and the ij and bia were not made aware of them,in the removal proceedings.
dent petitions for review of the bia decision affirming the ij decision,and raises a new issue,that he should have been furnished with the naturalization petitions in his.
ii.analysis 
judicial notice 
the procedural history of dent case took peculiar turns.first,the bia remanded to the ij because the record was inadequate.second,the bia affirmed,but failed to send notice to dent at his current address.dent was arrested in ohio in for illegal and claimed correctly that he had not known that the bia had affirmed or that he had been ordered deported.the government conceded inadequate notice and dismissed the indictment for illegal reentry in.dent had obtained counsel in the criminal proceeding.counsel petitioned the bia to reissue the decision that had not been sent to the proper address,so that a timely petition for review could be filed.the bia did so,and the petition for review before us is from the reissued decision.
the documents have trickled into these proceedings subsequent to the government aborted criminal prosecution for illegal reentry,so subsequent to the bia decision under review.the bia,so far as we can tell from the record,has never been provided with dent documents regarding his adoptive mother and his own petitions for his naturalization.when the bia held that dent had failed to prove that he was a naturalized citizen,it likely meant he had failed to prove that his adoptive mother was a united states citizen.that was the only argument the government had made once dent had proved his adoption.
dent mother and his own petitions to naturalize him were submitted to us as attachments to a motion dent filed before us,asking us to take judicial notice of them.the government has opposed this motion,but suggests that if we do take notice,we also take notice of handwritten notations on the copy of the documents it has provided to us.the government submissions differ from dent,even though both are supposed to be copies of documents in dent.the government submission shows a rubber stamp dent does not,and there are other differences.
on dent adoptive mother application filed in when dent was fourteen,there are handwritten notations on the upper left corner of the first page that appear probably to say absent for dates in,and.there is a notation in a box labeled nonfiled appearing to say over with someone initials.there is no explanation of why the ins may have sat on the document without acting on it for more than four years,until perhaps dent aged out of the category where his adoptive mother could get him naturalized 
the government argues that the handwritten notations mean that dent adoptive mother had her chance,and either she or her son or both failed to show up for three scheduled interviews or that they failed to file other required documents there is a rubber stamp on the copy the government submitted,illegible on our copy,which the government alleges says denied nov.dent submitted copy does not have that stamp,so the stamp may have been added after the government had provided the copy without the denial stamp to dent,well after the conclusion of his removal proceedings before the ij and bia.
on dent own application,signed in when he was eighteen,there is an important discrepancy between his copy and the government.the copy the government gave him in does not show any government action.but the copy the government gave us shows a label pasted onto the first page dated february,and a handwritten notation that appears to say denied.that date,too,is long after the bia had affirmed the removal order on dent appeal.if the government representations are accepted,the government denied dent mother application years after it was filed,and denied dent years after it was filed.
generally our review is confined to the administrative record before the bia.we may review evidence only where the board considers the evidence or the board abuses its discretion by failing to consider such evidence upon the motion of an applicant.the law does not,however,interpret this rule absurdly,so that injustice may be done if the government successfully shields its documents from a person who ought to have access to them,particularly when the documents might change the result of the proceedings.we took judicial notice of documents falsifying the proposition on which the bia had relied in lising.and have discretion to do so here.we held in lising that fisher does not prevent us from taking judicial notice of the agency own records 
we take notice of the existence of dent adoptive mother and his own applications for naturalization,because they are official agency records from dent.the government failure to provide dent with his,and his evident ignorance of its existence,justify his failure to present them to the tribunal.we can not,however,take notice of the facts proved by the documents,because we can not ascertain what those facts might be.we do not know who wrote the handwritten notes,or what they mean.nor are all the notations and rubber stamps legible.
b.the government duty to produce the 
the documents the history of immigrants and others interactions with components of the department of homeland security and predecessor agencies.the united states customs and immigration service uscis uses the information in an to enforce immigration laws the contains all the individual official record material such as naturalization certificates various forms and attachments,photographs,applications and petitions for benefits under the immigration and nationality laws,reports of investigations statements reports correspondence and memoranda on each individual for whom ins has created a record under the immigration and nationality act.
while dent was struggling with the issues of his possible naturalization and his mother citizenship,the government had his with his adoptive mother petition and his own.he did not have the contents of the file.the government has not suggested that anything in his was or should be secret.the government had a central index linking to dent name,both before and after his adoption that a proceeding should have taken place without the benefit of the documents in the government file on dent invited error.the documents show the existence of highly debatable entries.that the parties still disagree about what those documents mean shows the importance of having them where they were most needed,in dent proceedings before the ij.the extensive proceedings about whether he had been adopted,and whether his adoptive mother,evidently born in kansas in,was an american citizen,were all irrelevant if he was naturalized,and irrelevant if his naturalization was authoritatively and properly denied 
in his first appeal pro se to the bia,dent expressly asked for help getting records relating to his mother citizenship,because he was in jail and his adoptive mother was dead.despite his request,he was not furnished with copies of his.his lawyer later discovered the documents during his criminal prosecution for illegal reentry.that case was dismissed when the government discovered that it had failed to send his notice of his removal to the correct address.had the government error in service not led to dent arrest and criminal proceedings,he apparently would never have seen the petitions for his naturalization filed decades before.
dent argues that failure to furnish the to him denied him due process of law,citing our decision in that denial of a continuance necessary to a fair proceeding denied due process of law.
the government argues that dent did not raise the claim before the bia,so it is not exhausted.we reject that argument because his document request was indeed addressed to the bia,and it would not be reasonable to require him to do more,particularly where he was not given the documents and therefore could not have put them before the bia.the ij and the government had focused the case,at that point,on whether dent kansan adoptive mother was a united states citizen,a question to which the government may have already had the answer.the adoption lawyer had suggested in the letter furnished to the bia,that her application for a social security number,providing her date and place of birth,should be sufficient to establish her citizenship.
no justification has been offered for the failure to furnish dent,the ij,the bia,and us with the documents in the.the government motion in separate proceedings to change dent number shows the government awareness of the.the government uses the routinely in almost every case to determine whether an alien should be removed and whether an alien should be naturalized,and maintains an automated system to make access easy for its staff all the official records,correspondence,photographs,applications,petitions,statements,reports and memoranda relating to immigration contacts between the alien and the government are there,yet in the critical proceedings before the ij neither the ij nor the bia nor dent was furnished with the relevant documents.we have no idea why not.the only justification the government offers for why we all should have been left rooting around in the dark is in its j letter arguing that the law did not require them to furnish the.the government offers no reason why
