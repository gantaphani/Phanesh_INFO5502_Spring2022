igor suvorov filed a petition for review from the board of immigration appeals bia affirmance of the immigration judge ij decision denying suvorov waiver of inadmissibility request under section c b of the immigration and nationality act ina,c b.suvorov request under section c b would have waived the requirement that he and jeana lindell file a joint petition to remove the conditional basis of his permanent residence status.the ij denied suvorov request,determining that suvorov did not enter into the marriage in good faith.in its affirmance,the bia entered a final order of removal.
deportability is not at issue in this case all parties concede that suvorov is deportable.the issue is whether suvorov qualifies for relief from removal,specifically whether there is a good faith basis for a waiver of the joint filing requirement.our analysis requires us to review the ij credibility determinations.however,the government questions our jurisdiction to reach the merits of suvorov claim.we dismiss suvorov petition.
background 
at the time of his hearing suvorov was a divorced native and citizen of russia who entered the united states on may,as a fiancé.he married jeana lindell on august,in illinois and became a permanent resident on a conditional basis on december,the two separated on march,and divorced on august,before the period of conditional residence expired under.suvorov and lindell did not jointly petition the attorney general for removal of the conditions on suvorov status suvorov conditional status was terminated on may,and deportation proceedings began shortly thereafter.
the ij thorough page opinion highlights the testimony and exhibits presented in this case.it reviews the courtship of suvorov and lindell as well as the circumstances surrounding their brief marriage.testimony was taken in october.while both sides presented various witnesses who were familiar with the couple,the witnesses that provided the most pertinent testimony,according to the ij,were suvorov,lindell,and robin buehring,the daycare provider of a coworker of suvorov and lindell.
suvorov and lindell first met in russia in when suvorov lived there and lindell was traveling there on a tour.she noticed a lapel pin worn by suvorov displaying the soviet and american flags and began having conversations with him they spent about three days together during lindell trip that summer.lindell then made a second trip to russia in december,spending most of her winter vacation with suvorov.in june,lindell returned to russia yet again and the parties began to talk about marriage.lindell visited again in the summer of.after that the couple did not have much,if any,contact for about one and years.
twice lindell sought to have suvorov visit her and have him apply for a visitor visa at the united states consulate,which he did.twice his request was denied.later,with the help of a congressman,they sought a fiancé visa and it was issued.suvorov arrived in the united states in may and the two lived in wisconsin.after their august wedding,the couple resided in wisconsin rapids and worked together at a company called ccls,a group home for developmentally and mentally disabled individuals.suvorov and lindell acted as a normal couple,sending out christmas cards,celebrating birthdays and socializing as a couple.there was also evidence that lindell suffered from depression,which required medication.further,there was conflicting testimony about whether the couple ever consummated their relationship.evidence of other problems that might have existed was presented including suvorov alleged carousing and the occurrence of arguments between them.
barb lewis was a supervisor at ccls and knew both suvorov and lindell.in march,lindell received a phone call from buehring,a woman that lindell did not know,but who cared for barb lewis young son.among other things,buehring informed lindell that suvorov had copied parts of lindell diary and provided them to lewis and other colleagues of lindell.buehring further told lindell that suvorov and lewis had relations and that suvorov actually had plans to leave lindell on june,the date upon which suvorov supposedly believed he would receive permanent status.she said he then planned to move to new york city with lewis.buehring told lindell that suvorov only married lindell for the green card.she further revealed to lindell that suvorov father was not dead,as suvorov had told lindell during their courtship,but rather that he had a stepfather and that suvorov never knew his biological father.in fact,during their courtship,suvorov had told lindell that his father was ill and had been denied medical treatment due to suvorov relationship with an american.the week that she received buehring phone call lindell packed up her belongings and left suvorov.their divorce was final in august of that year.
buehring testified that suvorov asked lewis to look through the diary to find damaging information about lindell to show that lindell was crazy.suvorov testified that he ultimately had a sexual relationship with lewis but that they were only friends until the time that lindell left him.later,he also discussed marriage with lewis but no formal plans were made.
in his july,order,the ij held that he had no reason to discredit the testimony of lindell and buehring.he determined that lindell entered the marriage in good faith and could find no motivation for buehring to fabricate the information she provided.the ij discredited suvorov testimony,noting that suvorov story to lindell about the identity and death of his father was an extremely serious lie,a matter that caused the ij concern.the ij also questioned suvorov credibility given his behavior in stealing lindell diary to,purportedly,find evidence that lindell was crazy and to publish excerpts to others,a total violation of lindell trust.and,the ij noted that suvorov began a sexual relationship with lewis,possibly even the day after lindell moved out,and referenced indications in the record that suvorov hoped to immigrate to the united states from the time he met lindell.the timing of all these events calls into serious question whether or not suvorov was still interested in maintaining his relationship with his wife at the time immediately preceding her leaving him.in fact,suvorov behavior in february and march of was the deciding factor in the ij determination.the ij might have granted the waiver except that this behavior called into question suvorov intentions regarding the marriage.
nearly six years following the hearing in this matter,after weighing the conflicting testimony and other evidence,the ij denied suvorov application for a waiver of the requirement of filing a joint petition and declared suvorov deportable finding no clear error in the ij credibility determinations and his determinations regarding the validity of the marriage,the bia affirmed the ij.this request for review followed.
ii.discussion 
we first address the jurisdictional issue raised for the first time by the government just prior to oral argument in this case.pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure j,the government sent the court a letter stating that the real id act rida,enacted in,provides,inter alia,that a petition for review filed under former section a of the ina shall be treated as if it had been filed as a petition for review under,as amended by this section.section a b ii states 
notwithstanding any other provision of law no court shall have jurisdiction to review any other decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title 
accordingly,the government argues that we lack jurisdiction because suvorov seeks review of the discretionary determination made by the ij to deny his application for a waiver under c b.as we noted earlier,a waiver under section c is solely within the attorney general discretion.see ante.
suvorov responds that we retain jurisdiction in this matter because none of the cases relied
