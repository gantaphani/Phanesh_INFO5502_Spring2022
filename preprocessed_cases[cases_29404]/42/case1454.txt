this appeal centers on the question whether the immigration and naturalization service ins can apply a new law retroactively in a way that will alter the immigration consequences of an immigrant decision made under prior law under former c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c repealed,deportable aliens who had accrued seven years of lawful permanent residence in the united states could request discretionary relief from deportation by arguing that the equities weighed in favor of their remaining in the united states.even an alien deportable because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony,see a a iii,was eligible for such discretionary relief if he served a term of imprisonment less than five years.see c.
section c was repealed in september,when congress passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.codified in scattered sections of.section b of iirira repealed c relief entirely,replacing it with a procedure called cancellation of removal,see,and providing that cancellation of removal is not available to an alien convicted of any aggravated felony.this provision was consistent with section d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.codified in relevant part at,enacted shortly before iirira,which rendered aliens convicted of aggravated felonies,regardless of the length of their sentence,ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation under former c.
in ins cyr,d,the supreme court held that discretionary relief under former c remains available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.in cyr,the court needed to determine whether iirira section b applied retroactively.after concluding that congress did not provide a sufficiently clear command with respect to the temporal reach of the repeal of former c by iirira section b,the court applied the next step of the familiar principles of landgraf usi film products,d,to determine whether the repeal had an impermissible retroactive effect.landgraf cataloged a history of supreme court precedent establishing a presumption against statutory retroactivity,id.at,in the absence of a clear command from congress.a statute will be impermissibly retroactive when it attaches new legal consequences to prior events because its application would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.id.at.the question whether a new statute attaches new legal consequences to prior conduct demands a commonsense,functional judgment that should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.martin hadix,d quoting landgraf,at.
in cyr,the court concluded that the retroactive application of iirira section b would have an impermissible retroactive effect on as had pleaded guilty prior to the repeal of c.the court highlighted the quid pro quo of the criminal plea agreement,and reasoned that because aliens like cyr almost certainly relied upon the likelihood of receiving discretionary relief in deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial,the elimination of any possibility of c relief by iirira has an obvious and severe retroactive effect.this appeal presents the question whether application of iirira section b would have a similarly impermissible retroactive effect on the petitioner,murali krishna ponnapula.ponnapula turned down a misdemeanor plea agreement,went to trial when former c was still in effect,and was convicted of a felony by the jury he went to trial in reliance on the advice of his counsel that,even if he were found guilty,he would very likely not receive a sentence that would render him ineligible for c relief,because of his very minor role in the offense.
rejecting the position of the government that ponnapula is precluded from claiming retroactive effect by reason of the discussion in cyr,we conclude that cyr is simply one application of the general principles articulated in landgraf that counsel against interpreting statutes to have retroactive effect.here,with respect to an alien who reasonably could have relied on the potential availability of c relief,application of the landgraf principles shows that iirira section b has an impermissible retroactive effect.moreover,on this record,where the petitioner demonstrated clear and reasonable actual reliance on the former statutory scheme in making the decision to go to trial,there is a fortiori an impermissible retroactive effect.we begin with the facts of ponnapula case.
in,a new york state grand jury indicted ponnapula,along with several other defendants,for grand larceny in the first degree,penal law,and falsifying business records in the first degree,penal law.essentially the offense involved a fraudulent application submitted to the bank of india for a loan to generate working capital,secured by a valuable parking lot located near laguardia airport in new york city.the loan application was submitted by a group headed by ponnapula brother,prasad.prasad and his assistant,vijay dandapani,prepared a loan application in the name of a shell company,listed ponnapula as its nominal president,and submitted an inflated personal net worth statement over his name.the loan was eventually approved.however,the undisputed evidence established that prasad and dandapani did all of this without ponnapula knowledge,and that dandapani forged ponnapula signature on both the loan application and the net worth statement.
over the next year,ponnapula and the manhattan district attorney office engaged in plea negotiations.the district attorney office offered to allow him to plead guilty to a misdemeanor with a probationary sentence.ponnapula considered the offer and the immigration consequences of pleading guilty versus going to trial.his counsel advised him that if he was convicted,he would very likely receive the minimum sentence of only one to three years imprisonment,which is less than the five years necessary to disqualify an alien from c relief.accordingly,ponnapula reasonably believed that even if he were convicted of a felony after trial he would still likely be eligible for hardship relief from deportation pursuant to former c.in reliance on this advice,ponnapula decided to turn down the misdemeanor offer and proceeded to trial.on december,he was convicted of both counts in the indictment.he was sentenced to the minimum term of to three years.
the advice of ponnapula counsel,and his reliance thereon,is easily understandable,for the evidence at trial barely established criminality.indeed,ponnapula participation was so limited that the trial judge set aside the jury guilty verdict and dismissed the indictment as to ponnapula,for reasons chronicled in the margin it is also noteworthy that while the loan application contained false statements,the bank was well secured,and recovered million of the million loan amount when it ultimately sold the parking lot.however,the order setting aside the conviction was eventually reversed on appeal and the conviction reinstated.
upon remand,the trial court imposed the mandatory minimum term of one to three years imprisonment on this new york state b felony,see penal law,but the trial judge recommended to the new york state corrections department that it consider defendant for an early release program that encompasses work release.ponnapula then filed a petition for habeas relief in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.while concluding that the evidence had been legally sufficient to sustain petitioner conviction of a larceny involving more than one million dollars,and that he was constrained to deny federal habeas relief,judge rakoff observed 
p etitioner counsel has convinced me that his client was,for lack of a better term,the small fry even better schnook of this particular group of miscreants.
and though i have no power other than the power to comment on what should be done now in terms of his incarceration,for what it worth,it seems to me it would certainly be in the interests of justice for him to be released on work release.
after ponnapula was allowed out on work release,the ins filed a detainer and warrant for a removal hearing on october,and pursuant to new york law ponnapula was returned to state custody.on january,after a hearing,an immigration judge found ponnapula removable from the united states.on appeal,the bia affirmed,holding that cyr could not be extended beyond defendants who had pleaded guilty.on may,after two years of incarceration on his conviction,the new york state department of correctional services released ponnapula.upon his release,the ins took him into custody and transferred him to the pike county,pennsylvania jail for detention.on may,pursuant to,ponnapula filed the habeas petition that is the subject of this appeal.
in analyzing the petition for hardship relief,the district court reasoned that it was presented with the very narrow legal question of whether to apply iirira retroactively to ponnapula.ponnapula ashcroft,d.however,it decided that the provision in iirira could not be applied,g iven the factual underpinnings of this case,and it concluded that ponnapula was entitled to apply for hardship relief.more specifically,the district court found that the e limination of any possibility of former c relief by iirira has an obvious and severe retroactive effect on persons like petitioner who relied on settled expectations of the immigration laws in place at the time he turned down a plea bargain and decided to go to trial.id.at.it also found that a major factor in his decision not to accept the offer was the lack of any distinction for the purposes of c relief between a misdemeanor and felony conviction.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
summarizing its position,the district court ruled that i n deciding not to accept the plea bargain offered,but instead to go to trial,petitioner conformed his conduct to the settled expectation that c relief would be available.accordingly,the court finds that foreclosing c relief to petitioner would have an impermissible retroactive effect.id.at.
because ponnapula had lived continuously in the united states for seven years and had been sentenced to less than five years imprisonment,he would have been eligible for c relief had it not been eliminated.indeed,it would appear from the record that he would likely have been granted it ponnapula wife and two children as well as several of his brothers are naturalized united states citizens.all of them live in this country.ponnapula and daughters do not speak telgu,the native language of their parents.with the exception of the first one and years of the older daughter infancy,each has spent a total of only six weeks in india in their entire lives.the youngest daughter is in the ninth grade,and removal of her father would lead to her mother leaving the country,and would force the daughter to reside in a place where she has no ties and does not speak the language.indeed,ponnapula had been approved to become a united states citizen and was planning to take the oath in,but did not do so because he was indicted for this offense before the oath could be administered.
it will be useful to set forth a brief description of the statutory regime in place prior to and the passage of aedpa and iirira.under that regime,pursuant to c,a lawful permanent resident convicted of a deportable offense was statutorily eligible to seek from the attorney general discretionary relief from deportation.see d.prior to iirira,immigrants who were deportable on the basis of a criminal offense could apply for c relief so long as they had lived in this country continuously for seven years.only those who had been by plea or at a crime that fell under the definition of an aggravated felony,see a,and who had served a prison term of at least five years were statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief.see c.even a defendant convicted of an aggravated felony and sentenced to five or more years imprisonment might have maintained eligibility for c relief provided that he had not served five years of his sentence by the time of his removal hearing.
there was also a strong likelihood that such relief would be granted the attorney general granted it in over half of all cases in which it was sought.see cyr,at.moreover,the relief was predictably granted where certain factors were present,including family ties within the united states,residence of long duration in this country,evidence of hardship to the immigrant family as a result of deportation,and a stable history of employment.see in re marin,i n,bia 
with iirira,congress repealed c relief altogether and replaced it with a provision that created a new and significantly narrower form of relief called cancellation of removal.this form of relief is now unavailable to any immigrant who was convicted of an aggravated felony,no matter the length of the sentence.see.the definition of aggravated felony has been retroactively expanded to include dozens more offenses,including misdemeanor and felony offenses.see a.courts have upheld the application of the expanded definition of aggravated felony to minor offenses.see,united states pacheco,cir misdemeanor state theft of a video game valued at,for which immigrant received suspended sentence,is an aggravated felony united states graham,cir misdemeanor crime of petty larceny is an aggravated felony.
the practical effect of the repeal of c relief,in conjunction with several other statutory amendments,is that a far larger number of immigrants are now deportable under the new law,while a much smaller number are eligible for any form of relief from deportation.moreover,if the repeal is applied retroactively to immigrants such as ponnapula,the practical effect is that it will convert what was the mere possibility of deportation into a certainty.
since the principal authority governing this case is landgraf,we rescribe its fundamental precepts.there the supreme court held that,absent a clear command to the contrary from congress,there is a presumption against statutory retroactivity.at.without such a clear statement,retroactive application of a statute is impermissible when it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.id.at.in martin hadix,the court elaborated that the question whether a new statute attaches new legal consequences to prior conduct demands a commonsense,functional judgment that should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.at.quoting landgraf,at.most recently,in republic of austria altmann,the supreme court held that the landgraf line does not apply to the sui generis context of the foreign sovereign immunities act,slip op.at,but nonetheless both the majority and dissent expressly reaffirmed landgraf s old and principle,slip op.at kennedy,dissenting see also slip op.at reaffirming but distinguishing landgraf.the altmann court explained that the aim of the presumption is to avoid unnecessary post hoc changes to legal rules on which parties relied in shaping their primary conduct.slip op.at.
in cyr,the court applied the principles of landgraf in considering whether iirira repeal of discretionary relief under former c would have a retroactive effect if applied to an alien who was convicted pursuant to a plea agreement at a time when his plea would not have rendered him ineligible for c relief.cyr,at.the court first examined whether the provisions repealing former c evinced a clear congressional intent to apply the repeal retroactively.concluding that there was no such clear statement,see cyr,at,the court next considered whether applying the repeal retroactively would be impermissible.the court concluded that applying the repeal to aliens who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for c relief would attach a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past and produce a retroactive effect.id.at.quoting landgraf,at.the court ultimately held something somewhat more expansive we hold that c relief remains available for aliens,like respondent,whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the court focused on an alien reasonable reliance on the possibility of discretionary relief under former c as one of the most important factors prompting him to forego trial and enter a plea agreement.given the frequency with which c relief was granted in the years leading up to iirira,the court reasoned,preserving the possibility of such relief would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.id.at.indeed,t here can be little doubt that,as a general matter,alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.id.at.in support of its conclusion that aliens who accepted plea agreements prior to iirira had a reliance interest in c relief,the court pointed to the quid pro quo at the heart of criminal plea agreements.id.at.in exchange for some perceived benefit,defendants waive several of their constitutional rights and grant the government numerous tangible benefits.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that b ecause cyr,and other aliens like him,almost certainly relied upon the likelihood of receiving discretionary relief in deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial,the elimination of any possibility of c relief by iirira has an obvious and severe retroactive effect.id.at.
the crux of the government argument is that the appeal is controlled by cyr,which it views as resting uniquely on the existence of the quid pro quo of criminal plea agreements.the absence of this quid pro quo here,the ins argues,causes ponnapula claim to fail.of course,the unspoken premise of this argument is that cyr articulated the exclusive conditions for impermissible retroactivity in this context.
the courts of appeals for the second and fourth circuits have confined cyr to the context on the understanding that a quid pro quo is required.see swaby ashcroft,cir rankine reno,cir chambers reno,cir other courts of appeals have also limited cyr s retroactivity holding to the context without specifically invoking the quid pro quo language from cyr.see montenegro ashcroft,cir per curiam dias ins,cir sonchik,cir brooks ashcroft,cir.a related argument advanced by the ins and in these cases is that the immigrant has rolled the dice by going to trial and thereby forfeited any claim to certainty.see,chambers at.
as we will explain,our interpretation of landgraf and its progeny differs somewhat from these courts.but even accepting their understanding of landgraf,we think ponnapula case distinguishable from the cases cited above,with the possible exception of swaby with which,at all events,we disagree.we first explain why we believe that other courts of appeals have perhaps misapplied landgraf in this area,and we then show why,even under the constricted and questionable but nonetheless prevailing view,ponnapula somewhat unique situation still demands that he be considered for c relief.
because we disagree with other courts of appeals application of landgraf to the question in this case,some background on those courts treatment of landgraf is necessary.we treat the second circuit opinion in rankine as representative.there,the court laid out the supreme court modern retroactivity doctrine with citations to landgraf,hadix,and cyr,see rankine,at,much as we have done above,see supra part.the court explained that the rankine petitioners choice to go to trial puts them on different footing from cyr in two crucial respects.rankine,at.
first,none of these petitioners detrimentally changed his position in reliance on continued eligibility for c relief.unlike aliens who entered pleas,the petitioners made no decision to abandon any rights and admit immediately rendering themselves reliance on the availability of the relief offered prior to iirira.the petitioners decided instead to go to trial,a decision that,standing alone,had no impact on their immigration status.unless and until they were convicted of their underlying crimes,the petitioners could not be deported.
second,the petitioners have pointed to no conduct on their part that reflects an intention to preserve their eligibility for relief under c by going to trial.if they had pled guilty,petitioners would have participated in the quid pro quo relationship,in which a greater expectation of relief is provided in exchange for forgoing a trial,that gave rise to the reliance interest emphasized by the supreme court in cyr.as the court made clear,it was that reliance,and the consequent change of immigration status,that produced the impermissible retroactive effect of iirira.here,petitioners neither did anything nor surrendered any rights that would give rise to a comparable reliance interest.
id.at citation omitted.
three aspects of this opinion are noteworthy.first,neither in the passages above,nor anywhere else in the opinion,does the word presumption appear yet the presumption against retroactivity is the essence of the landgraf line of cases.second,the passage above discussing a detrimental change in position appears to require actual reliance by the party seeking to avoid retroactive application,yet the supreme court has never required actual reliance in any case in the landgraf line.third,the court objection that petitioners have pointed to no conduct on their part suggests that the party seeking to avoid retroactive application bears an evidentiary burden,another requirement we are unable to locate in the landgraf line.in the next section,we discuss in detail our concern that each of these may be unfaithful to landgraf and its progeny.
the second circuit lack of emphasis on the presumption against retroactivity is in considerable tension with the supreme court consistent treatment of retroactivity analysis.see supra note cataloging references to presumption in landgraf,hughes aircraft,hadix,cyr,and altmann.the supreme court framework for assessing the retroactivity of civil laws has been consistently applied the court first looks for a clear statement from congress that a statute is to be applied retroactively,and will defer to such a command.see,landgraf,at.but in the absence of a clear command,a consistent line of cases establishes that congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect.id.at.quoting bowen georgetown,d.
landgraf softens this apparently categorical stance by recognizing that another line of cases holds that in many situations,a court should apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,even though that law was enacted after the events that gave rise to the suit.at.quoting bradley sch,d.the landgraf court cited as examples laws authoriz ing prospective relief,statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction,id.at,and c hanges in procedural rules,id.at.harmonizing these two lines,the court explained 
when a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit,the court first task is to determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.if congress has done so,of course,there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.when,however,the statute contains no such express command,the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.if the statute would operate retroactively,our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.
moreover,in hughes aircraft,the court explained that a conten tion that only statutes with one of these effects are subject to our presumption against retroactivity would simply misread our opinion in landgraf.at.the hughes aircraft court held that the language quoted above does not purport to define the outer limit of impermissible retroactivity,but merely describes a sufficient,rather than a necessary,condition for invoking the presumption against retroactivity.id.because the supreme court has repeatedly couched its holdings in this area in terms of a liberal one that arises only conditionally,on a finding of retroactive read landgraf and its progeny to hold that the presumption against retroactivity is easily triggered,though not automatic 
our disagreement with the courts that have held that iirira repeal of c relief is not impermissibly retroactive with respect to aliens who went to trial is that those courts have erected too high a barrier to triggering the presumption against retroactivity.this has the effect of treating landgraf as establishing a presumption in favor of retroactive application,but such a presumption would be supreme court explicitly held in hughes aircraft that the court of appeals had erred by concluding that landgraf evinced a strong presumption in favor of retroactivity.at.
the second circuit subtle heightening of the showing required to trigger the presumption against retroactivity is also visible in that court apparent insistence that an alien show actual reliance to reap the benefit of the presumption against retroactivity.it is a strange presumption,in our view,that arises only on so heightened a showing as actual reliance though as we explain,see infra part iv,ponnapula actually has made such a showing.relatedly,the second circuit seems to require a quantum of evidence regarding the subjective intent of the party seeking to avoid retroactive application this too strikes us as being in tension with the language of presumption in landgraf and its progeny furthermore,such a requirement incorrectly focuses attention on the particular facts and circumstances of the party before the court.
the supreme court has never required actual reliance or evidence thereof in the landgraf line of cases,and has in fact assiduously eschewed an actual reliance requirement.landgraf,hughes aircraft,hadix,and cyr all establish this.in landgraf,the question was whether the civil rights act of addition of compensatory and punitive damages remedies to certain title vii suits could be applied retroactively to reach preenactment conduct.the court concluded that the remedies could not be applied retroactively,but it reached this conclusion without once referring to the defendant conduct or the defendant actual expectations.in fact,the defendant usi film products is not even mentioned in the pertinent section of the court opinion.see landgraf,at.indeed,it is difficult to see how usi film products could have proven its actual reliance on the absence of a punitive damages provision.
likewise,in hughes aircraft,the particular situation or expectations of the defendant were immaterial to the court analysis.hughes aircraft was brought under an amendment to the false claims act that eliminated a defense to certain qui tam suits.hughes aircraft argued that the elimination of the defense could not be applied retroactively,and the court agreed.again,the court evaluated the retroactivity question in the abstract,without reference to hughes aircraft conduct or expectations,see hughes aircraft,at,and it is again difficult to see how the defendant could have established its actual reliance on the prior state of the law.
hadix concerned congress amendments to the fee provisions applicable to monitoring in prison reform suits.the amendments capped the hourly fee recoverable on behalf of attorneys performing such monitoring.attorneys for hadix,one of the named plaintiff prisoners in the suit,claimed that the amendment was impermissibly retroactive because it reduced their hourly rate for work performed before the effective date of the amendment because it had already been performed and for work performed after the effective date of the amendment because the attorneys could not ethically withdraw from the case until the prison reform decree was terminated.the court agreed with the former position,see hadix,at,but rejected the latter because the attorneys provide d no support for their assumption about their ethical duties,id.at.
important for our purposes is not the result,however,but the court reasoning.hadix differs from landgraf and hughes aircraft in that hadix does in fact refer to the particular situation of the party seeking to avoid retroactive application.nonetheless,the hadix court discussion focuses not on the bona fides of the attorneys claimed actual reliance but instead on whether reliance was or would have been reasonable.see,id.at.to impose new standards now,for work performed before the amendments became effective,would upset the reasonable expectations of the parties.id.after the date of the amendment,any expectation of compensation at the rates was unreasonable.
cyr is the most recent case in the landgraf line.as with hughes aircraft and landgraf itself,the analytical focus of the opinion is not on the facts and circumstances of the party before the court.the court briefly considered the putative actual reliance of enrico cyr and a similarly situated alien,charles jideonwo,but did so merely for illustrative purposes.see cyr,at.cyr is principally concerned with the reasonable reliance interests of aliens who enter into plea agreements as a class.to that end,the discussion of the quid pro quo in criminal plea agreements is directed at establishing,as a general matter,the reasonable reliance of this class of aliens,irrespective of the course of cyr own plea negotiations 
moreover,the cyr court language does not require concrete certainty about the exact historical motives and actual reliance and expectations of each alien who pled guilty.we set out several examples in the margin on the whole,we think the supreme court regarded cyr as a clear and straightforward result flowing from landgraf to paraphrase counsel for the amici curiae at oral argument,cyr was an easy case on the retroactivity issue.
thus the supreme court has avoided an actual reliance formulation in favor of a reasonable reliance formulation in its retroactivity analysis.reasonable reliance is specifically highlighted in hadix,at.holding that retroactivity analysis should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.the likelihood that the party before the court did or did not in fact rely on the prior state of the law is not germane to the question of retroactivity.rather,courts are to concentrate on the group to whose conduct the statute is landgraf it was employers subject to title vii in hughes aircraft it was government contractors in hadix it was attorneys performing prison reform monitoring services in cyr it was aliens who accepted a plea a view to determining whether reliance was reasonable.
the landgraf line also establishes that a change in law can be found impermissibly retroactive without establishing that some or all members of the group affected by the change in law relied on the prior state of the law.for example,it is unlikely that in landgraf any employer demonstrably relied on the absence of a punitive damages remedy for title vii violations,or that in hughes aircraft any government contractor purposely arranged its billing practices ex ante to take advantage of a specific defense under the false claims act.likewise,in cyr,the court found it sufficient that the plea agreements of deportable aliens were likely facilitated by the aliens belief in their continued eligibility for c relief.at.emphasis added.and indeed the court holding is not limited to those aliens who actually relied on the availability of c relief we hold that c relief remains available for aliens,like respondent,whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.cyr,at.
the holding in cyr then is simply not subject to a qualification that the alien seeking the opportunity to pursue c relief must have accepted a plea agreement that necessarily preserved his eligibility for c relief,a plea agreement that provided for release from incarceration in less than five years time.we find this significant because it further confirms that landgraf s limitations on the repeal of former c are construed broadly in favor of those who had even a partial or contingent reliance interest in the existing state of the example,an alien who accepted a plea agreement with a term of imprisonment that,through good behavior credits and the like,could be shortened to less than five years time 
we have established that the question we must answer is whether the repeal of c relief is impermissibly retroactive with respect to aliens who elected to go to trial or some relevant subset thereof.stated another way,we ask what went to trial and were convicted did so in reasonable reliance on the availability of c relief.if ponnapula is among this group,we must affirm the district court grant of habeas corpus relief.we conclude that he is.
as noted above,in cyr,the supreme court found that all aliens who accepted plea agreements had some reliance interest in the potential availability of c relief.the court concentrated its discussion on the alien decision whether to accept the plea agreement.this focus is logical because the reliance interest of an alien who accepts a plea agreement arises at the time the choice is made to accept the agreement.generally speaking,reliance interests in the legal sense arise because some choice is made evincing reliance.restatement second of contracts requiring action or forbearance to invoke promissory estoppel.
accordingly,we focus on the choice made by aliens who went to trial and were convicted prior to the effective date of iirira repeal of former c we may subdivide this category into aliens who went to trial because they declined a plea agreement that was offered to them,and aliens who went to trial because they were not offered a plea agreement.because aliens in the latter category had no opportunity to alter their course in the criminal justice system in reliance on the availability of c relief,we highly doubt though do not explicitly hold,for the issue is not before us that such aliens have a reliance interest that renders iirira repeal of former c impermissibly retroactive as to them.
as for the former category,we hold that aliens such as ponnapula who affirmatively turned down a plea agreement had a reliance interest in the potential availability of c relief.for many aliens,the reliance interest is obvious and himself has such a reliance interest because the parameters for former c eligibility would so obviously factor into the of someone in his position.specifically,ponnapula needed to ensure that,however the larceny charge was resolved,he would serve less than the five years specified in former c.this conclusion is buttressed by the supreme court recognition that the availability of discretionary relief plays a central role in many aliens decisions regarding whether to accept a plea agreement.see cyr,at.though cyr concentrated on the many aliens who ultimately accepted plea agreements,it is not reasonable to believe that all aliens who rejected plea agreements thereby disclaimed any interest in c relief in fact,quite the contrary is true.there are many reasons to proceed to lack of a plea agreement that would ensure eligibility for c relief,the hope of an acquittal,or the simple desire to exercise fundamental constitutional few if any of them are inconsistent with preserving a contingent interest in c relief.
a case about aliens who accept plea agreements,is relatively straightforward because the availability of c relief was very likely a dominant factor in their decision.this case may seem harder because making the decision to go to trial is perhaps more complex and more nuanced,but we should not let that obscure the fact that former c was one of a host of factors considered by aliens who elected that,per the court discussion in cyr,a significant factor at that.
to be sure,there are aliens who would appear to have had a very attenuated reliance interest in the availability of c example,aliens charged with the most serious of crimes,carrying the longest prison sentences,who turned down unattractive plea agreements.preserving eligibility for discretionary withholding of deportation was probably not foremost in such aliens minds,for they had the slimmest of chances to qualify for c relief.but the fact that an interest may have been attenuated,however,has had little salience in the supreme court analysis of other retroactivity questions.for example,ex ante it was unlikely that hughes any given government need to avail itself of a specific defense against a qui tam action or that usi film any given employer subject to title find itself accused of discriminatory conduct meriting punitive damages.in neither case would anyone have claimed,ex ante,that the affected companies had anything more than a highly thus seriously in the state of the law 
moreover,in cyr itself,as we have discussed above,the court extended its holding to all aliens who had accepted plea agreements some of these aliens necessarily had attenuated reliance interests in the availability of c relief for example,consider the hypothetical alien described above who accepted a plea bargain with a term of imprisonment,subject to credits.the cyr court explanation that the fact that c relief is discretionary does not affect our conclusion,at,is also consistent with our understanding of how attenuated interests are to be treated in a retroactivity analysis attenuation of this kind generally does not render reliance unreasonable 
finally,if it was reasonable in cyr for an alien to rely on the attenuated availability of c relief in accepting a plea agreement,we see no reason why it would be unreasonable for the same alien to likewise rely in declining a plea agreement.the reasonable reliance question turns on the nature of the statutory right and the availability of some choice affecting that right,not on the particular choice actually made.in sum,because aliens such as ponnapula who affirmatively turned down plea agreements had a reliance interest in the potential availability of c relief,we hold that iirira repeal of c is impermissibly retroactive with respect to such aliens.while this statement seems broad,it is faithful to cyr,which painted with broad strokes we hold that c relief remains available for aliens,like respondent,whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of the plea under the law then in effect.at.this reflected approval of judge oakes opinion for the second circuit,cyr ins,cir,which adopted the same categorical approach w e hold that the bar on applying for relief enacted in aedpa d and iirira does not apply to an alien who pled guilty or nolo contendere to an otherwise qualifying crime prior to iirira enactment date.id.at accordingly,ponnapula is entitled to apply for discretionary withholding of deportation under former c 
in this part,we have set out our view of the most faithful application of the landgraf line to the case at bar.we recognize,however,that the other courts of appeals to address cases like ponnapula have taken a rather different approach to the retroactivity question.though we stand on the foregoing analysis,we will also analyze ponnapula case under the rubric employed by those other courts.
we have described the background of facts,all uncontradicted and accepted by the district court,which demonstrate that ponnapula played a minor and essentially unknowing role in the fraudulent scheme.we incorporate these facts by reference here.the best description of ponnapula pretrial posture is supplied by the declaration of his trial counsel,alexander eisemann,in support of a motion for a temporary restraining order in the district court.in pertinent part,eisemann declaration states as follows 
at one point prior to petitioner trial,assistant district attorney david steiner offered to allow him to plead guilty to a misdemeanor with a probationary sentence.petitioner considered the offer and the immigration consequences of pleading guilty and going to trial.he realized that even if he were convicted of a felony after trial he would still be eligible for hardship relief from deportation pursuant to section c of the immigration and nationality act,see c.moreover,his counsel advised him that,if convicted after trial,he would likely receive a sentence of less than five years imprisonment and that he would,in all likelihood,receive a sentence of only one to three years imprisonment.
in reliance on these facts,petitioner declined the misdemeanor offer and proceeded to trial.
in short,as the district court noted 
here,there can be no doubt that petitioner conformed his conduct to match his settled expectations of immigration law.petitioner was offered an opportunity to plead guilty to a misdemeanor which would have had no immigration consequences,but turned down the plea because even if he were convicted of a felony after trial he would still be eligible for hardship relief from deportation pursuant to c.

we stress that ponnapula actually relied on the state of the law in rejecting the misdemeanor plea agreement and going to trial.notably,none of the court of appeals cases treating cyr as requiring a quid pro quo involved actual reliance by the immigrant on the then state of the law.also,in these cases the charges and the sentences facing the immigrant were far more serious than those facing ponnapula.for example,to recur to the cases cited supra part,rankine was charged with attempted murder,his lawrence,a repeat offender,was convicted of a drug offense,and his eze was convicted of first degree rape see rankine,at.theodoropoulos was convicted of a drug conspiracy.see theodoropoulos ins,cir.montenegro was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,see montenegro,at,as was,at.in none of these cases does the record reflect or even suggest a plea agreement was offered,or that the defendant had reasonable assurance that his sentence would be less than five years thus ponnapula case seems distinguishable on its facts,both in that ponnapula has demonstrated actual reliance where the aliens in other cases did not,and in that ponnapula offense was significantly less grave.
we must also engage the rationale of these cases.as will appear,while that rationale will support the result reached on the facts of those cases,any attempt to apply it to deny relief in ponnapula case falls of its own weight or at least can not survive rigorous scrutiny.we treat rankine as representative.in arriving at its result,the court relied principally on selected parts of the supreme court opinion in cyr 
the supreme court focused on the fact that plea agreements are a form of quid pro quo where,i n exchange for some perceived benefit,defendants waive several of their constitutional rights including the right to a trial and grant the government numerous tangible benefits.cyr,at.internal quotation omitted.recognizing that c relief was frequently granted prior to the enactment of aedpa and iirira,the court found that preserving the possibility of such relief would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.id.at.
the court also highlighted the clear difference,for the purposes of retroactivity analysis,between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation.id.at.because there was a significant likelihood that resident aliens would receive c relief prior to iirira,the court found that aliens almost certainly relied upon that likelihood in deciding whether to forgo their right to trial,and instead to plead to sentences that would preserve their eligibility for such relief.without the possibility of relief,these pleas guaranteed the aliens removal the elimination of c,therefore,changed the legal effect of their pleas and unsettled their reliance.the court concluded that it would surely be contrary to familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations to hold that iirira subsequent restrictions deprive them of any possibility of such relief.id.at.quoting landgraf,at.internal citation omitted.
rankine,at.the court conceded that cyr did not directly control the outcome,but then opined that 
we can not,however,ignore the strong signals sent in those opinions that aliens who chose to go to trial are in a different position with respect to iirira than aliens like cyr who chose to plead guilty.
id.we agree,for it is clear that cyr does not control the outcome.but for reasons explained above,see supra part iii,we do not agree that relevant jurisprudence contains strong signals that aliens who go to trial are in a different position from those who plead guilty.
the wellspring of rankine and its companion cases is a concern for actual reliance.though we have explained why we do not believe that this is the best rendering of landgraf,we accept that here as a starting point for the sake of argument.what becomes critical,then,is how to prove reliance.we agree that the kind of quid pro quo inherent in the acceptance of a plea agreement is one way to prove reliance as we note above,the action and forbearance implicit in a quid pro quo is strong evidence of reliance.but it is surely not the only way to establish reliance,much less the talisman that the ins makes it out to be.an individual can rely or have settled expectations about a state of affairs without having to enter into an exchange to secure or assure it.
from our discussion above of the lack of concern in the landgraf line for actual reliance,it should go without saying that there is no mention of a quid pro quo or surrender of constitutional rights in landgraf,hughes aircraft,or hadix.neither is there any mention of a quid pro quo in our decision in mathews kidder,peabody,cir 
in this case,the events in question are the alleged fraudulent acts by the defendants.if the rico amendment is applied to this case,it would attach new legal consequences to these events.before the amendment,the legal consequences included liability under the federal securities laws and rico after the amendment,the legal consequences included liability only under the securities laws.
focusing then on new legal consequences to ponnapula himself,they surely have occurred here.ponnapula relied on the advice of counsel.it is hard to imagine that ponnapula would not have accepted the misdemeanor plea offer if he had known about the risk of being ineligible for c relief.and as the district court concluded,a defendant who goes to trial believing that his opportunity to seek c relief is secure,is as equally disrupted in his reasonable and settled expectations as is a defendant who accepts a plea believing it to confer such a benefit.d at.
we do not gainsay that the existence of a quid pro quo for a guilty plea justified the result in cyr.but to the extent that the court in cyr noted that plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between the criminal defendant and the government and a waiver of several constitutional rights,see at,these statements do not create an additional requirement necessary to establish retroactive effect.in our view,these statements only serve to highlight the obvious and severe retroactive effect of applying iirira to aliens who pleaded guilty in other words,the quid pro quo notion comfortably fit the case.what rankine and its companion cases have done is to convert quid pro quo into a rigid baseline test,to ossify the language of cyr into a test that the supreme court simply never mandated and we are unwilling to create.
in a variation on this theme,the government argues that ponnapula simple expectation or reliance is not the same as the heightened expectation of relief which the cyr aliens bought at the price of their constitutional rights and paid for with the immediate certainty of deportation.the rankine court used similar rhetoric the petitioners here assumed no similarly heightened expectation from their decision to go to trial.at.we find no basis for a heightened expectation standard in cyr or elsewhere in the supreme court
