background 
removal proceedings 
saka,a citizen of nigeria,entered the united states on june,using a doctored passport and fraudulently obtained visa bearing the name olukayode olapido wemimo.five years later,still using this false name,saka filed an application for naturalization.a close review of his application eventually revealed saka true identity,and the department of homeland security commenced removal proceedings,alleging that saka had procured admission into the united states by means of fraud or willful misrepresentation.
during removal proceedings,saka admitted to falsifying his entry documents and conceded removability but,citing fear of persecution in nigeria based on his conversion to christianity,filed for withholding of removal and cat relief saka,who had been raised as a practicing muslim,testified that his conversion had prompted death threats from angry family members in nigeria,who believed him an apostate.he suggested that these threats of violence fit a larger pattern of religious persecution in which the nigerian government was acquiescent.saka did not seek asylum at this time,informing the ij that he was aware any claim would be outside the deadline for asylum petitions.
ultimately,the ij determined that saka testimony was not credible given his past use of falsified documents and his history of making dishonest statements to immigration officials.the ij also found insufficient evidence that christians were subject to religious persecution in nigeria based on their beliefs.moreover,even had such persecution been proven,the ij questioned whether saka was indeed a practicing christian.specifically,the ij expressed significant skepticism as to why,although claiming to have become a devout christian in,saka was only baptized in june three months after removal proceedings began.on july,the ij ordered removal.the bia affirmed.
motion to reopen 
on march,saka filed a motion to reopen,citing changed country conditions.in addition to claiming continued eligibility for withholding of removal and cat relief,saka argued that he was newly eligible for asylum because changed country conditions constitute an exception to the deadline for such claims.saka motion was supported by evidence purporting to show increased persecution of christians in nigeria.specifically,the evidence pertained to the boko haram uprising,during which religiously motivated violence left nearly nigerians dead.saka also provided affidavits from his minister stating that he knew saka to be a practicing christian,and from a cousin in nigeria corroborating saka claim that family members remained angry about his conversion.
the bia denied this motion,finding that both the affidavits and the vast majority of news articles provided by saka were not newly available,but instead contained information that could have been provided during his initial proceedings.even assuming that the small number of articles that saka initial proceedings could prove increased persecution,the bia again stated that saka had offered inadequate proof that he is or would be perceived to be christian if returned.a written order denying saka motion was published on may.this order,however,referenced only withholding of removal and cat relief.no mention was made of saka asylum claim a mistake that would become paramount in later stages of these proceedings.
motion to reconsider 
on june,saka filed a motion to reconsider,asserting that the bia had erred by ignoring accounts of significantly increased persecution of christians in nigeria,making improper credibility determinations illustrative of an implicit bias against his claims,and failing to address his claim for asylum.the bia denied this motion,affirming its prior determination that saka evidence was not newly available and did not show that he was,in fact,a devout,practicing christian.it also denied making any improper credibility determinations,reasoning that any evidence discounted in its earlier decision was ignored solely on the basis that it was not newly available.
in contrast,the bia admitted that it had erred by failing to address saka asylum claim,but ultimately found this error harmless.the bia pointed out that under c a timely claim for asylum would face the same standard for reopening as saka other claims for withholding of removal and cat relief.an untimely application for asylum,however,would face an even higher burden,requiring proof of changed country conditions under a d.thus,having failed to present newly available evidence sufficient to reopen under the more forgiving standard,the bia reasoned that saka would have necessarily failed to meet the burden for raising his untimely asylum claim as well.because the bia found this error to lack materiality,it concluded that reconsideration was unnecessary.a final order denying saka motion was entered on september.
ii.discussion 
on october,saka sought appellate review of both his motion to reopen and his subsequent motion to reconsider.we take up each motion in turn.
motion to reopen 
petitioners seeking review of a final bia order before this court must abide by a strict filing deadline.b ven ashcroft,cir.this deadline runs from the time a final order is entered subsequent motions before the bia do not toll or extend it.zhang ins,cir citing stone ins.because this deadline is a jurisdictional requirement,we are strictly bound to dismiss petitions filed beyond its outer limit.ven,at citing zhang,at.
saka appeal was filed approximately five months after the bia entered a written order denying his motion to reopen,well beyond the deadline.nonetheless,seizing upon the bia failure to explicitly resolve his claim for asylum,saka argues that we retain jurisdiction.citing a ninth circuit case,go holder,cir,he argues that motions remain live so long as any possibility of relief remains.see id.finding jurisdiction appropriate despite late filing where,in ruling on the motion,the bia remanded one of three claims for further proceedings.applying go reasoning,saka theorizes that the bia order denying his motion to reopen was not final because it did not specifically foreclose his claim for asylum,thus leaving open some possibility of relief.under this theory,the motion to reopen became final only on september,when in ruling on his subsequent motion to reconsider the bia finally dismissed saka asylum claim.
we are unconvinced.whatever the merits of go reasoning,we are neither bound by its precedent nor unable to easily distinguish it from the case at hand.here,no portion of saka claim was remanded for further consideration,and the bia in no way indicated that additional proceedings were necessary.in contrast,the bia order unequivocally stated that t he motion to reopen is denied.this blanket denial is significantly distinct from the facts of go,which fit neatly into an administrative scheme that allows the bia to return a case to an immigration judge for such further action as may be appropriate,without entering a final decision on the merits.d.
simply put,saka sought to have his proceedings reopened,and the bia definitively declined to do so.although the bia order failed to make specific mention of saka asylum petition,it clearly intended to issue a final denial of all of his claims.indeed,had saka timely appealed the denial of his motion to reopen we would have had jurisdiction,if only to remand it to the bia to properly address the asylum claim.see halo gonzales,cir finding remand appropriate where the bia failed to adequately articulate its reasons for denying asylum.as such,we find that despite the bia failure to explicitly dismiss saka asylum claim,its may,order did not reasonably suggest any continuing possibility of relief on this motion to reopen 
moreover,adopting saka argument in practice would render void the rule that subsequent motions before the bia can not toll the deadline for judicial appeals.see zhang,at.it is more than clear that a motion for reconsideration posits that the decider here,the bia made some sort of error in the earlier decision.liu mukasey,cir.equally is that such error may take the form of an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked.muyubisnay cungachi holder,cir emphasis added quoting asemota gonzales,cir.thus,motions to reconsider may commonly proceed on the theory that the agency prior determination ignored or omitted some legal claim.
yet,saka would have us find that in all such cases the appeals deadline is held over until that claim is definitively resolved.while dressed up in the language of finality,what this argument proposes is no more than a form of tolling.finality would come only when the bia ruled on the subsequent motion to reconsider,effectively pausing the clock in the interim.we refuse to adopt a rule that would wreak such havoc on the accepted relationship between administrative and judicial review of immigration proceedings.
finding that saka appeal from the denial of his motion to reopen is untimely,we dismiss.
motion to reconsider 
because saka appeal from the denial of his motion to reconsider is timely,we review it on the merits we review the bia denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.nascimiento ins,cir see also lasprilla ashcroft,cir.under this deferential standard,we uphold decisions unless they are made without a rational explanation,inexplicably depart from established policies,or rest on an impermissible basis.nascimiento,at.any error of law is,inherently,an abuse of discretion.top entm t,torrejón,cir.
saka main argument on appeal is that the bia impermissibly attempted to explain away its failure to resolve his asylum claim with post hoc rationalization s.he asserts that the bia determination that its error was immaterial runs afoul of sec chenery,which requires that agency determinations clearly delineate the basis for their holdings.in support of this theory,saka cites a number of our opinions remanding issues to the bia for failure to clearly substantiate a legal basis for its decision.see,seong holder,cir kadri mukasey,cir.
we reject this argument,as it significantly misconstrues the applicability of these cited holdings to the instant case.without a doubt,judicial review is predicated on the requirement that agencies provide reasoned bases for their decision s.albathani ins,cir citing chenery,at.this case,however,presents no question concerning the scope of judicial review.the issue on appeal focuses on whether the bia acted appropriately in resolving an error originating from an earlier bia decision.the holding of chenery simply does not govern an administrative agency review of its own prior decision.lasprilla,at holding that the bia need not even explain its reasons when deciding a motion to reconsider albathani,at holding that,so long as a rational basis was set forth in some stage of agency proceedings,the bia may affirm ij decisions without an opinion therefore,we find no indication that the bia decision to assess the materiality of its prior error in ruling on a motion to reconsider was,itself,in error.see liu,at finding the denial of a motion to reconsider appropriate based on petitioner fail ure to identify any material error of law or fact in the earlier decision.
next,we turn to whether the bia ultimate conclusion was an abuse of discretion.noting that the purpose of a motion to reconsider is not to raise new facts,zhang,at,we see no such abuse in the bia materiality analysis.where legal claims are predicated on identical facts and are reviewed under the same standard,it is more than reasonable to hold that where one claim falls,the other falls with it.see,amouri holder,cir.having affirmed its earlier determination regarding saka failure to present new evidence the bia noted that at a minimum saka claim for asylum would have faced the same standard for reopening that his other claims had already failed.see c.more precisely,the bia reasoned,the standard for his asylum claim would actually be stricter,given that it had not been filed during initial proceedings and was admittedly untimely.see a d.far from irrational,the bia conclusion appears to have fully considered and reasonably applied the relevant legal standards.thus,we are untroubled by the bia decision to resolve saka claim of legal error without reconsideration.
saka final two claims of error we reach only briefly,as they are clearly not meritorious.first,he attempts to construct legal error from the bia refusal to apply ninth circuit precedent to this case.this argument lacks foundation.although the bia could have chosen to seek interpretative guidance from our sister circuits,the decision not to do so is no way an error of law,much less an abuse of discretion.see kechichian mukasey,cir.
we similarly find lacking saka claim that the bia demonstrated an implicit bias against him by neglecting evidence and undertaking improper credibility determinations.for one,we disagree that the bia was incorrect to refer to saka supplemental affidavits and corrected i as the corrected mistakes.a simple review of the administrative record makes clear that saka himself,in filing these documents,titled them the corrected mistakes.while we doubt such terminology would substantiate an abuse of discretion regardless,we are more than certain it does not do so here.
for another,we reject saka suggestion that the bia,by referencing the ij adverse credibility determination,made an improper factual finding.this argument starts from the flawed premise that the bia had previously rejected the ij adverse credibility determination.even a cursory review of the record reveals that is not the case.the bia,in its initial opinion affirming the ij,simply did not reach the issue of credibility,finding sufficient other reasons to dismiss.no later opinion questioned the ij determination,and the bia did not err by referencing this settled finding when considering whether its motion to reopen had given proper weight to saka evidence.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated herein,saka petition to review his motion to reopen is dismissed,and the petition to review his motion to reconsider denied.
saka also sought alternative relief in the form of voluntary departure.the ij denial of this request was not appealed and is not relevant here.saka also sought alternative relief in the form of voluntary departure.the ij denial of this request was not appealed and is not relevant here.
