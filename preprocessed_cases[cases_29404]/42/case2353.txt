saidu sankoh is a native of sierra leone seeking asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.an immigration judge denied his applications and ordered him removed.the board of immigration appeals concurred in the immigration judge conclusion and dismissed sankoh appeal.sankoh then moved to this court,challenging the agency decision under several theories.finding no error,we affirm.
background 
saidu sankoh is a sierra leonean national who arrived in the united states in.when his visitor visa expired in early,the ins issued him a notice to appear charging him with being removable under a b.after a number of extensions not relevant here,his removal proceedings finally began in.there,sankoh conceded his removability and requested relief in the form of withholding of removal,asylum,and protection under article of the convention against torture.the immigration judge conducted two hearings for these claims in january and june during which sankoh testified and submitted a number of documents to substantiate his requests for relief.the court inquiry centered on sankoh experiences prior to leaving sierra leone and what treatment he could expect should he return.
much of the evidence came from sankoh testimony.his story was one charted by the political currents of sierra below as he presented it,with modifications where necessary.sankoh told the court that he was born in to a family of some political prominence.in,when political conditions in the country deteriorated,sankoh family sent him to safety in germany.he spent fourteen years there,marrying a german woman,fathering a child with her,learning the language,and obtaining german residency.but after he divorced his german wife in,he returned to sierra leone,where he set up shop as a printer in the country capital,freetown.soon the political turmoil that had forced sankoh from sierra leone would flare anew,only this time much of it would be caused by sankoh uncle,foday sankoh,and the rebel group that he led,the revolutionary united front.
the ruf was a rebel group bent on overthrowing sierra leone government,although it did not espouse any particular ideology.the group was led by foday sankoh,supported by the liberian president charles taylor,and was responsible for sierra leone civil war.the brutal war was notable for the use of child soldiers,the atrocities the widespread practice of amputation and mutilation against the interplay between the war and the country valuable diamond mines.see generally barbara crossette,sierra leone rebel leader reportedly smuggled gems,times,may,howard french,african rebel with room service,times,see also ishmael beah,a long way gone memoirs of a boy soldier farrar,straus giroux.
this case turns on sankoh involvement with his uncle and the ruf from through.sankoh could not deny his connection to the group,but he sought to prove before the immigration court that he was an unwilling conscript to the ruf operations,a version of events that the immigration judge and board ultimately found to be incredible.as sankoh described it to the court,his uncle and a band of ruf soldiers first asked him to help the cause in.he testified that they wanted his help moving something from abroad into sierra leone.sankoh told the immigration judge that his confronters were purposefully opaque in describing what this something was as his asylum application recounted things,however,they told him he would be procuring guns.in any event,sankoh uncle considered him the perfect candidate for transacting business abroad.he had a valid passport to travel to europe,which meant he could travel freely throughout the continent.and his sierra leonean citizenship meant that he could import goods into the country as well,something a foreigner could not do.in short,he was someone that could function on both sides of a european in helping to procure goods abroad and in shepherding them into sierra leone.sankoh told the immigration judge that he initially refused the offer.but after his uncle struck his foot with the butt of a rifle and threatened further consequences if he did not cooperate,he acquiesced.he also submitted that he went along because,if he did not,the rebels would kill me because they had disclosed important secret information such as to me when requesting my help to buy weapons.
eight trips to various points in europe would ensue,and,according to sankoh,they all followed the same script.the ruf would make all the arrangements,and his escort would be an man named alex,who met sankoh along his path to europe.alex would then drop sankoh off at a hotel,take his passport,and leave him until all the shipments had been arranged.he said that he never left the hotel or entertained options of fleeing because he thought he was being watched.instead,he would stay in his hotel room most of the time he was away,and at some point alex would reappear,transaction complete,and tell sankoh it was time to go.when he arrived back in sierra leone,he would then have to pick up a shipment in his name at customs.sankoh claimed never to have known exactly what was in the shipment.someone in the ruf told him it was tires,although he surmised that it was either weapons,or medical supplies.at one point he read the word rifles in dutch along the side of one parcel,which he understood due to its similarity to german.as mentioned above,however,this version is in tension with his asylum application where he claimed he was told the content of the shipments from the outset.once through customs,sankoh would then help get the supplies to the rebels in the bush or,as he described his treatment,the ruf would use him as a pack animal to carry supplies.
sankoh claimed that his relationship with the ruf soured after his eighth and last trip to europe when he was attacked by several of the group members.after stopping for the night while transporting a shipment to rebel troops,someone threw scalding water on his back and four ruf members then him.he told the immigration judge that the rape was so forceful that he needed to later undergo surgery to fix an inguinal hernia that had resulted.immediately after his rape,sankoh received some comfort from an ruf member who was also moving materiel through the bush.the person was able to speak german and,when he heard what had happened to sankoh and that he was planning to escape,gave him some advice on the best way to do it.sankoh said that he made his move marching through the bush,flagging down a truck on a nearby road,and making his way back to freetown.once in freetown,sankoh says that he received help leaving the country from a friend at the airport,shaka kanu.kanu gave him an airplane ticket and some cash,and,on february,he left sierra leone bound for europe.
after a brief detour through belgium,sankoh arrived by train in frankfurt,germany.there,he learned that the german government had revoked his residency due to the length of his absence.and when he requested asylum,his request was denied.sankoh was able to remain in germany for nearly years,during which time,he said he received medical treatment for malaria,high blood pressure,and the hernia that he claims resulted from the rape.but after the german government denied all of his requests to remain,sankoh left for the united states in july,eventually overstaying his visa and receiving the notice to appear.
to support his testimony,sankoh also provided medical records of his surgery in germany to show his inguinal hernia.he also gave the court two letters from two men in sierra,abu koroma,claiming to be the ruf member who helped him escape after his rape and another,kanu,saying he was sankoh close friend.the two claimed to know each other.koroma,who had helped sankoh escape after his rape,said that he learned sankoh identity when he was visiting kanu for treatment.the doctor had a picture of sankoh on a wall,and when koroma saw it,he recognized sankoh from the jungle and recounted the story of his escape.the letters submitted to the court told the story of this serendipitous encounter as well as the details surrounding sankoh rape.
sankoh also claimed that the sierra leonean government would imprison him should he return.he based this claim on what he said had happened to his family after he left.according to sankoh,soon after he left sierra leone,his mother house was firebombed and destroyed,apparently in an effort to target his cousin.sankoh provided letters from a friend and the family lawyer describing the bombing,the government efforts to find sankoh children,and the government threats that sankoh would meet a similar fate if he returned.he also claimed that the government had been searching for him in his former apartment in freetown since he left officials thought that he had been a gunrunner for the ruf,meaning he would be arrested and imprisoned if he ever returned.
at the end of the hearing and just prior to closing arguments,sankoh attorney objected to the immigration judge decision not to admit a state department country report for sierra leone from.from through the proceedings in,sankoh had submitted a number of documents setting out the country conditions in sierra leone for the years in which he was living there.the immigration judge who would ultimately hear sankoh case had a limit on documentary evidence,and sankoh counsel was unsure as to whether these previously submitted documents would count against this limit.efforts to clarify the court position on the limit failed.and when proceedings began,sankoh counsel submitted pages of documents focusing on the country conditions in sierra leone since his original application for an update to the previously submitted documents.when the immigration judge later told sankoh attorney that the previous documents were not on file,she did not object,instead proceeding apace with sankoh case.after sankoh had presented his case,the judge asked whether there was any other document that has been considered that you want me to consider,and sankoh attorney indicated that there was not.the immigration judge then told the parties what issues he wanted addressed in closing arguments.these included sankoh credibility,his claimed past persecution,and whether he was a persecutor of others.sankoh attorney asked to supplement the record with the country reports from and period during which sankoh was making his trips to the judge refused,saying the case was closed for decision.
in his written opinion,the immigration judge denied all of sankoh requests for relief.as is relevant here,the court first found that sankoh was statutorily ineligible for asylum because he assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others.in the court estimation,sankoh had admitted to traveling to europe in order to assist the ruf acquisition of weapons,which the ruf subsequently used.and the court did not believe sankoh claim that he stayed in the hotel room the entire time while others conducted the transactions.alternately,the court found sankoh testimony incredible,discounting nearly every aspect of sankoh testimony.as to the arms purchases,the court reasoned that a group like the ruf would not hesitate in fabricating documents,making sankoh ability to freely travel to europe less useful.and the court did not credit sankoh version of the rape.the court noted that he had provided different dates for the rape in his original application for asylum and his testimony.also,the facts that sankoh was the nephew of the ruf leader and had been entrusted with the important task of obtaining weapons made a rape by the ruf unlikely.nor did the court believe that sankoh was entirely unaware of the purpose of his trips to europe.although he testified that he only had suspicions as to what he was helping to transport,in his original application for asylum,he stated that the rebels had come to his home to ask me to help them buy armaments in europe.the court then questioned the letters from koroma and kanu and the circumstances of their conversation regarding sankoh.finally,the court noted that the conditions in sierra leone had improved and that sankoh had no evidence that he would be persecuted upon his return.with a dearth of credible evidence before it,the court denied his various requests for relief and ordered him removed.
sankoh then challenged the immigration judge decision before the board of immigration appeals,which dismissed his appeal.expanding upon the immigration judge decision,the board similarly found him ineligible for asylum as a persecutor,reasoning that he had admitted in his original asylum application that he went to europe to assist in procuring arms.the board also upheld the adverse credibility finding.the inconsistencies between sankoh initial application and his testimony made his claim that the ruf forced him to go to europe implausible.the board otherwise agreed with the immigration judge rejection of sankoh documentary evidence regarding the rape,including the medical evidence and the letters from koroma and kanu.and the board found that the evidence failed to prove that sankoh would face persecution if he returned to sierra leone.finally,the board held that the immigration judge did not deny sankoh of due process either when he examined him during the proceeding or when he refused to admit the country report into the record.as to this last point,the board then took administrative notice of the country report.in his brief before that court,sankoh had described the ruf as relatively new at the time of his involvement.based on the report,however,the board concluded that sankoh had mischaracterize d the status of the ruf at that time as nascent and stated instead that,at that time,t he ruf was committing horrible atrocities against civilians and aid worker s and was already engaged in conscripting child soldiers.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,sankoh raises a host of challenges to the proceedings before the immigration judge and the board.first,he claims that he was denied due process i through the immigration judge decision not to admit the and country reports into the record ii through the board ultimate and in his view erroneous reliance on the report on appeal and iii as a result of the immigration judge bias against his case.in addition,he argues that the board erred in upholding the immigration judge adverse credibility findings.he also argues that the board erred in holding that sankoh was ineligible for asylum as a persecutor of others.finally,sankoh challenges the board conclusions that he had failed to show past persecution or a fear of future persecution for purposes of his asylum,withholding of removal,and convention against torture claims.the following sections discuss why the agency did not err in denying his requests for relief.
procedural claims 
sankoh raises three procedural challenges to the immigration judge handling of his hearing.he argues first that the immigration judge erred in refusing to admit the country reports from to.in addition,he argues that the board compounded this error when it improperly took administrative notice of the facts contained in the report.finally,sankoh claims that the immigration judge violated his due process rights by exhibiting bias against his application.
these procedural arguments involve an amalgam of constitutional and statutory claims.aliens have procedural due process rights under the fifth amendment,and this court will enforce the entitlements set out there when necessary.reno flores,d.but the statutes and regulations governing procedures before the ins provide a number of rights to an alien,and we have held that these guarantees,if secured,provide constitutionally adequate process.see,khan mukasey,cir.given the canon of constitutional avoidance,the upshot is that aliens are by arguing that immigration proceedings infringed some statutory or regulatory right not that the proceedings fell short of what the constitution requires.id.and in the event that there is no statute or regulation on point,only then will this court turn to whether the process afforded passed constitutional muster.as with most alleged procedural violations,after a showing is made,the question becomes whether the violation prejudiced his application in any meaningful way.hussain keisler,cir.
sankoh first claim is that the immigration judge violated his statutory right to a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf when it refused to reopen the record to admit the country reports from to.see b b a.sankoh presented these country reports after learning what the immigration judge wanted counsel to discuss during closing arguments.the bia rejected this claim because the immigration judge had asked sankoh counsel whether she had anything to add to the record before closing it,and sankoh counsel responded in the negative.because this is a legal conclusion,we review it de novo and agree that the judge evidentiary decision did not deprive sankoh of his reasonable opportunity to provide evidence 
sankoh originally received his notice to appear in.during the ensuing eight years,sankoh,represented by counsel,submitted several documents to the court to substantiate his claim of asylum.sankoh claim arises because the documents that he submitted regarding the country conditions in sierra leone from the early were not in the record at the beginning of his proceedings.after the immigration judge told his counsel this fact,however,she made no effort to introduce the documents into the records during the hearing.in his brief before this court,sankoh states that his counsel considered the issue moot when learning that the previous documents pertaining to country conditions were not in the file that is,she made no effort to press the matter.sankoh thus had the opportunity to present the evidence he now claims was unfairly rejected.he simply did not take advantage of it.capric ashcroft,cir.further,when the immigration judge gave the parties an opportunity to add more documentation prior to closing the record,sankoh counsel again passed on the offer.there was nothing stopping sankoh counsel from submitting these documents anew during the proceeding.thus,sankoh had his reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf.
next,sankoh argues that the board erred in taking administrative notice of the country conditions in sierra leone in.in rejecting his appeal,the board took administrative notice of the state department report to conclude that sankoh had mischaracterize d the status of the ruf in that report as nascent and to substantiate the alleged abuses the ruf had committed.sankoh challenges this on two grounds.first,he claims that the board violated his due process rights by taking notice of a fact to which he did not have an opportunity to respond.we do not agree.the board has the authority to take administrative notice of uncontroverted facts,meaning facts that can be characterized as commonly acknowledged.kaczmarczyk,cir,cir.but,as mentioned,due process affords an alien an opportunity to be heard,which extends to the specific facts grounding the agency decision to remove him.kaczmarczyk,at.one could claim,as sankoh does here,that the immigration judge ability to make certain factual determinations outside of the adversarial which the alien exercises his opportunity to be heard falls short of due process.as we have held many times,however,administrative notice does not violate the alien due process rights because an alien can challenge any factual finding through a motion to reopen.see also,cir.as far as our review of the briefs and the record indicate,sankoh did not file a motion to reopen.nor did the board deny him an opportunity to file one or render the opportunity meaningless through cursory review,at.thus,sankoh broadside challenge must fail.
sankoh also claims that the board official notice of the facts in the country report denied him due process because the board took official notice of a fact that the parties disputed he says that whether the ruf was in fact engaged in atrocities when he was making his trips to europe was a heavily contested issue.in turn,the administrative notice of this fact prejudiced him because it ultimately supported the board conclusion that he had persecuted others.we do not agree.the board was well within its authority to credit the country report findings regarding the ruf.as we have noted,the use of country reports is not entirely unproblematic.due process demands an individualized assessment of each asylum applicant.kaczmarczyk,at petrovic,cir asylum application depends on existence of specific facts demonstrating that he has actually been the victim or persecution or has good reason to believe that he will be singled out for persecution.and unthinking reliance on general country conditions without linking those conditions to the applicant for asylum would undermine the individualized nature of the inquiry.kllokoqi gonzales,cir state department reports are entitled to deference,but the ij must make an individualized determination.diallo ashcroft,cir begzatowski,cir generally inv.state board of equalization.not to mention the fact that considerations of diplomacy may shade the analysis offered by the state department,perhaps making it less than bedrock in its detailing of human rights abuses.niam ashcroft,cir.for these reasons,in some circumstances,denying asylum to an individual solely based on the generalized statements in the report may not afford the meaningful opportunity to be heard required by due process.
but that is not what happened here.the country report provided evidence of the political conditions in sankoh home country,kaczmarczyk,at,which is a suitable topic for notice.see margos gonzales,cir noting in passing that t he immigration judge took administrative notice of the fact that the hussein regime and its control of iraq ceased as of april.in addition,the facts contained in the country report were not controverted in the sense that sankoh had credible evidence to the contrary.see,niam,at.in fact,he testified that he knew that the ruf was a group which had already started attacks against the civilian population when he agreed to take business trips to europe.and of course the report was one of the three country reports sankoh sought to admit after the close of evidence.so he can not realistically claim error from the board accurate representation of the facts in a report he sought to admit.as a result,this claim fails as well.
sankoh final procedural argument is that the immigration judge exhibited impermissible bias towards his claims.he argues that the judge went beyond his role when he aggressively questioned sankoh,became hostile and impatient during sankoh testimony,and commandeered.this,he claims,was an abdication of the neutrality expected of immigration judges and denied him due process.once again,we disagree.unlike article iii courts,an immigration court is a more inquisitorial tribunal.congress has given immigration judges the authority to interrogate,examine,and the alien and any witnesses.b.immigration judges are thus not bound by all of the formalities that typify other adjudicative proceedings.but this authority,though broader,has its limits.the judge discretion in questioning is bounded by the applicant right to receive a fair hearing.podio,cir.and when the immigration judge treatment of the applicant crosses the line between his authority under b and unfairness,a due process violation has occurred.id.
here,the record just does not support sankoh claim that the judge crossed the line.the judge questioning began only after sankoh attorney had first examined him at length.thus,sankoh had an uninterrupted opportunity to be heard before the judge took over the proceedings.in addition,when the judge questioning did begin,it was not hostile.the interruptions that sankoh points to were simply efforts to keep the testimony moving in what the judge thought was the right direction.bereza,cir.for example,when the judge asked where and how the ruf operations were conducted,sankoh responded that they come to kilon,the town named kilon and t hey destroy there.the judge then cut sankoh short to redirect the questioning,saying that he would repeat the question again because you not really answering it.these interruptions reveal an effort to keep the testimony moving,not an impermissibly biased tribunal.iliev,cir.although the judge may have been testy at points with both sankoh and his attorney,due process does not constitutionalize good manners.in sum,the immigration judge did not deny sankoh a fair hearing,and his claim must therefore fail.
substantive claims 
sankoh raises several challenges to the rejection of his requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.the board adopted and expanded upon the immigration judge decision to deny all of sankoh requests for relief,making the board the decision we review for substantial evidence.see feto gonzales,cir.this standard of review means that we assess whether the bia determination was supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,and reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.tapiero de orejuela gonzales,cir.based on that review,we find adequate support for the board decision.the board rejected sankoh requests on a number of grounds.on appeal,however,it is only necessary for us to look at two the adverse credibility finding and the lack of proof that,if sankoh was treated poorly in the past or if likely to be treated poorly in the future,it was not the result of sankoh political views 
before delving into the particulars,an overview of the relationship between sankoh three claims is in order as the factual bases for the claims overlap substantially.an alien qualifies for asylum if he can show that he is a refugee.b a.the ina defines a refugee as a person who is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.if an alien establishes past persecution,there is a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.to still deport the alien,the government must then show that country conditions have changed,meaning the past persecutors are no longer able to do so.b.similarly,an alien must receive withholding of removal if the attorney general decides that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a.to qualify,the alien has to show a clear probability that he will face persecution if removed.zeqiri mukasey,cir.finally,to qualify for relief under the convention against torture,an alien must show that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.notably,these latter two showings are more difficult than proving that one is a refugee.see zeqiri,at hussain gonzales,cir.as a result,a failed asylum specifically,a finding that an alien does not have a fear of future persecution will eliminate both the withholding of removal and convention against torture claims as well.id.here,sankoh claim for asylum thus his remaining claims necessarily fall as there is no credible evidence of past persecution and no evidence establishing a fear of persecution.the following sections discuss each in turn.
past persecution 
sankoh claim of past persecution involves his treatment by the ruf from to.specifically,he identifies two acts of past persecution the ruf conscripted him into service running guns from europe and members of the ruf then gang raped him at one point while he was transporting arms to a rebel camp.the board rejected both.first,it adopted the immigration judge adverse credibility finding,which largely discredited sankoh version of events.for example,although sankoh claimed in his testimony that he was unaware of the precise content of the shipments,he stated in his application for asylum that he was told from the start that he was going to get guns.in addition,the board found it implausible that sankoh would be oblivious to the ruf objectives when he was sent to europe.he had professed a familiarity with their aims elsewhere in his testimony,and his claim that they sent him to europe for secondhand tires did not make sense given their ambitions.the board also found sankoh account of the rape to be not credible.the board noted discrepancies in the dates and circumstances surrounding the rape.and the board found it implausible that the ruf would rape the nephew of their leader who was running guns for the group.nor was the board persuaded by the documentary evidence the medical records from sankoh surgery did not indicate that the rape caused his injuries,and the letters from koroma and kanu lacked sufficient indicia of reliability.finally,the board noted that nothing in sankoh account indicated that,even if the events did occur as he stated,the ruf persecuted him on account of his membership in a protected group.
on appeal,sankoh first argues that the board should not have relied on many of these inconsistencies in finding him not credible because sankoh did not have an opportunity to explain them away first.the inconsistencies arose between his original asylum application,the affidavit included with the application,and his testimony.the immigration judge adverse credibility finding came after his testimony,and the judge did not flag the apparent consistencies and ask for an explanation before issuing his opinion.this silence,sankoh claims,was error.in support of this proposition,he points the court to a decision from the second circuit,which,he claims,holds that such an opportunity is required before an adverse credibility finding.see ming shi xue bia,cir.this claim is unavailing.
in the first place,we do not think ming shi advances sankoh position.there,the immigration judge found the applicant not credible based on inconsistencies in the applicant testimony.the second circuit held that the immigration judge failure to give the applicant an opportunity to explain these discrepancies was error.the court differentiated the inconsistencies at issue plausible explanations we re possible from those where the discrepancies were obvious to everyone.id.at.after concluding that e ach of the inconsistencies allowed for a plausible explanation,the court remanded so that the applicant would have a chance to explain.id.at.thus,the case stands for the proposition that before the board can rely on inconsistencies,the applicant must be given an opportunity to explain any tension that might exist between facts.
as will be seen,the inconsistencies noted by the agency in sankoh case are both fairly obvious and material.but,more importantly,this court has steered clear of this type of analysis when examining the adequacy of the agency credibility determinations.instead,we are generally deferential to the immigration judge and the board credibility findings as long as they are supported by specific,cogent reasons.diallo gonzales,cir.if the immigration judge relies on minor or tenuous inconsistencies to find an applicant not credible,the judge finding is not likely based on substantial,and probative evidence regardless whether the applicant had a chance to explain the inconsistencies.jalloh gonzales,cir see also kadia gonzales,cir if any such pratfall warranted disbelieving a witness entire testimony,few trials would get all the way to judgment.asylum hearings are human events,and individuals make mistakes about immaterial points.id.basing an adverse credibility finding on these kinds of mistakes appears to be more of a game of gotcha than an effort to critically evaluate the applicant claims.id.it may be true that the failure to explain a minor inconsistency will weaken an applicant case and so providing such an opportunity could in turn strengthen the agency reasoning.see shtaro gonzales,cir a dverse credibility determinations may not be based on minor discrepancies that are easily explained,and the ij did not attempt to ascertain whether these omissions could be accounted for.but we have not required a remand when an immigration judge fails to provide such an opportunity,and we decline to do so here.
sankoh also claims that the alleged inconsistencies are insufficient to support the board adverse credibility finding.the board discounted sankoh credibility based on his testimony and the documentary evidence submitted as part of his application.although the standar
