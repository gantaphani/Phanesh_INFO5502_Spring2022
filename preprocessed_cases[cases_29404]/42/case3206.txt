the government appeals the dismissal of xochitl garcia santana indictment for unlawful reentry in violation of.the district court determined that garcia prior removal order was constitutionally inadequate because garcia was denied her right to seek discretionary relief from removal.we affirm.in doing so,we hold that the generic definition of conspiracy under the immigration and nationality act ina,a u,includes proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
in,garcia pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit the crime of burglary in violation of.a nevada court found her guilty and sentenced her to a suspended term in county jail.
just over two weeks later,a deciding service officer of the immigration and naturalization service,proceeding under the summary removal procedures codified at b,ordered garcia removed as an undocumented alien convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to a a iii.the deciding service officer determined that garcia was subject to a final conviction of an aggravated felony as defined in a,and was ineligible for any relief from removal that the attorney general may grant in an exercise of discretion.she was removed.
in,garcia unlawfully reentered the united states.some years later,nevada law enforcement officials notified immigration and customs enforcement ice that they had booked garcia,a previously removed alien,into a local detention center.ice officials subsequently took garcia into custody at her home.
a grand jury indicted garcia on the charge that she was a previously removed alien found unlawfully in the united states,in violation of.she moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing that her previous removal order was fundamentally unfair.the deciding service officer erred,she asserted,in finding that her previous conviction qualified as an aggravated felony that rendered her ineligible for all discretionary relief.denying her an opportunity to seek such relief,she concluded,constituted a violation of due process.
the district court denied garcia motion,ruling that conspiracy to commit the crime of burglary under nevada law constituted an aggravated felony,so she did not qualify for any discretionary relief.upon reconsideration,however,the court struck its order denying garcia motion to dismiss for the constitutional inadequacy of her previous removal order.instead,the court granted garcia previous request upon the grounds contained in defendant motion.
this appeal followed.
the due process clause guarantees an individual charged with illegal reentry,the opportunity to challenge a prior removal that underlies the criminal charge,where the prior removal proceeding effectively eliminated the right of the alien to obtain judicial review.united states arias ordonez,cir citing united states mendoza lopez.section d codifies this principle.see id.it authorizes collateral attack on three conditions that the defendant exhausted available administrative remedies that the removal proceedings deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and that the removal order was fundamentally unfair.d.removal is fundamentally unfair,in turn,if a defendant due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying removal proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.united states ubaldo figueroa,cir first alteration in original quoting united states zarate martinez,cir,overruled on other grounds as recognized in united states ballesteros ruiz,cir.
an immigration official failure to advise an alien of his apparent eligibility for relief from removal,including voluntary departure,violates his due process rights.see,united states melendez castro,cir per curiam united states lopez valasquez,cir en banc.an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is not eligible for voluntary departure in lieu of removal.see a united states vidal mendoza,cir.garcia prior removal order stated that she was ineligible for any relief,because she had previously been convicted of an aggravated felony.the government challenges the grant of collateral relief only on the ground that garcia conviction for burglary conspiracy qualifies as an aggravated felony,contrary to garcia contention and the district court ruling aggravated felony is defined to include a theft offense or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year,a g,or a conspiracy to commit an offense described in a,a u,which includes a theft offense or burglary.
to determine whether an offense is an aggravated felony,we use the categorical and modified categorical approaches of taylor united states,and shepard united states.hernandez cruz holder,f d,cir.under the categorical approach,we look not to the facts of the particular prior case,but instead to whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.moncrieffe holder,quoting gonzales duenas alvarez,u.the generic definition of an offense is determined by the contemporary usage of the term.taylor,at.a state offense is a categorical match with a generic federal offense only if a conviction of the state offense necessarily involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.moncrieffe.at some alterations in original quoting shepard united states,plurality opinion.that is,an offense is an aggravated felony if the full range of conduct covered by the state criminal statute falls within the meaning of the relevant definition of an aggravated felony.ngaeth mukasey,cir per curiam quoting penuliar mukasey,cir,abrogated on other grounds as recognized in united states martinez,wl,at cir.by contrast,where the state statute of conviction sweeps more broadly than the generic crime,a conviction under the law can not count as an aggravated felony,even if the defendant actually committed the offense in its generic form.descamps united states.
nevada law defines a conspiracy as an agreement between two or more persons for an unlawful purpose.bolden state,quoting doyle state,overruled on other grounds by kacsmarek state,see also.conviction of a conspiracy in nevada requires no proof that any overt act was done in pursuance of such unlawful conspiracy or combination.
for reasons we shall explain shortly,we are convinced that,applying the methodology prescribed by the supreme court for defining generic offenses for categorical purposes,the generic federal definition of conspiracy,codified at a u,conditions conviction on performance of an overt act in pursuit of the conspiratorial objective because nevada conspiracy statute criminalizes a broader range of conduct than the properly determined generic definition of conspiracy,garcia conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony 
c ontemporary usage of a term governs its generic definition under the categorical approach.taylor,at.to identify that contemporary usage,we survey the definitions codified in state and federal statutes,adopted by the model penal code mpc,and endorsed by scholarly commentary.see,united states esparza herrera,cir per curiam.
i.the generic definition of an offense roughly correspond s to the definitions of the offense in a majority of the states criminal codes.taylor,at.a survey of state conspiracy statutes reveals that the vast majority demand an overt act to sustain conviction.by our count,states do so if the district of columbia,guam,puerto rico,and the virgin islands are included,then the tally rises to forty of jurisdictions 
such a great predominance of jurisdictions is more than sufficient to establish the generic federal definition of a crime.we have held the agreement of jurisdictions qualifies as sufficient consensus to establish the generic definition of a crime.see esparza herrera,at.here,the even more widespread agreement among jurisdictions on an overt act requirement for the general crime of conspiracy indicates that conviction for generic conspiracy requires an overt act.
the federal government general conspiracy statute,which criminalizes conspiracies to commit any offense against the united states,or to defraud the united states,also requires an overt act.parallel federal crimes are probative,but not independently determinative,of the contemporary,generic definition of an offense.see united states medina villa,cir.
ii.taylor,which first established the proper mode of analysis in this area of law,used both the mpc and a scholarly treatise wayne lafave austin scott,substantive criminal law ed as aids in its survey of generic burglary.taylor,at.these two sources agree that conspiracy to commit an offense now requires proof of an overt act,and so confirm the results of our survey of contemporary state and federal statutes.
the mpc conditions conviction for general conspiracy on proof of an overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy done by the defendant or by a person with whom he conspired,unless the conspiracy concerns the commission of a first or second degree felony.model penal code.because the mpc defines burglary as a felony in the third degree unless particular,narrow conditions are met conviction for conspiracy to commit burglary typically requires proof of an overt act 
the treatise,substantive criminal law,also supports an overt act requirement as that treatise observes,most of the states now require that an overt act in furtherance of the plan be proven for all or specified conspiratorial objectives.lafave,supra.the treatise goes on to observe that the requirement is in some instances treated as part of the offense and in others as merely an element of proof.id.under the categorical approach,this distinction does not matter a constituent part of the offense that must be proved by the prosecution in every case to sustain a conviction under a given statute,is an element of the crime for purposes of categorical analysis.united states beltran munguia,cir emphasis and alteration in original quoting united states hasan,cir per curiam.the scholarly assessment thus confirms that generic conspiracy requires proof of an overt act.
the agreement of a majority of states,the federal general conspiracy statute,the mpc,and scholarly commentary reflects the importance of an requirement to contemporary criminal jurisprudence.at common law,conviction for conspiracy required no proof of an overt act.see,whitfield united states.instead,agreement was seen as the essence of conspiracy,iannelli united states,and an evil in itself,independently of any other evil the criminal agreement seeks to accomplish,id.at quoting dennis united states,jackson,concurring.the evil of a conspiracy was understood to lie in the tendency of c oncerted action both to increase the likelihood that the criminal object will be successfully attained and to decrease the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality.id.at quoting callanan united states.
the move toward requiring proof of an overt act was but one manifestation of a larger shift in legal thought concerning the general crime of conspiracy,as jurists and scholars began to view with disfavor attempts to broaden the already pervasive and nets of conspiracy prosecutions.grunewald united states,see also lafave,supra,describing some common criticisms of conspiracy.a range of concerns informed that jurisprudential disfavor,among them the observation that the minimum of proof required to establish conspiracy is extremely low,krulewitch united states,jackson,concurring,and recognition that the procedural rules attached to conspiracy allegations make convictions easier to obtain than for substantive crimes,id.at.proof of an overt act is often the only external evidence of a crime predominantly mental in composition.krulewitch,at internal quotation marks omitted.for this reason,t he function of the overt act in a conspiracy prosecution is simply to manifest that the conspiracy is at work and is neither a project still resting solely in the minds of the conspirators nor a fully completed operation no longer in existence.yates united states,internal quotation marks and citation omitted,overruled on other grounds by burks united states,see generally peter buscemi,note,conspiracy statutory reform since the model penal code,colum,tracking legislative revision of the common law of conspiracy to include an requirement and outlining the motivations for reform.the contemporary overt act requirement thus developed to guard against the punishment of evil intent alone,and to assure that a criminal agreement actually existed.
as all the indicia we have been instructed to use under taylor and its progeny to determine the elements of the general crime of conspiracy point toward an overt act element,we conclude that such an overt act is an element of the generic definition of conspiracy.
the government maintains,however,that the reference to conspiracy in a u incorporates only the definition of that term,without the contemporary,widely adopted safeguard.for support,the government cites a line of supreme court cases interpreting conspiracy as used in specific federal criminal statutes,rather than in the generic federal conspiracy statute.those cases rest on a settled principle of statutory construction that,absent contrary indications,congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms,and hold that,absent express language to the contrary,a federal statute establishing a specific federal conspiracy offense does not require an overt act,only an agreement.whitfield,at emphasis added quoting united states shabani,conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of h see also shabani,at conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of singer united states,conspiracy to aid another in evading service in the armed forces nash united states,sherman act conspiracy.
the government reliance on these decisions tracks the bia reasoning in a precedential opinion,which relied on the same line of supreme court cases.see in re richardson,bia.on the basis of those cases,richardson interpreted conspiracy under a u as referring to the definition,and thus as omitting any requirement.id.at.we can not accept this interpretation.
i.the cases cited by the government,and by richardson,interpret specific penal statutes,each of which directly imposes criminal liability for particular acts,as well as conspiracy to carry out those same acts.whitfield recognized this limitation,explaining that the line of cases on which the government relies established the governing rule to determine whether an overt act is a required element of a particular conspiracy offense.whitfield,at emphasis added.that is,those cases explain how courts should interpret federal statutes criminalizing conspiracies.
the ina is quite different than those statutes.it is not a conspiracy offense.it defines aggravated felonies for the purpose not of defining and penalizing criminal conduct,but of assigning various immigration consequences to prior convictions.see,united states corona sanchez,cir en banc listing the various uses of the aggravated felony concept in the ina such collateral consequences attach to convictions from all jurisdictions,not merely to federal convictions.
in applying the taylor approach,we presume that the statute employs uniform,categorical definitions to capture all offenses of a certain type regardless of technical definitions and labels under state law.taylor,at.the definitions of aggravated felonies codified at a are thus descriptive,not proscriptive.they define a class of prior convictions,rather than prohibiting particular conduct.to interpret this kind of statute,taylor instructed us to identify the contemporary understanding of an offense and to spurn t he arcane distinctions embedded in the definition.at emphasis added.
a close look at taylor illuminates how the government argument,and the bia holding in richardson,disregard entirely the mode of analysis applicable to defining generic crimes under the categorical approach.taylor interpreted the meaning of burglary within the armed career criminal act,e.that act imposed enhanced sentences for offenders previously convicted of,among other things,a violent felony,which the statute defined to include burglary.taylor,u.at.the sentencing enhancement applied to convictions under either federal or state law,as does the aggravated felony definition at issue here.at common law,burglary was defined as the breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.but most contemporary state statutes,the court noted in taylor,had deviated from the understanding of burglary,by criminalizing conduct involving entry without a breaking,structures other than dwellings,offenses committed in the daytime,entry with intent to commit a crime other than a felony,id.at.stressing that t he arcane distinctions embedded in the definition have little relevance to modern law enforcement concerns,taylor concluded that it was unlikely that the members of congress,immersed in the intensely practical concerns of controlling violent crime,would have decided to abandon their modern,generic definition of burglary and revert to a definition developed in the ancient english law.id.at.
duenas alvarez,reinforces this conclusion.that case,applying taylor,considered,as do we,the description of a generic aggravated felony.subsection a g,at issue in duenas alvarez,lists a theft offense as an aggravated felony.duenas alvarez turned on whether the term theft offense included the crime of aiding and abetting a theft offense.the common law had distinguished between principals,principals,and accessories before the fact,precluding automatic incorporation of the broad concept of aiding and abetting into the description of a substantive crime.id.at.but,as duenas alvarez explained,criminal law now uniformly treats those who fall into th ose categories alike.id.at.rejecting,as in taylor,reliance on common law concepts,duenas alvarez used the prevalent,contemporary law of aiding and abetting instead,and concluded that the bare statutory reference to those convicted of theft included aiders and abetters,as well as principal offenders.
we must apply the same approach here,as our issue is parallel to those in taylor and duenas alvarez what set of prior state and federal criminal convictions did congress mean to encompass in a provision assigning consequences to such previous convictions as the ina aggravated felony definition is used to impose collateral consequences for earlier state and federal convictions,taylor and duenas alvarez direct us to presume that congress sought to track contemporary state criminal practice,not common law concepts.in the absence of any specific indication that congress meant to incorporate the meaning of a term,we shall not read into the statute a definition so obviously ill suited to its purposes.taylor,at see also corona sanchez,at although the common law definition informs us and is the starting point of our analysis,it is not the end point.indeed,such an approach was rejected by the supreme court in taylor,at.
the government retorts that adopting the contemporary,generic definition of conspiracy that is,requiring an overt act is an implausible interpretation of congressional intent,because a wide range of criminal conduct would fall outside this reading.not so.as we have seen,the predominant majority of state statutes already subscribe to the generic understanding of general conspiracy,as does the general federal crime of conspiracy.only a small subset of conspiracy convictions,emanating from that minority of jurisdictions that retain the definition of conspiracy,will not trigger adverse immigration consequences even were it otherwise,some measure of underinclusiveness is inevitable under the categorical approach,as the supreme court has expressly noted.see moncrieffe.at see also descamps.at.
ii.in its petition for rehearing,the government contends that united states castleman,undermines our basis for concluding that taylor,not the whitfield line of cases,controls.it argues that,in castleman,the supreme court relied on a definition in interpreting a statute that,like the ina,creates subsequent liability based on convictions from all jurisdictions,rather than directly imposing federal criminal liability for the relevant conduct.
castleman confronted a statute prohibiting possession of a firearm by anyone who had been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.g.m isdemeanor crime of domestic violence was,in turn,defined as a misdemeanor offense committed within certain intimate relationships which,among other things,has,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force.a a the question was how to interpret the term physical force within the definition in a a.castleman.at.the court did not adopt its recent construction of physical force in the definition of violent felony in e b i as requiring violent force,and instead looked to the canon of statutory construction.castleman.at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted citing johnson united states,u.the government argues that castleman shows that the presumption applies not only to direct penal statutes,but also to statutes that apply later consequences to earlier convictions from various jurisdictions.
castleman is inapposite.as discussed above,in taylor the court interpreted the term burglary,which was used but not defined in e b ii.it first rejected the idea that the definition was supplied by the statute of conviction,finding congress intended a consistent standard.taylor,at.it then concluded that congress used that term not in the sense,but in the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states.id.at.that is,the court found that the undefined offense of burglary was meant as a for a consistent set of elements,and that those elements should be discerned by reference to the consensus of contemporary sources.in this case,we have proceeded in the same way for the undefined offense of conspiracy.
by contrast,in castleman there was no call to look to contemporary sources for a definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,g,because the statute itself provided such a definition namely,the use or attempted use of force within certain intimate relationships.a a.the question was how to interpret an element within a definition that was explicitly provided by congress.thus the interpretive question at issue in castleman was very different from the problem of construing what congress means when it refers to a specific crime,such as burglary or conspiracy,without providing a definition.
consistent with that difference,none of the opinions in castleman addressed the methodology.the majority adopted a interpretation of the term force,as justice alito,concurring in the judgment,would have also done for different reasons.castleman.at.neither discussed the methodology.justice scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment,argued that the court should give force the same meaning as it had in johnson,principally based on the presumption of consistent usage,but he also made no reference to the methodology.id.at.moreover,none of the parties briefs advocated a approach 
thus,the methodology was simply not at issue in castleman that being the case,castleman can not answer the core issue in this case should the court rely on a,or,definition of conspiracy 
in short,our response to the government argument based on castleman is essentially the same as our response to its argument based on the whitfield line of cases.while the presumption of meaning was appropriate in considering the statutes at issue in those cases,the interpretive question at issue here is critically different.the question in this case is how to interpret an undefined offense,conspiracy,when it refers to convictions for that crime in various jurisdictions for the purpose of determining collateral consequences.the supreme court cases provide a clear answer to that question we interpret such provisions using taylor contemporary sources methodology,not the common law meaning.
the government also argues in its petition for rehearing that castleman illustrates another error in our reasoning.according to the government,i
