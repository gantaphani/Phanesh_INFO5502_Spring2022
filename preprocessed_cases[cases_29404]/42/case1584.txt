having been deported to mexico in following his conviction of an aggravated felony,trino medina campo returned to the united states and remained undetected for several years,until he was arrested in anne arundel county,maryland,on april,for driving under the influence.the federal authorities were alerted,and a grand jury in the district of maryland charged medina campo with a single count of illegal entry after deportation,in contravention of a see also b increasing maximum term of imprisonment for ordinary violators to twenty years for aliens whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.medina campo pleaded guilty,and,on april,he was sentenced by the district court to fifty months in prison.on appeal,medina campo challenges the court calculation of his prison term insofar as it was informed by the federal sentencing guidelines.discerning no error,we affirm.
the applicable guideline is section,titled unlawfully entering or remaining in the united states,which designates a base offense level of.the guideline provides for a enhancement,however,if,as a specific characteristic of the offense,the defendant unlawfully reentered the united states following a conviction for a felony that is a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded months.sentencing guidelines ussg b a.in,an oregon circuit court entered a judgment of conviction against medina campo on his guilty plea to five counts of a indictment,the most serious charge being unlawful delivery of a schedule i controlled substance,heroin.see.a medina campo was sentenced to prison for months on the heroin offense,and to lesser concurrent terms of imprisonment on the rest.
taking into account the oregon drug conviction,the district court,over an objection from the defense,enhanced the offense level for the conviction to from the base of.the court then subtracted three levels in adjustment,having found,in agreement with the government,that medina campo had accepted responsibility as to the federal offense.see ussg b.the final adjusted offense level of,viewed in conjunction with his inclusion within criminal history category iv,resulted in an advisory guidelines range for medina campo of to months of imprisonment.from the lower end of the calculated range,the court varied downward to impose the sentence appealed from.see a.
medina campo pursues on appeal the same contention he advanced below,that is,the oregon felony of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance does not qualify under the guidelines as a drug trafficking offense meriting the enhancement.discounting the trafficking enhancement,the applicable offense level is,reflecting a less severe enhancement for the oregon felony,see ussg b d,downwardly adjusted by two levels instead of three for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a.using the calculation that medina campo proposes,his advisory guidelines range would be to months,and it is possible that,after his present sentence is vacated and the matter remanded,he would receive a commensurately more lenient term of imprisonment.
we will not disturb a district court reasonable sentencing decisions,consistent with the proper exercise of its discretion.see united states lawing,cir citing gall united states,d.a sentence is unreasonable in the procedural sense if the court flatly omits certain steps,or if it analyzes relevant considerations in a manner contrary to fact or law.a court may therefore commit reversible sentencing error by,for instance,failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.gall,at.with respect to a guidelines range attacked on appeal as miscalculated,we review the court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see united states llamas,cir.
we begin with the proposition that c ourts employ a categorical approach in determining whether a prior conviction will lead to a sentence enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.united states peterson,cir citing,inter alia,taylor united states,d.medina campo posits that the oregon felony of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance is not categorically a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of section.this seemingly counterintuitive theorem finds germination in the oregon case law recognizing that one can be convicted of delivery not only for the most mundane physical transfer of possession,but also by merely soliciting drugs from a supplier albeit unsuccessfully for subsequent transfer.
the latter situation was illustrated in state sargent,in which an oregon appellate court held that 
if a person solicits another to engage in conduct constituting an element of the crime of delivery,to provide to the person a controlled substance for the purpose of distribution to third parties,the person has taken a substantial step toward committing the crime of attempted delivery under oregon revised statutes a,the conduct constitutes delivery.
as related by the sargent court,the solicitation constitutes delivery insofar as an attempt to transfer a controlled substance is treated the same as a completed transfer.id furthermore,a n attempt becomes a crime when the defendant takes a substantial step toward commission of the crime.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in essence then,in oregon,the solicitation of controlled substances in order to resell them regardless of the success of the endeavor amounts to an attempted attempt at delivery,which is the same as attempted delivery,which is the same as actual delivery.
seizing upon the remoteness in time of the threshold act of soliciting delivery from the climactic act of actual delivery via physical transfer,medina campo maintains that the oregon delivery statute,having been interpreted inclusively by the courts of the state,prohibits different types of behavior such that it can be construed to enumerate separate crimes.united states gomez,cir quoting united states rivers,cir.and if soliciting delivery is,under gomez and rivers,a separate crime from attempted or actual delivery,peterson categorical approach must give way to the modified categorical approach,which applies only to that relatively small subset of cases involving statutes encapsulating separate proscriptions,at least one of which constitutes,for our purposes,a drug trafficking offense.gomez,at see united states maroquin bran,cir.
medina campo asserts that he prevails under the modified categorical approach,which circumscribes our review only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,gomez,at quoting shepard united states,d citation omitted,and confines the proper proof thereof to a limited universe of documents relevant to the underlying conviction,id.citing shepard,at.according to medina campo,the shepard documents produced by the government in his case the oregon indictment,together with the petition and order evidencing his guilty plea to the delivery charge are insufficiently detailed to permit a court to determine whether he was convicted for the initial act of soliciting delivery or for undertaking a subsequent step in the process.thus,says medina campo,the government is unable to prove it more likely than not that the upward modification should be figured into his sentencing calculus.see united states washington,cir concluding that,in cases employing modified categorical approach,government bears burden of proof by preponderance of evidence.
medina campo carefully crafted argument goes nowhere,of course,if its premise is shown unsound,if soliciting delivery of a controlled substance is not,for purposes of section,a separate crime from attempting or effectuating delivery,such that the modified categorical approach may be employed.see united states vann,cir en banc king,concurring instructing that t he categorical approach,when it applies,is mandatory and dispositive,and,thus,where the statute only contains one category of crime a court may not vary from the categorical approach third alteration in or
