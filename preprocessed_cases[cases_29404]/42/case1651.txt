li fang lin,a citizen of the people republic of china,petitions for review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture cat.lin applications for asylum and withholding of removal stem from the forced implantation of an intrauterine contraceptive device iud by chinese officials after the birth of her first child.her application for protection under the cat arises from her fear of detention and torture as a result of leaving china illegally with the assistance of a snakehead the bia dismissed lin asylum claim,concluding that the forced iud insertion was not persecution under the immigration and nationality act ina,et.west supp,and that any fear lin had of forced sterilization in the future was unreasonable.based on its finding that lin failed to satisfy the lower burden of proof required for asylum,the bia also dismissed her withholding of removal and cat claims.for the following reasons,we grant lin petition for review on all claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
when,as here,the bia does not expressly adopt any portion of the immigration judge ij decision,we review only the findings and order of the bia,not those of the ij,cir.
the bia expressly declined to address the ij determination that lin testimony was incredible we have not yet had occasion to answer the question of how we should evaluate the petitioner testimony in such circumstances.in similar situations,our sister circuits have presumed the petitioner to be credible and have reviewed only whether the petitioner satisfied the burden of proof.see ying zheng gonzales,cir b ecause the bia specifically declined to address the ij adverse credibility determination,we must evaluate petitioner claims on the presumption that she was credible and review only the burden of proof finding.see also zhen hua li att y,cir w here the bia makes no findings on the credibility issue,we must proceed as if petitioner testimony were credible and determine whether the bia decision is supported by substantial evidence in the face of the assumed but not determined credibility.internal quotation marks and citations omitted krotova gonzales,cir same.we agree with the approach of our sister circuits and adopt it in this case.we therefore presume that the testimony of lin,the only witness at her removal hearing,was credible.
lin was a lifelong resident of the fujian province on the southeast coast of china.fujian province has been known for being a place where the policy has been enforced with special vigor a reputation that persists still today at.local officials in fujian province have employed unspecified measures to deal with pregnancies,and,notwithstanding a purported national policy to the contrary,forced sterilization and abortion are prevalent in rural areas.dep t of state country reports on human rights practices for china,available at released march,in fact,in,officials in fujian province reportedly forcibly sterilized women.id.
lin married her husband li wei on september,when she was years old.the couple lived with li wei parents in nan seng village,also within fujian province.lin gave birth to the couple first child,a girl,on october.
in january,about three months after the birth of lin and li wei daughter,the local cadre,acting pursuant to china policy but against lin will,fitted her with an iud to prevent further pregnancies.the record does not provide details about the circumstances of the iud insertion because the ij declined to hear lin testimony about the iud insertion procedure.at the hearing,lin counsel asked her to describe the procedure of the iud insertion.at.before lin could respond,the ij instructed,that okay,counsel.you can move on to the next question.at.
despite her awareness of the chinese government policy,lin desperately wanted to give birth to a boy.the reasons were many.she and her husband wanted a boy to carry on the family name,to help care for them when they became old and could no longer care for themselves,and for ancestral worship purposes after they died.the cadre,however,told lin that she could not have another child for five years,and lin feared that the cadre policy would change for the worse,at,requiring her to use the iud for an even longer period.thus,after an iud inspection in january,lin had the iud secretly removed by a private doctor without the permission of the cadre.shortly thereafter,in april,lin became pregnant with a second child.upon learning of her pregnancy,lin moved to her aunt home in bian lan village,roughly a trip by car from lin former home in nan seng,in an effort to conceal the pregnancy from the local officials.on january,lin,still in hiding at her aunt house,gave birth to a second daughter.
because lin did not attend her regularly scheduled checkups,the cadre began to look for her in nan seng.on several occasions,the cadre visited her home in the village.lin husband told the cadre that lin had gone to visit her relatives,but the cadre did not believe him and told him that he would be in trouble if lin was found.
local chinese authorities in lin home village learned about the existence of the couple second child when lin husband brought the baby to nan seng to visit his parents in march.lin testified that her husband took the baby to nan seng rather than having her visit the baby in bian lan because it was too difficult for her aging to make the trip over rural roads and because her felt that it was inappropriate under chinese customs for them to visit the baby at the house of a relative on lin side of the family 
immediately after lin husband and daughter left nan seng,the cadre visited lin home.they claimed that they knew that lin had a second child and informed her that if lin came back,if the government found her,she would be sterilized.at.the cadre threatened to destroy lin house and to impose fines if lin did not report for sterilization.lin departed china in may,shortly after her husband had taken the baby to visit his parents in nan seng.lin husband has been in hiding since her departure,living with their two children at her aunt home in bian lan and working in her aunt garment factory.
in addition to her fear of forced sterilization,lin also expressed fear that she would be fined,beaten,jailed,tortured upon return to china because she came to the united states with the help of a snakehead lin and her husband paid a snakehead approximately to smuggle lin into the united states.after the birth of her second child and with the snakehead help,she obtained a passport from the chinese government in her own name.lin stated that she had no trouble getting the passport because she got it far away from her hometown.at.lin left china through fujian province jiang dong airport that is located a considerable distance from her difficulty because only the local village officials were aware of her second child and wanted to find her.lin eventually disposed of the chinese passport in malaysia,where she received a hong kong passport from her uncle.
on or about june,lin attempted to enter the united states at or near the miami international airport without valid entry documents.the immigration and naturalization service ins,which has now been reorganized within the department of homeland security dhs,took lin into custody at the airport.on june,dhs issued lin a notice to appear,charging her with being subject to removal under a a i i west supp lin conceded removability and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat.
on june,an ij conducted a removal hearing in which lin was the only witness.at the conclusion of lin testimony,the ij,in an oral decision,found that lin ha d failed to meet her burden that she has suffered past persecution or that she has a fear of future persecution should she return to the people republic of china at the present time and that lin testimony was incredible.at.the ij thus denied lin claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.
lin timely appealed the ij decision to the bia.on march,a single member of the bia dismissed the appeal.in its written decision,and as noted above,the bia expressly declined to address the ij adverse credibility determination.instead,the bia reasoned that even if lin testimony were taken as true,she could not meet her burden of proof.the bia first concluded that lin failed to establish past persecution because the temporary nature of the iud insertion removes it from the defined and permanent actions described as persecutory within the definition of refugee set forth in section a a of the ina and because lin was never forced to abort a pregnancy or undergo involuntary sterilization at.
turning to her claim of a fear of future persecution,the bia reasoned that,even if lin met her burden of establishing her subjective fear,she had failed to submit any evidence that her fear of returning to china was objectively reasonable.the bia noted that the reasonableness of lin fear of sterilization was undermined because lin was never harmed after fleeing to her aunt home to have her child and because her husband,who remained in china,had not been sterilized.it emphasized that lin had failed to submit what it viewed as reasonably obtainable documents to corroborate her claim,such as a birth certificate for her second daughter or affidavits from her relatives.the bia found that lin claim was further undermined by the fact that she freely obtained a passport and left china without encountering any problems.finally,the bia stated that the possibility that lin might be subjected to criminal prosecution for leaving the country with the aid of a smuggler did not demonstrate a likelihood of persecution under the ina.thus,the bia concluded that lin failed to prove that a reasonable person in her circumstances would fear persecution if returned to china.at.
addressing lin withholding of removal and cat claims,the bia stated 
inasmuch as lin has failed to meet the lower statutory burden of proof required for asylum,it follows that she has also failed to satisfy the higher burden required for withholding of deportation and protection under the convention against torture.
lin timely petitioned for our review of the bia removal order.we possess jurisdiction under a west supp.
in her petition for review,lin principally contends that the bia erred in denying her asylum and withholding of removal claims because she has established both past persecution and a fear of future persecution for her resistance to china coercive program.lin also challenges the denial of her claim for cat protection.
the bia decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the united states is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law.b c.we treat administrative findings of fact as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.we review de novo legal questions determined by the bia,including claims of due process violations,blanco de belbruno ashcroft,cir,affording appropriate deference to the bia interpretation of the ina and any attendant regulations,christensen harris county,d.
an alien seeking asylum must demonstrate that she is unable or unwilling to return to her country of origin because of persecution,or a fear of persecution,on account of her race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a west supp.in response to china policy,congress amended a so that it now provides as follows 
a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
an alien seeking withholding of removal bears the higher burden of showing that it is more likely than not that,if removed to a particular country,her life or freedom would be threatened on account of one of the enumerated grounds.camara ashcroft,cir.an applicant seeking protection under the cat must show that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.
with this statutory backdrop in place,we turn to each of lin arguments.
lin contends that the bia dismissal of her asylum and withholding of removal claims was inappropriate because the bia erred in finding that lin did not establish a fear of future persecution when an alien has suffered past persecution,she is presumed to have the required fear of persecution.b gonahasa,cir.the burden then shifts to the government to establish by a preponderance of the evidence either that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality,b i a,or that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant country of nationality,b i b.b ii.
lin contends that she suffered past persecution for resistance to china coercive population control program through the forced insertion and mandatory continued usage of the iud,thus entitling her to a presumption of a fear of persecution.this argument is premised on our holding in qiao hua li gonzales,cir.in qiao hua li,we held that the single event of iud insertion did not constitute persecution,but we expressly left open the possibility that if qiao hua li had challenged both the required insertion and continuous usage of an iud,we might have found that the iud insertion constituted persecution id.at emphasis added.
the bia has yet to provide a published,precedential opinion addressing whether,and under what circumstances,the forced insertion and continued usage of an iud constitutes persecution.it thus has not afforded the bench,the bar and potential asylum applicants guidance concerning whether and how they might approach the issue.ying zheng,at.in lin case,the bia determined that the temporary nature of the iud insertion removes it from the defined and permanent actions described as persecutory within the definition of refugee set forth in section a a of the ina.at emphasis added.this cursory statement,however,does not provide us enough information to conduct a meaningful review of the bia conclusion that lin has not suffered past persecution.it is unclear from the bia stark invocation of the word temporary how the bia factored the temporary nature of iud insertion and usage into its overall persecution calculus,whether forced iud insertion and continued usage is never persecution or whether it is not persecution only because it did not deprive lin of a significant portion of her reproductive life.see qiao hua li,at cir stating that persecution involves the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom,on account of one of the enumerated grounds in the refugee definition.it will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency action nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.chenery.here,we can not review the bia decision because the bia has given us nothing to review.we would run the risk of violating fundamental principles if we attempted to divine the bia thoughts on this matter and tried to build a legal conclusion in a veritable vacuum where bia interpretation should always first exist.our better judgment keeps us from such overreaching here.
accordingly,we vacate the bia denial of asylum to lin and remand for proceedings consistent with this decision the bia dismissed lin withholding of removal claim solely because it found that she failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum.because of our conclusion as to lin asylum claim,we must also vacate the bia decision dismissing her withholding of removal claim and remand that claim as well 
we also wish to note that the bia decision was signed by a single member,which means that it is not afforded precedential status by the bia.e ii.at least two of our sister circuits have held that nonprecedential decisions by a single member of the bia should not be accorded deference under chevron natural res.def.council,d.rotimi gonzales,cir per curiam holding that the opinion here by a single member of the bia does not merit chevron deference gonzales,cir same.we need not decide today whether we must afford deference to a single member bia decision,for on remand,the bia can,if necessary,bring its full attention to bear on the important issue of whether lin forced iud insertion constituted persecution under the ina if the bia does address this in a precedential decision,there is no doubting that we will owe the decision deference.see,d directing that the bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
lin also asserts that she was denied due process when the ij refused to allow her to testify about the iud insertion procedure.in qiao hua li,we also left open the possibility that we might have found that the iud insertion constituted persecution if the record contained evidence of forcible mistreatment or physical abuse of qiao hua li during the iud insertion.id.at.the government contends that lin claim,like the claim in qiao hua li,fails for a lack of evidence that she underwent anything but a medically routine insertion which typically does not cause pain or lasting side effects.id.at.but when lin attorney asked her to describe the iud insertion procedure,the ij did not allow lin to so testify and instructed counsel to move on.at.
although the government is correct that aliens illegally in this country do not have a fundamental right to remain,harisiades shaughnessy,aliens are entitled to the constitutional protections of the due process clause,mathews diaz,d.see also rusu,cir deportation and asylum hearings are subject to the requirements of procedural due process.lin argues that due process requires that she be given a full and fair hearing in her removal proceeding.the bia itself has stated that the ij must ensure that the applicant presents her case as fully as possible and with all available evidence.in re,bia internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in its decision,the bia did not address lin due process claim.it may be that lin counsel failure to object to the judge curtailment of her testimony forecloses appellate review of this claim.indeed,the bia has held as much before.see essome,wl.lexis,at cir,unpublished the bia found that essome failure to object to the ij disruption and curtailment of her testimony foreclosed appellate review of the claim.but the bia has not so held in this case because it has not addressed the issue.because it is committed to the bia to resolve in the first instance issues relating to asylum requests,we decline to decide lin due process claim and leave it for the bia to address,if necessary,on remand.see gonzales thomas,d per curiam a court of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.rather,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.quoting ventura,d per curiam.
finally,lin contends that the bia erred in dismissing her cat claim.lin applied for protection under the cat based on her fear that she will be jailed and tortured upon return to china because she came to the united states with the help of a snakehead.lin concedes that her cat claim is not related to china coercive policy.the bia dismissed lin cat claim because she failed to carry her burden of proof with respect to her asylum claim inasmuch as the respondent has failed to meet the lower statutory burden of proof required for asylum,it follows that she has also failed to satisfy the higher burden required for protection under the convention against torture.at.
we have noted,however,that cat has a standard independent from the standard for determining an asylum claim,camara,at,so it does not follow that denial of asylum requires denial of cat relief.because the cat inquiry is independent of the asylum analysis,the bia decision as to asylum should never,in itself,be determinative of the alien cat claim.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.indeed,given that cat relief lacks a subjective element,focuses broadly on torture without regard to reasons for that treatment,and requires a showing with respect to future,rather than past treatment,id.at,the cat and asylum analyses focus on different elements and must be treated independently.camara,at quoting ramsameachire,at.
when the bia misapplies the law addressing a cat claim or any other claim,for that matter,the appropriate remedy is to remand so that the agency may apply the correct legal standard in the first instance.menghesha gonzales,cir see also ventura,at.explaining the ordinary remand rule.remand is necessary here because the bia failed to apply the correct legal standard to the cat claim when it treated lin failure to meet the lower statutory burden of proof required for asylum as determinative of the cat claim we therefore remand lin cat claim so that the bia may apply the appropriate legal standard.
for the foregoing reasons,we grant lin petition for review of the bia final order of removal.we remand to the bia for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.
petition for review granted vacated and remanded 
i would deny lin petition for review of the bia denial of her claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat.the bia eligibility determination is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.b c west.because the bia decision,in my opinion,is not manifestly contrary to law,i respectfully dissent.
the bia concluded that lin failed to carry her burden of proving refugee status,eligibility for asylum under the ina.see a dankam gonzales,cir.the ina defines a refugee as an individual who is unable or unwilling to return to his homeland because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a west.the statutory definition,then,permits an alien to prove refugee status by demonstrating that she belongs in one of two categories those who have been persecuted in the past because of one of the protected grounds and those who have a fear of future persecution based on one of the enumerated grounds.see gonzales,cir b.the bia determined that lin failed to prove either that she suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground or that she has a fear of such persecution in the future.
in determining that lin failed to establish past persecution,the bia specifically concluded that an iud insertion procedure,because of its reversible nature,does not qualify as persecution although the record indicates the respondent was required to undergo iud insertion,the temporary nature of the iud insertion removes it from the defined and permanent actions described as persecutory within the ina definition of refugee.the bia order does not specifically reference the continued usage aspect of lin claim rather,the bia rejected the narrower claim that the insertion of an iud alone rises to the level of persecution.such a conclusion is certainly consistent with this court decision in li gonzales,cir.
as chief judge williams rightly points out,however,li left open the possibility that a compulsory iud insertion coupled with mandatory continuous usage might be severe enough to constitute persecution under the ina.see id.although there is little if anything in the record to suggest that the required regular checkups with family planning officials were any more than an afterthought to lin asylum claim,lin brief to the its cue from clear that her past persecution claim included a continued usage component.
nevertheless,even if the alleged acts qualified as persecution under the ina,i would still conclude that the bia decision is not manifestly contrary to the law because of lin failure to offer any evidence establishing a nexus between the iud insertion and her own resistance to china population control policies.
to establish eligibility for asylum based on past persecution,an alien must demonstrate that he suffered persecution on account of a protected ground.see a a.not every morally reprehensible act to which an alien is subject entitles him to protection under the ina unless it occurs on account of one of the protected grounds spelled out therein.gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the protection afforded under the ina does not extend to shield an alien from all indignities that are an unfortunate part of everyday life in the alien homeland.saldarriaga gonzales,cir the ina requires persecution to be on a discrete basis and to fall within one of the enumerated categories.this particularity demonstrates that the asylum statute was not intended as a panacea for the numerous personal altercations that invariably characterize economic and social relationships.
lin seeks political asylum under the amendment to the definition of refugee a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion a b.lin does not claim to have undergone a forced abortion or involuntary sterilization,both of which qualify as past persecution per se,nor does lin allege that she was persecuted for failing or refusing to submit to these procedures.therefore,in order to establish past persecution,lin must demonstrate that she was persecuted for other resistance to china population control policy.a b emphasis added.the statutory text requires that the persecution alleged by lin must have been on account of lin resistance to china population control program.see li ashcroft,cir en banc congress determined that those who resist coercive population control policies should enjoy protection,making the question whether the asylum applicant resistance motivated the government officials to harm her through the forced pregnancy examination.
lin past persecution claim is premised on the insertion of an iud following the birth of her first child and the ensuing mandatory medical checkups with family planning officials to ensure that lin did not remove the device.in her asylum application,lin claimed that she was forced to have an iud inserted shortly after the birth of her first child,that she was required to attend iud checkups regularly,and that t he cadres told us that we could have a second child five years later.lin did not suggest that government officials physically coerced her into undergoing the iud procedure,that she resisted,or that she was in violation of chinese family planning law at the time.similarly,at the asylum hearing,lin testified that the insertion of the iud was contrary to her wishes,but she did not indicate that she resisted or objected to the procedure or that,prior to receiving the iud,she had violated or opposed or resisted china population control laws.in fact,lin documentary evidence suggests that her iud insertion three months after the birth of her first child was consistent with routine protocol followed by fujian province family planning cadre.fuzhou city rules for enforcing the fujian province family planning regulations direct that in agricultural households,iud insertion is mandatory after giving birth to one child.lin submitted a department of justice study on family planning in china indicating that a fter having her first child,within three to six months a woman is required to have an device iud inserted.none of the documentation offered by lin suggests that iud insertion is linked to resistance or opposition to china population control program.and,lin did not suggest that the birth of her first child was or in any way violated family planning regulations,or that,in receiving the iud,lin was treated differently than other birth mothers who undergo iud insertion not because of their resistance to policy but simply because it is standard operating procedure.
although the bia addressed whether lin offered sufficient proof to establish past persecution,it did not specifically address whether lin established that the alleged persecution was for other resistance to a coercive population control program.a b.when the bia has not considered a given issue,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.ins ventura,d per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.generally,a court of appeals is not empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.id.internal quotation marks omitted li,at b ecause neither the board nor the ij addressed the issue of whether the mistreatment li alleges was imposed for other resistance to a coercive population control program,we would be required to remand to the board for an initial determination on that issue if it were necessary to dispose of this case.
we recently considered the rare circumstances exception to the ordinary remand rule in hussain gonzales,cir,concluding that remand to the bia was not required where it was clear from the record that petitioner would be unable to establish a prima facie case that he was eligible for adjustment of status.lin is in a similar position here.not only is there no evidence to suggest that her iud insertion resulted from her resistance,but the evidence suggests quite the lin iud insertion was standard operating procedure.because lin failed to produce any evidence linking her iud procedure to other resistance,she failed,in my view,to establish a prima facie case.under these circumstances,remand for lin to take another shot at her proof is neither necessary nor appropriate.
i would also deny lin petition for review of the bia conclusion that she failed to establish a fear of future persecution.the bia rejection of lin claim of a fear of future persecution is grounded largely on findings of fact,to which we accord substantial deference.the bia findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.having reviewed the record,i would conclude that the bia decision is supported by substantial evidence and i am not able to say that the bia conclusions are manifestly contrary to law.
finally,i would also deny lin petition for review of her claim for relief under the cat.to be eligible for relief under the cat,lin must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.although the bia failed to separate lin asylum and cat claims,which are analytically distinct and require separate analyses,see camara ashcroft,cir,lin failed to submit evidence suggesting it is more likely than not that she would be tortured upon returning to china.accordingly,i can not find the bia decision manifestly contrary to law.
based on the foregoing reasons,i respectfully dissent.
a snakehead is a professional smuggler of chinese migrants.chen gonzales,cir.
accordingly,lin challenge to the ij adverse credibility determination is not before us.
rule of fuzhou city enforcement of the fujian province family planning regulations states that c ouples belong ing to agricultural households have to undertake iud insertion after giving birth to one child sterilization operation after having two children manual abortion if pregnant.at.see also shou yung guo gonzales,cir noting that a document entitled q a for changle city information handbook states that a n iud insertion is mandatory upon birth of a first child sterilization upon birth of a second child.
the department of state office of country reports and asylum affairs specifically referred the ij to the current country reports for adjudication of this case.
according to lin,in asian cultures,daughters leave their family to join their husband family once they marry.indeed,lin is registered in her husband household.lin further c
