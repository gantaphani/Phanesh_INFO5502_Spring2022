in this asylum case,petitioner yidong bu challenges the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirming the immigration judge denial of bu asylum application.because we conclude that the immigration judge misapprended the nature of bu claim that he had suffered past persecution in his native china based on political opinion,and because substantial evidence fails to support the denial of asylum,we find it necessary to remand the case to the immigration court for reconsideration.
factual background 
the facts in bu case were not disputed,and the immigration judge found him to be fully credible.according to bu,prior to fleeing china he had served as the elected chairman of the labor union at a optical equipment factory.as union chairman,bu represented over workers and oversaw the provision of food,clothing,and housing for all of them.he also negotiate d with the head of the factory for these workers salaries and retirement insurance.bu testified that the factory had a history of corruption and bribery and that the problem became markedly worse when,in,the government appointed a new factory director.under the new director,bu stated,t he management of the factory was in a mess and corruption by factory officials became more and more severe.the workers that bu represented took the brunt of this corruption.as bu detailed in his asylum application 
the new factory director sold production equipment at good conditions to his relatives at the prices of discarded equipment.then,he purchased new equipment at high prices to make a profit for himself.he also rented the factory office building facing the road to his son at very low rent so that his son could open a computer company.his relatives and friends worked in the supply department and financial department of the factory.raw materials were purchased at high prices and quality was poor.the cost of our products skyrocketed and lost market competitiveness.the factory officials drove luxury cars and lived in luxury houses.on the other hand,the workers,medical expenses and pensions were all past due.the workers were angry,but did dare to say anything.the factory was depleted slowly and operated at a loss.
at his asylum hearing,bu added that f rom the head of the factory and down to some department heads or leaders in the units,they were all putting monies into their own pocket and ignoring the benefit of these old workers.as a result of this official corruption,the workers lost both their wages and their retirement insurance.
according to bu,by t he state policy to close down,merge and to reorganize businesses running at losses gave the factory officials an other sic chance to make a fortune for themselves.this policy enabled the head of bu factory to attempt the sale of the enterprise to a private party.o n the verge of bankruptcy,bu said,the factory officials decided to sell the factory at a very low price,and a prospective buyer bribed the factory officials to reach an agreement to sell.but the buyer wanted only the factory and not the factory,bu said,not those in poor health conditions or over years old.in an effort to forestall sale of the factory,the workers pleaded with the factory director,who turned a deaf ear to the ir requests.as a result,about workers in the factory,led by bu,staged a strike in front of the factory director office building on or about march,protesting the factory officials corrupt acts of putting monies into their own pockets at the expense of factory workers benefits and livelihood.
the protest was peaceful but at the end of the day,as bu left the strike and headed home,he was followed by two police officers who stopped him and ordered him to accompany them to the police department.there,they put him in an interrogation room,where they questioned him about his involvement in the strike.bu admitted to the officers that he had organized the strike.they informed him that he had been reported for gathering a crowd to make trouble and disturbing social stability,but that if he could dissuade the workers from having another strike they would cease investigating him.when bu declined to cooperate,the police refused to release him.
according to bu,he was then intentionally put into a cell with other criminal inmates who cruelly beat him up at the instruction of the policemen.bu was taken to a cell occupied by eight common criminals.an officer placed bu in the cell and then told the other occupants that bu had lost his mind and instructed them to help him out.the officer then stepped out to smoke and t he prisoners in the cell started to beat bu cruelly.bu explained they hit me and kicked me.i had nowhere to hide.i screamed and passed out.bu stated that he was beaten up hard and that his mouth and nose were bleeding,but the police ignored him.
bu was detained for a total of seven days,during which he was beaten up severely by inmates everyday.he elaborated 
sometimes when i was sleeping,the other inmates hit me hard with a sheet of quilt covered me.it could last for over twenty minutes.sometimes they had someone seize my legs and arms,and someone sit on my back jolting.it was very painful.i could even hear the cluck sound on my back.when we had meals,they always robbed my food.when i was sleeping,they placed the toilet beside my head and did not allow me to move it.the smell of the toilet was so disgusting that i almost thrown up.they spattered the urine to me on purpose when they urinated.i reported to the police but i was told to forbear it.they said that i would never get a good result if i went against the government.
bu family was finally able to bail him out of jail,but for a sum far in excess of the annual income for an urban worker.the police department decision notice on bailing out and awaiting for trial stated that bu had organized illegal meeting,gathered workers to disturb the public security,stroke sic and harassed the social order.when he was released,the police again told bu to dissuade the workers from having another strike or he would have to spend the rest of his life in jail.he was also advised that his case was not over yet and told not to go against the government.as a condition of his release,bu was required to report to the police regularly and was subject to surveillance.
after bu was released,his wife took him to the hospital because he had bruise s everywhere.according to hospital records,bu entered the hospital on the day of his release complaining that he had a s urgical injury on face and head with headache for one week,that he was hit on head and face in a week,and that a fter being beaten,patient felt headache,dizziness and sickness,and thrown up several times.the hospital records describe a cm hematoma on head,painful when touched left face swelled cm wound,painful when touched chest and back has several blood clot left eyelid swelled,conjunctiva become bloodshot.
meanwhile,the director of the factory had lodged charges against bu,discharging him and accusing him of abus ing his official powers,incit ing crowd to harassed sic public security and strike,which affected the production,violated the social order and caused a serious result.while bu was in the hospital,policemen constantly came to his house to inquire about him.bu testified that as a result of his treatment in jail,he was so afraid,he just stayed home and did get in touch with anybody in an effort to avoid being.after a week,he escaped to an aunt house in beijing,where he did dare to go out and just stay ed in until he was able to secure the means to leave the country.since his arrival in the united states,his wife has reported that police have come to his house in china searching for him and indicating that he was guiltier because he had escaped during his time of release on bail.bu wife has also received many threatening phone calls.in addition,bu learned that,after he left china,some of his coworkers had gone to the city government and reported that the head of the factory had sold the equipment,the facilities,and put money into his own pocket and that,as a result,they had been incarcerated for accusing the head of the factory of being corrupt.
