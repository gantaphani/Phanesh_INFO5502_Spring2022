in,congress passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,which inter alia provides all noncitizens a statutory guarantee that they may file one motion to reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the united states,c a,and one motion to reopen proceedings,c a.see dada mukasey,t he statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to each alien the right to file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section.citation omitted.that guarantee was limited in some ways with number,content,and time restrictions but not in any respect by whether the noncitizen had departed the united states prior to filing such motions.
two regulations that predate the passage of iirira hereinafter referred to as the regulatory departure bar provide that a noncitizen who is the subject of immigration proceedings may not make a motion to reopen or reconsider subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.see b concerning motions to reopen or reconsider made before an immigration judge d concerning motion to reopen or reconsider made before the board of immigration appeals bia.in matter of armendarez mendez,i n,bia,the bia held that the regulatory departure bar survives the passage of iirira.here,we consider whether the bia was correct,or whether the regulatory departure bar conflicts with iirira statutory guarantee that noncitizens may file one motion to reopen and one motion to reconsider irrespective of whether they previously departed the united states.
this is not the first time we have examined the regulatory departure bar.as a matter of regulatory interpretation,we have held that the departure bar does not apply to noncitizens who departed the united states either before removal proceedings have commenced,see singh gonzales,cir,or after removal proceedings were completed,see lin gonzales,cir.in considering the relationship between the regulatory departure bar and iirira,we have held that the regulatory departure bar is invalid as applied to a noncitizen who is involuntarily removed from the united states.see reyes torres holder,cir coyt holder,cir.
we have not,however,addressed whether the regulatory departure bar may be validly applied to a noncitizen who voluntarily departs the united states during removal proceedings.although we have never upheld the invocation of the regulatory departure bar in a precedential decision,we have reserved that question.see coyt,at other circuits have considered whether d and b can be applied to any removal voluntary or involuntary a question we need not,and do not,reach in this case.cardoso tlaseca gonzales,cir.now,we address the question,and consistent with every other circuit that has addressed it,we hold the regulatory departure bar invalid irrespective of how the noncitizen departed the united states 
jasbir singh toor petitioner,a native and citizen of india,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis in.in,the former immigration and naturalization service ins approved his petition to remove the conditions on his residence.on august,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against petitioner,charging that he was removable for fraudulently or willfully misrepresenting a material fact on a visa petition in violation of ina a c i,and for lacking a valid entry document at the time of his application for admission in violation of ina a a i i.on november,an immigration judge ij sustained both charges of removability.two days later,the ij granted petitioner until december,to apply for all forms of relief from removal.petitioner did not do so,and on february,the ij considered all requests for relief waived and abandoned,and ordered petitioner removed to india.
petitioner filed a timely motion to reopen or reconsider his removal proceedings,in which he argued that the ij could not validly order him removed to india because petitioner had already departed the united states and arrived in india on april,before the ij ordered him removed.the ij denied petitioner motion,holding that,pursuant to b the regulatory departure bar applicable to proceedings before an immigration judge the ij had no jurisdiction to entertain petitioner motion to reopen or reconsider because petitioner had voluntarily left the united states while his removal proceedings were pending.the bia dismissed petitioner appeal.like the ij,the bia explained that it had no jurisdiction to consider petitioner motion because the regulatory departure bar located for the bia at d precludes a noncitizen from moving the bia to reopen or reconsider his removal proceedings subsequent to his departure from the united states,and petitioner had from the united states during the pendency of administrative proceedings.the instant petition for review followed.
we have jurisdiction to review questions of law presented in a petition for review.a d.we review the bia denial of motions to reopen or to reconsider for abuse of discretion,although de novo review applies to the bia determination of purely legal questions.cano merida,cir quoting mejia ashcroft,cir.the subject of this appeal the validity of the regulatory departure bar presents a purely legal question of statutory interpretation to which we apply de novo review,giving appropriate deference to the agency if warranted.arteaga de alvarez holder,cir.
separate sections in the federal register provide essentially an identical limitation on motions to reopen or to reconsider filed before an ij,on the one hand,and the bia,on the other.the regulation pertaining to motions to reopen or to reconsider made before an ij states,in relevant part 
a motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal,deportation,or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.
b.the regulation pertaining to motions to reopen or to reconsider made before the bia states 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.
d.these regulations compose the regulatory departure bar.in this case,the ij and the bia refused to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner motion to reopen and reconsider because he had voluntarily departed the united states during his immigration proceedings,and therefore was barred by the regulatory departure bar from making a motion to reopen or to reconsider.
petitioner argues that the regulatory departure bar conflicts with the statutory right to file a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider provided in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira.in matter of armendarez mendez,i n,bia,the bia held that the regulatory departure bar,which predated the passage of iirira,remains in full effect after iirira.the bia explained that it saw nothing in the language or legislative history of iirira that would lead it to conclude that iirira was intended to override the existing regulatory scheme governing the filing and adjudication of motions in removal proceedings.id.at.
we apply chevron deference to the board interpretations of ambiguous immigration statutes,if the board decision is a published decision or an unpublished decision directly controlled by a published decision.guevara holder,cir quoting uppal holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the bia issued an unpublished decision,but it was directly controlled by matter of armendarez mendez,a published decision.therefore,we apply chevron deference.under chevron,we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter chevron natural res.def.council.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
here,we hold that congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue the text of iirira makes clear that the statutory right to file a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider is not limited by whether the individual has departed the united states the regulatory departure bar,therefore,fails at the first step of chevron.in so holding,we join every circuit that has resolved this issue under chevron.see santana holder,cir prestol espinal,cir william gonzales,cir garcia carias holder,cir contreras bocanegra holder,cir en banc lin,cir.we recognize that the second,sixth,and seventh circuits have held that the regulatory departure bar is an impermissible contraction of the bia jurisdiction.see luna holder,cir pruidze holder,cir marin rodriguez holder,cir.without necessarily disagreeing with those courts,we choose to resolve this case under chevron because that is the approach taken by six of the nine circuits to have considered the question,and the one that our cases in this area of the law have taken.see reyes torres holder,cir coyt holder,cir.
our inquiry begins with the statutory text,and ends there as well,because the text is clear and unambiguous.satterfield simon schuster,cir quoting mcdonald sun oil,cir internal quotation marks omitted.iirira states inter alia that an alien may file one motion to reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the united states,c a,and that an alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section,c a.the statute does not limit these rights to aliens who have not departed the united states during their immigration proceedings,as the regulatory departure bar would require.the statutory rights are,instead,guaranteed to each alien.the regulatory departure bar conflicts with this clear statutory command.see dada,at the statutory text is plain insofar as it guarantees to each alien the right to file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section.citation omitted santana,at t he provision unambiguously confers upon an alien the authority and the right to file a motion to reopen,in language that admits of no exceptions.william,at because the statute sweeps broadly in this reference to an alien,it need be no more specific to encompass within its terms those aliens who are abroad.garcia carias,at by its clear terms,the statute does not distinguish between those aliens who are abroad and those who remain in the united states the unmodified alien captures both.contreras bocanegra,at the language does not distinguish between noncitizens abroad and those in the united states.
placing these statutory rights in their proper context confirms that iirira invalidated the regulatory departure bar.iirira limits the right to file a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider by number,time,and content,but not in any respect by whether the individual has departed the united states.specifically,the statute provides that a noncitizen may file one motion to reconsider,c a,it must be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,id.c b,and it shall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority,id.c c.similarly,unless the statute exception for victims of domestic violence applies,a noncitizen is limited to one motion to reopen,id.c a,which must be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order,id.c c i,and shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material,id.c b.in contrast,the statute does not contain any requirement that the noncitizen filing a motion to reconsider or a motion to reopen remain physically present in the united states during the immigration proceedings.indeed,it contains no restriction of any kind.
when congress provides exceptions in a statute,t he proper inference is that congress considered the issue of exceptions and,in the end,limited the statute to the ones set forth.united states johnson.as the tenth circuit explained,t his principle is particularly pertinent in the iirira context,given that congress was undoubtedly aware of the regulatory bar.contreras bocanegra,at.applied here,therefore,the proper inference is that congress considered whether to bar motions to reopen or to reconsider from noncitizens who had departed the united states,and chose not to do so.the statute contains several exceptions to the general grant of a right to file a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider,but does not contain any related to whether the noncitizen previously departed the united states.the regulatory departure bar unambiguously conflicts with this decision by congress.see garcias carias,at the fact that congress created limitations on the exercise of the motion to reopen,yet did not place a geographic restriction,supports a reading that does not deny departed aliens their right to file a motion to reopen.lin,at congress clearly considered and included some restrictions on the ability to file a motion to reopen but chose not to make a limitation based on the alien physical location.
moreover,subsequent enactments by congress further demonstrate that it knew how to include a requirement on motions to reopen,yet did not do so for all noncitizens who make such a motion contrary to the regulatory departure bar,which applies to all noncitizens.see food drug admin.brown williamson tobacco,t he meaning of one statute may be affected by other acts,particularly where congress has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the topic at hand.with changes enacted in and congress provided that the number and time limitations on filing a motion to reopen do not apply to battered spouses,children,and parents,c c iv,as long as such individuals are physically present in the united states at the time of filing the motion,id.c c iv iv.no other requirement exists in the statute governing motions to reopen and motions to reconsider.
the addition of a requirement confirms that the omission of a departure bar from the statute governing motions to reopen and motions to reconsider was deliberate.where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.here,congress included a requirement in the section of the statute concerning tardy or successive motions to reopen filed by battered spouses,children,and parents,but did not include any requirements elsewhere in the statute.therefore,we must presume that congress intentionally excluded a requirement from its general grant of a statutory right to file a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider.see santana,at this provision shows that congress knew how to impose a geographic restriction when it wanted to,and further suggests that the statute general provisions do not contain such a limitation.lin,at explaining that the requirement included in the statute leads to an inference that congress intentionally chose not to require such presence for a motion to reopen,except in the specified circumstances.
moreover,congress must have understood that iirira invalidated the regulatory departure bar.as the third circuit explained,there would have been no need for congress in its enactments subsequent to iirira to provide a requirement for victims of domestic violence filing motions to reopen if iirira had left the regulatory departure bar undisturbed.prestol espinal,at.in fact,the argument to the contrary that the regulatory departure bar survived iirira,yet congress nevertheless provided the requirement for victims of domestic violence filing late or successive motions to reopen would require us to read the latter provision as mere surplusage,in direct violation of the fundamental canon of statutory construction that a statute should not be construed so as to render any of its provisions mere surplusage.united states wenner,cir see also william,at we can go beyond simply drawing an inference regarding congress intent in this case,for a finding that physical presence in the united states is required before any motion to
