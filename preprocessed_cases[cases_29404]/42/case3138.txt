immigration law changes over time.new statutes are enacted agency interpretations change new appellate and supreme court decisions issue.our questions concern how those legal changes affect an individual ordered deported from the united states when,as it turns out,the law concerning the grounds for deportation,or for denial of relief from deportation,changes after the individual is ordered deported.
here,macario jesus bonilla,formerly a lawful permanent resident of the united states,was deported to el salvador in following a misdemeanor firearms conviction.he later reentered the united states without inspection and,much later,filed a motion to reopen,his second,on the ground that his original lawyer did not properly advise him how to adjust his status after he married a united states citizen.the motion was untimely,but bonilla argued he was entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period.
after the supreme court announced a change in law that placed in question the legality of the original deportation,bonilla supplemented his motion to reopen.the supplement asked the board of immigration appeals bia or board to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his deportation order to permit him to file for relief from deportation.the board denied both bonilla motion and his request for sua sponte reopening.bonilla now petitions for review.
we conclude that bonilla was not entitled to equitable tolling and so deny review as to the adjustment of status issue.but,in agreement with every circuit that has squarely addressed the issue,we hold that we have authority to review refusals to reopen sua sponte to the limited degree that the refusal was based on legal error.because we conclude the board decision in this case was based on a legally erroneous premise,we grant the petition for review,vacate the board denial,and remand to the board to exercise its broad discretionary authority as to sua sponte reopening against the correct legal backdrop.
background 
macario jesus bonilla is a native and citizen of el salvador.he entered the united states in and became a lawful permanent resident in.
in,bonilla was convicted of misdemeanor possession of a concealed firearm in a motor vehicle and placed in deportation proceedings.an immigration judge ij concluded that because bonilla had been a lawful permanent resident for fewer than seven years and had been convicted of a firearms offense,he was ineligible for any form of relief under the immigration and nationality act of ina,including a waiver of inadmissibility under former c the ij therefore ordered him deported.
bonilla appealed the decision to the bia,pro se.in october,the board affirmed,on the ground that the reason for bonilla deportation his firearms conviction precluded his eligibility for c relief.
bonilla married ana lilian bonilla,a united states citizen,in february.at the time of the marriage,the couple had an infant son,jessie,also a united states citizen.after the marriage,a notario advised bonilla to surrender himself and present his marriage certificate to immigration officials.bonilla did so,and was taken to the san pedro detention center.
while bonilla was detained,his father and ana met with and retained manuel rivera,an immigration attorney,who assured them he could get bonilla out of detention and stop his deportation.ana asked rivera if there were any forms she or bonilla should file rivera said no.on march,rivera filed with the board a motion to reopen for adjustment of status and a request for stay of deportation.he also filed an application for a stay of deportation with the immigration and naturalization service ins.
the board and ins denied the stay requests,and bonilla was deported to el salvador.rivera then told ana there was nothing more he could do.he never sent bonilla or ana any copies of the documents he filed or received on bonilla behalf.
shortly thereafter,the board denied bonilla motion to reopen for adjustment of status.to have his status adjusted,the board explained,bonilla had to make an application for adjustment of status have an immigrant visa immediately available to him at the time of filing his application and be eligible to receive a visa and be admissible for permanent residence.bonilla never filed an application for adjustment of status form,and an immigrant visa petition form was never filed on his behalf.as there was no indication in the record that bonilla could have had an immigrant visa immediately available to him,the board denied the motion to reopen.
bonilla and ana then retained another immigration attorney,philip abramowitz.abramowitz advised ana to file an immigrant visa petition on bonilla behalf.she did so on october,the petition was approved on june.during the course of his representation,abramowitz never told bonilla that the board had denied his motion to reopen in may,nor that rivera should have filed an immigrant visa petition and an application for adjustment of status.
in may,while in el salvador,bonilla was shot by gang members.soon after,he fled the country and reentered the united states without inspection.
in,bonilla consulted a pro bono attorney at an immigration workshop.he explained his case and showed her all of the documents he had.the attorney told bonilla there was nothing she could do to help him.he had to wait a few years before he could seek legal assistance to fix his immigration case,she said.
bonilla then waited six years to seek further legal assistance.in,bonilla and ana met with eddie bonilla no relation at servicio latino legal offices.eddie bonilla claimed to be a licensed immigration attorney but,it turned out,was not he was a notary unlawfully practicing law.eddie bonilla reviewed bonilla documents and told bonilla he had to wait another year before taking any action.in,bonilla returned and retained eddie bonilla to represent him.eddie bonilla filed with the board a pro se motion to reopen or reconsider the denial of appeal.the motion was denied.
still pursuing her husband case,ana consulted with stacy tolchin,bonilla current attorney,in the fall of.unlike the lawyers and faux lawyer consulted earlier,tolchin obtained bonilla immigration files from this court,and informed bonilla and ana that the board had denied bonilla first motion to reopen back in may.she also advised them that an immigrant visa petition should have been filed before filing the motion to reopen,which rivera had not told them.
on december,tolchin filed a motion to reopen bonilla deportation order based on ineffective assistance of counsel.shortly thereafter,the supreme court decided judulang holder.judulang disapproved a bia practice concerning the granting of c relief invoking the change of law announced in judulang,tolchin filed on bonilla behalf a supplement to his motion to reopen,asking the board to exercise its sua sponte jurisdiction and reopen his deportation order so that he could apply for c relief under judulang.
the board denied bonilla motion to reopen for adjustment of status.it held that equitable tolling of the filing period was not merited,as bonilla did not demonstrate either due diligence or prejudice.in addition,the board declined to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen the deportation proceedings.bonilla timely filed a petition for review.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under to review the board denial of bonilla motion to reopen for adjustment of status.see avagyan holder,cir.we review the board denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion,but review purely legal questions de novo.see iturribarria ins,cir.the bia abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.avagyan,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court recently left open the question whether federal courts may review the board decision not to reopen removal proceedings sua sponte.kucana holder.before kucana,we had held that,generally,we lack jurisdiction to review denials of sua sponte reopening.see ekimian ins,cir.but we have not specifically addressed whether we have jurisdiction to review the board denial of a motion to reopen sua sponte for the limited purpose of determining whether the board based its decision on legal or constitutional error.several circuits have held that courts of appeal do have such limited jurisdiction.see,holder,cir.pllumi attorney general,cir.mahmood holder,cir.for reasons explained in part,infra,we agree with those decisions.
iii.discussion 
motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on ineffective assistance of.ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis for equitable tolling 
generally,a motion to reopen must be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,c c i,and an alien is limited to one such motion.id.c a.but,because bonilla final deportation order preceded the imposition of the current time and number limitations on motions to reopen,his motion to reopen was due by september.see executive office for immigration review motions and appeals in immigration proceedings,fed.reg.bonilla did not file the motion to reopen at issue in this case until december,more than fifteen years late.
failure to meet the filing deadline is not fatal where equitable tolling is available ineffective assistance of counsel is one basis for equitable tolling.singh holder,cir.equitable tolling applies in ineffective assistance of counsel cases because,a lthough there is no sixth amendment right to counsel in a deportation proceeding,the due process guarantees of the fifth amendment still must be afforded to an alien petitioner.avagyan,at citation omitted.ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding denies an alien petitioner his due process rights if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.id.at citation omitted.erroneous legal advice that results in the petitioner failing to file a timely motion to reopen is such a denial of due process.id.consequently,we recognize equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of his attorney deception,fraud,or error,as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception,fraud,or error.id.quoting iturribarria,at.
to determine whether a petitioner exercised due diligence,we consider three factors if and when a reasonable person in petitioner position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying her motion to reopen whether petitioner took reasonable steps to investigate the attorney suspected fraud or error,or,if petitioner is ignorant of counsel shortcomings,whether petitioner made reasonable efforts to pursue relief and when the tolling period should end that is,when petitioner definitively learns of the harm resulting from counsel deficiency.avagyan,at citations omitted.the petitioner need not act with the maximum diligence possible only due or reasonable diligence.id.internal quotation marks omitted.our review of the petitioner diligence is and,assessing the reasonableness of petitioner actions in the context of his or her particular circumstances.id.
review of bonilla asserted diligence 
bonilla argued in his motion to reopen for adjustment of status that the board should reopen its decision affirming his order of deportation because his first attorney,manuel rivera,and the notary posing as an attorney,eddie bonilla,both provided ineffective assistance.bonilla acknowledged that the motion was filed many years past the deadline for filing such motions,but contended that he had demonstrated due diligence during,and therefore was entitled to equitable tolling for,the years between and.
the board disagreed,holding,inter alia,that bonilla did not act with due diligence,as there was a six year gap between and in his pursuit of legal advice.we enforce the denial of the motion to reopen on this ground,and so do not reach the board other bases for denying the motion to reopen.assuming,therefore,that bonilla was indeed ignorant of his prior counsel shortcomings when he consulted his present attorney in,avagyan,at,the question is whether bonilla made reasonable efforts to pursue relief,despite that lapse.id.
bonilla explained that he did not seek any legal assistance from to because he was following the advice of the pro bono attorney he consulted at an immigration workshop that attorney told him to wait a few years.bonilla contends that it was reasonable for him to rely on the immigration workshop attorney advice.
taking into account the particular circumstances,avagyan,at,we note,first,that bonilla did give the attorney what he thought to be the necessary information about his case and had no reason to believe her advice incorrect.but bonilla appears to have had no meaningful or sustained relationship with that attorney he did not provide her name,for example,nor any details about the immigration workshop,such as its sponsoring organization or location.lacking any continuing connection to the lawyer or the sponsoring organization,he could not,and did not,follow up with her,nor she with him.nor did bonilla explain the basis for the attorney recommendation to wait,perhaps because she did not offer one,or because he did not understand or remember what she said.
most importantly,although the attorney advised bonilla to wait a few years to seek further legal help,she did not advise him how long to wait.because of the lack of any ongoing relationship,she was in no position to contact him when the appropriate time to seek relief had arrived and did not do so.
in the end,bonilla waited six years to take any further action to negate the deportation order.he provides no explanation for waiting that long.
given the exceedingly long lapse of time before seeking further legal advice,the lack of any continuing relationship or follow up with the lawyer relied upon,and the general nature of the advice offered,the bia appropriately concluded that bonilla did not make reasonable efforts to pursue relief,avagyan,at,and so did not demonstrate the diligence necessary for equitable tolling 
we deny bonilla petition for review as to the motion to reopen for adjustment of status.
motion to reopen sua sponte 
after the supreme court rejected the approach in judulang,see note,supra,bonilla asked the board to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his deportation order so that he could now apply for c relief,as judulang would allow.the board denied the request.maintaining that the board denial of sua sponte reopening rested on an erroneous legal premise,bonilla asks that we correct the error and vacate the board denial of sua sponte relief.
we conclude that we do have jurisdiction to review the board decision so as to assure that the board made its discretionary decision on the correct understanding of the applicable legal principles.as the board premised its decision on an erroneous understanding of the legal principles concerning the relationship between prior deportation,reopening of deportation proceedings,and eligibility for c relief,we will grant the petition and return the case to the board for further consideration.
origins of the board sua sponte reopening authority 
we begin our consideration of the jurisdictional question before us by revisiting some history of the concept of reopening.
originally,in the immigration context,reopening was a judicial creation dada mukasey,citing federal court cases reviewing administrative decisions denying motions to reopen removal proceedings from the early.in,the year the bia was established,the attorney general promulgated a rule for the reopening and reconsideration of removal proceedings id.at citing fed.reg,final rule codified at.
today,the board authority to grant or deny a motion to reopen is still found in a regulation,a,which closely follows the version.dada,at.the current regulation provides 
the board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.the decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion of the board,subject to the restrictions of this section.the board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.
until,there was no time limit for requesting reopening.dada,at.in,congress,fearful that deportable or excludable aliens were trying to prolong their stays in the by filing one type of discretionary relief after another in immigration proceedings,ordered the attorney general to issue regulations limiting the number of motions and setting a maximum time period within which to file them.id.citation and internal alterations omitted.although t he attorney general found little evidence of abuse,congress did not rescind or adjust its request.id.so,in,the department of justice issued a regulation imposing time limits and filing restrictions.id.citing executive office for immigration review motions and appeals in immigration proceedings,fed.reg.congress then codified those rules in the illegal immigration reform and responsibility act of iirira.id.at.
iirira provided the first statutory right to a motion to reopen holder,cir.citing c.with certain narrow exceptions,iirira limited an alien to one motion to reopen,to be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.c a,c c i.iirira thus transform ed the motion to reopen from a regulatory procedure to a statutory form of relief available to the alien.kucana,at alteration in original quoting dada,at.
notwithstanding the statutory provisions that now provide the contours of the reopening process,congress never codified the regulation specifically authorizing the board to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider.kucana,at.the regulation codified at a thus remains the sole enunciation of the reach of that power.id.at.
since the enactment of iirira,where the timing and numerosity statutory requirements are not met and equitable tolling is unavailable,the only way an alien can reopen an adverse final order of removal is to ask the board to exercise its sua sponte authority that is,to reopen the case on its own motion.a see also in re,interim decision bia discussing the board limited discretionary powers under the regulations to reopen or reconsider cases on its own motion.neither the authorizing regulation,a,nor iirira statutory provisions supply a standard for the board to apply when deciding whether to grant or deny a motion to reopen sua sponte.
the board has,however,articulated some general parameters for the exercise of its sua sponte powers.it has cautioned that its sua sponte power to reopen is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations,where enforcing them might result in hardship.in re,at.rather,the board must be persuaded that the respondent situation is truly exceptional before it will intervene.in re,bia.for example,sua sponte action by the board is appropriate where there has been a fundamental change in the law that represents a departure from established principles.id.at.importantly,however,the board is not required by regulation or its own decisions to reopen proceedings sua sponte in exceptional situations.ekimian,at.
jurisdiction to review the board decision to deny a motion to reopen sua sponte 
ekimian held that we ordinarily lack jurisdiction to review a board decision denying sua sponte reopening,as the breadth and generality of the truly exceptional situations locution,in re,at,provides no judicially manageable standard with which to do so.ekimian,at.
the board had denied the ekimians motion to reopen sua sponte because it did not find sufficient grounds to warrant doing so.id.at.the ekimians then petitioned for review,arguing that because the board had stated that it could reopen proceedings sua sponte in exceptional situations,id.quoting in re,at,this court had jurisdiction to review the bia determination that exceptional situations do not exist for abuse of discretion.id.we rejected that argument.id.at.
in doing so,we took some guidance from heckler chaney,which considered the provisions for judicial review of agency actions set out in the administrative procedure act.ekimian,at.in particular,a provides that the chapter on judicial review does not apply when an agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.heckler explained that,under a,even where congress has not affirmatively precluded review,review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.heckler,at.this exception to judicial review is very narrow,and applies in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.id.quoting citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,internal quotation marks omitted.drawing on heckler,ekimian explained that the ekimians could not point to any statutory,regulatory,or case law definition of exceptional circumstances applicable to the bia sua sponte power under a,and so rejected the argument that exceptional situations was a meaningful judicial standard for reviewing the board discretion.at.because we could not discover a sufficiently meaningful standard against which to judge the bia decision not to reopen sua sponte,ekimian held,we do not have jurisdiction to review the bia refusal to reopen deportation proceedings sua sponte.id.at.
ekimian holding that the exceptional situation benchmark does not provide a sufficiently meaningful standard to permit judicial review remains good law.this court has relied on or approvingly cited ekimian in fifteen published opinions but neither ekimian nor any of the later cases considered the question presented here whether appellate courts have jurisdiction to review the board denial of a motion to reopen sua sponte for the limited purpose of identifying legal or constitutional error.
neither the immigration statute nor any regulation expressly precludes judicial review of motions to reopen,whether sua sponte or otherwise.absent any such proscription,there is a presumption favoring interpretations of statutes to allow judicial review of administrative action.kucana,at alterations in original quoting reno catholic soc,see also gutierrez de martinez lamagno,executive determinations generally are subject to judicial review.that presumption is,kucana,at quoting catholic soc,at,and particularly important where legal and constitutional questions are at issue.
for example,iirira stripped courts of jurisdiction to review most discretionary decisions or actions of the attorney general and secretary of homeland security,the authority for which was specified under a particular statutory subchapter.see a b ii.the real id act of clarified,however,that courts were not precluded from reviewing constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.id.a d.the recognition in a d that legal or constitutional issues are reviewable even when the statute makes the underlying decision discretionary is reflective of a general recognition that there is no preclusion of such review if otherwise ordinarily available.indeed,our court held that we retained jurisdiction over legal and constitutional questions raised regarding bia discretionary decisions even before congress so stated in the real id act,further confirming the strength of the presumption of reviewability.see,ashcroft,cir.explaining that iirira did not eliminate our jurisdiction over purely legal questions citing ins,cir.ashcroft,cir.ins,cir.holding that we had jurisdiction to review a bia decision for the denial of due process.
our recent decision in singh holder,cir,confirms that we may review denials of sua sponte reopening where,unlike in ekimian and similar cases,there is law to apply in doing so.singh argued in his petition for review that the board abused its discretion when it erroneously concluded that it lacked authority under a to reopen his exclusion proceedings so that he could pursue an adjustment of status application.singh,at.we concluded that ekimian did not preclude our jurisdiction.id.the jurisdictional bar announced in ekimian,we explained,rests on the absence of a judicially manageable standard for us to evaluate the bia exercise of discretion in ruling on a motion to reopen.id.in singh,however,the bia did not deny a motion to reopen as an exercise of discretion it conclude d that it lack ed the authority to reopen.id.
singh held that the board conclusion as to its lack of authority was contrary to plain statutory language and our court precedents,and thus was legal error.id.at.singh then granted the petition for review and remanded the case to the board for an exercise of its discretion that is,for a decision whether there were truly exceptional circumstances,a decision that remains unreviewable under ekimian.id.singh thus limited our review to the board legal conclusion that,because of legal preclusion,it could not exercise its discretion.
there is little distinction as to judicial reviewability between the situation in singh and the circumstances here.bonilla contention,upon which we elaborate below,is that the board misunderstood the parameters of c relief as applied to a legal permanent resident who had been deported and,based on that misunderstanding,concluded that it would not exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen because it would,in the end,lack the legal authority to grant the relief requested.just as in singh,there is law to apply in reviewing that question here,the substantive law governing c relief when there has been a deportation of a lawful permanent resident.reviewing that legal question will simply assure that the board decision whether there is a truly exceptional situation meriting sua sponte relief is made on a proper understanding of the underlying law.
we therefore conclude that,as in singh,this court has jurisdiction to review board decisions denying sua sponte reopening for the limited purpose of reviewing the reasoning behind the decisions for legal or constitutional error.if,upon exercise of its jurisdiction,this court concludes that the board relied on an incorrect legal premise,it should remand to the bia so it may exercise its authority against the correct legal background.pllumi,at quoting mahmood,at.once it does so,this court will have no jurisdiction to review the sua sponte decision,as ekimian instructs.
in so ruling,we join three other circuits the second,third,and tenth see,at pllumi,at w hen presented with a bia decision rejecting a motion for sua sponte reopening,we may exercise jurisdiction to the limited extent of recognizing when the bia has relied on an incorrect legal premise.mahmood,at w here the agency may have declined to exercise its sua sponte authority because it misperceived the legal background and thought,incorrectly,that a reopening would necessarily fail,remand to the agency for reconsideration in view of the correct law is appropriate.see also holder,cir.w e do not mean to foreclose review of the board denial of a motion to reopen sua sponte in cases where a petitioner has a plausible constitutional or legal claim that the board misapplied a legal or constitutional standard.to our knowledge,no circuit squarely presented with this issue has held to the contrary 
application of jurisdiction to the board denial of bonilla motion to reopen sua sponte 
we turn to the limited legal question over which we do have jurisdiction was the board denial of bonilla motion to reopen sua sponte premised on an erroneous legal understanding 
bonilla contends that the board refused to grant his motion for sua sponte reopening despite the substantial change in the law worked by judulang because it believed,incorrectly,that bonilla had lost his lawful permanent resident status when he was deported and,even if reopening were granted,could not regain it.as a consequence,posits bonilla,the board believed he could never have sufficient lawful presence to become eligible for c relief,because he had accrued fewer than seven years of lawful domicile in the united states at the time the board issued its final order of deportation.see c.
we agree with bonilla that any such conclusion about the irrevocable loss of lawful permanent resident status would be legally incorrect.generally,an alien lawful permanent resident status ends upon entry of a final administrative order of deportation.matter of lok,bia.but if the bia grants a motion to reopen,or a reviewing court holds that the bia should have granted a motion to reopen,the final deportation order is vacated that is,it is as if it never occurred.nken holder,see also mukasey,cir.explaining that s everal courts of appeals,including the ninth circuit,have held that a grant of a motion to reopen vacates the final order of deportation,overruled on other grounds by holder,cir.en banc.the previously terminated immigration proceedings thus are reinstated,and the alien is restored to his prior status.see immigration and customs enforcement,facilitating the return to the united states of certain lawfully removed aliens,w hen a pfr is granted that returns a former lpr to the posture of a alien,the alien will once again,in contemplation of law,be an lpr even though removal proceedings may still be pending before eoir on remand from the circuit court.here,were the board to grant bonilla motion to reopen sua sponte,his previous deportation proceedings would be reinstated and he would be restored to his prior status as a lawful permanent resident,unless and until the new proceedings result in a removal order.
in bonilla case,restoration of his lawful permanent resident status could result in acquisition of seven years of unrelinquished lawful domicile.bonilla was admitted as a lawful permanent resident on february.the bia issued its final order of deportation on october,which stopped the clock four months short of the necessary seven years.see,foroughi ins,cir.when an order of deportation is administratively final,it ends the accrual of lawful permanent residence time.but bonilla was not deported to el salvador until march.thus,if his lawful permanent resident status were restored,he would have accrued unrelinquished lawful domicile from february,to march,a period of just over seven years.
the government did not engage with the merits of the alleged legal error in its brief or at oral argument.instead,it maintained that the board did not make the ruling of law bonilla attributes to it.we disagree.
bonilla had specifically addressed whether he had the requisite time and status for c relief in his reply brief to the board he explained how he could satisfy the requirement,arguing that i f his case is reopened by the board,then respondent would be restored back to the status of a lawful permanent resident,and as a lawful permanent resident from the time of entry until he was deported,he would have been lawfully domiciled for more than seven years 
the relevant portion of the board decision reads 
the respondent was not eligible for either a waiver of inadmissibility or adjustment of status at the time a final order had been entered by the board on october,or within the time period to file a timely motion to reopen,or on or before september.under the controlling authority at that time,the respondent was not eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section c of the act due to his firearms conviction.moreover,the respondent lawful permanent resident status terminated upon the entry of the final administrative order by the board,and he no longer accrued lawful domicile.matter of lok,i n bia 
based on the totality of the circumstances presented in this case,and the arguments raised in the motion and its supplements,we conclude that sua sponte reopening of the respondent deportation proceedings is inappropriate.the respondent lost his lawful permanent resident status upon this board entry of a final order on october.see matter of lok,supra.the final deportation order was lawfully executed on march,and the respondent returned to el salvador.his deportation is a transformative event that fundamentally alters the alien posture under the law.matter of armendarez,i n,bia.despite the change in law set forth in judulang holder,supra,we do not find that proceedings should be reopened.the respondent has not addressed the effect of his deportation on his current eligibility for a c waiver whether he can meet the lawful unrelinquished domicile requirement 
we are persuaded that the board based it
