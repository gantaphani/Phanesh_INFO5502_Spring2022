petitioner,donald hanaj,entered the united states without admission,parole or inspection through canada,and applied for asylum in.the asylum application was also considered as a request for withholding of removal and for protection under the united nations convention against torture.the immigration judge denied his application,and ordered him removed,and the bia summarily affirmed.hanaj now seeks relief from this court.
at the hearing,the immigration judge was presented with the testimony of hanaj,as well as that of numerous witnesses.we turn first to hanaj testimony.
hanaj testified that he is an ethnic albanian who was born in gjilan,kosovo,on may,and resided there until april when he was forced to leave due to persecution by serbian officials.his father was an active member in the league democratic of kosovarian ldk,a political party opposed to serbian rule over kosovo,and hanaj and his brother later became members as well.when hanaj was ten or eleven years old,his father moved to germany because the serbian special police sought to kill him for his political activities.hanaj brother,eduard,was later forced to leave as well,and he ultimately obtained asylum in england.the police searched hanaj home on several occasions for evidence relating to the departure of his father and brother,and threatened to burn down the home if they found anything incriminating.hanaj formally joined the ldk in when he was sixteen,and received a membership card.at the hearing,hanaj was questioned as to why his membership card contained the dates of to.he testified that the ldk used old cards because they lacked the means to make new ones.
in,several police officers approached hanaj on the street,speaking to him in serbian.when he responded to them in albanian,they became angry and hit and kicked him for ten minutes,leaving scars on his lip and shin.hanaj went to the hospital,but was refused treatment because he was albanian.a few months later,a vehicle hanaj was driving was stopped at a police roadblock and searched,and ldk leaflets were found under the car seat.hanaj and his friends were then transported to the police station,where they were separated.hanaj was then questioned about ldk and his father.he denied any involvement with ldk,and foreswore knowledge of his father whereabouts.hanaj also refused to identify ldk members whose pictures he was shown.during this interrogation,he was first struck repeatedly on his head.the police then handcuffed him and chained the handcuff to a hook on the wall,leaving him hanging by the chain.he was then beaten with a whip and a wooden stick.when he began to fade in and out of consciousness,the police removed him from the wall and beat the soles of his feet with a wooden stick until they were bleeding and swollen.he was subsequently placed in a cell which contained water and salt on the floor to exacerbate those wounds.three days later,hanaj found himself at a hospital,but had no recollection as to how he got there or what transpired in the interim.it took a month of care at home before hanaj recovered from those injuries.
hanaj had yet another violent encounter with the police when he was about seventeen years old,after a search at a roadblock again yielded banned materials including ldk leaflets and a book about kosovo.he was interrogated,hit with wooden sticks and a riding crop,and once again placed in a basement cell.this aggravated his prior injuries.
in november,hanaj and approximately other ethnic albanians gathered in a demonstration led by the leader of the local ldk,to celebrate albanian flag day.when the serbian police tried to break up the demonstration,the albanians responded by throwing rocks,and the serbian police then shot into the crowd.one of hanaj close friends,naim frasheri,was hit by a bullet.hanaj and his friends took naim to hanaj house,where naim died shortly thereafter.
the final event precipitating hanaj departure occurred in april,when his father unexpectedly returned home.shortly after his arrival,hanaj mother responded to a knock at the door.upon opening the door,she encountered the serbian police,who struck her on the head with the butt of a gun,and she fell to the ground unconscious.the police kicked hanaj father and then searched him,finding an albanian flag and a book by a national ldk leader.when hanaj father spit on the police,they shot and killed him.at that time,hanaj fled to his uncle house,where his uncle gave him some money and sent him to a cousin in macedonia.because many serbs lived in macedonia,his cousin recommended that hanaj continue on to greece.after arriving in greece,hanaj contacted his uncle and learned that his parents had both died and that a warrant for hanaj arrest had been left at hanaj home.
eventually,hanaj traveled to canada by ship.once there,he climbed under a truck and hid in the space where a spare tire is normally kept.the truck crossed the border into the united states,and when it slowed to a near stop,hanaj jumped out.he made his way by bus from that location in plattsburg,new york,to chicago.
in support of his asylum application,hanaj introduced his birth certificate,the arrest warrant that his uncle mailed to him in greece,his ldk membership card,and the international driver license that he had with him when he fled kosovo.he further presented the testimony and affidavits of many witnesses to corroborate his claim of torture and persecution.among those was the affidavit of james sanders,who documented scars on hanaj heel,head,shoulder,back,palms and leg consistent with his allegations of the beatings.sanders is a family physician,who has worked at the center for victims of torture in minneapolis,minnesota,and established the advocates of survivors of trauma and torture in baltimore,maryland.he received education in the examination,diagnosis and treatment of torture survivors at harvard and columbia universities.he also served as a program officer for a large international relief operation in kosovo in.hanaj further submitted an affidavit of alison duncombe,a physical therapist who spent four sessions with hanaj to treat him for back,leg,and neck pain and frequent headaches.
hanaj also presented testimony from julie mertus,a human rights professor and a specialist on country conditions in kosovo.mertus testified that hanaj description as to the type of torture he experienced was consistent with the descriptions provided during that time period by numerous ethnic albanians in kosovo who mertus had interviewed,especially his experience in being beaten on the bottom of the feet and placed in wet cells.mertus testified as to her belief that the serbian police were trained to act in a specific way and that there was a pattern and practice to the type of torture hanaj experienced.her testimony further detailed her extensive experience in kosovo,including as the author of a book on kosovo based on ten years of study and extensive field work.she was asked to participate on a task force convened by the white house on the future of kosovo,and visited kosovo on a trip.
in addition,hanaj introduced the testimony of steven patt,a psychiatrist who had been treating hanaj once or twice a month for approximately fifteen months as of the time of the hearing,for a total of approximately sessions of minutes each.patt diagnosed hanaj as definitely suffering from stress disorder ptsd,and after months of treatment had prescribed medication for hanaj to ease the symptoms.patt testified that he does not doubt the truth of what hanaj described to him regarding his experiences in kosovo.patt added that in his profession,he listens to patients with the understanding that they are not always truthful,but that he found hanaj to be very reliable.throughout the many months of treatment,hanaj was detailed in describing what happened and was consistent in that patt did not hear anything from him that conflicted with anything heard at a different time,including his descriptions of the beatings by the police,the fatal shooting of his friend,and the deaths of his parents.moreover,patt further stated that hanaj descriptions were plausible and that everything in his clinical picture fit w
