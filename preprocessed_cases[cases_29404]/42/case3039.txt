this matter arises out of exclusion proceedings before an immigration judge which resulted in an in abstentia order finding teresa gonzalez de jimenez petitioner subject to exclusion and deportation following her failure to appear at a hearing.she now petitions this court for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her motion to reconsider its earlier denial of her motion to reopen the case.petitioner maintains that the bia abused its discretion in denying her the opportunity to establish reasonable cause for her failure to appear at the hearing.she argues,among other things,that the bia misapplied its own precedent and erroneously disregarded evidence she had presented.for the reasons stated below,we grant the petition for review and remand the case to the bia with instructions.

the rescheduled hearing was set for august,at,to be held before an immigration judge located in chicago,illinois.to accommodate petitioner venue request,the hearing was to be conducted telephonically.petitioner and the government attorney were duly notified to appear at the ins district office in kansas city,missouri.
on the morning of august,the government attorney timely appeared at the ins office in kansas city,but petitioner did not.on the government motion,the immigration judge issued an exclusion order against petitioner in absentia.petitioner did not call the ins office or the immigration court on the date of the hearing to explain her failure to appear.

petitioner timely filed an appeal with the bia as instructed.her appeal was pro se.in a handwritten letter,she explained that she could not afford an attorney.she further asserted that she had missed the august hearing because of a sick child and trouble locating the building,and she asked the bia to give her a second chance.at pro se appeal.
three years later,on march,the bia dismissed petitioner appeal.at in re teresa gonzalez de jimenez,file no.bia.in dismissing petitioner administrative appeal,the bia explained 
a n in abstentia order is proper in exclusion proceedings if the alien has been given an opportunity to be present and without reasonable cause fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance.where an alien later establishes that he or she had reasonable cause for the failure to appear,the immigration judge order may be vacated and proceedings may be reopened,or the alien may appeal the adverse decision directly to the board,as the alien has done in the case before us.in exclusion proceedings,the reasonable cause standard will be applied.
an alien has an obligation to appear in immigration court at the time and date indicated on a notice of hearing.normally,a valid excuse for an alien absence will be reasonable under the circumstances of the case and will be substantiated by evidentiary material or an affidavit.the applicant has submitted no affidavit or other evidence to support her claim of her child being sick or being unable to locate the building.
we conclude that the applicant reasons for her failure to appear do not constitute reasonable cause.general assertions,without more,do not constitute reasonable cause that would warrant remand of an in abstentia exclusion proceeding.claims of an ill child without corroborative evidence,or mere good intentions toward her family,are insufficient for satisfying the reasonable cause standard.the applicant failed to explain why she had been unable to locate the building and did nothing to alert the immigration court of the problem.the applicant could have ensured her appearance by taking steps earlier to familiarize herself with the location of the immigration court or else find someone to accompany her who had knowledge of the area and traffic conditions.the applicant stated reasons for failing to appear do not satisfy the definition of reasonable cause.
