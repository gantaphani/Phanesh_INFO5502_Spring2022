opinion of the court 
petitioner,bhupinder singh,seeks review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia determining that he is removable as an aggravated felon under a a iii,and a subsequent bia decision affirming without opinion the denial by the immigration judge ij of his claims for withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture cat.we will deny the petition.
singh is a native and citizen of india who immigrated to the united states in,and obtained lawful permanent resident status.on january,singh was driving in lancaster county,pennsylvania.when another motorist made an obscene gesture at him,he responded by pointing a bb gun at the driver.local police pulled him over and arrested him based on the incident.he was charged,in relevant part,with simple assault under.ann.a,and recklessly endangering another person under.ann.on august,singh pled guilty to,and was convicted of,both offenses in the lancaster county court of common pleas.
as a result of these convictions,on september,the and naturalization service ins served singh with a notice to appear charging him with removability under sections a a i and iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a i iii.section a a i renders aliens removable if they have committed certain crimes involving moral turpitude,while a a iii provides for removal of aliens who have committed an aggravated felony as defined in ina a,a.singh moved to terminate his removal proceedings on the basis that his convictions were neither crimes of moral turpitude nor aggravated felonies.on july,an ij in philadelphia,pennsylvania determined that both crimes were aggravated felonies,but neither were crimes involving moral turpitude.the ij denied singh motion to terminate removal proceedings and ordered him removed.he was then placed in detention in york,pennsylvania.accordingly,venue was changed to york.
following the change of venue,singh received a merits hearing at which a new ij again determined that neither crime involved moral turpitude,but also that neither was an aggravated felony.the ij accordingly terminated the removal proceedings against singh on october,whereupon the ins appealed to the bia.the bia sustained the appeal on march,ruling that both crimes,simple assault and recklessly endangering another person,were aggravated felonies,thereby again rendering singh removable.the bia did not enter a final order of removal,but instead remanded the case to allow singh opportunity to seek relief from removal by applying for withholding of removal and protection under the cat.
at his june,hearing before the ij,singh presented his claims for withholding of removal and cat relief.he claimed that as an ethnic sikh,he would face persecution upon return to india,and specifically,upon return to punjab,a sikh state within india.singh testified that he feared arrest and loss of his life should he return to india,based on the fate of two uncles who had been members of the akali dal,a movement seeking an independent sikh state.he called as a witness a third uncle who testified that the other uncles had been arrested in.this third uncle also testified that he feared for singh safety in india because singh would be likely to support the akali dal,and would be immediately recognizable as a sikh because of his surname.the uncle conceded that singh parents had been members of the akali dal,but had never been arrested.the country report on india current at the time of singh hearing noted that the violence and disappearances in punjab during the had ended,and that while some sporadic human rights abuses may still occur,they are sparse.
the ij found that singh had not shown a clear probability of persecution with respect to his claim for withholding of removal,nor,regarding his claim for cat relief,that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured.accordingly,the ij ordered him removed to india.
on july,singh filed an appeal with the bia claiming that the ij violated his fifth amendment right to due process by limiting him to examining just one of the three witnesses he sought to call,and that his application for relief from removal was denied in error.the bia affirmed without opinion on october.singh petition for review in this court,filed on november,is timely.singh has also timely sought review of the bia march,determination in the government appeal to the bia that his past criminal convictions constituted aggravated felonies,as well as the due process and relief from removal claims he raised in his own subsequent bia appeal 
under the real id act,our jurisdiction encompasses constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.real id act,a a iii,stat,codified at a d papageorgiou gonzales,cir this represents an enlargement of our jurisdiction over final orders of removal issued against aggravated felons,which,prior to enactment of real id,was proscribed by a c whether singh convictions are aggravated felonies under a a iii presents a question of law within our subject matter jurisdiction.singh due process claims are constitutional in nature,and within our jurisdiction under the real id act.finally,we have jurisdiction under a d to consider singh cat and withholding of removal claims to the extent they present questions of law,or of the application of law to undisputed fact.see kamara att y,cir finding that court of appeals had jurisdiction under real id act to review legal determinations and application of law to fact under the cat.
we first determine whether singh is removable as an aggravated felon under a a iii,and conclude that he is.for purposes of the ina,a defines aggravated felony to include a wide array of offenses relevant to this case is subsection f,which brings a crime of violence defined in for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year within the ambit of the definition.in turn,defines crime of violence as 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
the present question is whether simple assault under.ann.a,or recklessly endangering another person under.ann.crimes for which singh was crimes of violence within,and,therefore,aggravated felonies under the ina,a.
the bia interpretation of is not entitled to deference by this court as a federal criminal provision outside the ina,it lies beyond the bia area of special expertise.tran gonzales,cir francis reno,cir.we exercise plenary review over the bia purely legal determination that singh convictions for simple assault and recklessly endangering another person were aggravated felonies.valansi ashcroft,cir.with this in mind,we turn to the pennsylvania crimes of which singh has been convicted,and conclude that his conviction for simple assault qualifies as an aggravated felony,but that his conviction for recklessly endangering another person does not.
as an initial matter,we note that both crimes were misdemeanors under pennsylvania law thus,neither could be a felony under b,which relies on the state grading of the offense to determine whether it is a felony.francis,at.therefore,we consider whether either conviction was for an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another under a the underlying facts of the conviction are not relevant rather,we must look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction when determining whether it is a crime of violence leocal ashcroft,d.
to qualify as a crime of violence within a,a criminal statute must require a mens rea of specific intent to use force mere recklessness is insufficient.tran,at citing united states parson,cir.we have held that another section of the pennsylvania simple assault statute.ann.a,which states that a person is guilty of assault if he attempts to cause or intentionally,knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another,requires no mor
