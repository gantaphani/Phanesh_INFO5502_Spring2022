pablo ruiz apolonio appeals the month sentence of imprisonment imposed following his guilty plea to one count of illegal reentry under.because we agree with the district court that a conviction for forcible rape under california penal code a is categorically a crime of violence as defined by the sentencing guidelines,we hold that the district court correctly imposed a level sentencing enhancement.we also hold that the district court did not commit procedural error in calculating the guidelines range and that the sentence of months was not substantively unreasonable.we therefore affirm.
in,ruiz pleaded guilty under california penal code a to one count of forcible rape,a crime he committed in.he was deported to mexico on september,but reentered the united states without permission on november.on february,ruiz pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry after deportation in violation of.at sentencing,the district court found that ruiz prior california conviction under a constituted a crime of violence within the meaning of the sentencing guidelines and therefore warranted a level upward adjustment of the offense level,resulting in a total offense level of.the court then found that ruiz criminal history score was,which placed him into criminal history category iii,resulting in a guidelines sentencing range of months of imprisonment.
in addition to his argument that rape under california penal code a is not categorically a crime of violence under,ruiz raised two specific objections to the guidelines calculation.first,while he conceded that he had committed his illegal reentry offense within two years of release from prison,he nonetheless argued that the district court addition of two recency points under e was improper.he based this argument on the sentencing commission january,proposal to amend the guidelines to eliminate the calculation of recency points from e,and the commission statement that inclusion of such recency points only minimally improves the predictability of recidivism.although the proposal had not yet gone into effect on the date of sentencing,ruiz believed that the district court should apply it.second,ruiz argued that,because the bureau of prisons allegedly calculates good time credits differently than does the sentencing commission,the guidelines sentencing range was effectively increased to compensate for time off that ruiz could not possibly earn.
the district court rejected both arguments without explanation and then considered the a factors.discussing what it termed a number of aggravating facts,the court noted that the circumstances of the rape were very serious,demonstrating that ruiz was a danger to society.the court added that it had carefully considered the mitigating factors laid out in a letter from ruiz sister,as well as the probation office recommendation of months of imprisonment.the court concluded that a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range was appropriate and sentenced ruiz to months of imprisonment,with two years supervised release,no fine,and a special assessment.

the district court did not err by increasing ruiz offense level by levels on the basis of ruiz conviction for rape in california,because a conviction under california penal code a is categorically a crime of violence under.
california penal code a defines rape as an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator w here it is accomplished against a person will by means of force,violence,duress,menace,or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.the illegal reentry sentencing guidelines provide that a defendant offense level shall be increased by levels i f the defendant previously was deported,or unlawfully remained in the united states,after a conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence.b a ii.to determine whether california penal code a is categorically a crime of violence,we apply the categorical approach set forth in taylor united states.under the categorical approach,we look not to the particular facts underlying the defendant prior conviction,but only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,in order to determine whether the state statute could potentially criminalize conduct that would not qualify as a crime of violence.united states aguila montes de oca,slip op.at cir,en banc alterations in original quoting taylor,at.the sentencing enhancement is applicable under the categorical approach only if the full range of conduct covered by the state statute fall s within the scope of the federal statutory provision.united states pallares galan,cir citation omitted.
application note b iii to defines crime of violence to include forcible sex offenses including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid,such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary,incompetent,or coerced.sentencing guidelines manual cmt.b iii.therefore,we must decide whether california penal code a is a forcible sex offense.before the sentencing guidelines became effective,application note b iii to had defined crime of violence to include only three types of sexual offenses forcible sex offenses,statutory rape,and sexual abuse of a minor.see,e,sentencing guidelines manual cmt.b iii.both we and the fifth circuit construed the term forcible sex offense as requiring the use of some physical force above and beyond that required for penetration.see,united states beltran munguia,cir united states luciano rodriguez,cir united states sarmiento funes,cir.in,citing sarmiento funes,the fifth circuit held that a conviction for rape under california penal code a was not categorically a crime of violence under the guidelines because the statute criminalized sexual intercourse including intercourse accomplished through fear or duress accomplished without the use of physical force.united states gomez gomez,cir hereinafter gomez gomez i.the fifth circuit later reheard this decision en banc and unanimously changed direction,holding that a conviction under california penal code a did categorically constitute a crime of violence.united states gomez gomez,cir en banc hereinafter gomez gomez ii.in,in direct response to the earlier decisions in luciano rodriguez,sarmiento funes,and gomez gomez i,the sentencing commission promulgated amendment,which modified the definition of application note b iii to include within the definition of forcible sex offenses those sex offenses where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid,such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary,incompetent,or coerced.sentencing guidelines manual supp.to app.c,at.
focusing on the version of application note b iii,ruiz argues that a criminalizes conduct that does not fall within the guidelines definition of crimes of violence,because it is theoretically possible to convict a perpetrator who passively exploits a victim unreasonable,subjective fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury even though he has not committed a forcible sex offense.specifically,ruiz imagines the possibility of a victim who silently assents to intercourse under circumstances where the victim unreasonably believes that failure to assent will result in harm,even though the perpetrator has taken no intentional actions to create this fear.such a hypothetical victim,ruiz argues,has given consent that is neither involuntary nor actively coerced.
ruiz argument fails in several ways.first,the premise that his hypothetical perpetrator would not have committed a forcible sex offense depends upon an overly restrictive textual parsing of the application note.ruiz suggests that involuntary consent can mean only consent obtained by fraud or intoxication,because otherwise the terms involuntary and coerced would be redundant ruiz also suggests that in order to coerce consent,a perpetrator must intentionally act,and so there can not be coercion where a perpetrator is entirely passive.see,black law dictionary ed defining coercion as c ompulsion by physical force or threat of physical force.there is no reason,however,to read either involuntary consent or coerced consent in such a limited fashion.that the commission cited three particular decisions in explaining its reasons for amending the application note does not mean that the commission thought those decisions exhaustively articulated all the circumstances captured by the amended definition of forcible sex offenses.the sort of consent that ruiz envisions,where a victim assents only because he or she subjectively and unreasonably fears immediate and unlawful bodily harm,is clearly involuntary.even were ruiz correct that his hypothetical victim assent would not constitute involuntary or coerced consent,moreover,the plain language of the application note makes it clear that the guidelines definition of forcible sex offenses captures other sorts of invalid consent as well.see sentencing guidelines manual cmt.b iii i ncluding where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid,such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary,incompetent,or coerced.emphasis added see also sentencing guidelines manual cmt.the term includes is not exhaustive.
second,the plain language of california penal code a makes clear that it does not criminalize sexual intercourse where a victim actually consents.the statute criminalizes only sexual intercourse accomplished against a person will.code a.under california law against a person will in the context of sexual assault means without the consent of the alleged victim.people lee,cal gomez gomez ii,at such offenses under a,by definition,involve victims who have not consented in fact,even if the victim has nominally consented.
indeed,the jury instructions for rape cases under a promulgated by the committee on california criminal jury instructions defines a gainst that person will as without the consent of the alleged victim.caljic.the judicial council of california criminal jury instructions are even more direct to prove that the defendant is guilty of rape under a,the people must prove that t he woman did not consent to the intercourse calcrim 
third,in any event,it is not clear that ruiz hypothetical passive and unreasonable victim actually consents,even under california definition of consent.california penal code defines consent as positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will.the person must act freely and voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature of the act or transaction involved.ruiz argues that,where a victim assents or acquiesces to intercourse only because of force,duress,or fear of harm,but positively cooperates in act or attitude,the victim has actually consented.ruiz,however,ignores the second half of the definition.even if he is correct that a victim who assents to intercourse out of an unreasonable fear of immediate and unlawful injury consents by somehow positive ly cooperat ing pursuant to an exercise of free will,such a victim surely is not acting freely and voluntarily.see,gomez gomez ii,at a mere word or action indicating consent that is given under duress,whether through physical or nonphysical means,and against the free will of the victim,indicates nothing about whether the victim in fact wishes to engage in sex.but see lee,at california supreme court declined to reach the questions of whether an instruction that consent may be proved by evidence of an alleged rape victim passive acquiescence would be consistent with the intent of the legislature as expressed in section.
while ruiz hypothetical argument is inventive,to show that a state statute criminalizes conduct that lies outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute,the defendant must demonstrate that there is a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.gonzales duenas alvarez.to do so,the defendant must point to at least one case in which the state courts applied the statute in the manner that he posits.see also united states laurico yeno,cir.ruiz contends that there is a realistic probability that california courts would apply california forcible rape statute to offenses beyond those included in the generic definition.he points to three decisions of the california courts where,he claims,the victim consented to the sexual intercourse,but the defendant was nevertheless convicted of rape under a.these decisions,however,do not demonstrate that the california courts would uphold a a conviction where a victim consents to intercourse only because of a subjective,unreasonable fear of immediate and unlawful bodily harm,because in each of the three decisions ruiz cites the victims did not consent to intercourse.
ruiz first cites people young.ruiz argues that young demonstrates that subjective fear in the absence of deliberate,coercive acts of the defendant is sufficient to meet the requirement in a that the intercourse with a nonspouse be accomplished against a person will by means of force,violence,duress,menace,or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.in young,a father was convicted under what is now a after his daughter testified that he had oral and vaginal intercourse with her.id.at.the victim testified that she did not want to engage in intercourse with her father,but was too scared to object,although the defendant did not say anything to the victim that made her afraid.id.the california court of appeal overturned the conviction,concluding that,while the evidence was sufficient to show that the sexual intercourse was accomplished against the victim will by means of force,there was no substantial evidence that defendant accomplished the act of sexual intercourse by means of fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury,and it was unable to state with any degree of certainty which theory the jury may have used to find the defendant guilty.id.at.while ruiz cites young for the court holding that e ven a victim unreasonable fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury would be sufficient to sustain a a conviction,he ignores the court holding that,given the evidence,t he jury could properly find that the act of sexual intercourse was against the victim will since she did not want to do it and the evidence did not otherwise establish positive cooperation in act or attitude.id.thus,young does not stand for the proposition that a defendant can be convicted under a where a victim consents.
ruiz next cites in re john,cal,which,he argues,demonstrates that a defendant can be convicted under a after engaging in consensual sex.in john,a minor defendant was convicted of forcible rape after he and the victim began engaging in apparently consensual intercourse,but the victim expresse d an objection and attempt ed to stop the act and the defendant forcibly continue d despite the objection.id.
the california supreme court affirmed the conviction,holding contrary to ruiz arguments that the victim did not consent.indeed,the california supreme court observed that,even if the victim initially consented to,or appeared to consent to,intercourse with defendant,substantial evidence shows that she withdrew her consent and,through her actions and words,communicated that fact.john,at.n o reasonable person in defendant position would have believed that the victim continued to consent to the act,the court added.id.at.
finally,ruiz cites people iniguez,cal,which,he argues,demonstrates both that a defendant can be convicted under a where the defendant knowingly uses,but does not intentionally create,a victim objectively unreasonable fear and that a defendant can be convicted under a where the victim consents.in iniguez,the defendant,who was the fiancé of the victim close friend and who had just met the victim that night,admitted that he approached her as she slept on the living room floor,removed her pants,fondled her buttocks,and had sexual intercourse with her,all without saying anything.id.at.the victim,who was staying at her friend house on the night before her wedding,testified that she was too scared to use physical force to resist a man whom she did not know,who outweighed her by pounds,and who approached her silently while she was sleeping.id.while the california supreme court affirmed the conviction,iniguez does not demonstrate that a defendant can be convicted of rape under a where a victim consents indeed,the court explicitly found that the evidence was sufficient to show that the sexual intercourse was accomplished against the victim will by means of fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.id.at emphasis added.
given ruiz inability to identify any case in which the state courts applied the statute where a victim had consented to intercourse a reading that would run contrary to the plain language of a the district court did not err by applying the level crime of violence offense level increase authorized by b a ii 
the district court did not commit either procedural or substantive error by denying the variances ruiz requested to compensate for the inclusion of recency points and the supposed differences between the sentencing commission and bureau of prisons methods for calculating good time credits,or by declining to explain why it rejected ruiz arguments for the variances 
substantive unreasonableness 
recency points 
the district court rejection of the requested variance to account for the inclusion in the guidelines calculation of recency points did not render ruiz sentence substantively unreasonable 
at the time of ruiz sentencing,to calculate the criminal history score,the district court was to a dd points if the defendant committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on a sentence counted under a or b or while in imprisonment or escape status on such a sentence.e on january,however,the sentencing commission proposed amendment,which eliminated the addition of points due to recency of a prior sentence.sentencing guidelines manual e proposed amendment.in an april,press release,the commission stated that the addition of recency points might result in a single criminal history event having excessive weight in the determination of the applicable guideline range.press release,sent g comm n,sentencing commission votes to send to congress guideline amendments providing more alternatives to incarceration,increasing consideration of certain specific offender characteristics during the sentencing process.the commission added that deletion of the provision did not detract from the overall ability of the criminal history score to predict an offender likelihood of recidivism.id.in an april,policy statement on the proposed amendment,the commission further explained that consideration of recency only minimally improves the predictive ability of the criminal history score,and that it had received public comment and testimony suggesting that recency does not necessarily reflect increased culpability.sent g comm n,amendments to the sentencing guidelines,policy statements,and official commentary.the amendment took effect november,recency points are no longer included in the calculation of criminal history points.
ruiz argues that,in accord with the general parsimony principle of a,the district court should have varied downward because recency points were empirically unjustified when he was sentenced.ruiz cites kimbrough united states,in which the supreme court,addressing the crack and powder cocaine equivalencies,held that courts may vary from the guidelines ranges based solely on policy considerations,including disagreements with the guidelines,after considering the a factors,including the overarching parsimony provision.id.quotation omitted.the kimbrough court reasoned that the commission recommendations are generally based on empirical data and national experience,but that in formulating the crack cocaine ranges,the commission was not permitted to consider such data.see id.at.the implication is that the guidelines ranges are given more weight when they are based on the commission analysis of empirical data and national experience,and they are due less weight when they regularly result in sentences that are greater than necessary in light of the purposes of sentencing set forth in a.see see also spears united states.
we have not previously addressed this recency points variance argument in a published opinion.the first circuit has done so and has rejected it.see united states adams,cir.in unpublished opinions,moreover,we,along with at least five other circuits,have similarly rejected versions of the argument that a variance was required after the commission promulgated the amendment but before the amendment became effective.see,united states prado figueroa,wl,at cir,united states rodriguez sanchez,wl,at cir.may,united states gonzalez molina,fed.app x,cir per curiam in re anderson,fed.app x,cir per curiam united states gadsden,fed.app x,cir united states dennis,fed.app x,cir united states mitchell,fed.app x,cir.no circuit has found a sentence substantively unreasonable where,after promulgation of the proposed amendment that reduced the sentencing range,a court declined to vary downward to account for inclusion of recency points in the guidelines calculation.
a sentencing court,of course,has the discretion to grant a variance from the guidelines after promulgation but before adoption of a proposed amendment,based on its policy disagreement with the existing guidelines provision,especially where,as here,the commission has acted to remedy the basis for the court disagreement.kimbrough,at.however,where an amendment has been promulgated but has not yet been adopted,district courts are not required to consider that amendment in the analysis unless the amendment has been given retroactive effect by express decision of the commission.see braxton united states,in addition to the duty to review and revise the guidelines,congress has granted the commission the unusual explicit power to decide whether and to what extent its amendments reducing sentences will be given retroactive effect.emphasis and citation omitted.s ubstantive amendments to the guidelines that occur between the date of sentencing and the resolution of an appeal have no retroactive effect unless specifically referenced in.united states diaz cardenas,cir citing united states aldana ortiz,cir amendment is not listed in indeed,the commission explicitly chose not to make it retroactive.see sentn g comm public meeting minutes,and public hearings and meetings.that the commission has promulgated a amendment that is very likely to be adopted and that would result in reduced guidelines ranges does not render a district court failure to grant a variance substantively unreasonable.this is not to say that the district court could not have granted the requested variance after considering all of the factors and the totality of the circumstances.carty,at.
therefore,the district court did not improperly include recency points in calculating the guidelines range of to months of imprisonment.though the government recommended months of imprisonment,the district court reasonably imposed a sentence of months of imprisonment.had the district court not included recency points in ruiz criminal history score,the months would also have been at the midpoint of the applicable guidelines range of months.we therefore conclude that the district court rejection of this argument did not render the sentence substantively unreasonable.
good time calculation 
ruiz argues that the court erred by rejecting a variance to account for what he maintains is a difference in the way the sentencing commission and the bureau of prisons bop calculate credits.the guidelines,he argues,overcompensate for credits that will never be earned,and therefore his sentence of imprisonment should have been reduced from the low end of the guidelines range by an additional one month rounded up from days.
this argument is an attempt to reframe the arguments raised by the petitioners in barber thomas,who challenged the bop methodology for calculating credits under b.b permits an award of up to days of credit per year of imprisonment.the bop calculates such credits on the basis of time served,rather than time imposed.under the bop calculations,a prisoner serving a term may receive days of credit.id.at.at the end of each year,the bop subtracts days from the sentence.id.at.a consistently prisoner serving a term,however,will get out before the end of that sentence.id.at kennedy,dissenting.thus,the bop methodology in calculating credit precludes prisoners from earning credit they would otherwise have earned had they not been released early for good behavior.id.at.the barber petitioners argued that they should instead be able to earn up to days days per year of credit while serving a sentence,regardless of when they are released.id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument,holding that the bop method of calculation reflected the most natural reading of the statute.id.at.
in support,the barber petitioners cited both a statement the sentencing commission made in and a reference in later editions of the guidelines to a potential credit of approximately fifteen percent for good behavior,id.at,which,they argued,suggested that the commission set its guideline ranges with the expectation that prisoners would receive good time credit of up to of the sentence imposed,not of the time actually served.id.ruiz,relying on exactly the same evidence,contends that it actually demonstrates that all guidelines sentences are too days in his case.
regardless of whether ruiz is correct that parsimony principle would mandate a variance due to the and assumptions by the commission and the bop,the supreme court has already concluded that the evidence is inconclusive as to whether the bop and the commission acted on different assumptions 
w e can find no indication that the commission,in writing its supplementary report or in the guidelines themselves,considered or referred to the particular question here before us,that is whether good time credit is to be based on time served or the sentence imposed.the guidelines manual itself,a more authoritative account of the commission interpretive views than the supplementary report,says nothing directly on that subject because the commission has expressed no view on the question before us,we need not decide whether it would be entitled to deference had it done so.if it turns out that the calculation of good time credit based on prison time served rather than the sentence imposed produces results that are more severe than the commission finds appropriate,the commission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accordingly.
id.at.ruiz concedes that the supreme court did not determine whether the sentencing commission and the bop use different credit systems.more than that,however,the supreme court actually concluded that the very evidence ruiz now cites did not even address whether the commission attempted to compensate for credits on the basis of whether they were calculated as a percentage of the time sentenced or time served.accordingly,we find that ruiz sentence is not substantively unreasonable on this ground.
procedural error 
ruiz argues that the district court committed procedural error by failing to provide a sufficient explanation for its rejection of the requested variance based on recency points and good time credits.the court did not explicitly state that it rejected the variance until the end of the sentencing hearing,when the defense counsel asked whether the court rejected both bases for the variance,and the court responded yes.however,the court began the sentencing hearing by stating that it had reviewed the,government sentencing summary chart,the rap sheet summary,the objections to the,the defendant request for departures,the revised sentencing summary chart,defendant sentencing memorandum,the letters that were submitted therewith,and the addendum to the.the court then explained thoroughly,with reference to numerous a factors,the basis for its conclusion that a sentence of months was appropriate.the district court is not required to provide a detailed explanation as to each of its reasons for rejecting every argument made by counsel.see,carty,at see also rita,at where a matter is as conceptually simple as in the case at hand and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments,we do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.given that the court reviewed all the relevant submitted materials,correctly calculated the applicable range using the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing,and thoroughly explained its reasons for imposing the sentence of imprisonment it did,the district court did not commit procedural error by not offering a more explanation of why it rejected the variances ruiz requested.
ruiz also argues that,given his history,background,and age,the district court imposed a sentence that was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing purposes set forth in a,and that his sentence was therefore substantively unreasonable.see a.in particular,ruiz argues that his history reflects financial hardship and lack of opportunity while his relationship with the mother of his young daughter is now over,he reentered the country only to be with his daughter he lived continuously in the united states since his youth,and had culturally assimilated he has no history of substance abuse a letter from his sister states that he needs to return to mexico to assist with the care of his elderly parents while in custody he behaved well and his age of places him well beyond the prime period of highest recidivism.conceding that his rape conviction is serious,ruiz argues that his criminal history is mitigated because that rape conviction was his sole prior conviction,and the state judge imposed a lowterm sentence,and so must have found mitigating circumstances.
these are the same arguments that the district court explicitly addressed in imposing ruiz sentence.the district court noted that there were a number of aggravating facts,including ruiz criminal history,though the seriousness of the rape conviction was tempered by the fact that the relevant conduct occurred in.the court discussed the letter from ruiz sister,and observed that t here is,obviously,is a very good and decent side to you that many people see and experience,and those are mitigating factors that the court does consider.noting that the probation department and government had recommended a month sentence,the district court concluded that a sentence at the low end at months is the right,just and fair sentence under all of the circumstances.
as the record as a whole reflects rational and meaningful consideration of the a factors,see ellis,at,ruiz
