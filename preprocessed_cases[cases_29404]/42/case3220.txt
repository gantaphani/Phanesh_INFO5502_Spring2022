petitioner mario sandoval gomez petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision ordering him removed to mexico.according to petitioner,the bia remanded his case to the immigration judge ij for the limited purpose of reconsidering the effect on his case of an intervening decision,jordison gonzales,cir.petitioner therefore first contends that,on remand,the government was precluded from arguing that his attempted arson conviction under california penal code section was an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act ina or the act,a e i,as an offense described in the federal explosive materials statute,f,i.petitioner further argues that the bia erred as a matter of law in concluding that his state conviction categorically qualified as an aggravated felony because petitioner conviction had nothing to do with explosives and because,unlike f,i,the state statute contains no federal jurisdictional requirement.we reject these arguments and deny the petition.
in september,petitioner was convicted of attempted arson in violation of california penal code section.he also had several other convictions,dating back to the early,for receiving stolen property,possession of controlled substances,and violating a protective order.
the government first initiated removal proceedings against petitioner based on his attempted arson conviction on april.the following month,the ij determined that petitioner was removable under a a iii because the attempted arson conviction constituted a crime of violence,thus making it an aggravated felony and rendering petitioner removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal.
petitioner appealed to the bia arguing that the ninth circuit intervening decision in jordison made clear that his attempted arson conviction did not constitute a crime of violence.the government nonetheless moved for summary affirmance,arguing that jordison had no effect on the ij ruling.in january,the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision.petitioner subsequently filed a petition for review in this court.
in his opening brief in case,petitioner argued,as he had before the bia,that his conviction did not qualify as a crime of violence.before the government filed its answering brief,however,it moved the bia to sua sponte reconsider its summary affirmance of the ij decision because the bia had failed previously to consider the impact of jordison.the government thus asked that the bia reconsider and reopen the case accept a new form,additional charges of and remand to the ij to address the original charge of removability in light of jordison and to address the additional charge in the i.
in january,the bia granted the government motion.according to the bia,reconsideration was warranted because dhs ha d identified a potential error of law or fact,and,although the government had not raised the issue previously,the issue was of such gravity that it merit ed reconsideration.the bia remand ed the case to the immigration judge to permit him to consider this case in the first instance and ordered that t he board decision dated january,was vacated and proceedings were remanded for any further proceedings the immigration judge deem ed appropriate and for a new decision.this court then dismissed the pending petition for lack of jurisdiction because the bia remanded the case for further proceedings and a new decision and there was no longer a final order of removal.
on march,in the second round of proceedings before the ij,the government submitted two new i alleging that petitioner was removable on several grounds not previously raised.more specifically,the government alleged,among other things,that petitioner was removable under section a b i of the ina as an alien who had been convicted of a controlled substance offense.the government further argued for removal pursuant to section a a iii because,under a e i,petitioner attempted arson conviction was an offense described in relating to explosive materials offenses and was thus an aggravated felony.the government conceded that,contrary to its prior position in the earlier proceedings,petitioner was not removable on the basis that his attempted arson conviction was a crime of violence.
as a threshold matter,the ij observed that the bia remand order made this to be a pretty open hearing,to be heard as the court deemed appropriate for the issuance of a new decision.the ij noted that this was not a new action.it was not subject to res judicata or collateral estoppel,based upon the controlling precedent.indeed,the ij was satisfied that the government followed the procedures that were mandated to be able to get back and charge the petitioner with allegations that were not originally filed in the notice to appear.
the ij again found petitioner removable,this time based on petitioner controlled substance conviction.however,the ij rejected the government theory that petitioner was alternatively removable and ineligible for cancellation on the basis that his attempted arson conviction was an aggravated felony.
the ij further determined,although petitioner was removable,he remained eligible for cancellation of removal under a,which provides for discretionary cancellation if,among other things,an alien has not been convicted of an aggravated felony.see.the ij reasoned that petitioner attempted arson conviction did not categorically qualify as an aggravated felony under the federal explosive materials statute.more specifically,the ij determined that petitioner state law conviction could not qualify as an aggravated felony because the state statute,california penal code section,did not contain the jurisdictional elements set forth in the relevant federal provisions,f,i.the ij then exercised his discretion and granted petitioner application for cancellation.
the parties to the bia.the government argued that the ij had erred in failing to sustain the ground of removability alleging that the petitioner had been convicted of an aggravated felony explosives crime and an aggravated felony attempted explosives crime and by granting petitioner cancellation of removal pursuant to a as a matter of his discretion.the bia agreed,and reversed the ij.despite the fact that the california statute of conviction contained no interstate commerce requirement,the bia concluded petitioner arson conviction was encompassed by the language of the federal statute because the interstate requirement was jurisdictional only.according to the bia,attempted arson thus constituted an aggravated felony for immigration purposes,and petitioner was removable and statutorily ineligible for cancellation 
in reaching this conclusion,the bia also rejected petitioner arguments that it was error for the immigration judge to permit dhs to lodge additional removal charges on remand and the dhs was barred by res judicata from charging him with removability as an aggravated felon.according to the bia,the remand order was broad enough to permit the bringing of new charges,and res judicata did not act as a bar because,given the remand,no final order had been entered in the case.the instant petition for review petition followed in which petitioner contends that the ij improperly permitted the government to lodge new charges on remand from the bia and that the bia erred in concluding that his attempted arson conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under the federal explosives statute.
we review for abuse of discretion the bia grant or denial of a motion to reconsider or reopen.barroso gonzales,cir lainez ortiz,cir.reversal is warranted if the bia acted arbitrarily,irrationally,or contrary to law.lainez ortiz,at.
w e lack jurisdiction to review an order of removal against an alien removable for having committed an aggravated felony.lopez jacuinde holder,cir a c.nonetheless,this court retains jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction,which includes determining whether a particular offense constitutes an offense governed by the provisions.cazarez gutierrez ashcroft,cir.accordingly,we can reach the question of whether petitioner conviction constituted an aggravated felony,a question we review de novo.murillo prado holder,cir citing ramirez villalpando holder,cir.
according to petitioner,as a threshold matter,the government was barred from relitigating the merits of his removability on remand from the bia because doing so exceeded the scope of the bia remand order,which petitioner contends was intended only to permit the parties to address the jordison decision the bia did not reopen the case to permit the filing of additional charges against petitioner and even if the bia remand order is construed as granting the request to reopen,such a decision would have contravened the bia own regulations,principles of res judicata,and the law of the case.we disagree.
there is no dispute that the bia acted within its discretion in granting reconsideration.indeed,petitioner does not even attempt to challenge the bia decision in that regard,arguing instead that,in order to entertain any new charges,the bia must also have impermissibly reopened the case.any potential challenge to reconsideration has thus been waived.see greenwood,cir.
we also reject petitioner arguments that granting the request to reopen would have contravened the bia own regulations,principles of res judicata,and the law of the case because they turn on the flawed premise that the bia must instead have sua sponte reopened the case to permit the filing of those charges.because the case was remanded,there was nothing to reopen in the first place,and consequently,there could be no violation of the regulations governing such motions.see c requiring,among other things,that motions to reopen state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and that a motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.
given the scope of the bia remand order,we conclude that the ij properly allowed the government to file new charges against petitioner.in its order granting reconsideration,the bia vacated its prior order entirely and broadly instructed the ij to conduct any further proceedings the immigration judge deems appropriate.despite the bia order language indicating that the motion for reconsideration was granted for the purpose of giving the ij the opportunity to rule on the applicability of the jordison decision,the scope of the remand order itself was quite broad,leaving the ij free to adjudicate new charges.see fernandes holder,cir t he ij jurisdiction on remand from the bia is limited only when the bia expressly retains jurisdiction and qualifies or limits the scope of the remand to a specific purpose.an articulated purpose for the remand,without any express limit on scope,is not sufficient to limit the remand such that it forecloses consideration of other new claims or motions that the ij deems appropriate or that are presented in accordance with relevant regulations.moreover,the bia regulations expressly permit the government to bring a t any time during deportation or removal proceedings,additional or substituted charges of deportability,which is precisely what the government did here.see.having rejected petitioner procedural arguments,we now turn then to the merits of his challenge to the removal order.
an analysis of the merits requires us to undertake two separate,but related inquiries.in doing so,we conclude california penal code section is divisible and,applying a modified categorical approach,petitioner attempted arson conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony and petitioner is not saved from removal by the fact that the state statute lacks jurisdictional elements included in the corresponding federal provisions 
aggravated felonies include offense s described in section h or i of title,or section d,e,f,g,h,or i of that title relating to explosive materials offenses.a e i.the first question before us is whether,as the government contends,california penal code section is a categorical match to f or i.the federal provisions provide 
whoever maliciously damages or destroys,or attempts to damage or destroy,by means of fire or an explosive,any building,vehicle,or other personal or real property in whole or in part owned or possessed by,or leased to,the united states,or any department or agency thereof,or any institution or organization receiving federal financial assistance,shall be imprisoned for not less than years and not more than years,fined under this title,or both.
whoever maliciously damages or destroys,or attempts to damage or destroy,by means of fire or an explosive,any building,vehicle,or other real or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce shall be imprisoned for not less than years and not more than years,fined under this title,or both and if personal injury results to any person,including any public safety officer performing duties as a direct or proximate result of conduct prohibited by this subsection,shall be imprisoned for not less than years and not more than years,fined under this title,or both and if death results to any person,including any public safety officer performing duties as a direct or proximate result of conduct prohibited by this subsection,shall also be subject to imprisonment for any term of years,or to the death penalty or to life imprisonment.
at the time of petitioner conviction,california penal code section mandated 
any person who willfully and maliciously attempts to set fire to or attempts to burn or to aid,counsel or procure the burning of any structure,forest land or property,or who commits any act preliminary thereto,or in furtherance thereof,is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for months,two or three years.
the placing or distributing of any flammable,explosive or combustible material or substance,or any device in or about any structure,forest land or property in an arrangement or preparation with intent to eventually willfully and maliciously set fire to or burn same,or to procure the setting fire to or burning of the same shall,for the purposes of this act constitute an attempt to burn such structure,forest land or property.
we employ a categorical approach to determine whether a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.see taylor united states.if the full range of conduct covered by state law falls within the confines of the federal offense,petitioner state conviction is categorically a removable offense and our inquiry ends.see coronado holder,wl,at cir.july,quoting alanis alvarado holder,cir.if it is possible for a person to be convicted under state law without also being convicted under federal law,then a modified categorical approach may,under certain circumstances,be appropriate.
as indicated in note above,at the time the bia issued its decision in this case,it did not have the benefit of the supreme court recent decision in descamps united states.the court in descamps made clear that the modified categorical approach helps effectuate the categorical analysis when a divisible statute,listing potential offense elements in the alternative,renders opaque which element played a part in the defendant conviction.id.at.under the modified approach,courts are permitted as a tool for implementing the categorical approach,to examine a limited class of documents to determine which of a statute alternative elements formed the basis of the petitioner prior conviction.id.at.the modified approach merely enables a court to ascertain the specific element that a defendant was convicted of violating when a statute contains multiple,alternative elements.coronado,wl,at.divisibility is therefore an inquiry and not a one.id.
the felony complaint shows that petitioner attempted arson conviction was based on what is now section a,or section first provision.we initially note that both f and i include an extra element an explosive not found in the relevant subsection of.based on this extra element,a person could be convicted under f or i,but not be convicted under section.however,anyone convicted of at least one subset of section a,one convicted of willfully and maliciously attempt ing to set fire to any structure,forest land or property could be convicted under either provision of if the jurisdictional elements were met under the latter provisions thus,it seems that would satisfy the elements of the generic crime.see descamps.at.
however,section is divisible not only based on the now sections a and b,but it is also divisible within itself.a violation of section a can be committed in several ways.one could willfully and maliciously attempt to set fire to or attempt to burn any structure,forest land,or property aid,counsel or procure the burning of any structure,forest land or property or commit any act preliminary thereto,or in furtherance thereof.see people carrasco,d.
this reading is supported by the applicable jury instruction 
in order to prove this crime,each of the following elements must be proved 
a person attempted to set fire to or burn any structure,forest land,or property a person aided,counselled,or procured the burning of any structure,forest land,or property 
a person committed an act preliminary to or in furtherance of the setting fire to or burning of any structure,forest land,or property 
that person acted willfully and maliciously and 
that person had the specific intent to set fire to,or burn a structure,forest land,or property of another.
caljic.this statute is thus divisible because it contain s multiple,alternative elements of functionally separate crimes.rendon holder,wl,at cir.
we must next determine whether all three of the ways to commit an offense under section are a categorical match to f or i.based on a comparison of the statutes,we conclude they are not.the second and third ways to commit the crime are not categorical matches,as their language aided,counselled,or procured or committed an act preliminary to or in furtherance does not exist in f or i.however,one provision of section a ny person who willfully and maliciously attempts to set fire to or attempts to burn any structure,forest land or property is a categorical match.thus,a modified approach must be taken to determine whether petitioner pled guilty to this provision.
the complaint to which petitioner pled guilty includes all three divisible crimes but uses and rather than or to join them.moreover,the abstract of judgment does not limit petitioner plea of guilty to one indivisible crime,but rather shows that petitioner pled guilty to the alleged single count listed.therefore,applying the modified approach,we conclude that petitioner pled guilty to willfully and maliciously attempt ing to set fire to or attempt ing to burn any structure,forest land or property.as a result,the bia did not err in concluding that petitioner committed an aggravated felony.
aggravated felonies are enumerated in section a of the ina,and include offenses described in i.a e i.t he term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in section a whether in violation of federal or state law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous years.id.a.
the only remaining aspect of petitioner argument,and the part on which the parties focus,is that other federal elements prevent california penal code section from being a categorical match.specifically,the elements are any building,vehicle,or other personal or real property in whole or in part owned or possessed by,or leased to,the united states,or any department or agency thereof,or any institution or organization receiving federal financial assistance,f,and any building,vehicle,or other real or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce,i.because we conclude petitioner attempted arson conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under i,we need not address petitioner challenge to f.
we conclude that this additional federal element is purely jurisdictional and must be disregarded for our instant purposes.indeed,in the context of state convictions,both this court and the bia have previously determined that purely jurisdictional elements should be disregarded in determining whether those state laws categorically qualified as aggravated felonies under federal law.first,in united states castillo rivera,cir,we held that enhancement of a criminal sentence for removal subsequent to deportation for an aggravated felony was proper when the defendant had previously been convicted under a state statute.we concluded that violations of california possession statute categorically qualified as aggravated felonies under the corresponding provision of federal law,g,despite the lack of any jurisdictional element under state law.id.interpreting the same basic provisions of federal law relevant here,we reasoned 
the wording of a makes evident that congress clearly intended state crimes to serve as predicate offenses for the purpose of defining what constitutes an aggravated felony.section a explicitly states that t he term applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law.a.moreover,a e defines aggravated felony as an offense described in several federal statutory provisions,including g.id.as we have previously noted,congress as a practical matter had to use some looser standard such as described in rather than the more precise standard of defined in,if it wanted more than a negligble number of state offenses to count as aggravated felonies.united states sandoval barajas,cir.interpreting the jurisdictional element of g to be necessary in order for a state firearms conviction to constitute an aggravated felony under a e ii would reduce the number of state firearms offenses that qualify to no more than a negligible number.rarely,if ever,would a state firearms conviction specify whether a commerce nexus exists.if we were to construe the jurisdictional nexus of the federal felon in possession provision to be a necessary element for a state crime to qualify as an aggravated felony,we would undermine the language of the aggravated felony statute and the evident intent of congress.
id.at footnote omitted.we also reasoned that the inclusion of foreign offenses in the aggravated felony statute further supported the conclusion that federal jurisdictional elements should not be considered for categorical purposes.id.at.otherwise,a lthough a foreign commerce nexus would be a possibility,there is still no reason to believe that anything other than a negligible number of foreign offenses would qualify because it is the commerce clause of the constitution that lends such an element any legal significance.id.internal citations omitted.
subsequently,in in re vasquez muniz,the bia applied castillo rivera directly in the immigration context.the vasquez muniz panel also reasoned that great weight should attach to the penultimate sentence of section a.id.at.according to the panel,use of the phrase described in indicated that the penultimate sentence provided a guide to congress intent that the crimes specified are aggravated felonies regardless of whether they fall within the jurisdiction of the federal government,a state,or,in certain cases,a foreign country.id.the language clearly reflects a concern over substantive offenses rather than any concern about the jurisdiction in which they are prosecuted.id.the bia concluded that to give this language meaning,it must render irrelevant any purely jurisdictional element appearing in the crimes enumerated.id.at.
in addition,the bia reasoned that its conclusion was bolstered by the fact that owing to the nature of federal and state jurisdictional requirements,it would be very rare for a state to include federal jurisdictional language within its criminal statutes.id.at.consequently,if state crimes must include a federal jurisdictional element in order to be classified as aggravated felonies,then virtually no state crimes would ever be included in section a e,despite the statute language to the contrary.id.the panel concluded that the act,in its overall design,in the language of the aggravated felony provision itself,and in the very specific reference noted above,clearly contemplates that subparagraph e of t
