zeeshan manzoor petitions for relief from the denial of his claims for asylum and withholding of deportation.to qualify for asylum,an applicant must show that he or she faces a fear of persecution.the board of immigration appeals bia or board found that manzoor had experienced past persecution in his native pakistan on account of his political opinion,giving rise to a statutory presumption of a fear of future persecution.the burden then shifts to the immigration and naturalization service ins to rebut that presumption.here the bia erred by imposing part of the ins burden on the applicant.it did so by requiring manzoor to establish that his fear of future persecution was after he had shown that he was persecuted in a particular region,possibly with some involvement by the federal government.because of that legal error,we vacate the judgment of the bia and remand for further proceedings.
we summarize zeeshan manzoor testimony,which the bia found credible.manzoor is a native of karachi,a city in the sindh province of pakistan.he is an ethnic mohajir,a group defined as the native descendants of those who immigrated to pakistan when india was partitioned in.
manzoor said that he is a member of the mohajir quami movement mqm.according to reports by the state department and amnesty international,the mqm was founded in by mohajirs who felt disadvantaged in relation to native sindhis.the same reports explain that a faction called the haqiqi split off from the main mqm,now sometimes called the mqm a,in the early.both the state department and amnesty international say that relations between the haqiqi and mqm a are tense and have led to political violence and killing.
manzoor testified that haqiqi workers kidnaped him in and again in october and that shots were fired at his father house.manzoor said that his family did not report these incidents to the pakistani police because the police sometimes exchange information with the haqiqi.after manzoor escaped from the second kidnaping,his father arranged for him to leave pakistan.manzoor waited two months for a visa.he said he had to cancel his departure three times because the pakistani police and immigration service had his name listed as an active mqm a member.in february,he paid a bribe to facilitate his departure and left pakistan.manzoor traveled to paris and the dominican republic.on february,the coast guard caught him trying to enter puerto rico illegally by boat.
after being caught,manzoor told authorities that he would be killed by haqiqi members or members of the pakistan people party if he were returned to pakistan.an asylum officer interviewed manzoor and determined that his testimony was sufficiently credible to warrant a hearing before an immigration judge.manzoor was also charged with being subject to removal from the united states under a a i i at a hearing on july,manzoor admitted the allegations against him,conceded removability,and requested asylum and withholding of removal.the immigration judge found manzoor removable as charged but granted him a continuance to allow him to submit an asylum application.when manzoor filed the application,the judge forwarded it to the state department for an advisory opinion about conditions in pakistan.
on october,after receiving the state department country profile of pakistan,the judge held a hearing on the merits of manzoor asylum petition.as recounted here,manzoor testified about his membership in the mqm,the kidnapings,and his flight from pakistan.the judge asked manzoor if he had considered moving to a different part of pakistan.manzoor said i could not go to another area because you,require identity card and i do have identity card,because if i go to karachi by road,they have a check post,and because i speak urdu,they turn me over to mqm haqiqi,and they kill me.when the judge asked him if he could travel by airplane,manzoor responded this is not possible because on airport there is police and then there is mqm haqiqi people all over airline station,so they get hold of us.the judge did not ask the ins any questions about whether the persecution of mqm members is limited to sindh province.
in her oral decision of november,the judge denied manzoor request for asylum and withholding of removal.the judge said that manzoor testimony was vague,unpersuasive,not corroborated,and inconsistent with the state department country profile.she found that manzoor had not established persecution by the pakistani government or by a faction that the government could not control.in addition,relying on the country profile of the state department,the judge said that there were no credible reports of harassment and abuse of mqm members outside of sindh province,and that manzoor could therefore relocate to a different part of pakistan.
manzoor appealed to the bia,which issued its opinion in the matter on july.the bia said that the immigration judge did not explicitly find the respondent testimony not to be credible,and that it was thus difficult to defer to the judge findings.the board said that after reviewing the transcript of manzoor testimony,it could find no support in the record for an adverse credibility finding.instead,the board found manzoor account to be detailed and consistent,and said that his testimony and supporting documentation,especially regarding the political climate in pakistan and the activities of the mqm other political parties,are consistent with the country profile prepared by the department of state.as a result,the bia found manzoor testimony credible.the bia also said that it agree d with the respondent contention on appeal that the immigration judge failed to fully consider the documentary evidence provided by the respondent.in light of manzoor testimony and supporting documentation,the bia found that manzoor was persecuted on account of his political opinion and stated that because manzoor had demonstrated past persecution,he is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.
despite these findings,the bia denied manzoor request for asylum and withholding of deportation on the ground that manzoor failed to show that the threat of persecution existed.a majority of the panel found that while the record clearly indicates that conditions in karachi continue to be dangerous for members of the mqm,the record reflects that mqm members are able to live safely outside of the sindh province.a dissenting board member took a different view of the evidence 
the record indicates that the are in collusion with both the federal government and the military in pakistan.this cooperative relationship,when coupled with the pervasive military and police presence throughout pakistan,makes it unlikely that the respondent will be able to return to a different location within pakistan where he could successfully avoid future persecution.
section a of the immigration and nationality act authorizes the attorney general,in his or her discretion,to grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee.a ins,d.the act defines a refugee as an alien who can not or does not want to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.we review the bia legal conclusions de novo,with appropriate deference to the agency interpretation of the underlying statute in accordance with administrative law principles.gailius ins,cir.
