fabio garcia,a native and citizen of columbia,applied for asylum.he claimed that members of the revolutionary armed forces of columbia farc,an insurgent group,had threatened him because he was providing assistance to impoverished widows and orphans.the immigration judge ij denied garcia application,which his wife,luz marina franco,had joined.the ij found garcia to be credible,but concluded that the threats he described did not constitute persecution.the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirmed the ij decision,and garcia brought this petition for review.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we deny the petition.
background 
garcia entered the united states in november on a visitor visa,which he overstayed.his wife had entered the united states in december and overstayed her visitor visa as well.during removal proceedings,garcia conceded removability,but requested asylum and withholding of removal on the ground that he had received death threats from farc and feared that,if he returned to colombia,he would be killed.at his removal hearing,garcia testified that he was an entrepreneur who bought products from the peasants and farmers in ubalá and sold them to distributors in bogotá.in addition to his business dealings in ubalá,he began taking clothing and toys to the widows and children living in ubalá shanty towns.soon thereafter,the colombian institute of family welfare,a government organization located in bogotá,formally commissioned garcia to continue his humanitarian work on its behalf.with the official support of the government,garcia was able to increase the amount of aid he could provide to the peasants of ubalá.he also began examining human rights violations by farc.
garcia testified that his first encounter with farc occurred in june.he was on his way to the church in ubalá when a peasant,who identified himself as a farc helper,patted garcia on the back and told him to stop helping the women and the orphans and to stop engaging in politics.at.garcia said he considered reporting the incident,but the mayor of ubalá convinced him not to file an official complaint.instead,the mayor sent two police officers with garcia to protect him while he carried out his official duties.garcia testified that he felt safe walking around with the officers.
garcia also recounted his second with farc,which occurred in december while he was campaigning for three candidates for elective office.during the campaign he received a call at his parents house in bogotá from someone who identified himself as a member of farc.the caller told him that farc had him under surveillance and that he was going to die if he did not stop his activities.id.at.the next month garcia received a letter telling him that,if he did not stop his humanitarian and political activities,farc would initiate a trial by the people.id.at.garcia interpreted this threat to mean that the group would kill him.once again he consulted the mayor about filing a complaint but decided against it after he learned that the mayor also had been threatened.instead,garcia testified,he stopped all of his activities.
in april,while garcia was attending a dairy fair in ubate,two men grabbed him by the arms and told him,you thought you were going to get away and that you were going to pay.id.at.garcia testified that he started shouting for help,and the men escaped into the crowd.frightened,garcia immediately left for bogotá.despite moving,garcia explained,he continued to receive threatening phone calls at his parents house in bogotá and also received threatening calls on his cell phone.
garcia final encounter with farc occurred in november.he testified that he had traveled back to ubalá with the town mayor to celebrate the political victories of the three candidates he had helped to elect.he and the mayor traveled with police officers and did not let anyone know that they were planning to attend the celebration.nothing happened to garcia while he was in ubalá,but,on the way back to bogotá,he was stopped at a farc roadblock and asked for identification.garcia testified that one of the men at the roadblock was one of the assailants who had grabbed him at the dairy fair in ubate.the man pulled garcia from the car and hit him on the head with the butt of his gun.shortly thereafter,the colombian air force arrived and fired shots from a helicopter,freeing the people who had been stopped at the roadblock.as the man from ubate ran off,he told garcia that they would meet again.when garcia returned to his parents home,he learned that a caller from farc had warned that garcia would be killed the next time someone from farc saw him.garcia testified that he fled to the united states later that month and that he feared he would be killed if he returned to colombia.
the ij found garcia credible,but nevertheless denied his asylum application.the ij ruled that garcia had not demonstrated past persecution because farc never acted on any of its threats and because garcia did not demonstrate that the colombian government was unable or unwilling to protect him.the ij further ruled that,although garcia has a genuine subjective fear of returning to colombia,he had failed to establish that his fear was objectively reasonable.again,the ij noted that,during the time farc was threatening him,garcia never was harmed seriously,nor did garcia offer any evidence that farc carried out any of the threats it made against the mayor of ubalá.the ij denied all forms of relief,and the bia affirmed without opinion.
discussion 
garcia contends that the bia erred in its conclusion that he did not qualify for asylum on the ground that he had failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution.where,as here,the bia summarily affirms the decision of the ij,we review the ij decision as the final agency determination.tapiero de orejuela gonzales,cir.we review the ij denial of an asylum claim under the substantial evidence standard.feto gonzales,cir.we shall affirm if we find that the ij decision is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.id.at citing ahmed ashcroft,cir.under this deferential standard,we shall not reverse the ij determination simply because we would have decided the case differently.margos gonzales,cir citing gonzales,cir.
past persecution 
garcia contends that his testimony that members of farc repeatedly had threatened to kill him if he did not stop his humanitarian activities demonstrated that he was persecuted on account of an imputed political opinion.to demonstrate past persecution,however,it is not enough simply to demonstrate some harm on account of a political opinion.to show past persecution,when the harm alleged was inflicted at the hands of private parties,a petitioner must demonstrate that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect him against the private parties.see a a tarraf gonzales,cir hor gonzales,cir.
here,the ij found that members of farc are not governmental actors and that garcia had failed to demonstrate that the colombian government either condoned their behavior or was unwilling or unable to protect garcia from it.garcia himself admitted during his removal hearing that the mayor of ubalá assigned two colombian police officers to escort him as he carried out his humanitarian missions and that their presence made him feel safe.he later testified that he was again saved by the colombian government when air force helicopters rescued him after he and others were stopped at a farc roadblock.far from demonstrating an unwillingness or inability to protect him,garcia own testimony demonstrates that the government of columbia was both willing and able to protect him from farc.gonzales,cir upholding the ij conclusion that the petitioner did not demonstrate that the government of columbia was unwilling or unable to protect him from farc where the record indicated that police responded immediately to his report that farc members threatened to kill him and that no further threats had been made.
future persecution 
garcia next contends that the ij erroneously concluded that he did not establish a fear of future persecution.garcia submits that his
