after nicolas carpio leon,a citizen of mexico,was indicted for possessing firearms while being illegally or unlawfully in the united states,in violation of g,he filed a motion to dismiss the charge,contending that g violated his rights under the second and fifth amendments to the united states constitution.the district court denied carpio leon motion,and carpio leon then pleaded guilty to that charge,as well as to an illegal entry charge,reserving,as part of his plea agreement,the right to appeal the district court conclusion that g is constitutional.
concluding that g is constitutional,we affirm.on carpio leon second amendment challenge,we conclude that the scope of the second amendment does not extend to provide protection to illegal aliens,because illegal aliens are not members of the political community and aliens who have entered the united states unlawfully have no more rights under the second amendment than do aliens outside of the united states seeking admittance.on carpioleon fifth amendment challenge,we conclude that prohibiting illegal aliens,as a class,from possessing firearms is rationally related to congress legitimate interest in public safety.
following a consensual search of carpio leon home on february,in orangeburg,south carolina,immigration and customs enforcement agents recovered a caliber marlin rifle,a mm hi point model c pistol,and ammunition.carpio leon admitted that he had stored the firearms in his master bedroom and that he was in the united states illegally.he was thereafter indicted in two counts charging him with possession of a firearm by an alien illegally or unlawfully in the united states,in violation of g a and illegal entry into the united states,in violation of a.
carpio leon filed a motion to dismiss count i on the ground that g violates his rights under the second amendment and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.at the hearing on the motion,he introduced evidence that he and his wife had lived in orangeburg for some years and had three children,all of whom were born in the united states that he had no prior criminal record that he had filed income tax returns and that a caliber and a mm pistol could be the type of arms one would use for protection of their homes and children.he also stipulated that he was in the united states illegally and that he had used a false social security number to obtain a driver license.
the district court denied carpio leon motion,concluding that heller and other supreme court precedent foreclose his argument that aliens illegally present in the united states are among those protected by the second amendment.alternatively,the court ruled that g survives intermediate scrutiny,the relevant standard,because g iven congress legitimate concerns about the dangers potentially posed by individuals who have violated this country immigration laws and either entered or remain present inside its borders illegally,g a reasonably addresses the governmental objective of keeping firearms out of the possession of illegal aliens.the court rejected carpioleon fifth amendment claim because it found,for the same reasons given in its analysis of his second amendment claim,that g does not deprive carpio leon of any fundamental constitutional right.
after the court denied his motion to dismiss,carpio leon entered a conditional guilty plea to both counts of the indictment,reserving the right to appeal the issue of g constitutionality.the court sentenced carpio leon on october,to time served on count i and to six months imprisonment on count ii,with both sentences to run concurrently.it ordered two years supervised release on count i and,as additional conditions,directed carpio leon to surrender to a immigration official for deportation consideration in accordance with established procedures provided by the immigration and naturalization act,et and not to the united states for the duration of supervised release and not without the approval of the united states attorney general or the secretary of homeland security.
this appeal followed.
carpio leon contends that possession of firearms typically used for in one home is protected by the second amendment,even when such possession is by an illegal alien.recognizing the historical analysis required in construing the second amendment,he argues that the second amendment could not have been intended to exclude illegal aliens from its scope because in,attitudes toward immigration were the reverse of today attitudes and immigrants also known as settlers were deemed absolutely necessary to the development and survival of the new nation.carpio leon also argues that there is no empirical evidence demonstrating that undocumented workers in their homes,the classification into which he falls,are any more dangerous to society than legal aliens or,for that matter,native born united states citizens.thus,he asserts,g is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.
the government contends that the second amendment does not protect illegal aliens because it codified a preexisting right to bear arms that historically has been enjoyed only by,responsible citizens,and illegal aliens are necessarily not law abiding.in any event,it argues that g survives intermediate scrutiny by serving an important interest in public safety.it also notes that congress has broad power over matters and can choose to disarm illegal aliens.
we have not had occasion to address a second amendment challenge to g.the fifth,eighth,and tenth circuits,however,have upheld the provision in the face of a second amendment challenge,and we have found no court of appeals decision that has found it unconstitutional.the fifth circuit and the eighth circuit held that the protection of the second amendment does not extend to illegal aliens.see united states portillo munoz,cir,cert.denied,d united states flores,cir per curiam,cert.denied,wl june.and the tenth circuit avoided the question of whether illegal aliens are protected by the second amendment and upheld g because it passed intermediate scrutiny.see united states huitron guizar,cir.
as we have previously observed,a ny second amendment analysis must now begin with the supreme court recent seminal decision in heller,which held that the second amendment providing that the right of the people to keep and bear arms,shall not be infringed codified a preexisting right that allows individuals to keep and bear arms.united states carter,cir citing district of columbia heller,d.in heller,the court,finding that the second amendment protects an individual right to bear arms,struck down the district of columbia bans on handgun possession in the home and on having a firearm in the home that is immediately operable.heller,at.but in doing so,the court cautioned that the right to bear arms has limits.of course the right to bear arms is not unlimited,just as the first amendment right of free speech is not.id.at.
thus,the second amendment does not guarantee the right to possess for every purpose,to possess every type of weapon,to possess at every place,or to possess by every person.see united states chester,cir significantly,heller recognized that the right to keep and bear arms,like other constitutional rights,is limited in scope and subject to some regulation carter,at explaining that under heller,the right to keep and bear arms depends not only on the purpose for which it is exercised but also on the relevant characteristics of the person invoking the right huitron guizar,at the right to bear arms,however venerable,is qualified by what one might call the who,what,where,when,and why.as the heller court itself enumerated the limitations,the constitution does not protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of confrontation,at the right to bear arms does not guarantee the right to possess every type of weapon,id.at and not every person has the right to possess a firearm n othing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,id.at.the court also noted that the presumptively lawful regulatory measures it identified were only examples and that its list did not purport to be exhaustive.id.at.
to apply heller,we follow the approach set forth in chester,asking first 
whether the challenged law imposes a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the second amendment guarantee.this historical inquiry seeks to determine whether the conduct at issue was understood to be within the scope of the right at the time of ratification.if it was not,then the challenged law is valid.
chester,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.if,however,the regulation is found to burden conduct that falls within the scope of the second amendment protections,we move to the second step of applying an appropriate form of scrutiny.id.
employing this analytical structure here,we start by determining whether the scope of the second amendment includes the protection of aliens who are illegally in this country.
beginning with the text,the second amendment provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.const.amend.ii emphasis added.in providing its protection to the people,the amendment is distinguishable from the fifth and fourteenth amendments,which provide protections to persons.as heller noted,the term the people is a term of art,which is also used in the first and fourth amendments,that refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.heller,at quoting united states verdugo urquidez,d.
heller does not make clear,however,whether illegal aliens can ever be part of the political community and therefore be included in the class of persons labeled the people.heller does frequently connect and citizenship.for example,its analysis of the phrase right of the people ends by concluding,we start therefore with a strong presumption that the second amendment right is exercised individually and belongs to all americans.heller,at emphasis added see also id.at,connecting citizenship and the right to bear arms.we should be cautious,however,in assuming that the court defined the people as excluding illegal aliens because the court used verdugourquidez to explain the meaning of the people.in verdugourquidez,the court noted that its assumption in lopez mendoza,d,that the fourth amendment applies to illegal aliens is not dispositive of how the court would rule on a fourth amendment claim by illegal aliens in the united states if such a claim were squarely before it.verdugo urquidez,at.though verdugo urquidez certainly did not rule out the possibility that illegal aliens have only limited fourth amendment rights,it did not rule on whether illegal aliens were part of the people.id.at.the supreme court precedent is therefore not clear on whether the people includes illegal aliens.
here,we need not limit our analysis to the scope of the term the people and thereby become enmeshed in the question of whether the people includes illegal aliens or whether the term has the same scope in each of its constitutional uses.this is because heller concludes,through a distinct analysis,that the core right historically protected by the second amendment is the right of by,responsible citizens.carter,at emphasis added quoting heller,at see also united states moore,cir holding that a defendant with prior felony and violent crime convictions simply does not fall within the category of citizens to which the heller court ascribed the second amendment protection of the right of responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home quoting heller,at united states masciandaro,cir identifying the fundamental,core right of the second amendment as in the home by a citizen emphasis added,cert.denied,d.
the heller court reached the second amendment connection to citizens through a historical analysis,independent of its discussion about who constitutes the people.see heller,at.the court read united states miller,to say that the second amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by citizens for lawful purposes.heller,at emphasis added.when looking at prior gun regulation,the court found that f or most of our history,the bill of rights was not thought applicable to the states,and the federal government did not significantly regulate the possession of firearms by citizens.id.emphasis added.the court was careful to note that its opinion should not be read to limit the government ability to disarm individuals who can not be trusted with firearms.see id.at stating that nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill.finally,the court concluded that whatever else the second amendment leaves to future evaluation,it surely elevates above all other interests the right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.id.at emphasis added.
even though the heller court stressed that the core right of the second amendment protects members of the political community,it did not face a law prohibiting firearms possession by a particular class of persons.nonetheless,we can employ the historical analysis it prescribed to apply its observations to this case,see chester,at,and thus to reach the conclusion that we do that illegal aliens do not belong to the class of members of the political community to whom the second amendment gives protection.
m ost scholars of the second amendment agree that the right to bear arms was tied to the concept of a virtuous citizenry and that,accordingly,the government could disarm unvirtuous citizens.united states yancey,cir quoting united states vongxay,cir citing glenn harlan reynolds,a critical guide to the second amendment,don kates,the second amendment a dialogue,law contemp,winter,at.for example,felons were excluded from the right to arms because they were deemed unvirtuous.reynolds,supra,at see also david yassky,the second amendment structure,history,and constitutional change,the average citizen whom the founders wished to see armed was a man of republican virtue.
colonial governments often barred potential subversives from owning firearms.joyce lee malcolm,to keep and bear arms the origins of an anglo american right detailing colonial laws preventing suspect populations from owning firearms.in several colonial states,refusal to swear allegiance to the state or the country warranted disarmament.saul cornell nathan dedino,a well regulated right the early american origins of gun control,fordham,during the american revolution,several states passed laws providing for the confiscation of weapons owned by persons refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the state or the united states see also saul cornell,do know much about history the current crisis in second amendment scholarship,describing the right to bear arms in colonial pennsylvania as a civic right,one that was limited to those members of the polity who were deemed capable of exercising it in a virtuous manner.similarly,after shays rebellion,to obtain a pardon for taking up arms against the state,massachusetts required swearing allegiance to the state and giving up firearms for three years.cornell dedino,supra,at.
also,several early proposals for the bill of rights demonstrate the understanding that the core protection of the second amendment belongs to citizens.delegates asked the massachusetts ratifying convention to recommend barring congress from prevent ing the people of the united states,who are peaceable citizens,from keeping their own arms.bernard schwartz,the bill of rights a documentary history leon friedman et.the new hampshire convention similarly proposed that congress shall never disarm any citizen unless such as are or have been in actual rebellion.id.at.
finally,the prefounding english right to bear arms supports this limitation of second amendment rights.heller,at analyzing the english law prior to the founding to interpret the operative clause of the second amendment.in england,the right to bear arms allowed the government to disarm those it considered disloyal or dangerous.see patrick charles,arms for their defense an historical,legal,and textual analysis of the english
