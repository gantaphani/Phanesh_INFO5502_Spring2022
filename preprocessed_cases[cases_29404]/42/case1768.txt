this case primarily involves whether defense counsel or a trial judge must inform a criminal defendant of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea.the district court concluded that jesus natividad had failed to establish that his counsel provided ineffective assistance or that his plea was involuntary.for the following reasons,we affirm the ruling of the district court.
background 
has been a legal resident alien of the united states since.on september,drove into a united states border patrol checkpoint approximately fifteen miles north of laredo,texas.during an inspection,agents discovered that one of passengers was an undocumented alien.was then arrested and charged with aiding and abetting the illegal entry of an alien in violation of and a.
two days later,appeared before a magistrate judge and pleaded guilty.before entering his plea,consulted with assistant federal public defender myrna montemayor montemayor.another assistant federal public defender,paul saenz saenz,represented during his plea colloquy.the magistrate judge sentenced to one year of supervised probation and assessed a fine and a special assessment.completed his probation without incident.
as a result of his guilty plea,the department of homeland security dhs brought removal proceedings against.dhs alleged that was removable because he had knowingly encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided another alien to illegally enter the united states within five years of his entry into the country.see a e i.an immigration judge ij initially determined that was not removable based upon his conviction.the board of immigration appeals later disagreed,vacating the ij decision and remanding the case for a new ruling.
the ij postponed entering the new ruling,however,due to filing a petition for a writ of coram nobis.filed this petition with the magistrate judge that had accepted his guilty plea and sentenced him.in his petition,alleged that his counsel provided ineffective assistance and that his guilty plea was involuntary.after a hearing and filings from both and the government,the magistrate judge granted the petition for a writ of coram nobis,vacating conviction and ordering a new trial.
the government then moved the district court to strike the magistrate judge order and remove the case to the district court.the district court granted the motion,holding that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to decide the petition.the district court thus vacated the magistrate judge decision and noted that the petition remained pending before the district court.the district court later denied petition for a writ of coram nobis.this timely appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court assumption of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.singh duane morris llp,cir.on appeal from a district court denial of a petition for a writ of coram nobis,we review factual findings for clear error,questions of law de novo,and the district court ultimate decision to deny the writ for abuse of discretion.see united states mandanici,cir alikhani united states,cir.we note that a district court abuses its discretion when it bases its decision on an erroneous legal conclusion or on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.james cain,cir citing mcgary scott,cir.
iii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
argues that the district court erred in vacating the magistrate judge order.the district court held that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction because delegation of such authority to a magistrate judge would violate article iii of the constitution,and the district court had not referred the case to the magistrate judge pursuant to b b or c.we affirm the district court conclusion solely on the lack of referral.
first suggests that the magistrate judge had authority to hear his petition because she was the judge who sentenced him.he notes that a coram nobis proceeding is brought in the sentencing court,like a motion.united states cooper,cir italics omitted,abrogated on other grounds by smith barry,d.as pleaded before and was sentenced by a magistrate judge,he suggests that the magistrate judge was the only proper forum in which to file his petition.essentially argues that the magistrate judge statutory authority to sentence him implicitly included the authority to hear his petition for a writ of coram nobis.
in determining whether a magistrate judge has the authority to address a particular claim,we ask first whether congress intended for the magistrate judge to perform that task,and then whether such exercise of authority is constitutional.see united states johnston,cir united states dees,cir.congress explicitly granted a magistrate judge the authority to conduct misdemeanor trials and impose sentences for petty offenses in a.that same section,however,also includes two distinct avenues for a magistrate judge to hear applications for relief such as a petition for a writ of coram nobis.under b b,a district court can refer an application for relief to a magistrate judge for hearings and a recommended disposition.under c,a magistrate judge can hear and decide any civil case,including civil applications for relief,when the district court designates it to do so and the parties consent.we do not think that congress would explicitly provide two ways for a magistrate judge to hear a petition for a writ of coram nobis but silently intend that the magistrate judge authority over certain criminal matters include a third.in light of these provisions,we do not interpret the magistrate judge authority to sentence as inherently including the authority to hear a subsequent petition for a writ of coram nobis.
also argues that the magistrate had jurisdiction pursuant to c.section c provides,in pertinent part,
upon the consent of the parties,a united states magistrate judge may conduct any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case,when specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court or courts he serves.
accordingly,for the magistrate judge to hear petition for a writ of coram nobis pursuant to c,the parties must have consented to proceed before the magistrate judge,the proceeding must be a civil matter,and the district court must have specially designated the magistrate judge to exercise such jurisdiction.
the parties agree that the petition was a civil matter but dispute whether the government consented to the proceedings before the magistrate judge.we see a more fundamental error,however,in the lack of a special designation by the district court.although neither party raises the issue of special designation,t he district court order of reference,or special designation,pursuant to c,is a jurisdictional concern that we must examine,sua sponte if necessary.hill city of seven points,cir.w hen the magistrate enters judgment pursuant to c,absence of the appropriate consent and reference or special designation order results in a lack of jurisdiction mendes junior int l sokai maru,cir.there is no indication in the record that the district court ever referred or specially designated petition to the magistrate judge,and the district court noted that it had not done so.the magistrate judge thus did not have jurisdiction to hear petition under c.
consequently,we affirm the district court conclusion that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction to hear petition.because we hold that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction on statutory grounds,we express no opinion as to the district court conclusion that the magistrate judge exercise of jurisdiction in the present case would violate article iii of the constitution.we thus turn to the merits of appeal from the district court judgment.
merits of the writ of coram nobis 
in united states esogbue,this court described the writ of coram nobis as follows 
the writ of coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy available to a petitioner no longer in custody who seeks to vacate a criminal conviction in circumstances where the petitioner can demonstrate civil disabilities as a consequence of the conviction,and that the challenged error is of sufficient magnitude to justify the extraordinary relief.
cir quotation omitted.the writ of coram nobis exists to correct errors of the most fundamental character,id.at quoting united states morgan,and will issue only to correct errors resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice,jimenez trominski,cir.further,t he writ will issue only when no other remedy is available and when sound reasons exist for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief.united states dyer,cir quotation and alteration omitted.
as the district court correctly concluded,a writ of coram nobis is the proper avenue for to seek relief.is no longer in custody and seeks to vacate his misdemeanor aiding and abetting conviction because it triggered removal proceedings against him.esogbue,at.the district court also held that had established sound reasons for failing to seek appropriate earlier relief,and the parties do not dispute this conclusion.
has no avenue for relief from deportation and raises three errors that he asserts warrant coram nobis relief based on the advice he received and did not receive regarding the certainty of his deportation.first,he argues that his defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by affirmatively misrepresenting the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.second and alternatively,argues that his defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to warn him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.finally,argues that his plea was involuntary due to the magistrate judge failure to admonish him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.we address each argument in turn.
ineffective assistance of counsel due to affirmative misrepresentation 
as to first argument,ineffective assistance of counsel is an error that can warrant coram nobis relief.see united states castro,cir.the standard for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel is the familiar test from the supreme court decision in strickland washington the defendant must establish that counsel performance was deficient,and counsel performance prejudiced the defendant.castro,at citing strickland washington,d united states banda,cir see also hill lockhart,d holding that the strickland test applies to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in plea bargaining.we determine whether counsel performance was deficient by measuring it against an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.castro,at quotation omitted.as to prejudice,the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.quotations and alteration omitted.
asserts that his counsel misled him into thinking that he had a chance of remaining in the country if he pleaded guilty.montemayor stated in her affidavit that it is her practice to always advise resident alien defendants that there is a possibility that they may be deported as a result of their plea of guilty to the criminal charge against them,and that they may want to consult with an immigration lawyer.argues that this statement was an affirmative misrepresentation of the law montemayor indicated that deportation was possible,when in fact it was almost certain.thus argues that montemayor misled him into thinking that he could plead guilty but avoid deportation.further,according to affidavit,saenz gave an immigration lawyer business card and suggested that call the lawyer if he had any problems with immigration.argues that this only compounded montemayor misrepresentation.by leaving him with the impression that deportation was not certain,argues,his counsel performance was deficient 
in support of his argument,relies on united states kwan,cir,and united states couto,cir.in both kwan and couto,attorneys indicated to their clients that guilty pleas to aggravated felonies would not necessarily result in deportation when deportation was actually a near certainty.see kwan,at couto,at.in both cases,the court held that an attorney misleading statements about the deportation consequences of a guilty plea constituted objectively unreasonable conduct that satisfies strickland first prong.see kwan,at couto,at.
the attorneys actions in kwan and couto,however,were quite different from the public defenders actions in the present case.in couto,the attorney assured his client that they could deal with her immigration problem after the guilty plea.at.the second circuit found fault in the attorney representations that there were a lot of things that could be done to avoid deportation and that his client should not worry about it.id.at.according to the court,these statements affirmatively misled the defendant into believing there were things that could be done to avoid deportation when in fact there were none.id.at.
in kwan,the attorney responded to the defendant specific questions regarding the deportation consequences of a guilty plea,gave erroneous advice,and represented himself as having expertise on the immigration consequences of criminal convictions.at.the ninth circuit emphasized that the attorney made an affirmative representation to the defendant that he had knowledge and experience regarding the immigration consequences of criminal convictions.id.at.moreover,the court noted that 
i f counsel did not have the requisite competence in immigration law,or if counsel did not plan on maintaining the requisite competence,he should not have advised the defendant regarding the immigration consequences of his plea without referring the defendant to an immigration lawyer or consulting himself with an immigration lawyer in the first place.
in contrast,neither montemayor nor saenz represented that they had any expertise in immigration law,nor did they suggest that could probably avoid deportation after pleading guilty.they also did not purport to answer any questions had regarding deportation.further,montemayor statement put on notice that there were potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea and suggested that he should seek out an immigration attorney.saenz even gave the name of an immigration attorney that he could contact.while montemayor statement that deportation was possible might indicate that deportation was not a certainty,it is not so inherently misleading in this context that it constitutes an affirmative misrepresentation of the law.zhang united states,d,noting that an attorney advice regarding the immigration consequences of a guilty plea was mistaken,but not an affirmative misrepresentation.under these circumstances,we can not hold that the behavior of public defenders was objectively unreasonable.consequently,has failed to establish deficient performance due to affirmative misrepresentation.
ineffective assistance of counsel due to failure to warn 
in his second argument,asserts that the district court erred in finding no ineffective assistance due to his counsel failure to warn him of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea.the district court held that counsel was not required to advise of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea because,under our decision in banda,deportation is a collateral consequence of a guilty plea.see banda,at holding that an attorney failure to advise a client that deportation is a possible consequence of a guilty plea does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
this court has clearly stated that d efense counsel has done all he must under the constitution when he advises his client of the direct consequences of a guilty plea.id.at.that is,counsel failure to inform a defendant of the collateral consequences of a guilty plea is never deficient performance under strickland suggests,however,that our decision in banda left open the question of whether an attorney failure to advise a client that deportation is a certain consequence of a guilty plea constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.suggests that certain deportation is a direct consequence of a guilty plea,and an attorney must therefore inquire about her client immigration status and inform her client of this consequence.
misconstrues our decision in banda.in banda,we held that the possibility of a collateral consequence of the criminal process.see id.at likening dep
