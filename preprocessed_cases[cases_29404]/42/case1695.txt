essam helmi el shami el shami or the defendant appeals his conviction for unlawful reentry of a deported alien under a and b although a jury also convicted el shami of one count of social security fraud and one count of credit card fraud,he does not appeal these convictions.el shami argues that this court should vacate his illegal reentry after deportation conviction under d because he satisfies the three requirements for a collateral attack of a prior deportation order under d because we conclude that the prior deportation order was flawed under section d,we vacate the illegal reentry conviction.
in may,el shami was arrested in colonial heights,virginia,after being found in possession of numerous fraudulent documents,including fraudulently obtained credit cards and social security cards.after determining that el shami had been deported to egypt in august pursuant to an order of the immigration and naturalization service ins and had never received permission to this country,the united states charged el shami with illegal reentry after deportation.
the facts underlying el shami deportation are as follows.el shami immigrated to the united states from egypt in and became a permanent resident alien in.the defendant married a united states citizen and owned and operated two successful businesses in the new jersey area.on july,el shami was convicted of criminal sexual contact in the new jersey superior court for passaic county.el shami was convicted of aggravated arson in the same court on august.
subsequently,in early,ins officials initiated deportation proceedings.on march,ins agents personally served el shami with an order to show cause and notice of a hearing at his residence in guttenberg,new jersey.this order to show cause informed el shami that he was subject to deportation under the immigration and nationality act for being previously convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude criminal sexual contact and aggravated arson.after being taken into custody by ins and transferred to oakdale,louisiana,el shami appeared for a bond hearing on march.at that hearing in louisiana,the immigration judge released el shami on a bond.after his release,el shami provided the ins with his address of record in guttenberg,new jersey,for all correspondence regarding the scheduling of his deportation hearing.after returning to new jersey,el shami hired an attorney,who successfully moved for a transfer of the deportation proceedings to the immigration court in new jersey 
once the case was transferred to new jersey,the immigration court eventually scheduled the final deportation show cause hearing for october.although el shami did not appear at this hearing,the immigration judge proceeded in absentia and ordered el shami deported to egypt.subsequently,in august,ins officials took el shami into custody and deported him to egypt.
the united states was unable to produce any evidence demonstrating that the ins had sent el shami or his attorney written notice of the date and time of the october hearing however,el shami and his wife testified at the hearing on the defendant motion to dismiss the illegal reentry charge that the defendant never received notice of the hearing at his address of record.indeed,these witnesses testified that el shami only learned of the october deportation hearing nine months afterwards,when he received a copy of the deportation order in the mail.
after being arraigned on the illegal reentry after deportation and fraud charges in november,el shami filed a motion to dismiss the illegal reentry charge on the grounds that defects in his deportation proceedings rendered the deportation order invalid under d.the district court denied this motion,concluding that even if el shami had been deprived notice of his deportation hearing,he was unable to demonstrate actual prejudice see.
with respect to the district court denial of his motion to dismiss the illegal reentry charge under d,the defendant argues that the court erred because it misunderstood the state of the record and the applicable standard of prejudice.appellant br.at.because el shami never received notice of a hearing,the defendant argues that he was denied the opportunity to challenge the factual or legal basis for the deportation,by disputing the ins evidence or presenting his own evidence to apply for relief from deportation under section c of the immigration and naturalization act,c to appeal the deportation order to the bureau of immigration affairs bia and,if applicable,to appeal the bia order to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit.further,el shami contends that the district court erred in concluding that,even assuming the above deprivations,the defendant could not demonstrate actual,that but for the errors complained of there was a reasonable probability that the alien would not have been deported.
the united states responds that the district court properly denied the motion to dismiss the illegal reentry charge,because the ins afforded the defendant all due process protections.even if the ins failure to advise el shami of the date and time of his final hearing constitutes a due process violation,the united states contends that el shami collateral attack still fails because he can not show actual prejudice.accordingly,the united states argues that el shami can not meet the requirements for a valid collateral attack of an illegal reentry charge under.
this court reviews de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss a charge under d.see united states wilson,cir.because a deportation order is an element of the offense of illegal reentry,the supreme court has recognized that an alien can collaterally attack the propriety of the original deportation order in the later criminal proceeding.see united states,d.in order to successfully attack the underlying deportation order,the defendant must satisfy three requirements.wilson,d.the alien must demonstrate that 
he exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the deportation order was fundamentally unfair.
id.these requirements are listed in the conjunctive,so a defendant must satisfy all three in order to prevail.id.however,if the defendant satisfies all three requirements,the illegal reentry charge must be dismissed as a matter of law.see id.
because we find that the ins did not provide el shami with written notice of the october deportation hearing as the statute required,we conclude that he satisfies the first two requirements for a collateral attack under d.the undisputed evidence indicates that el shami lived at the address of record that he provided to immigration officials after his release on bond pending the show cause hearing on march,until he was deported in august.under the law as it stood in,the ins was required to serve upon the alien or his attorney in person,or,if service was impracticable,send by certified mail,written notice informing the alien,inter alia,of the time and date of the deportation hearing.a.both el shami and his wife testified that they did not receive any correspondence from the ins regarding the final deportation hearing during the period of april through october.further,during the pendency of this matter in the district court,the united states stipulated that there was no evidence in el shami immigration file to reflect that the ins had sent el shami written notice of the final deportation hearing.thus,on the basis of the uncontradicted evidence in the record,we find that el shami did not receive notice of the october deportation hearing.
the united states nevertheless argues that el shami can not meet the exhaustion requirement because he never appealed the immigration judge order of deportation to the bia within thirty days this argument misses the mark.because the ins never sent el shami written notice of the deportation hearing,el shami did not appear and,thus,was never informed of his right to appeal to seek administrative and judicial review.indeed,el shami did not find out that he had been ordered deported until he received a copy of the deportation order nine months after the deportation hearing,well after the time for seeking review had expired.as el shami aptly concludes in his reply brief,the united states argument that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies begs the question,for without notice of the hearing in the first instance,el shami did not know about either the existence or the nature of the immigration judge ruling.without that knowledge he could not appeal to the bia and,if necessary,to the court of appeals for the third circuit.appellant reply br.at.we agree.
in united states,d,the supreme court held that an immigration judge failures to advise the alien of his right to apply for section relief and to ensure that the alien waiver of his right to appeal the deportation order constituted a complete deprivation of administrative and judicial review within the meaning of section d.see id.at.this case falls squarely within the rule of.to the extent that the ins failure to provide notice precluded el shami from attending his deportation hearing in the first instance,he was never apprised of his right to seek section relief and administrative and judicial review.accordingly,we hold el shami satisfies the first two requirements for a collateral attack under section d.see id.
we next turn to the question of whether the entry of the deportation order was fundamentally unfair.we find that it was.to demonstrate fundamental unfairness,a defendant must show that his due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.wilson,at.
the ins failure to send el shami written notice of his deportation hearing deprived him of due process.as then judge chertoff recognized in united states torres,cir,an alien fundamental right of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.more specifically,due process requires an alien who faces removal be provided notice of the charges against him,a hearing before an executive or administrative tribunal,and a fair opportunity to be heard.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.although el shami was aware of the charges against him,the ins failure to provide notice of the hearing deprived him of the opportunity to contest those charges or otherwise seek relief from deportation from the administrative tribunal.therefore,we hold that el shami satisfies the due process prong of the fundamental unfairness requirement.
the last element that el shami has to show under the fundamental unfairness requirement is that the deficiencies in the deportation proceedings caused him actual prejudice.see wilson,at.specifically,el shami must show that,but for the errors complained of,there was a reasonable probability that he would not have been deported.wilson at.
in the instant case,el shami would have sought relief from deportation under section c of the immigration and naturalization act.see c supp.this provision,which was subsequently repealed by the passage of the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,authorized an immigration judge to waive deportation upon a showing that certain mitigating factors outweighed adverse factors.see matter of marin,bia.in,the supreme court held that the aedpa did not apply retroactively.see ins cyr,d.therefore,because section c relief was available to el shami at the time of his deportation proceeding in,we must consider the likelihood that the immigration judge or the bia would have waived deportation under section in determining whether there is a reasonable probability that he would not have been deported.
we find that el shami has made such a showing.in determining whether to grant relief from deportation,the immigration judge would have weighed adverse factors against mitigating factors.see matter of marin,bia.adverse factors included the nature and circumstances of the offense that led to the initiation of deportation proceedings additional violations of the immigration laws the existence of a criminal record and evidence of bad character.id.mitigating factors included family ties in the united states lengthy residence in the united states hardship to the alien and his family if deportation occurs existence of property or business ties evidence of good character and reputation in the community proof of rehabilitation if a criminal record exists.id.
although el shami had two serious felony convictions on his record,there is substantial mitigating evidence in the record.specifically,el shami had lived in the united states for thirteen years at the time of the deportation hearing.further,el shami had a wife and a son,both of whom were citizens of the united states and depended on him for financial support.at the time of his deportation hearing,el shami owned a small business in new jersey,on which he paid federal income taxes.we also note that el shami complied with the terms and conditions of his release on bond from the time of his release in april until the final deportation hearing on october.these are substantial facts that el shami could have presented at the time of his final deportation hearing to obtain relief.finally,we note that the supreme court has recognized that between and,the interval during which el shami would have sought waiver,over fifty percent of aliens who requested section relief received it.see cyr.at.accordingly,we hold that el shami satisfies the second prong of the fundamental unfairness requirement under d.
because we find that el shami satisfies the three requirements for a collateral attack of conviction for unlawful reentry of a deported alien under d,we vacate the judgment of conviction on that count and remand to the district court for 
vacated in part and remanded.
the majority correctly identifies the facts relevant to el shami motion to dismiss count one of the indictment,which tend to show that el shami did not receive notice of his deportation proceeding.but the majority errs in applying to these facts the rules for collateral attack on a deportation order under d and united states,d.because el shami did not establish a reasonable probability that he would not have been deported but for the lack of notice,i respectfully dissent.
in united states wilson,cir,we held that to show an order is fundamentally unfair under section d,a deported alien must show prejudice.id.at.as the majority acknowledges,this requires a showing that there was a reasonable likelihood that the alien would not have been deported but for the defect in the deportation proceeding.id.at.in wilson,the alien counsel had claimed a chance of a different outcome,which the district court deemed insufficient to establish prejudice under the governing standard.id.we concluded that wilson actual chance of obtaining a reversal was lower than and that he had demonstrated none of the unusual or outstanding favorable equities necessary to suggest a favorable exercise of discretion under section c.we thus affirmed the deportation.id.at.
like wilson,el shami did not demonstrate unusual or outstanding equities.the majority identifies,as evidence in his favor,that el shami had lived in the united states for thirteen years has a wife and son,both dependent on him owned a small business in new jersey and paid income taxes on its revenues and complied with the conditions of his release on immigration bond.in my view,these are only ordinary factors.indeed,wilson had lived in the united states for longer,over seventeen years,and had served for nearly all of that time in the united states marine corps,from which he had a bad conduct discharge.at.presumably this service involved paying income taxes,not to mention suffering the other hardships associated with military life.that leaves as the principal distinguishing factor el shami dependent wife and son but this ordinary qualification for relief should not covert el shami case into one of unusual hardship.see,united states,cir noting that family hardship is nothing more than a common result of deportation and explaining that a finding of plausibility on this showing would requi
