background 
manuel puello is a immigrant from the dominican republic.he has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since october,and is married to a united states citizen.on september,a southern district of new york grand jury indicted puello on charges of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance,and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance,arising out of his negotiations to sell approximately two kilograms of cocaine to a confidential informant.puello pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count before united states district judge robert patterson on december.puello sentencing did not occur,however,until april,when judge patterson sentenced puello to time served and four years of supervised release.the clerk filed the judgment in a criminal case on april.the judgment indicates that the court sentenced puello to a sentence on motion of the government as a result of puello substantial assistance,perhaps explaining the lengthy delay between puello guilty plea and his sentencing.
puello applied for united states citizenship on october.in his application,puello responded affirmatively to the question asking whether he had ever been convicted of a crime.on september,following an investigation,bcis informed puello that federal immigration regulations rendered him ineligible for naturalization.in its decision denying puello application,bcis noted that,under a,an applicant must establish that he has been and continues to be a person of good moral character.bcis then quoted b,which states that an applicant shall be found to lack good moral character,if the applicant has been convicted of an aggravated felony on or after november.the decision explained that puello federal conviction occurred on april.because puello conviction was for an aggravated felony,as defined by a b,he was therefore precluded from establishing good moral character since his conviction occurred subsequent to november.puello requested a review hearing,arguing that bcis had erred according to puello,his conviction occurred on december,the date of his guilty plea.on february,the bcis district director affirmed the denial of puello application.
on june,puello filed a petition for de novo review of the denial of his application in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.see c a person whose application for naturalization under this subchapter is denied may seek review of such denial before the united states district court such review shall be de novo,and the court shall make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.both parties agreed to the material facts and moved for summary judgment.the district court issued an opinion and order granting bcis motion for summary judgment and affirming the denial of puello application on december.see puello bureau of citizenship immigration,d.the district court held that the date of puello conviction was either his sentencing date or the date the judgment was entered on the docket,both of which occurred after november.id.puello timely filed this appeal.

the meaning of the word conviction in the ina 
in this case,our principal task is to determine whether,under the definition of conviction in a a,a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court occurs at the time of the alien guilty plea to a criminal charge,or on the date of sentencing or entry of the judgment.statutory construction is a holistic endeavor.united sav.ass of texas timbers of inwood forest,d.to interpret the terms of a statute,we look first to the statutory language itself.see auburn hous,at citing mallard united states dist.court,d.principles of construction dictate that statutory analysis necessarily begins with the plain meaning of a law text and,absent ambiguity,will generally end there.collazos united states,cir.in ascertaining the plain meaning of a statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.k mart cartier,d.if the meaning of a statute is ambiguous,the court may resort to legislative history to determine the statute meaning.see canada life assurance converium ruckversicherung deutschland ag,cir auburn hous,at.but in so doing,we must construct an interpretation that comports with the statute primary purpose and does not lead to anomalous or unreasonable results.connecticut ex rel.blumenthal united states dep t of the interior,cir citing am.tobacco patterson,d.
it has long been a requirement that an applicant for naturalization demonstrate good moral character.see,repouille united states,cir construing the phrase good moral character in the predecessor to the immigration and nationality act.prior to,the ina barred aliens convicted of murder from demonstrating good moral character,but allowed aliens convicted of other felonies to attempt to meet that requirement.in,congress amended the ina to provide that all aliens convicted of any aggravated felony would be statutorily precluded from establishing the necessary good moral character for naturalization.the pertinent naturalization provision now reads no person shall be regarded as,or found to be,a person of good moral character who,during the period for which good moral character is required to be established,is,or who at any time has been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in subsection a of this section.f.the amendments also provided that this change shall take effect on the date of enactment of this act and shall apply to convictions occurring on or after such date.immigration act of,b,stat.at.the date of enactment was november.
in,congress again amended the ina,for the first time adding to the statute a definition of the word conviction 
the term conviction means,with respect to an alien,a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or,if adjudication has been withheld,where 
i a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt,and 
ii the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the alien liberty to be imposed.
a a.in passing the statute,congress made clear that it intended the new definition to apply retroactively.illegal immigration reform and alien responsibility act of iirira,div,title c,stat.applying the new definition to convictions and sentences entered before,on,or after the date of enactment of this act.
there is no dispute that the crime for which puello was convicted is an aggravated felony.see a b including among the list of aggravated felonies illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.nor is there any allegation that this case is governed by the provision of the definition defining what constitutes a conviction when adjudication has been withheld,which applies to situations where the defendant might mitigate the effects of his conviction through good behavior,successful completion of probation,or the like.thus,we focus only on the first prong of the definition,formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.
we begin,as we must,by examining the language of statute,starting with the common meaning of the words in it.see pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d courts properly assume,absent sufficient indication to the contrary,that congress intends the words in its enactments to carry their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.internal quotation marks omitted.first,the definition uses the words formal judgment,the common meaning of which denotes a document signed by the judge and entered on the docket,as in federal rule of criminal procedure k in the judgment of conviction,the court must set forth the plea,the jury verdict or the court findings,the adjudication and the sentence the judge must sign the judgment,and the clerk must enter it.see perez,at noting that it makes sense to define formal judgment of guilt by reference to rule k definition of judgment of conviction.while it is true,as puello argues,that the language of rule k judgment of conviction is slightly different from the language of the ina definition formal judgment of guilt,both terms center on the action the court must take to formalize the judgment.further,as the district court noted,d at,in other contexts the supreme court and this court have considered the judgment to occur at the time of sentencing.see,corey united states,d noting that the sentence is the judgment internal quotation marks omitted united states ex rel.mignozzi day,cir noting that the only judgment in a criminal case is the sentence.puello does not suggest any alternative explanation for why congress included the word judgment in the definition of conviction,especially with the common understanding of that word as a backdrop.
additionally,the statutory definition of conviction speaks of a judgment entered by a court,the common understanding of which involves the entry on the docket of the document envisioned in rule k,and not a guilty plea alone.see,fed.b a i noting that a defendant notice of appeal must be filed within days after the later of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed united states robinson,cir noting the rule that we ordinarily lack jurisdiction to review decisions before sentencing is complete and a judgment of conviction has been entered united states rodriguez,cir referring to the date of the judgment as the date t he judgment of conviction was actually entered in the criminal docket.
examination of the overall structure and operation of the statute lends added credence to bcis position.see auburn hous,at the meaning of a particular section in a statute can be understood in context with and by reference to the whole statutory scheme,by appreciating how sections relate to one another.in other words,the preferred meaning of a statutory provision is one that is consonant with the rest of the statute.construing a guilty plea alone as a formal judgment of guilt makes little sense in the context of the definition of conviction as a whole.the definition discusses two types of convictions the first prong addresses cases in which a formal judgment of guilt has been entered,and the second prong addresses cases in which adjudication has been deferred or withheld,but where a plea or verdict of guilt has occurred and punishment has been imposed.to find a conviction under the first prong,bcis assesses only whether there is a formal judgment of guilt,while under the second prong bcis must find both i a jury verdict,guilty plea,plea of nolo contendere,or admission of facts sufficient to warrant a finding of guilt,plus ii imposition of punishment.a a.the first prong stands in relief from the formal judgment of guilt is different from a deferred adjudication only at the point of sentencing or entry of judgment.both procedures may involve the acceptance of a guilty plea.if a guilty plea alone were sufficient to establish a formal judgment of guilt,then the second prong of the definition would be superfluous it would never matter if adjudication were deferred because the verdict or entry of the plea would be sufficient to constitute a conviction.see griffiths ins,cir holding that a notation of on the criminal docket could not constitute a conviction under the first prong of the ina conviction definition because a formal judgment of guilt under the first prong of the definition entails a showing of something beyond a simple finding of guilt otherwise the reference in the second prong of the statute to deferred adjudications where either a judge or a jury has found the alien guilty would be rendered superfluous.puello reading of the statute would therefore contravene our usual practice of rejecting a reading of a statute that would render a section of it superfluous.see tablie gonzales,cir.a statute must,if reasonably possible,be construed in a way that will give force and effect to each of its provisions rather than render some of them meaningless.allen oil,comm r of internal revenue,cir.
furthermore,construing a guilty plea alone to constitute a conviction would be a significant departure from normal criminal procedure and would present difficult practical problems applying the statute.the federal rules of criminal procedure make clear that a guilty plea does not represent a final,acceptance of the plea is a step along the way to a final judgment.rule contemplates the different posture of proceedings before and after sentencing,as a guilty plea may be withdrawn under some circumstances prior to sentencing,but never afterwards.compare.d a defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere after the court accepts the plea,but before it imposes sentence if the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal with.e after the court imposes sentence,the defendant may not withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,and the plea may be set aside only on direct appeal or collateral attack.puello interpretation of the statutory definition appears to lead to the bizarre result that a withdrawn guilty plea would still be a conviction for immigration purposes,because the conviction would be established on the date of the entry of the plea.we reject this reading because a statute should be interpreted in a way that avoids absurd results.see united states dauray,cir.
in support of his reading of the definition,puello cites a provision of the united states sentencing guidelines dealing with status stating that the date a defendant sustained a conviction shall be the date that the guilt of the defendant has been established whether by guilty plea,trial,or plea of nolo contendere.c.but puello citation to the sentencing guidelines does him more harm than good.the language puello cites from c was inserted into that provision to conform with similar language in a.sentencing guidelines manual app.c,amend.section deals with how a district court should assess a defendant prior conduct in determining his criminal history and defines conviction to ensure that the district court takes into account conduct for which the defendant has been found guilty but not yet sentenced.as such,the guidelines commissi
