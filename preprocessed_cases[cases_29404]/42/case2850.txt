a jury convicted jesus of illegal reentry after deportation,in violation of.at sentencing,the district court concluded that prior conviction in minnesota for manslaughter was an aggravated felony,so that the statutory maximum term of imprisonment was twenty years,see b,and then imposed a term of months imprisonment.challenges his conviction based on the admission of certain disputed evidence,and he argues that his sentence was imposed in violation of law.we affirm the conviction,but vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings.
according to evidence presented in the district court,is a mexican national who was found in a jail in cloud,minnesota,by immigration authorities in.his criminal history includes a conviction in minnesota for manslaughter,which resulted in his deportation to mexico in april.after he was deported,returned to the united states,and he was arrested and charged in federal court in texas with illegally reentering the country after having been deported.he pled guilty in october and was sentenced to months imprisonment.upon release from prison in february,was again deported to mexico.at some point thereafter,returned to the united states,and in july,he was arrested on a drug charge in minnesota.after he was found during a routine check of jails by immigration authorities,a federal grand jury charged him with illegal reentry after deportation.
the indictment charged that had been twice previously deported to mexico,on or about april,and february.the grand jury alleged that these deportations followed conviction in march for manslaughter,which the grand jury alleged was an aggravated felony.the indictment charged that knowingly and unlawfully entered and was found in the united states in after this conviction and these two deportations.
at trial,the government introduced documents concerning the prior deportations.the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the illegal reentry charge.at sentencing,the court concluded that the statutory maximum penalty was twenty years imprisonment,because prior conviction for second degree manslaughter qualified as an aggravated felony for purposes of b.the court then imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,which was the sentence at the bottom of the advisory guideline range.
in challenging his conviction,disputes several evidentiary rulings of the district court.we review these decisions for abuse of discretion.united states seifert,cir.
argues that the district court erred by permitting the government to introduce evidence of two prior in april and another in february documents described as warrants for deportation.the government was required to prove a prior deportation as an element of the charged offense,but early in the trial,argued that the only deportation that was properly provable as an element of the crime was the april removal.tr.i at.he argues on appeal that the district court erred by admitting evidence of the february deportation,because it was not relevant to the charged offense and not admissible as a prior bad act under federal rule of evidence b.
we conclude that evidence of the february deportation was properly admitted for two reasons.first,it was relevant to proving an element of the charged offense.the government was required to prove a prior deportation,and it could satisfy that element by proving either the april deportation or the february deportation.see united states,cir per curiam.second,at the conclusion of the evidence,the parties agreed that the jury instructions would specify that the government must establish the prior deportation element by proving the february deportation.the april deportation was stricken from the instructions.tr.ii at.by agreeing that the case would be submitted to the jury based on the allegation that he was previously deported in february,waived any claim that evidence of february deportation was irrelevant.
also appears to contend on appeal that the district court erred by admitting evidence of his deportation in april.this evidence was received at a point in the trial when maintained that only the april deportation could satisfy the prior deportation element of the offense.the government could rely on the april deportation to prove an element of the charged offense,so the evidence was clearly relevant.also complains that the district court permitted evidence that he was in the united states as far back as june.that evidence,however,was received in connection with testimony from an immigration agent that made admissions concerning his element of the he was interviewed in june.therefore,the evidence was relevant and properly admitted.another evidentiary challenge relates to testimony that was found in a correctional facility in,and that investigators learned of his presence from a routine check of the jails.the district court did not err in allowing this evidence,because the government was required to prove that was found in the united states in,see jury instruction,doc,at and the circumstances of his apprehension were relevant to proving that element of the offense.
further complains that the court erred by admitting evidence of a prior conviction for illegal in texas in december.the government sought to introduce evidence relating to this prior conviction to prove the defendant alienage.there was brief testimony from an immigration agent that had been convicted of a title,united states code,section offense,but the certified record of the conviction was not received in evidence.tr.i at.later,with the agreement of the parties,the court used the record of conviction to take judicial notice that the defendant admitted his legal status was alien on december,and there was no further reference to the fact of conviction.tr.i at.we find no abuse of discretion in allowing this limited use of the prior conviction to prove an element of the charged offense.
also challenges the admission of warrants of deportation on the ground that they deprived him of the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him under the sixth amendment.a warrant of deportation is a document that commands an immigration official to take custody of the deportee and to remove him from the united states.united states garcia,cir.a signed warrant indicates that the attesting witness observed the deportee leaving the country.as noted,the government introduced the warrants of deportation to prove the element of the charged offense that had been deported in the past.the witness who testified concerning the february warrant explained that he could not specifically recall seeing cross the border,but that his regular practice was to sign the warrant upon seeing the alien depart the country,and that the records therefore accurately reflected the fact of his observations at the time.tr.i at.because the government could not produce testimony from someone who actually recalled seeing leave the country,argues that admission of the warrant of deportation denied him the right to confront his accuser.
