yulia firmansjah,a citizen of indonesia,entered the united states as a student and overstayed her visa.she subsequently filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal.after a hearing,the immigration judge denied firmansjah asylum request on the ground that firmansjah was firmly resettled in singapore prior to her arrival in the united states.the immigration judge also denied her request for withholding of removal,reasoning that she had not shown a clear probability that she would be persecuted if removed to indonesia.the bureau of immigration affairs affirmed without discussion,and firmansjah appeals.for the reasons that follow,we find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge determinations and deny the petitions for review.
background 
yulia firmansjah was born in indonesia and is an indonesian citizen.she is ethnically chinese.at her asylum hearing,she recounted that in,when she was twelve years old,she and her family moved from their home in jakarta,indonesia to the western outskirts of jakarta in an effort to avoid violence in the city.in,at the age of sixteen,she moved with her family to singapore,where she attended high school for four years.she lived with her family in singapore from to when,at the age of nineteen,she entered the united states on a student visa.she studied at the university of dayton,where she received a bachelor degree in environmental engineering technology and a master degree in business administration.
firmansjah testified that in approximately,her father removed all his money from singapore and reinvested it in business in indonesia.in or,after her siblings finished high school and she was already living in the united states,her parents moved back to indonesia.in,as a result of violence in indonesia,her parents twice left indonesia and headed to singapore.she testified that as of december,her parents lived in indonesia but retained their residency in singapore.
firmansjah most recent visa expired on december,and she acknowledged that she stayed in the united states beyond her visa expiration.she stated that at the time of her graduation from college,she had planned to return to indonesia.however,after riots in indonesia in may during which ethnic chinese persons were harmed,her parents advised her not to do so.instead,she completed an application for asylum.on her application for asylum dated september,she stated that she had a singapore residence permit and was entitled to return to singapore for residence reasons.at her hearing,she testified that although her parents were still singapore residents,she no longer had residency in singapore because it had expired in march of.
firmansjah asserted that if returned to indonesia,she feared persecution based on her ethnicity chinese,religion catholic,and status as a young westernized chinese woman.she expressed fear that the government was unable to control violence towards christians or chinese in indonesia.she also testified that she did not know anyone personally who had been the victim of violence in indonesia.
the immigration judge denied firmansjah request for asylum on the ground that she had firmly resettled in singapore prior to entering the united states.the immigration judge also denied her request for withholding of removal,reasoning that she had not established a clear probability that she would face persecution if returned to indonesia.her request for voluntary departure was granted,with an alternative order of removal to indonesia.firmansjah appealed the immigration judge decision to the board of immigration appeals,which summarily affirmed the immigration judge decision without opinion.
ii.analysis 
firmansjah raises two issues in her petition for review.first,she contends that the immigration judge erred when he determined that she had firmly resettled in singapore prior to her arrival in the united states.in addition,she maintains that the immigration judge finding that she was not entitled to withholding of removal was not supported by substantial evidence.where,as here,the board of immigration appeals affirms the immigration judge decision without opinion,we review the decision of the immigration judge as the final agency determination.rashiah ashcroft,cir.
to be eligible for a discretionary grant of asylum,an applicant must establish that she is a refugee within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act.b gonzales,cir.the act defines a refugee as one who is unable or unwilling to return to her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,a a.the petitioner carries the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum,at a.
although it has not always been the case,under the current statute,an alien is not eligible for asylum if she was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the united states.b a vi see abdille ashcroft,cir discussing history of firm resettlement and noting that prior to,firm resettlement was only one factor for immigration judge to consider in deciding whether to grant asylum see also diallo ashcroft,cir.here,the immigration judge found that firmansjah had firmly resettled in singapore prior to entering the united states and denied her asylum request on that basis.firmansjah maintains that this finding was erroneous.
a finding of firm resettlement is a factual determination.diallo,at.therefore,we will review the immigration judge decision only to determine whether substantial evidence supports it.id.the finding that firmansjah was firmly resettled must be upheld if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,and we will reverse only if a reasonable would be compelled to reach a different conclusion.id.citations omitted.
we considered the firm resettlement provision in the current statute for the first time in diallo ashcroft,cir.there,we observed that the statute does not define the term firm resettlement or provide guidance for how to determine whether a refugee was firmly resettled.at.the regulations,however,provide that 
a n alien is considered to be firmly resettled if,prior to arrival in the united states,he or she entered into another country with,or while in that country received,an offer of permanent resident status,citizenship,or some other type of permanent resettlement 
we decided in diallo,after examining the text of the statute,that the primary and most important inquiry in any analysis of firm resettlement is whether or not the stopover country has made some type of offer of permanent resettlement.id.at.not all circuits take this approach,as some employ a totality of the circumstances test that also examines based elements such as an applicant length of stay and social and economic ties in the third country.see,mussie,cir cheo,cir.although we recognized in diallo that circumstances may arise in which the ins may not be able to secure direct evidence of a formal government offer of some type of permanent resettlement,we made clear that our initial inquiry asks whether the third country extended an offer of permanent resettlement.at citing abdille,at.
the government has the initial burden of demonstrating that an applicant was firmly resettled in a third country prior to entering the united states.diallo,at.if the government satisfies its burden,the applicant may rebut the presumption by presenting evidence to the contrary.id.
firmansjah argues that the only evidence the government produced in its attempt to demonstrate her permanent residence in singapore was a stamp on her indonesian passport.the stamp,dated march,states it is a visa for singapore valid until march.firmansjah contends that there is no evidence that this stamp granted her permanent residency in singapore.
firmansjah focus on the nature of her visa stamp ignores significant other evidence in the record.in support of its position that it met its initial burden of demonstrating that firmansjah was firmly resettled prior to entering the united states,the government points to firmansjah statements on her asylum application and her testimony at the hearing.first,in answer to a question on the asylum application that asked,do you now hold,or have you ever held,permanent residence,other permanent status,or citizenship,in any country other than the one from which you are now claiming asylum,firmansjah checked yes and typed,i do have a singapore permanent resident permit.in addition,she stated elsewhere on her application that she was entitled to return to singapore for residence purposes.at the hearing,she confirmed the answers she had provided on her asylum application.she testified that she received a singapore permanent resident card in in addition,she testified that at the time of her application in,she still maintained her residency in singapore.
we agree with the government that firmansjah admission in both her written application and oral testimony that she had received permanent resident status in singapore satisfied the government initial burden of producing evidence indicating that firmansjah had resettled in a third country.the burden then shifted to firmansjah to show that she was not firmly resettled.
firmansjah points to the five year entry stamp on her passport that expired in march,contending that its limited nature demonstrates it did not confer permanent status on her.in addition,she contends,the expiration date of her visa coincides with the time that she testified her permanent residency expired.it is possible that firmansjah was mistaken as to her real status in singapore,and it would have helped us if the government had introduced evidence of what permanent resident status or its equivalent entails under singapore law.abdille,at concluding that party seeking to rely on foreign law bears burden of establishing its content.however,although represented by counsel at her hearing,she introduced no evidence and offered no explanation of why she consistently maintained on both her asylum application and in her testimony that she had permanent resident status in singapore at the time of her application and had obtained that status in,if she did not in fact have this status.
firmansjah also contends that her singapore residency should be disregarded because her parents may have fraudulently obtained their permanent resident status,thus rendering their status null and void.she admitted,however,that her parents still maintain their residency in singapore,and she did not indicate that singapore officials had ever attempted to revoke their status.firmansjah offered no evidence other than her own speculation to support her assertion that her parents may have obtained their status illegally.the bottom line is that according to her own testimony,singapore still considers her parents permanent residents.therefore,firmansjah conjecture that her family may have obtained their permanent residency status improperly does not help her.see rife ashcroft,cir rejecting argument that israeli citizenship invalid because applicants were practicing christians,where israel had offered applicants permanent resettlement under its law of return and issued certificates evidencing citizenship,and there was no evidence that israel had ever revoked such a citizenship offer upon learning of conversion to christianity salazar ashcroft,cir holding that alien testimony that he paid another person to obtain residence stamp did not require immigration judge to discount its facial validity.
in addition,the expiration of her permanent residency status prior to the hearing in this case does not preclude a finding that firmansjah had firmly resettled in singapore.firmansjah testified that by the time of the december hearing,she no longer had her residency in singapore and believed it had expired in march of that year.she testified that at the time she filed for asylum,however,she still maintained permanent residency status in singapore.she explained that maintaining her residency status in singapore required her to return to singapore to obtain an extension.however,she had not done so.
the text of the statute provides that firm resettlement is determined by asking whether the applicant was firmly resettled prior to arrival in the united states.b.in abdalla,cir,the tenth circuit held that a firm resettlement finding is not affected by the possibility that by terminating his third country residence permit petitioner may have jeopardized his entitlement to resume residence in that country through his extended and illegal stay in the united states.at.this rule prohibits an alien from bootstrapping an asylum claim simply by unilaterally severing his existing ties to a third country.see also elzour ashcroft,cir ali reno,cir vang,cir.here,there is ample evidence that firmansjah had permanent resident status in singapore prior to her arrival in the united states,but apparently she let that status expire.moreover,firmansjah testified that at the time she filed her asylum application,she still retained her residency status in singapore keeping in mind our deferential standard of review,we can not say that the immigration judge finding was unsupported by substantial evidence.
firmansjah also argues,without case citation,that her due process rights were violated because the immigration judge did not make clear that he would base the thrust of his decision on a firm resettlement finding.we disagree.firmansjah counsel addressed the firm resettlement issue in her closing argument,and the parties had a colloquy with the court following the arguments on this issue.moreover,in order to prevail on a due process claim,an applicant must show prejudice.capric ashcroft,cir.firmansjah has not demonstrated prejudice,as she has not suggested what evidence she would have produced had she received more notice that firm resettlement,an explicit statutory bar to asylum,would be an issue.
withholding of removal 
although a finding of firm resettlement is,by statute,a bar to eligibility for asylum,no statute or regulation bars the grant of withholding of removal upon a finding that an applicant firmly resettled in a third country prior to entering the united states.we will therefore consider the withholding of removal claim separately from the barred asylum claim,as have other circuits.madjakpor gonzales,cir rife,at salazar,at vang,at abdalla,at.when we review the denial of an application for withholding of removal,we will uphold the decision if it is supported by substantial evidence.zheng gonzales,cir.
unlike the decision to grant asylum,which is discretionary even if the criteria for asylum are met,the attorney general must withhold deportation if he determines that the alien life or freedom would be threatened because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a.the applicant bears the burden of establishing entitlement to withholding of removal.zheng,at.to meet this burden,the applicant must demonstrate a clear probability that he or she will face persecution in the country to which he or she will be removed.id.the clear probability standard requires an applicant to show that it is more likely than not that she will be subject to persecution if returned to her native country,a more stringent test than the standard for establishing eligibility for asylum.id.
although withholding of removal is based on the likelihood of future persecution,if an applicant demonstrates that she suffered past persecution in the proposed country of removal,it shall be presumed that the applicant life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the original claim.b see also zaidi ashcroft,cir.the government can rebut this presumption by demonstrating either a fundamental change in circumstances or that the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal.b i.
we first address firmansjah contention that she established past persecution,which,if true,would entitle her to a presumption of future persecution.although she testified that neither she nor any member of her family was ever threatened or harmed in indonesia,firmansjah contends her testimony that her parents changed their chinese names
