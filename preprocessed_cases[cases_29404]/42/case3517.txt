in casas castrillon department of homeland security,f d cir,we held that aliens facing prolonged detention while their petitions for review of their removal orders are pending are entitled to a bond hearing before a neutral immigration judge.in this appeal we address certain procedures that must be followed in those hearings to comport with due process.we hold as an initial matter that a federal district court has habeas jurisdiction under to review casas bond hearing determinations for constitutional claims and legal error.see demore kim.we also hold that,given the substantial liberty interests at stake in casas hearings,the government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that continued detention is justified.we further hold that the immigration court is required to make a contemporaneous record of casas hearings and that an audio recording would suffice.
background 
vijendra singh is a native and citizen of fiji who was admitted to the united states in on a visitor visa.he became a lawful permanent resident in.he has been married to babita singh,who is also a resident,since,and they have five children,all of whom are citizens.in april,the department of homeland security dhs immigration and customs enforcement ice issued singh a notice to appear nta,charging that he was removable because he had been convicted of receiving stolen property in and petty theft with priors in.singh was taken into ice custody without bond on april,and has remained in continuous custody from that time until the present.
in september,the immigration judge ij concluded that singh was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had committed an aggravated felony within the meaning of a g singh appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,which affirmed the removal order in march.he then filed a petition for review of the final administrative order of removal with this court in august,docketed as.we stayed the order of removal on august,pending our resolution of the petition.those proceedings are ongoing and the stay remains in place.
in september,singh received his first casas bond hearing before an immigration judge.before the hearing began,the government agreed that singh wife would not be.despite this stipulation,the ij allowed the government to singh after singh completed his own testimony.after the close of direct and,the ij also permitted the government to introduce as evidence singh record of arrest and prosecution rap sheet.singh complains that he did not have an opportunity to explain or rebut the evidence presented in his rap sheet or his wife because both were admitted after the conclusion of his testimony.
when the bond hearing was near its end,the ij incorrectly stated that singh bore the burden of proving he was not a flight risk or a danger to the community.singh immediately objected and informed the ij that the government bore the burden of proof,and the ij acknowledged the error.at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij found that singh was not a flight risk,a point the government had not disputed.the ij did,however,find that singh was a danger to the community and,accordingly,denied singh request for release on bond.
in october,the ij issued a written decision denying singh bond.apparently contradicting his oral finding at the september hearing,the ij concluded that singh was a flight risk as well as a danger to the community because of his criminal history,his history of failures to appear and the fact that he was under an administratively final order of removal.
singh appealed to the bia.he moved to obtain a transcript of the casas bond hearing to support his appeal,in which he raised various due process violations he contended occurred during the hearing.the bia denied singh motion,and ultimately dismissed his appeal,concluding that he was both a danger to the community given his extensive criminal record,and a flight risk given that he was subject to a final administrative order of removal.
in july,singh filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging various procedural and substantive due process violations at his casas bond hearing.the district court denied singh petition in february,concluding that it lacked authority to review the ij discretionary decision to deny bond and that singh allegations of procedural and substantive due process violations were without merit.the court concluded that petitioner procedural due process rights,as afforded to him by casas castrillon and prieto romero clark,cir,were satisfied because petitioner received an individualized bond hearing before a neutral ij.we disagree with the district court conclusion that this is all that casas castrillon and prieto romero require.accordingly,we vacate the dismissal of singh habeas petition and remand to the district court with instructions to grant the writ and order singh release unless within days of the district court order the agency provides singh a new casas hearing applying the standards set forth in this opinion.
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over singh appeal under and a.see arango marquez ins,cir.our jurisdiction is consistent with e,which provides 
the attorney general discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject to review.no court may set aside any action or decision by the attorney general under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien or the grant,revocation,or denial of bond or parole.
although e restricts jurisdiction in the federal courts in some respects,it does not limit habeas jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law.
the supreme court held in demore that e does not strip a district court of its traditional habeas jurisdiction,bar constitutional challenge s or preclude a district court from addressing a habeas petition challeng ing the statutory framework that permits the petitioner detention without bail.at see also al siddiqi achim,cir holding that e does not deprive us of our authority to review statutory and constitutional challenges saint fort ashcroft,cir noting that demore read the provision in e as applying only to review of the attorney general discretionary judgment sierra ins,cir holding,before demore was decided,that e does not speak with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pursuant to the general habeas statute alterations in original quoting ins cyr.in addition,although the attorney general discretionary judgment shall not be subject to review,claims that the discretionary process itself was constitutionally flawed are cognizable in federal court on habeas because they fit comfortably within the scope of.gutierrez chavez ins,cir.
the conclusion that the district court had habeas jurisdiction to review singh claims of constitutional and legal error is also consistent with a b ii.like e,a b ii restricts jurisdiction only with respect to the executive exercise of discretion.it does not limit habeas jurisdiction over questions of law,see afridi gonzales,cir,overruled on other grounds by estrada espinoza mukasey,cir en banc,including application of law to undisputed facts,sometimes referred to as mixed questions of law and fact,ramadan gonzales,cir per curiam.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to grant or deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see nadarajah gonzales,cir.we also review de novo due process claims and questions of law raised in immigration proceedings.see simeonov ashcroft,cir.the district court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.see jones wood,cir.
discussion 
burden and standard of proofa.the immigration judge properly placed the burden of proof on the government 
the first issue is whether the immigration judge properly allocated the burden of proof.as we held in casas castrillon,the burden of establishing whether detention is justified falls on the government.see casas castrillon,at a n alien is entitled to release on bond unless the government establishes that he is a flight risk or will be a danger to the community.emphasis added quoting tijani willis,f d,cir.singh contends that the ij failed to adhere to this principle by improperly placing the burden on him to show that he was neither a danger nor a flight risk.we disagree.although the ij initially stated that singh bore the burden of proof,singh objected and the ij immediately acknowledged the error.the ij written bond memorandum also reflects the proper allocation of the burden of proof to the government.we therefore reject singh argument.
b.the applicable standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence 
neither casas castrillon nor any other ninth circuit,statutory or regulatory authority specifies the appropriate standard of proof at a casas bond hearing.singh argues that the government should be held to a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof given the substantial liberty interest at stake singh,for example,has been detained for nearly four years we hold that the government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that an alien is a flight risk or a danger to the community to justify denial of bond at a casas hearing.
as we said in casas castrillon,even where prolonged detention is permissible,due process requires adequate procedural protections to ensure that the government asserted justification for physical confinement outweighs the individual constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.at quoting zadvydas davis.because it is improper to ask the individual to share equally with society the risk of error when the possible injury to the individual deprivation of liberty is so significant,a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof provides the appropriate level of procedural protection.addington texas,see also tijani,at tashima,concurring explaining that,under addington,the primary function of a standard of proof is to properly allocate the risk of an erroneous decision among litigants based upon the competing rights and interests involved.
the supreme court has repeatedly reaffirmed the principle that due process places a heightened burden of proof on the state in civil proceedings in which the individual interests at stake are both particularly important and more substantial than mere loss of money.cooper oklahoma,alterations in original quoting santosky kramer,see also foucha louisiana,requiring clear and convincing evidence to justify civil commitment because f reedom from bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the due process clause woodby ins,requiring clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence to prove deportability chaunt united states,requiring clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence to set aside a naturalization decree internal quotation marks omitted.for detainees like singh,who face years of detention before resolution of their removability,the individual interest at stake is without doubt particularly important and more substantial than mere loss of money,and therefore a heightened standard of proof is warranted.santosky,at.
we are not persuaded by the government argument that we should deviate from this principle and apply the lower preponderance of the evidence standard because the liberty interest at stake here is less than for people subject to an initial finding of removal or other types of civil commitment.first,the government argues that its purpose for detaining people like singh is distinguishable from other sorts of civil commitment because removal is its ultimate goal.the supreme court,however,repeatedly has recognized that civil commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty.addington,at,emphasis added concluding that the individual interests were of such weight and gravity that due process requires the state to justify confinement by proof more substantial than a mere preponderance of the evidence.
second,the government argues that aliens like singh should be treated differently because they can end their detention by voluntarily electing to leave the country.as the government conceded at oral argument,however,in some cases aliens who do so will not be permitted to continue challenging their removability from abroad.we are not persuaded that a lower standard of proof is justified by putting people like singh to the choice of remaining in detention,potentially for years,or leaving the country and abandoning their challenges to removability even though they may have been improperly deemed removable.
finally,the government argues that singh liberty interest is diminished because he has already been afforded a removal hearing.we considered an analogous argument in diouf napolitano,wl cir,which addressed whether a detainees have a lesser liberty interest in freedom from detention than a detainees because,u nlike a a detainee,a a detainee is subject to a final order of removal and is thus,at least as a theoretical matter,closer to actual removal from the united states.id.at.we concluded that the government ma de too much of this distinction because r egardless of the stage of the proceedings,the same important interest is at stake freedom from prolonged detention.id.we reach the same conclusion here.although at the margin singh liberty interest may be slightly less than that of someone subject to only an initial finding of removal,fundamentally the same interest in freedom from prolonged detention is at stake.id.
we therefore hold that the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof applies in casas bond hearings the ij erred in not holding the government to that heightened standard at singh casas hearing.
we also conclude that this error was prejudicial.the evidence that singh was a danger and a flight risk was by no means overwhelming,so the standard of proof could well have affected the outcome of the bond hearing.significantly,during the hearing the ij orally announced his finding that singh was not a flight risk,and only later,in the written bond memorandum,found otherwise.indeed,the government never argued that singh was a flight risk or presented any evidence to that effect.consequently,the only evidence the bia cited for its affirmance of the ij conclusion that singh was a flight risk was the fact common to all detainees afforded casas bond hearings that singh had already been ordered removed by a final,administrative order,diminishing his incentive to appear for further removal proceedings.although this is a relevant factor in the calculus,it alone does not constitute clear and convincing evidence that singh presented a flight risk justifying denial of bond.
next,the evidence showing that singh presented a danger was equivocal.in affirming the denial of bond,the bia focused on singh prior convictions for petty theft,receiving stolen property and substance abuse.under a clear and convincing evidence standard,the bia might conclude that singh largely nonviolent prior bad acts do not demonstrate a propensity for future dangerousness,in view of evidence showing that his drug use,which was the impetus for his previous offenses,has ceased.
for these reasons,we can not conclude that the clear and convincing evidence standard we adopt today would not have affected the outcome of the bond hearing.accordingly,we remand this case to the district court with instructions to grant the writ and order singh release unless within days of the district court order the agency provides singh a new casas hearing applying the proper standard.
ii.the standard of dangerousness that must be met to deny bond 
casas castrillon and matter of guerra contemplate that criminal history alone may be insufficient to justify detention 
in prieto romero we explained that,to determine whether aliens like singh who are detained under a present a flight risk or danger to the community,immigration judges should look to the factors set forth at matter of guerra.at.the guerra factor most pertinent to assessing dangerousness directs immigration judges to consider the alien criminal record,including the extensiveness of criminal activity,the recency of such activity,and the seriousness of the offenses.guerra,at 
although an alien criminal record is surely relevant to a bond assessment,guerra contemplates that criminal history alone will not always be sufficient to justify denial of bond on the basis of dangerousness.rather,the recency and severity of the offenses must be considered.see id.casas castrillon likewise recognized that not every criminal record would support a finding of dangerousness.every criminal alien who receives a casas hearing has,presumably,been convicted of at least one crime giving rise to the removal order.nevertheless,casas castrillon required individualized bond hearings to ensure that the government purported interest in securing the alien presence at removal and protecting the community from danger is actually served by detention in t his case,necessarily anticipating that criminal history alone would not always justify detention.casas castrillon,at.
indeed,not all criminal convictions conclusively establish that an alien presents a danger to the community,even where the crimes are serious enough to render the alien removable.foucha,at requiring a showing of dangerousness beyond that of any convicted criminal to justify civil detention of the criminally insane.for example,some orders of removal may rest on convictions for relatively minor,offenses such as petty theft and receiving stolen property.moreover,a conviction could have occurred years ago,and the alien could well have led an entirely life since then.in such cases,denial of bond on the basis of criminal history alone may not be warranted.
b.the government need not establish special dangerousness to justify denial of bond 
singh urges us to require the government to prove that a detainee is a specially dangerous person to justify denial of bond.the government argues that the guerra standard is sufficient,and no heightened showing of dangerousness is required.we are persuaded by the government argument although we recognize that the basic purpose of immigration detention is assuring the alien presence at the moment of removal,zadvydas,at,and protecting the community from dangerous aliens is a secondary statutory purpose more typically addressed through criminal law,id.at,we disagree with singh argument that zadvydas requires a heightened standard of special dangerousness.
in deciding that special dangerousness is not required,we draw a distinction between temporary and indefinite detention.although the supreme court noted in zadvydas that it has sanctioned preventive detention based on dangerousness only when limited to specially dangerous individuals,zadvydas held the confinement at issue unconstitutional in large part because the detention was not limited,but potentially permanent.id.at.regulations governing continued detention of removable aliens are in accord,providing that an alien must be found specially dangerous to permit prolonged order detention where there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.a emphasis added.likewise,the ninth circuit cases singh cites in support of his argument for a special dangerousness standard address period indefinite detentions.see,tuan thai ashcroft,cir kim ho ma ashcroft,cir.singh,however,does not allege that he is subject to indefinite detention like the zadvydas detainees who were experiencing limbo.prieto romero,at.unlike in zadvydas,singh does not contend that the united states lacks a repatriation treaty with fiji or that fiji will refuse to accept him.accordingly,although singh detention lacks a certain end date,it is not indefinite in the sense the supreme court found constitutionally problematic in zadvydas.id.
zadvydas also focused on the minimal procedural protections afforded to the detainees through administrative proceedings,noting that the alien bears the burden of proving he is not dangerous,without significant later judicial review.at.here,by contrast,the government bears the burden of proof,and must meet a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof.in addition,we have said that there is jurisdiction for federal habeas courts to review casas bond determinations for constitutional claims and legal error.there are thus far greater procedural protections in this context than there were in zadvydas.
given that singh detention is not indefinite and that procedural protections are in place to safeguard his rights,we hold that due process does not require the government to prove that he presents a special danger to justify denial of bond at a casas hearing.
iii.the government must provide contemporaneous records of casas hearings 
in conjunction with his appeal of the denial of bond at his casas hearing,singh asked the bia to produce a transcript of the hearing.five days later he received a summary denial of his request.the bia has long concluded that t here is no right to a transcript of a bond redetermination hearing.matter of chirinos.current procedures provide instead that a written memorandum decision is prepared only if a detainee appeals the oral bond determination.see dep t of justice,exec.office for immig,immigration court practice manual,e iii vii.singh argues that this post hoc memorandum is inadequate,and that the absence of a contemporaneous record deprived him of due process.in accordance with mathews eldridge,we agree that due process requires a contemporaneous record of casas hearings and that the memorandum decision presently provided is insufficient.we hold that,in lieu of providing a transcript,the immigration court may record casas hearings and make the audio recordings available for appeal upon request.although we determine that such audio recordings satisfy due process,and are feasible for the government to provide,we do not decide whether they are the only constitutionally adequate alternative to transcripts.
evaluating the constitutional sufficiency of administrative procedures calls for analysis of the governmental and private interests affected.see id.at.
t he specific dictates of due process generally require consideration of three distinct factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.
id.at.the private interest here freedom from prolonged detention is unquestionably substantial.it is also fundamentally affected by the bia refusal to provide transcripts or an adequate substitute.see bergerco,shipping of india,cir w here a defendant makes allegations of error which,if true,would be prejudicial,the unavailability of a transcript may make it impossible for the appellate court to determine whether the defendant substantive rights were affected.
the memorandum decision provided under existing procedures is insufficient for two reasons.first,it is not created contemporaneously with the hearing.reconstruction is inadequate because,once the court has entered judgment,it may become subject to the very natural weight of its conviction,tending to focus on that which supports its holding.id.at.second,the memorandum decision is not the functional equivalent of a transcript.although a record of sufficient completeness does not translate automatically into a complete verbatim transcript,alternatives are permissible only if they constitute an equivalent report of the events at trial from which the appellant contentions arise.mayer city of chicago.the potentially adequate substitutes the supreme court has suggested a statement of facts agreed to by both sides,a full narrative statement based perhaps on the trial judge minutes taken during trial or on the court reporter untranscribed notes,or a bystander bill of exceptions demonstrate the insufficiency of an decision drafted by an immigration judge in the face of an impending appeal of his or her decision.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting draper washington.the suggested adequate substitutes do,however,demonstrate that an audio recording a neutral contemporaneous record of the hearing would provide a record of sufficient completeness.accordingly,the first two eldridge factors weigh heavily in favor of requiring a neutral contemporaneous record of casas hearing
