the question presented is whether attempted misdemeanor child abandonment,with intent to return to the child,under section b of the texas penal code is a crime involving moral turpitude cimt under a a i i.we conclude that it is not.as interpreted by the texas courts,that crime is not an abandonment in the ordinary sense of the word,but is,in essence,leaving a child under the age of years temporarily without adult supervision under circumstances that a reasonable person would perceive expose the child to an unreasonable risk of harm.applying the bia definition of a cimt to that category of crime as defined by texas law,we conclude that the offense does not amount to a cimt.we therefore grant petition for review,vacate the decision of the bia,and remand the case to the bia for further proceedings.
background and procedural history 
is a native and citizen of mexico who entered the united states some time between and without inspection or parole.on september,she was indicted in texas state court for child abandonment with intent to return in violation of texas penal code section,subsections b and c.she ultimately pleaded guilty to the lesser included charge of attempted misdemeanor child abandonment with intent to return,in violation of texas penal code section b.on july,the state court accepted her guilty plea.was sentenced to pay a fine and serve days in jail,with imprisonment suspended subject to probation and community service.
on september,the ins charged under a a,as an inadmissible alien ineligible for admission because she was present in the without being properly admitted or paroled or because she arrived in the united states at a time or place other than as designated by the attorney general as admissible.under a a,such inadmissible aliens are deportable.conceded her removability and sought relief by filing an application for cancellation of removal.
under b,a nonpermanent alien may be granted cancellation by the attorney general if she has been present continuously in the for at least years she has been a person of good moral character during that period,b b she has not been convicted of certain categories of crimes meeting the requirements of a,crimes of moral turpitude and removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien child,who is a citizen of the b d.
the immigration judge found conviction for attempted misdemeanor child abandonment qualified as a cimt.thus,was not eligible for cancellation of removal r espondant is barred as an alien convicted of an offense under a cimts and is unable because of that conviction to show good moral character.immigration judge opinion at.as a result,a final order was entered,sustaining the charge under,denying the application for cancellation of removal on the basis of statutory ineligibility,and ordering removed from the immigration judge opinion at.on december,the bia affirmed the immigration judge decision without opinion.timely filed a petition for review of the bia decision.
jurisdiction 
on may,the president signed the real id act of,stat,broadening the court jurisdiction by adding a section to the addition reads 
judicial review of certain legal claims nothing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this act other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.a d.
section b of the real id act makes the above section applicable retroactively,stat.
the real id act thus removes jurisdictional bars to direct review of questions of law in final removal,deportation,and exclusion orders.see papageorgiou gonzales,cir accord gonzales,cir gattem gonzales,cir lopez gonzales,cir.in case,the question is entirely a question of the bia properly classified the texas statute as a cimt.because a question of law is at issue and because the statute explicitly applies retroactively,we have jurisdiction over case.
standard of review 
the ina does not define the term moral turpitude and legislative history does not reveal congressional intent regarding which crimes are turpitudinous.smalley ashcroft,cir quoting pichardo,cir.instead,congress left the interpretation of this provision to the bia and interpretation of its application to state and federal laws to the federal courts.okoro,cir.
the immigration regulations provide that a cimt is an offense that is both a crime in the jurisdiction of occurrence,and a crime of turpitude per the moral standards generally prevailing in the united states.we have concluded that the bia,through its administrative decisions,has interpreted and defined crime involving moral turpitude as follows 
moral turpitude refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.moral turpitude has been defined as an act which is per se morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong,or malum in se,so it is the nature of the act itself and not the statutory prohibition of it which renders a crime one of moral turpitude.among the tests to determine if a crime involves moral turpitude is whether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind.
hamdan,cir quoting the bia decision in that case internal citations omitted see also omagah ashcroft,cir quoting hamdan language with approval.consequently,we give chevron deference to the bia interpretation of the ina when appropriate,but we review de novo the bia interpretation and evaluation of state law in deciding whether a particular state law is a cimt.see omagah,at cir accord,okoro,cir knapik ashcroft,cir in determining what the elements are of a particular criminal statute deemed to implicate moral turpitude,we do not defer to the bia.michel,cir stating that when the bia is interpreting state or federal criminal laws,we must review its decision de novo citing hamdan,cir.
in our de novo interpretation and evaluation of a state law,we look to the statutory crime definition as interpreted by the state courts,without regard to the particular circumstances surrounding the specific offender violation.okabe,cir whether a crime involves moral turpitude depends upon the inherent nature of the crime,as defined in the statute concerned,rather than the circumstances surrounding the particular transgression.accord,padilla gonzales,cir ashcroft,cir nguyen reno,cir.when applying the categorical approach,the statute must be read at the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under the statute.hamdan,at citing ex rel.guarino uhl,cir accord,partyka attorney general of the,cir matter of marchena,bia.generally,a statute that encompasses both acts that do and do not involve moral turpitude can not be the basis of removal determination under the categorical approach.hamdan,at citing matter of short,bia accord,smalley ashcroft,cir omagah ashcroft,cir pichardo,cir michel,cir partyka attorney general of the,cir.
