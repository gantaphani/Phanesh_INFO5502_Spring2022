we are called on to determine whether this court has any power to act where the government voluntarily dismisses immigration removal proceedings and has not yet obtained a final order of removal.
alcala petitions for review of two orders of the board of immigration appeals bia the bia order affirming the immigration judge ij grant of the government motion to dismiss removal proceedings so the government could reinstate a prior,expedited order of removal against alcala and the bia order denying alcala motion to reopen the dismissed removal proceedings,which motion was based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
our jurisdiction is limited to that granted by congress.because the authorizing statute limits our jurisdiction to review of final orders of because no such order exists in this dismiss alcala petitions for review.
alcala,a native and citizen of mexico,unlawfully entered the united states on january,without being admitted or paroled.in,alcala filed an application for asylum at some point thereafter,he returned to mexico on march,alcala attempted to return to the united states by using a fraudulent certificate of legal permanent residency sometimes called a green card.that same day,pursuant to b,alcala was placed in expedited removal proceedings and removed from the united states the removal order prohibited alcala from the united states for five years.nevertheless,alcala again unlawfully the united states soon thereafter.
in late alcala application for asylum was denied,and,on december,he was served with a notice to appear for removal proceedings.the notice alleged alcala entered the united states on or about january,without being admitted or paroled after inspection.the notice did not mention alcala expedited removal on march,or his subsequent unlawful.
at a december hearing,alcala,through counsel,admitted the allegations in the notice to appear and conceded the charge of removability.the ij continued proceedings until july,to allow alcala to file with the ins an amended application for asylum,as well as applications for withholding of removal,protection under the convention against torture cat,and,in the alternative,voluntary departure.meanwhile,in february,alcala married a united states citizen,who then filed a visa petition for an alien relative on alcala behalf with the ins.the petition was approved.alcala then filed with the ins an application for permission to reapply for admission to the united states after removal form and an application for adjustment of status form.once he filed the application for adjustment of status,alcala abandoned his applications for other forms of relief before the immigration court,including asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.
after several adjournments,the hearing on the merits of alcala application for adjustment of status was set for november.alcala was present with his wife.alcala counsel,however,failed to appear.instead,alcala counsel sent an unprepared attorney who was unfamiliar with alcala case.at the hearing,the government introduced into evidence two verified notices of alcala prior expedited removal on march.alcala admitted he had been so removed on march.
the government then orally moved to dismiss the removal proceedings it had commenced in december so that it might reinstate alcala prior march,removal order pursuant to a based on alcala prior removal on march,and subsequent illegal.alcala attorney presented no argument in opposition to the government motion,nor did the attorney mention alcala pending applications for permission to reapply for admission and for adjustment of status.the ij granted the government motion to dismiss the proceedings without adjudicating these applications for relief.
from the ij order of dismissal,alcala original counsel filed a timely appeal to the bia,with a brief in support.the brief failed to make any argument about the ij dismissal of the proceedings or the ij failure to address alcala pending applications for permission to reapply for admission and adjustment of status.the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion.
in our court,now represented by new counsel,alcala timely filed a petition for review of the bia order affirming the ij dismissal of removal proceedings,which is now before us.
alcala new counsel also filed a motion to reopen the november removal proceedings with the bia.alcala claimed ineffective assistance of counsel based on his counsel his removal hearing and appeal.alcala also contended the ij abused his discretion by failing to adjudicate his application for adjustment of status before terminating the proceedings.
the bia denied alcala motion to reopen.the bia held that under the reinstatement statute and implementing regulation,a and alcala was subject to reinstatement of his prior order of removal without a hearing before an ij.the bia concluded prior counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel because alcala had no right in the first place to the removal proceedings and there was no legal argument counsel could have made to avoid their termination.alcala timely filed a petition for review of this decision.
this court consolidated both petitions for review.
at the outset,it is important to be clear about what alcala does and does not petition this court to review.alcala has not petitioned for review of the march,removal order.nor does alcala petition for review of a bia order denying a motion to reopen the march,expedited proceedings that resulted in that removal order.alcala has filed no such motion.instead,alcala seeks review to november removal proceedings,proceedings that resulted in no order of removal whatsoever.the only order the november hearing produced is an order of dismissal.the carefully crafted congressional scheme governing review of decisions of the bia limits this court jurisdiction to the review of final orders of removal.see a lolong gonzales,cir en banc o ur jurisdiction is limited to review of final orders of removal.because an order dismissing removal proceedings is not an order of removal,we lack jurisdiction over alcala petitions for review.
that the government may,in the future,decide to reinstate the march,order of removal does not confer jurisdiction upon us.for reasons unknown,the government has not yet reinstated the order.as we have explained previously,w hen an alien subject to removal leaves the country,the removal order is deemed to be executed.if the alien reenters the country illegally,the order may not be executed against him unless it has been reinstated by an authorized official.gonzales,cir.
reinstatement of a prior order of removal is not automatic.under a,if the attorney general finds an alien has reentered this country illegally after having been removed under an order of expedited is the case with prior order can be reinstated from its original date.however,the statute implementing regulation requires that before a prior order can be reinstated,the immigration officer must obtain the prior order related to the alien,confirm that the alien under consideration is the same alien who was previously removed or voluntarily departed,and confirm that the alien unlawfully reentered the united states.lin gonzales,cir citing a.
if these requirements are met,the immigration officer must then provide the alien with written notice of the determination and give the alien an opportunity to make a statement contesting the determination before an immigration officer.b.only if the requirements of a and b have been satisfied is the alien removable under the previous order.lin,at,citing c.
here,the government has taken no action to fulfill the requirements of a and b indeed,there is no evidence in the record the government has taken any steps whatsoever to reinstate the prior removal order against alcala.when,and if,the government chooses to reinstate the march,expedited order of removal,alcala may seek whatever judicial remedies are afforded to an alien in reinstatement proceedings.see garcia de rincon dep t of homeland,cir,at.alcala may also have remedies by means other than direct review in this court,and we express no opinion as to whether another court would have jurisdiction to review his claims for relief.but absent a final order of removal,we lack the power to entertain alcala claims for relief 
citing lin gonzales,the dissent contends we have jurisdiction over alcala petition because alcala petitions for review of an order denying a motion to reopen.in lin,we stated the denial of a motion to reopen falls within our jurisdiction over final orders of removal not issued in abstentia under a,provided that the denial has been separately appealed.at.lin is distinguishable.petitioner lin attempted to enter the united states,but was intercepted at the border,and placed in expedited removal proceedings.at.lin was ordered removed,and the government executed the order by removing lin from the united states.id.lin then illegally the united states and filed an asylum application.id.at.after the ij denied his application for asylum,lin filed a motion to reopen the first removal expedited proceeding that had resulted in a final order of removal and its execution by his removal from the united states.id.the ina does not provide an independent statutory basis for jurisdiction over a motion to reopen instead,our jurisdiction over a motion to reopen is derivative of our jurisdiction over the underlying order of removal.see sarmadi ins,cir w e have assumed that jurisdiction over these orders denying a motion to reopen is included in our jurisdiction over final orders of deportation.alcala,in contrast to lin,sought before the bia to reopen his second removal proceeding the government had voluntarily dismissed and that resulted in no order of removal.even if this executed final order of removal exists,it has not been reinstated and it is not before us thus,the dissent purely textual reading of the statute is incorrect because alcala petition does not seek review of a final order of removal.a.
the dissent further contends we have jurisdiction over alcala petition for review of the bia order denying his motion to reopen simply because it raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel the ina does not give this court jurisdiction to review any and all claimed constitutional defects in a removal proceeding.this court has jurisdiction under a d over petitions for review which raise constitutional claims or questions of law if,and only if,there is a final order of removal.section a d states 
nothing in subparagraph b or c limiting review over denials of discretionary relief and removal orders against aliens convicted of certain criminal offenses,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.
emphasis added.this section is a,which limits jurisdiction to petitions for review of final orders of removal.lolong,at.
further,the ina states 
judicial review of all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.
b emphases added.
in gonzales,the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit held it lacked jurisdiction over a petition for review of a revocation of an immediate relative petition and of a motion to reopen proceedings on the revocation,because there was no final order of though the petitioner raised a due process claim,cir.we agree with the eighth circuit 
w e do not interpret the constitutional claims or questions of law exception contained in the real id act to be a general grant of appellate court jurisdiction over all appeals involving alleged constitutional violations by the service regardless of the nature of the underlying proceedings the alleged constitutional violations must result in an order of removal that is otherwise directly appealable to the courts of appeals.
id.thus,where there is no final order of removal,this court lacks jurisdiction even where a constitutional claim or question of law is raised 
the dissent accuses us of donning willful blinders to the facts of alcala fate and to the prior order of removal whose reinstatement is apparently inevitable.infra at.we plead guilty as charged.none of those facts,nor alcala counsel deficient performance,can confer jurisdiction upon us.what the dissent terms a technicality,infra at,is nothing less than the bedrock principle that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.see cary curtis,how.t he judicial power of the united states depends entirely upon the action of congress,who possess the sole power of creating the tribunals inferior to the supreme court for the exercise of the judicial power,and of investing them with jurisdiction either limited,concurrent,or exclusive,and of withholding jurisdiction from them in the exact degrees and character which to congress may seem proper for the public good.to deny this position would be to elevate the judicial over the legislative branch of the government.as an inferior court,we are not free to expand our jurisdiction to review a decision congress has placed outside our purview,no matter how incoherent individual judges find congress scheme to be and no matter how unsatisfying the circumstances in which an individual petitioner finds himself.
we can not and do not reach the merits of alcala claim the ij abused his discretion when he terminated proceedings without adjudicating alcala applications for relief and alcala claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.as a court of appeals,our direct review of immigration proceedings is limited to review of final orders of removal.here,there is none.
petitions dismissed 
i respectfully dissent from the portion of the disposition holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider alcala motion to reopen.though the majority would end its inquiry at the purported lack of a final order of removal,it can not escape two facts first,a final order of removal exists and will be reinstated upon termination of this appeal.second,with effective assistance of counsel,alcala may have succeeded in adjusting his status before the ij.by not recognizing these facts,the majority has ensured that alcala potentially meritorious ineffective assistance of counsel claim can never be heard due to a technical delay that is entirely within the government control and of its own creation.
the majority dons willful blinders to disregard the final order of removal that already exists for alcala,the reinstatement of which has merely been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.in fact,the very first order we issued after alcala filed his petition for review before us was to grant alcala unopposed motion to stay removal pending review.moreover,during the initial adjustment of status proceeding at which alcala counsel failed him so utterly,the following colloquy ensued between the ij and counsel for the immigration and naturalization service ins 
to the government,is the respondent not subject to being removed under the expedited removal proceeding 
he is,your honor.service,unfortunately,ca make a motion to terminate right now unless i can contact my office to reinstate the prior order of removal.
all right.how long would it take you to get that information from your office where we can appear back here in court 
your honor,i can do it this afternoon if i could contact my office by telephone and let you know in minutes.
all right.i will go off the record.here the phone.
counsel for the government,you had an opportunity to discuss this matter with your office 
yes,your honor,and pursuant to the office policy and permission of my office,seek to terminate the proceedings and the removal order 
q.the respondent admits that the orders do show and the documents do show that he was deported in.he has reentered the united states without authorization from the attorney general.he was subject for immediate removal without having been placed in proceedings so i will grant that order of termination.
the oral decision of the ij also confirmed the understanding that,once the proceedings were terminated,the reinstatement,which was stayed pending these proceedings,would go into effect as a result of these documents and the admissions of the respondent here in court,the ins moved that these proceedings be terminated so that the ins could reinstate the prior removal order.that motion is granted and proceedings are hereby terminated.thus,the removal order exists,and once the department of homeland security reinstates it,it is the order by which alcala may be deported.inexplicably,the majority nonetheless concludes that there is no removal order.
the majority argument that alcala removal is not,at this point,a foregone conclusion is unpersuasive.the majority notes that under a,an immigration officer must verify three findings prior to reinstatement the existence of the prior order of removal the identity of the individual and the individual unlawful reentry.again,the majority ignores the fact that all three findings have been admitted under oath by alcala,on the record,before an ij in alcala circumstances,the likelihood of reinstatement can not be seriously questioned at this point,it is simply a matter of time.to hold that we lack jurisdiction under these circumstances is to allow the government to circumvent review on a temporal technicality.that is precisely why,in similar contexts,we have previously exercised our jurisdiction.see lolong gonzales,cir finding jurisdiction over the bia reversal of a cancellation of removal because it was effectively an order of removal see also perryman,cir t he agency does not have the final say on constitutional matters instead,that power rests with the courts.quoting singh reno,cir.in sum,the majority is wrong that there is no final order of removal and improperly relies upon a technicality that will be cured as soon as the mandate issues to avoid considering the merits of alcala petition 
indeed,though the majority cites lin gonzales,cir,for the proposition that reinstatement of a prior order of removal is not automatic,our decision in lin should more fundamentally guide our resolution of alcala appeal.in lin,after his first petition for asylum had been denied,lin illegally reentered the united states and filed a second application for asylum.when this second petition was also denied,lin filed a motion to reopen his initial asylum application before the ij.the ij denied lin motion,and the bia affirmed denial,on the grounds that lin was currently subject to reinstatement of his prior removal order,and that the ij lacks jurisdiction to reopen lin prior removal order.id.at.stressing that both the bia and the ij had erroneously assumed that lin prior order of removal had been reinstated,when in fact under the order of removal had not yet been reinstated,id.at,we nonetheless exercised our jurisdiction because w e have jurisdiction over the affirmance of a denial of a motion to reopen under a.id.at.as we explained,t he denial of a motion to reopen falls within our jurisdiction over final orders of removal not issued in absentia under a,provided that the denial has been separately appealed.id.at.under lin,therefore,we clearly have jurisdiction over the denial of alcala motion to reopen,which was separately appealed.
as a purely textual matter,moreover,lin reading of a is correct the provision authorizes judicial review of a final order of removal but does not specify whether the removal order must be unexecuted.an executed order of removal does not cease to be a final order of removal by virtue of its execution.while the majority cites gonzales,cir en banc,for the proposition that a final order of removal may not be executed more than once without reinstatement,it does not follow from that once a final order of removal has been executed it ceases to exist.indeed,both and lin suggest a valid distinction between execution and existence once executed,a final order of removal continues to exist,but it may not be without reinstatement.see id.at as noted,morales can not be removed again under the removal order unless and until it was reinstated.in alcala case,therefore,a final order of removal clearly continues to exist.
we also have jurisdiction to consider alcala appeal because his motion to reopen contained an independent claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.see fernandez gonzales,cir noting that,even in those cases where we may otherwise lack jurisdiction,we have jurisdiction over motions to reopen regarding cases in which an independent claim such as ineffective assistance of counsel is at issue.because alcala claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a matter properly before us for review,his motion to reopen should be granted 
a claim for ineffective assistance has two components counsel failure to perform with sufficient competence,and prejudice resulting from this failure.mohammed gonzales,cir.prejudice does not require evidence that counsel poor performance definitively changed the result rather,all that alcala is required to demonstrate is that the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.id.at quoting ortiz ins,cir.
alcala met the first prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.his lawyer displayed a complete disregard for his professional obligations.when alcala proceeding was called by the ij,his attorney was not even present in the courtroom.only by scouring the courthouse did alcala wife eventually track the attorney down and then attempt to drag him back to represent her husband.rather than accompanying alcala back to the courtroom where his client awaited potential deportation,the lawyer sent in his stead an appearance lawyer someone who had never worked on alcala immigration matters.other than some minimal hemming and hawing,including admissions that he did not have key documents in his possession,the appearance lawyer offered little by the way of advocacy.in fact,when the ij granted the motion to terminate the proceedings,the substitute lawyer muttered i like to speak to the original lawyer about this and see what the before being cut off by the judge.deficient assistance is a euphemism for what was in fact counsel complete abandonment of his duty of representation 
this deficient performance prejudiced alcala claim,because he had plausible grounds for relief.lin ashcroft,cir quoting united states,cir.had alcala counsel actually attended the hearing,he could have argued that a did not categorically bar review of the merits of alcala previous application for a discretionary waiver to apply,filed pursuant to e.that this argument existed and could have affected the outcome of the proceedings is not idle speculation.we,in fact,later accepted this very argument in ashcroft,cir,overruled by dhs,cir where counsel persuaded us to reject a mechanical application of a to automatically prevent review of a petitioner claims.had counsel fulfilled his duty of representation he may have anticipated this same argument based on his knowledge of the facts underlying alcala the appearance lawyer plainly lacked.
that we issued our decision in two years after alcala hearing is immaterial.if were already established law in the ninth circuit,there would be no doubt that the attorney deficient assistance changed the ultimate result of alcala case.that,of course,is not the test.the question,rather,is whether adequate advocacy may have changed the result.obviously,counsel fashioned this argument before it became established law,and a properly prepared attorney should have been able to present similar arguments at alcala hearing.failure to provide effective assistance deprived alcala of the opportunity to have this line of argument tested earlier.for that reason,alcala suffered prejudice due to counsel deficient performance,and his motion to reopen should be granted.further,the bia conclusion that alcala proceedings were terminated by application of pertinent statutes and regulations,not as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel,is clearly erroneous.
indeed,in his motion to reopen alcala specifically argued before the bia that,given th
