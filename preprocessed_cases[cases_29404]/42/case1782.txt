based on the facts of this case,it was foreseeable by participants in an unlawful alien smuggling scheme conducted in south texas in august that others involved in the endeavor would take the aliens on foot through brush and hostile terrain and that death or serious bodily injury might result.the district court did not err in applying sentencing enhancements under b and and the evidence was sufficient to support the jury findings.because the remaining challenges raised in this appeal have no merit,we affirm the convictions and sentences.
a superseding indictment charged five defendants with violations of a.three of the defendants entered into plea agreements.jose and maria de proceeded to trial before a jury,were found guilty on all counts,and are the appellants in this appeal.de was in deportation proceedings at the time of her trial.the other four defendants were unlawful aliens.
it was alleged that defendants de,her nephew,sergio miguel,edgar,and tirso engaged in smuggling,transporting and harboring unlawful aliens from july,to on or about august of the same year.the evidence at trial reflects that in july and august of,gregoria yaneth was years old and a native of guatemala.her family paid to have her smuggled into the united states.traveled through mexico,was led to the home of dona oralia in mexico,and was subsequently delivered by oralia to.
drove and other aliens to his home in mexico,where they remained for two days.then led the group to a river bordering the united states presumably the rio grande,but the aliens were arrested and jailed before they could cross.was deported from mexico to guatemala.a week later,took the same route to mexico and returned to home.he again drove her and others to the river bordering the unites states.he put and two other women in and on an inner tube from a car tire and towed them across the river.could not swim,was not given a life vest or jacket,and the water was too deep for her feet to touch the bottom.
another unlawful alien,rufino,testified that similarly led him to the rio grande river to cross into the united states in this same.could swim well and tried to touch the bottom of the river but was unable to do so.testified that pulled an inner tube with two girls hanging onto it across the river.none of the aliens had life vests or jackets.
testified that after crossing the river,led the group on foot for about minutes.he then directed them to hide in the brush,while he left to make a telephone call.a vehicle subsequently arrived,and it took and the aliens to a stash house where there were an additional to unlawful aliens.they stayed at the stash house in harlingen,texas for about a week,and met other smugglers there including,and.asked her for the name and contact information of relatives in the united states,and he told her to call them and ask them to send money to maria.aunt sent to maria de in san benito,texas about five miles southeast of harlingen on july,through western union.de received other western union money transfers in july,and seven of these payments were received on july.from april,through july,maria de received western union payments totaling.
took to the same stash house to which he had taken,and likewise stayed for about a week and met,and.similarly asked for the names of relatives in the united states who would send payment,and directed those relatives to wire to maria de.she received that payment on july.while at this location,became friendly with jose martin,an unlawful alien who would later perish from dehydration or exposure,or both,in the south texas brush.
at the end of their week stay,and at least other aliens,including,were driven from the stash house in harlingen to a hotel,and the following day,they were driven to the edge of brush located south of a customs and border patrol checkpoint on road near hebbronville,texas,which is northwest of harlingen,in the interior of texas the aliens were guided into the south texas brush by and.it was august or.the group of including the two guides had six gallons of water.
on the first leg of their journey,they walked at night,from about until about,and then slept until later in the morning.when they started walking again that morning,they were out of water.by,all of the aliens were complaining of the lack of water and were feeling ill.and brought about three more gallons of water for the group,but the day was hot at least and perhaps up to degrees,and that supply was soon exhausted.
was ill even before they began walking through the brush,and at some point during the trek on the second day,he fainted.two of the aliens carried him on.another alien was ill and had trouble walking,and eventually he was unable to walk and was assisted by other aliens.while proceeding through the brush,and knew they were near a road,because they could hear cars passing nearby.and told the group to press on through the brush in spite of the heat and lack of water.
the group eventually reached a windmill where they were able to drink.while at the windmill,the guides saw a white vehicle coming toward them and told the aliens to run and to hide in the brush.two of the aliens carried into the brush with them.some of the aliens,including and,communicated their concern about to the guides.initially,the guides refused any aid,but at some point they used a cell phone to call and request a car.however,died before it arrived.was with when he died and could hear cars driving not far from that site.
the unlawful aliens asked the guides to carry body to the road,but they declined,saying his corpse was too heavy.one of the guides spoke to,apparently a leader of the smuggling group,by cell phone and was told to leave body in the brush.wrapped body in a hotel sheet.about an hour after had died,the car the guides had summoned arrived,and it took the group about five minutes to walk from where his body was left to the side of the road.they were picked up in small groups and transported to more brush near a ranch.the guides told the aliens to stay in the brush,then left,saying they would return with food and water.
at this point,it was about or,and the aliens remained hiding in the brush through that night and all of the next day.the guides did not return for them.the aliens had no food or water.some of the aliens left,found water,and returned to the others.eventually,and four others went to a nearby road and surrendered to border patrol agents,telling them that others were in the brush.the authorities found all but,who successfully remained hidden.after a few days,he went to the nearby road and to dallas.he contacted immigration officials there,told them about,and led them to body.it was where it had been left,which was of a mile from road,in an area near the border patrol check point.
in the meantime,when was arrested after walking to the road close to where body lay,she told the authorities to whom she surrendered that she was from mexico.she was deported to that country with the other aliens with whom she had been arrested after coming out of the brush.accompanied that group to mexico.two or three days later,the group was moved by smugglers to a hotel and again met.the aliens told him that they had been caught,deported to mexico,and that had died.
then took only back to his house in mexico where another man and woman,also seeking unlawful entry into the united states,were present.for a third time,with full knowledge of ordeal and death,guided across the river between mexico and the united states and hid her and the other two aliens in brush.a van subsequently arrived,and as was placing the aliens into it,authorities appeared and arrested all of them.
the nueces county medical examiner testified that he saw approximately ten to twelve cases each year in which an illegal alien would die from dehydration or heat exhaustion while trying to evade a checkpoint by traveling on foot through the brush.there was evidence from immigration agents that unlawful aliens were frequently guided through the brush,attempting to skirt three border patrol checkpoints in this area of south texas,including the one on road near hebbronville.
the jury convicted de and.at the sentencing stage of proceedings regarding,the probation officer grouped the five counts and fixed a base offense level of for a violation of a a v i.the officer held responsible for illegal aliens,and increased the offense level by pursuant to b a the officer increased the offense level to pursuant to b on the basis that the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.an additional levels was added pursuant to b because the probation officer determined that actions contributed to the death of one unlawful alien resulting in a total offense level of.criminal history points placed him in criminal history iii,resulting in an advisory guidelines sentencing range of to months.the district court sentenced him to months of imprisonment for each of the five counts,to be served concurrently,and five years supervised release.
with regard to de,the probation officer similarly grouped the five counts and fixed a base offense level of for a violation of a a v i.the officer recommended that de be held responsible for illegal aliens,and increased the offense level by pursuant to b b the probation officer determined that de could have reasonably foreseen the danger posed by the conditions under which the aliens were transported and increased her offense level by pursuant to b an additional levels was added pursuant to b because the probation officer determined that de actions contributed to the death of one unlawful alien de total offense level was,and her criminal history category was ii,resulting in an advisory guidelines sentencing range of to months.the district court sentenced her to months of imprisonment on each of the five counts,to be served concurrently,and three years supervised release.
de challenges only her sentence.she contends that an enhancement under section b for an offense involv ing intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person should not have been applied because she did not create any risk of injury and it was not foreseeable that others involved in the offense would do so.for the same reasons,she contends that the district court erred in applying an enhancement under section b for the death of.
does not challenge the district court construction or application of the advisory sentencing guidelines.his arguments are based on his construction of a b iii and iv.he contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury findings of aggravating factors in connection with the first three counts of the superseding indictment and therefore his conviction.
we turn first to de contentions.
maria de does not challenge any aspect of her conviction on five counts.she complains only of her sentence and contends that the district court erred in applying an enhancement under b and an enhancement under b because,she asserts,neither the creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury nor the death of was foreseeable to her.
the government contends that de did not assert her foreseeability arguments in the district court and that our review should be for plain error.we disagree,but conclude that even under the more exacting standard of review for issues that are not forfeited,the sentence should be affirmed.
de did not use the word foreseeable in her objections to the report prepared by the probation officer or in her objections at her sentencing hearing.however,she argued that she participated only in receiving western union payments,which she gave to her nephew.she asserted that she did not knowingly participate in the alien smuggling scheme and therefore that she should not be held responsible for sentencing purposes for the acts of the other defendants.she contended that she did not intentionally or recklessly create a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or death and that none of her overt acts led to the death of.she also pointed out that there was no evidence that she received any payment from the alien who perished,from his family,or otherwise on his behalf.
the probation officer report concluded that alien smuggling is inherently dangerous by its very nature,and that the checkpoints at falfurrias,hebbronville,and sarita,texas,which smugglers often seek to circumvent,are surrounded by dry,hostile terrain.the district court adopted the psr and reasoned at de sentencing hearing that she was responsible for placing in the hands of traffickers that,you know,led up to this young man death.the district court also stated that de 
knew what was eventually going to happen in that month of august.people are being transported and the means by which they are ordinarily transported in this this geographic area that is very arid and very hot weather sic during that time of year.so i find that she should be held accountable for the resulting death of jose martin in the same way as someone who was actually there 
when complaints are preserved in the district court for appeal,we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its factual determinations for clear error we have held that in reviewing an application of a sentencing enhancement under the guidelines,a district court is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the facts,and these inferences are reviewed for clear error as well,and that w e will uphold a district court factual finding on clear error review so long as the enhancement is plausible in light of the record as a whole.had de failed to preserve error,our review would be for plain error and de would be required to demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for the error,she would have received a lesser sentence in order to show that her substantial rights were affected 
we first consider whether the district court erred in applying a enhancement under b in determining the advisory sentencing guideline range applicable to maria de.she contends that she had no knowledge of the methods that would be used to transport the aliens and therefore,the risks created by others involved in the scheme were not reasonably foreseeable to her.she additionally contends that the gross negligence of the two guides created the risk of bodily injury,and their gross negligence was a superseding cause that could not have been reasonably foreseen by her.
her latter contention is patently insupportable.if gross negligence is always a superseding cause,and therefore forecloses foreseeability,then subsection b would rarely,if ever,apply to any defendants other than those who actually intentionally or recklessly creat ed a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.reckless conduct is generally equivalent to gross negligence,and intentional conduct would seemingly provide an even more compelling reason to invoke superseding cause.but it is clear that this is not what the guidelines contemplate.the commentary to addresses relevant conduct and directly dispatches de argument 
note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake,and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity,are not necessarily identical.for example,two defendants agree to commit a robbery and,during the course of that robbery,the first defendant assaults and injures a victim.the second defendant is accountable for the assault and injury to the victim even if the second defendant had not agreed to the assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity the robbery and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity given the nature of the offense 
our focus,then,is on whether the reckless conduct in taking the unlawful aliens into the south texas brush during august with inadequate water supplies was reasonably foreseeable in connection with the criminal activity in which de agreed to participate.we conclude,based on the facts of this case,that it was.
de personally received payments for the smuggling of unlawful aliens during july.it was reasonably forese
