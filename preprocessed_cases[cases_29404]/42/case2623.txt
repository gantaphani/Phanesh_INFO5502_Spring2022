in december of,yetunde balogun attempted to enter the united states without a valid entry document or labor certification and was placed in custody of the immigration and naturalization service agency balogun subsequently conceded her removability but sought asylum under a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a,withholding of removal under b of the ina,b,and withholding of removal under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment convention against torture,as implemented in c.on june,an immigration judge ij denied her requests and ordered that she be removed the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed without opinion on december.this petition followed.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we deny the petition for review and affirm the decision of the bia.
backgrounda.facts 
balogun was born in in nigeria and is currently a citizen of nigeria.she is from the yoruba tribe,a state called ogun,with a hometown of osheilli.after high school,she attended ogun state university for five or six years and received a degree in accounting.from or to,balogun lived in lagos with her parents,three brothers and one sister and worked as an accountant.in either march or april of,she was married in lagos to obu kaloko,who is from the state of delta and has a urgghob tribal affiliation.id.at.
according to an affidavit balogun placed in the record,about two weeks after she got married,her parents sent for her because they had visitors from the village wanting to know when she would be performing the rites of womanhood,commonly known as circumcision or female genital mutilation fgm.id.at.balogun had heard stories of this happening but had never discussed such a topic with her family.id.she did not believe that her father agreed with this practice,but he did not want to go against the words and authority of his tribesmen.id.at.
balogun nightmare began thereafter.id.at.she was constantly being harassed and intimidated by tribal members.id.she explained 
i felt sad and depressed,i had constant migraine and panic attacks just thinking of the whole process i would get back from work and find three to four people waiting for me and telling me that i was being stubborn and this was something i was eventually going to have to do.it got to the point that i had to stop going to work.i would lock myself inside the house and refuse to answer bells or knocks at night.i had to switch off all lights,so it would seem like no one was home.
id.when it got to the point where she just could handle it,she and her husband went to his home state of delta.id.at.they only stayed there for two or three weeks due to civil unrest in the area they then returned to lagos.id.at.
in may of,balogun and her husband went to visit her brother in columbus,ohio.when they returned to lagos,balogun mother informed her that they were still looking for her and pressuring her to undergo fgm.id.she and her husband then went to london for two or three weeks and from there came to the united states in september of.id.at this time,they lived with her brother in ohio.in november,she began working in a shoe shop as a sales representative or cashier.in early december of,she went to london to visit her parents.she explained i just had to talk to my dad and explain to him about the whole thing just for him to be on my side and tell him i did have to under go fgm,but he said it was his choice.that tradition.id.at.balogun claimed that,up until this point,she thought her parents would tell the tribal elders she did not have to go through it.however,balogun explained,after this trip to london,she decided that she could not go back to nigeria.
on december,balogun attempted to return from london to the united states,but she was stopped for an immigration inspection at chicago international airport and found to be without a valid entry document or labor certification.at her airport interview,balogun explained that she was married,but she falsely stated that she thought her husband was in nigeria but was not sure because they did not talk.id.at.she also had a picture of her husband,id.at,which she told the immigration official was her boyfriend,id.at.balogun later explained that she told these lies because i was just picked up from the airport,and i was scared that they were going to pick him up too.id.at.
balogun also told the immigration official that she had come to the united states on two previous occasions.she falsely claimed that the purpose of a previous trip was to buy things to sell in her country,and that she had come back to the united states to buy some more things and sell.id.at.balogun later explained that i did want to tell them i was working because i was scared because i knew i was supposed to be working.id.at.balogun was asked the following at the end of her interview 
do you have any fear or concern about being returned to your home country or being removed from the united states 
i do know,maybe.
would you be harmed if you are returned to your home country or country of last residence 
may be sic,i do know.
at some point,balogun told the immigration officials that she had a fear of going back to nigeria.a form dated december,notes about the time the subject had to be taken to her flight to depart the united states,she claimed she had fear to go back to her home country.id.at.balogun was then transported to paige county jail.there,she met with her attorney,who then accompanied her to her credible fear or fear interview.id.at.at this interview,she told immigration officials that she could not return to nigeria because she would be forced to undergo fgm.id.at.
at her merits hearing,balogun explained that she knew she would have to undergo fgm if she returned because her mother told her they still harassing them her parents and asking why i have come back and what my dad is doing about it.id.she explained that it was her father family who sought to have her undergo fgm.specifically,she linked the fgm practice which was being forced upon her to the elders from her village,osielle,which is in ogun state.see id.at traditional thing has to do with my village id.at explaining the village elders of osielle are the ones insisting she undergo fgm.she further explained that,although she lived in lagos and visited osielle infrequently,the elders could and would come to lagos,which was about an hour and a half away,on a regular basis.id.at.
balogun submitted into evidence a march letter to her from her mother at the merits hearing.id.at.this letter stated the elders keep asking when you are coming back to perform the traditional rites.id.the letter asked balogun not to blame her father for not preventing the elders from forcing her to undergo fgm because it is his tradition,his mother and sisters went through it and the sic expect his daughters to do the same.id.the letter concludes by mum explaining that she supported balogun and encouraged her to stay away for as long as possible.id.balogun testified that she was unsure if her mother had undergone fgm.id.at.she also testified to her belief that her sister,who was eighteen at the time of the hearing,had not undergone fgm.id.at.
balogun also entered into evidence a number of documents regarding the prevalence of fgm in nigeria.the department of state position paper or bulletin on fgm notes that different studies place the rate of fgm from sixty to ninety percent but that anecdotal evidence suggests that the current rate is probably under fifty percent and gradually decreasing.id.at.this paper specifically confirms that the yoruba tribe practices fgm.id.at.it notes that there is little active government support for the national campaign against fgm,but governmental officials have voiced their support for the movement.id.at.the department of state country report on human rights notes two studies which identify the incidence of fgm at approximately fifty and sixty percent,respectively.id.at.the report states that the country has taken no legal action to curb the practice.there are no federal laws banning fgm.id.at.it explains that some states,including ogun,have banned fgm,but the punishments imposed are minimal.id.at.the report also notes that the press repeatedly criticize the practice and most observers agree that the number of females who are currently subjected to fgm is declining.id.
agency proceedings 
the first notice to appear which was issued to balogun was stricken by the ij because it contained numerous errors the amended notice to appear charged her as being removable because she was an alien seeking admission to perform labor without a valid labor certificate under a a of the ina,a a,and as an alien not in possession of a valid entry document under a a i i of the ina,a a i i.in a november,hearing before the ij,balogun conceded that she was removable on these grounds however,she informed the ij that she would be seeking asylum under a of the ina,a,withholding of removal under b of the ina,b,and withholding of removal under the convention against torture,as implemented in c.
on june,after a hearing on the merits,the ij issued an oral opinion denying balogun requested relief.beginning with the asylum claim,the ij explained that t he central issue in this case i think is not the background information but rather the credibility of this particular applicant.the ij principally relied upon three factors that,in his opinion,affected adversely balogun credibility.first was the timing of the claim.the ij explained that,on her previous trips,balogun had not sought asylum or otherwise expressed a fear of returning to nigeria.balogun claimed that she told her cousins in ohio of her fear,the ij noted,but she produced no evidence to corroborate that claim nor did she explain why such evidence would be difficult to obtain.the ij further relied on the fact that,when asked by immigration officials at the airport whether she feared returning to nigeria,balogun responded i do know.maybe.id.at.the ij did not credit her claim that this statement was made out of nervousness.
the second reason that caused the ij to doubt balogun fear was credible was balogun family situation.specifically,the ij noted that balogun did not know if her mother or sister had undergone fgm.lastly,the ij doubted balogun credibility because of the misrepresentations she made during her airport interview.the ij recognized that these misrepresentations did not involve a material aspect of the respondent claim,but he found they did show a propensity to dissemble and to distort the truth when the need arises.it is i think relevant in a case where the respondent is essentially asking the court to accept her account at face value.id.at.for these three reasons,the ij concluded that balogun expressed fear of returning to nigeria because of fgm is not a credible fear.id.at.
the ij then added that he found balogun background information on fgm as it relates to her situation to be inadequate.he explained that the background information,although showing that fgm continues to be a problem in nigeria,does not provide the sort of support that the respondent has contended.for example,the respondent is from ogun state which has passed a law against the practice.id.for these reasons,the ij denied balogun asylum request.the ij then denied balogun requests for withholding of removal under the ina and the convention against torture and ordered that balogun be removed from the united states to nigeria.
discussiona.standard of review 
because the bia summarily affirmed the ij opinion,we base our review on the ij analysis.see mousa ins,cir.we review the ij denial of balogun petition for asylum and withholding of removal under the highly deferential substantial evidence test.see ememe ashcroft,cir.pursuant to this test,we must uphold the ij findings if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole we may reverse the ij determinations only if we determine that the evidence compels a different result.see ins,d ememe,at see also b b t he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.the ij c redibility determinations are questions of fact and should only be overturned under extraordinary circumstances,although they must be supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.pop ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
b affords the attorney general the discretionary authority to grant asylum to an alien if the attorney general determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of section a a of this title.section a a defines refugee as one who is unable or unwilling to return to her country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.the burden of proof is on balogun to show that she is a refugee and is eligible for asylum.see a.
the agency does not dispute,at least with any force,that the type of fgm which balogun has alleged is persecution.see tesfu ashcroft,cir defining persecution see also in re kasinga,wl bia en banc holding that fgm may constitute persecution.the agency also does not challenge that her persecution would be on account of one of the statutory grounds.see a a.rather,at issue in this case is the validity of balogun claimed fear of fgm if she returns to nigeria.see b.t he fear standard requires a showing of a reasonable possibility of persecution.sayaxing ins,cir.as we have explained,the fear test breaks down into two components the asylum applicant must show that she has a genuine,subjective fear of persecution and that her fear is objectively reasonable see selimi ashcroft,cir explaining that an asylum applicant must show a subjective fear and that a reasonable person in his shoes would fear persecution.the subjective fear component turns largely upon the applicant own testimony and credibility.capric ashcroft,cir see also duarte de guinac ins,cir an alien satisfies the subjective component by credibly testifying that he genuinely fears persecution.the objective component requirement can be met either through the production of specific documentary evidence or by credible and persuasive testimony.duarte de guinac,at.
as these statements reveal,credibility is the linchpin of a fear claim.this is especially true of the subjective component,on which the ij focused in denying balogun claim.see,the central issue in this case is the credibility of this particular applicant i have concluded that the respondent expressed fear of returning to nigeria because of fgm is not a credible fear.a credibility analysis assesses the applicant claim only for internal consistency,detail,and plausibility,in light of the applicant testimony and the background evidence.capric,at.the applicable regulations and our case law explain that the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a emphasis added see also capric,at.
however,if the ij finds the testimony to be incredible,then a convincing explanation of the discrepancies or evidence is required.see,de ins,cir.without such an explanation or corroboration,whether included with the application,presented at the hearing,or submitted via a motion to reopen the case to supplement the record during the pendency of an appeal to the bia,the applicant can not meet his burden of proof and his asylum claim will fail.see,mansour ins,cir affirming asylum denial where applicant testimony was riddled with discrepancies,which the applicant failed to explain except to allege a language difficulty malek ins,cir affirming asylum denial where the applicant testimony was found to be vague,and lacking in internal consistency and plausibility and where corroborating testimony was unpersuasive because the witnesses had limited knowledge of the alien experiences in his home country ahmad ins,cir affirming asylum denial where applicant testimony conflicted with his asylum application,where the ij disbelieved a letter corroborating the applicant membership in a political party,and where the applicant failed to submit additional corroborative evidence.
the ij cited three pieces of evidence that caused him to enter an adverse credibility determination the timing of balogun claim,her particular family situation and family history with fgm and her lack of credibility at critical moments in the past.in addition,he noted that the background information,although showing that fgm continues to be a problem in nigeria,does not provide the sort of support that the respondent has contended.id.balogun challenges the three listed factors as not going to the heart of petitioner claim and as lacking evidentiary foundation.petitioner br.at.she further alleges that the background information confirm s the high incidence of fgm in nigeria and establish es that petitioner claim that she fears being subjected to fgm is plausible.id.at.we shall analyze each of these factors in turn.
the ij first reason for questioning balogun timing of her claim is probative and supported by the evidence.as he noted,balogun traveled to the united states and britain several times after being married and subjected to threats of fgm without ever seeking asylum from either of these countries.compare in re kasinga,wl bia en banc the applicant did not attempt a fraudulent entry into the united states.rather,upon arrival at newark international airport on december,she immediately requested asylum.indeed,not only did balogun not seek asylum,but the ij found that she never expressed a fear of being forced to undergo fgm to anyone on her trips to the united states.balogun testified that she expressed her fear to her cousins in ohio however,the ij did not credit that claim because balogun lacked corroboration.noting that the cousins have not testified nor presented any statement and balogun has explained what effort,if any,she has made to obtain such statement where her cousins are in ohio.as we discuss further infra,in this case,we can not fault this use of the corroboration rule to discredit this claim.
perhaps most damaging to balogun credibility,when she was detained at on her third attempted trip into the united states in december of,balogun was specifically asked at her airport interview whether she had any fear or concern about being returned to nigeria and whether she would be harmed if she returned to nigeria,to which she replied i do know and m aybe.id.at see ramsameachire ashcroft,cir where the alien airport statements and his or her later testimony present materially different accounts of his or her purported persecution,however,the inconsistencies may render the alien testimony incredible.
balogun offered a series of explanations for these timing factors.she explained that,on her first trip to the united states,she believed that,when she returned home,her relatives would have relented.she explained that,on her second trip,she was still under the assumption her father would intervene to prevent his relatives from forcing her to undergo fgm.finally,she explained that,on her third trip to the united trip after her father told her he would not help told the immigration officials that she was not sure if she had fear of returning to nigeria because she was nervous.furthermore,she emphasized that fgm was something she was reluctant to discuss.although we believe these explanations might be regarded as plausible,the ij,looking at them cumulatively,did not.we can not say that the record commands a different result.see b b explaining that factual findings,such as credibility,are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.
we have deferred our discussion of the corroboration rule in this circumstance to the end of our inquiry into this factor because it requires a more elaborate discussion.corroboration can arise in a number of contexts.first,it comes into play when the ij has determined that the petitioner testimony,standing alone,is credible.in this context,a explains that t he testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.emphasis added.the bia has interpreted this regulation to mean that,indeed,credible testimony alone may be sufficient h owever,where it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts pertaining to the specifics of an applicant claim,such evidence should be provided to support the testimony and failure to supplement the testimony with corroborating evidence under these circumstances can lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet her burden of proof.in re,wl bia en banc 
corroborative evidence also may be important when the ij has yet to assess definitively the credibility of the petitioner.the situation can present itself in at least two different contexts.in certain circumstances,the ij may determine that the failure of the petitioner to present certain foundational evidence that is reasonably available to the petitioner casts such a cloud on the testimony offered by the petitioner as to require a determination that the testimony is incredible.in these circumstances,the ij must,of course,exercise great prudence in determining what can be expected of the petitioner in the circumstances presented by the case.for instance,conditions in another country or the economic circumstances of the petitioner may render unreasonable what might be considered very reasonable and therefore expected in typical domestic civil litigation.in reviewing the need for corroboration,the bia and this court must guard against reliance on hindsight in assessing the ij determination.
corroboration also can be important when,for any reason,the ij determines that the testimony of the petitioner,while not mendacious,can not be accepted at face value.it is not necessary to determine that the petitioner has lied in order to decline to accept that person version of events.as in the case of all witnesses in any kind of proceeding,time and circumstances may have caused the petitioner memory to be less than accurate,or the situation may not have afforded the petitioner an opportunity to obtain a global perspective.infirmity,injury or emotion may have taken its toll on the individual perspective.in any of these situations,the ij must turn to the entire record to determine whether,despite an impaired perspective,the petitioner nevertheless has made out a sufficient case.
the corroboration the corroboration requirement of the second becoming a staple in these types of immigration cases.see,capric,at.no matter what form of corroboration is at issue,the corroboration requirement should be employed reasonably.it is always possible to the petitioner as to what evidence would be most cogent,and,consequently,there is a distinct danger that,in practice,the corroboration requirement can slip into could have speculation about what evidence the applicant could have brought in a environment.the ijs need to take to heart the bia blunt admonition that corroboration should be required only as to material facts and only when the corroborative evidence is reasonably accessible.in re,wl bia en banc.
in this case,the corroboration sought was material to balogun case.an obvious problem for balogun claimed fear is that she articulated it only when faced with a concrete threat of deportation.balogun had been to britain and the united states on multiple occasions after the prospect of her having to submit to the ordeal of fgm developed.nevertheless,she never sought asylum,and,according to balogun,the only person she told of her fear of fgm was a cousin.the government then called even that into question 
q.did you tell anybody about your circumcision threats when you were here in may 
i told my cousins.
and were do they live where does she live 
a.she lives in columbus.
okay.did she come to court today 
q.did she submit an affidavit 
despite the fact that her cousin or cousins could validate her fears and rebut the government suggestion that balogun alleged fears were simply a effort to avoid deportation,balogun offered no explanation to the ij as to why her live testimony or affidavits were unattainable.in this circumstance,we can not say the ij was not justified in giving some weight to the lack of corroboration in its adverse credibility determination.
family history 
the next factor upon which the ij relied was balogun professed ignorance as to whether her mother or sister had undergone fgm.the inference,of course,is that,if she does not know if her own family members had undergone fgm,then it is questionable as to whether she would be expected less forced fgm.this inference is questionable with respect to her sister balogun consistently explained that,in her village,fgm occurred after a woman is married and her sister is unmarried.with respect to her mother,however,in assessing the petitioner credibility,the ij was entitled to give some weight to the petitioner assertion that she was unaware whether her own mother,with whom she allegedly communicated on numerous occasions about fgm after she was married,had undergone fgm.it is true,as balogun notes,that a letter from mum in the evidence states that her father mother and sisters went through it.balogun also claims that fgm was not something talked about among her family.nevertheless,after reviewing her testimony on this point,see,id.at,and noting that,in fact,she did communicate with her mother about fgm,we can not say that a reasonable trier of fact would have to find her explanation plausible.
past credibility 
finally,the ij relied on balogun past credibility,by which he was referring to her misrepresentations at her airport interview on her last trip in december of into the united states.at this interview,balogun misrepresented that a photograph of her husband that she had in her possession was her boyfriend,and she also falsely claimed that she was estranged from her husband.further,she misrepresented that her purpose in a prior trip to the united states was to buy things to sell in her country,and also misrepresented that her current trip was for the same purpose.the ij held that these inconsistencies,while not directly connected to the heart of her alleged fear of persecution,show a propensity to dissemble and to distort the truth when the need arises and are relevant in a case where the respondent is essentially asking the court to accept her account at face value.
inconsistencies that do not relate to the basis of the applicant alleged fear of persecution are less probative than inconsistencies that do.see capric,at.nevertheless,multiple misrepresentations to agency officials can serve as a factor in the credibility calculus lying in a sworn statement is not irrelevant to credibility.the ij did not seize on a few omitted details to conjure up an inconsistency balogun misrepresentations were numerous and apparent.ins,cir explaining that an applicant testimony is not per se lacking in credibility simply because it includes details that are not set forth in the asylum application ins,cir holding that minor discrepancies in birth dates of children between the application and oral testimony were trivial errors that did not reflect on the petitioner credibility,especially when the applicant had no motivation to misrepresent those dates.this also is not a case in which the adverse credibility determination rests solely on inconsistencies that do not go to the heart of the petitioner case rather,the ij justifiably set these misrepresentations against the backdrop of the whole record and considered them as one factor in his credibility determination.see ins,cir explaining that the impact of outright inconsistencies and omissions must be measured against the whole record before they may justify an adverse credibility determination.finally,the ij refusal to credit balogun explanations for these she was justified.balogun own testimony at the merits hearing reveals that these misrepresentations were calculated attempts to mislead the immigration officials.see explaining that she lied about her purpose in entering the united states because i did want to tell them i was working,because i knew i was supposed to be working id.at explaining that she lied about her husband because i was just picked up from the airport,and i was scared that they were going to pick him up too.
balogun challenges whether the ij may rely on the airport interview at all.she claims that the transcript from the interview in the record is unreliable.the airport interview is more than the basis of the past credibility factor.it also is the source of the most damaging evidence,cited in the timing factor,that,at her airport interview,she was asked whether she had any fear of returning to nigeria or any reason to believe she would be harmed if she returned to nigeria,and she responded m aybe and i do know.id.at.
the second circuit recently synthesized the case law on the probative value and reliability of airport interviews in subsequent immigration proceedings.see ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.as ramsameachire and numerous other cases explain,airport interviews only are useful and probative if they are reliable.id.at discussing cases.reliability concerns not only the accuracy and validity of the documents on which airport interviews are recorded,but also the applicant frame of mind and ability to answer the interviewer questions.id.for example,if there are language barriers or if the applicant has a reasonable fear of governmental authority perhaps because the applicant recently has been subjected to governmental abuse or coercion,then evasive answers on the question of fear of persecution would not be a reliable indicator of a true lack of fear.see id.the second circuit set out a useful,list of factors to consider in the reliability equation 
first,a record of the interview that merely summarizes or paraphrases the alien statements is inherently less reliable than a verbatim account or transcript.second,similarly less reliable are interviews in which the questions asked are not designed to elicit the details of an asylum claim,or the ins officer fails to ask questions that would aid the alien in developing his or her account.third,an interview may be deemed less reliable if the alien appears to have been reluctant to reveal information to ins officials because of prior interrogation sessions or other coercive experiences in his or her home country.finally,if the alien answers to the questions posed suggest that the alien did not understand english or the translations provided by the interpreter,the alien statements should be considered less reliable.examining the interview in light of these factors will focus the agency inquiry on whether the record of the interview accurately reflects the alien statements,whether the alien had a full opportunity to express him or herself,and whether the alien statements are likely to reflect his or her actual beliefs and fears.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
balogun first key challenge to the transcript is that,on the first page of the transcript,she is incorrectly identified as a male.balogun second key challenge is that the date on the transcript is december,and this is a whole day off from the date of her actual arrival,petitioner br.at.it is obvious that these were minor clerical example,the question and answer portion of the transcript reveals that there was,in fact,no confusion regarding balogun gender,see,on this record,these errors do not call into serious question the reliability of the airport interview.any concern that we might have about the transcript reflecting the substance of the interview is relieved by the fact that balogun did not object to this document admission into evidence.moreover,at the merits hearing,she did not dispute as inaccurate her recorded representations and misrepresentations indeed,she openly admitted many of them.see id.at admitting that she lied about entering the country to buy things to sell in nigeria id.at admitting that she lied about her husband.even on this appeal,she does not challenge as falsely recorded or untrue the representations and misrepresentations relied upon by the ij.
moreover,the record reveals that balogun is a,mature woman who speaks adequate english.the transcript was sworn and subscribed as true and correct balogun signed not only the last page indicating her belief this statement is a full,true and correct record of my interrogation,but she also initialed each page.id.at
