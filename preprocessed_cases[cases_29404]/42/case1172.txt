opinion of the court 
petitioner jose juan appears before us again,this time challenging a second decision of the board of immigration appeals bia that he be removed,among other things,for committing sodomy while serving in the united states army.in the simplest of terms,the bia reasoned that the president through his delegated authority to define punishments for those who commit military crimes essentially could create the definition of those crimes himself.he can not,as the latter is a power reserved to congress.we therefore grant the petition for review and reverse the bia decision.
background 
is a citizen of mexico.he entered the united states without admission or parole but became a lawful permanent resident in.following the adjustment of his status,he served in the united states army for over twelve years.
while deployed to south korea in august,assaulted an intoxicated female platoon member by penetrating her vagina with his fingers and performing oral sex on her without consent.when questioned about the incident by military officials,denied the allegations against him on two separate occasions.after formal charges were brought before a,he entered into a stipulation of fact admitting the assault.the military judge accordingly convicted him of violating three sections of the uniform code of military justice the code as enacted at the time of his conviction article for making false official statements when he had earlier denied the allegations against him two separate violations,one for each statement article for sodomy and article for adultery and indecent assault.he was discharged and confined for months.
nearly a decade later,was detained by the department of homeland security and charged as removable because,under,of the immigration and naturalization act ina,he had been convicted of an aggravated felony with a term of imprisonment of at least one year,see a f,a a iii,and two or more crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,see a a ii.the immigration judge ij found him removable under both provisions of of the ina,determined he was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h,and ordered him removed to mexico.the bia affirmed the ij decision that was removable under a a iii because he committed the aggravated felony of forcible sodomy after his admission to the united states.it held off determining whether he was also removable under a a ii committing two separate crimes involving moral turpitude.
on appeal,we reversed the bia because it incorrectly determined that sodomy conviction resulted in a term of imprisonment of one year or more.att y,cir.because there was no specific proof in the record regarding the way in which the sentence was rendered as to each charge by the military judge,it was impossible to determine whether the apportionment of the sentence as to his aggravated felony conviction was at least one year.id.at.accordingly,we remanded to the bia.
with the case back,it concluded that was nonetheless removable under the provision of the ina.he argued that he was only convicted of sodomy,a constitutionally protected activity under lawrence texas.the bia disagreed,determining that because particular crime was subject to a sentence enhancement because it was committed forcibly,and because the application of the enhancement in his case was the functional equivalent of a conviction for the enhanced offense,he was convicted of forcible sodomy.finding that this was a crime involving moral turpitude,the bia also determined that his two convictions were separate crimes of moral turpitude that were not within the same criminal scheme as that of his forcible sodomy conviction.hence the bia found him removable,and he petitions us for review.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review the bia final removal order under ina a,a.our jurisdiction here is limited to review whether there is a colorable constitutional claim or question of law.id.we review legal questions de novo.valansi ashcroft,cir.when the bia issues its own decision on the merits,rather than a summary affirmance,we review its decision,not that of the ij.syblis att y of,cir.quotations omitted.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,contends that his convictions arose from a single scheme of criminal misconduct and thus he is not subject to removal.he also asserts that he was convicted of sodomy not forcible sodomy and the former is not a crime involving moral turpitude.we address each issue in turn.
a.the bia interpretation of a single scheme is reasonable 
per a a ii,the government may remove an alien who is convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude,not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,after his admission to the united states.claims that his two convictions of alleged crimes involving moral turpitude his sodomy offense and making false statements stem from the same scheme of criminal misconduct.the rationale is that because only seven hours elapsed between the commissions of the two crimes and there is no evidence that he was not intoxicated throughout that time,had not yet dissociated himself from his single criminal enterprise when he made false statements following the assault.
the bia deems a single scheme to exist where one crime constituted a lesser offense of another,or where the two crimes flow from and are the natural consequence of a single act of criminal misconduct.matter of adetiba,bia.no single scheme exists simply because the acts may be the same,be similar in character,or even because one may closely follow the other.id.at least five other courts have affirmed this interpretation as reasonable and within the latitude the bia possesses in interpreting the ina under chevron,natural resources defense council,et.see,balogun ins,cir.akindemowo ins,cir.iredia ins,cir.abdelqadar gonzales,cir.thanh huu nguyen ins,cir.see also michel ins,cir.cabranes,concurring hyacinthe att y,app x cir.all agree there is no clear definition of single scheme within the ina.thus there is a presumption that we defer to the agency interpretation of that phrase so long as it is reasonable.see chevron,at.indeed,that interpretation need not be the most reasonable.iredia,at.finding no issue with the bia construction of a single scheme,we join our fellow courts in concluding that the bia interpretation is reasonable.
here the bia ruled that,although the two crimes were committed hours apart,there was a substantial interruption of time between them.it determined that making false statements with the intent to deceive was of such a different nature than sodomy that the former did not flow from nor was the natural consequence of the latter.the bia further noted that neither is a lesser crime of the other.given the lapse in time,had the opportunity to reflect on what he had done but chose on two separate occasions to make false statements denying his actions.thus the bia was correct to affirm the ij finding that alleged commission of two crimes involving moral turpitude was not from a single scheme of criminal misconduct.
sodomy conviction 
at the heart of this appeal is whether the bia correctly determined that sodomy conviction was one of moral turpitude,thereby making him removable under ina a a ii.the bia concluded that the conviction was for forcible sodomy,which is akin to rape and therefore a crime involving moral turpitude.challenges that ruling,insisting that he only was convicted of sodomy under the code,as forcible sodomy appears nowhere in the statute that he violated.as will be discussed later,this distinction is important to removability if sodomy is not a crime involving moral turpitude.
the government contends that,because the charging document accused of forcible sodomy which was proven beyond a reasonable doubt by his stipulation of fact,this was the offense he committed.and,the contention continues,when the crime of sodomy is committed forcibly,article of the manual for the manual allows the military judge to enhance the punishment imposed.from this the government asserts that the manual which lists various sentence enhancements based on the specific circumstan
