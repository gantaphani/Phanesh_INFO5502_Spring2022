ejigu tadesse was living in italy in when war broke out between eritrea and her home country of ethiopia.after a was declared in,she attempted to return home in order to discover what had become of her family,who lived near the border separating the two countries and with whom she had lost all contact.ethiopian policemen apprehended her at the airport and accused her of being an eritrean spy because she is half ethnically eritrean on her father side.she contends that they severely beat her,and that two of them raped her.the officers then ordered her to leave the country.she returned to italy and then came to the united states seeking asylum.the immigration judge denied the application and other relief,finding that the ethiopian deportation order that tadesse included in her application was fraudulent the ij also found tadesse testimony implausible and inconsistent.the board of immigration appeals affirmed on similar grounds,and tadesse petitioned this court for review.
we grant the petition for review.the ij never gave tadesse an opportunity to rebut the government expert testimony regarding the deportation order,and wrongfully disregarded tadesse corroborating evidence.moreover,the ij treatment of the case demonstrates a troubling disregard for the situation in ethiopia at the time of tadesse ordeal.the case is remanded to the bia for further proceedings.
background 
the war between ethiopia and eritrea arose over a border dispute and led to tens of thousands of deaths on each side.critically for our consideration,the war also involved mass deportations.the government of ethiopia deported some eritrean nationals and ethiopians of eritrean ethnicity during the conflict.a cessation of hostilities was implemented in june and monitored by a united nations peacekeeping force,and the mass deportations stopped at that time.the parties signed a comprehensive peace accord in december.
tadesse november ordeal at the ethiopian airport occurred between the cessation of hostilities in june and the final peace in december.after her release,she learned that her father,brother,and sister had been deported to eritrea that her mother and husband whereabouts were unknown and that her family home and business had been confiscated by the government and sold at auction.although she was ordered to depart from ethiopia within eight days,she sought medical treatment and recuperated at the home of a family friend for two months before leaving the country.
at tadesse immigration hearing,the government sought and obtained a continuance in order to send the ethiopian deportation order to the department of homeland security forensic document laboratory fdl in virginia for analysis.on the day of the continued hearing,the government provided tadesse with a fdl report that had been prepared and submitted to the government approximately six months earlier by document expert dorothy held,whom the government sought to have testify by telephone.tadesse objected,stating that she should have been given an opportunity to study the report in advance of the hearing,but the ij refused to grant a continuance.the ij stated,however,if you request,at the conclusion of the hearing today,the opportunity to present your own expert,to rebut anything presented,i would grant you a continuance for that purpose.the ij also accepted the affidavit of saule buzaite,tadesse therapist at the marjorie kovler center for the treatment of survivors of torture,and sent home was prepared to that she could be recalled if something comes up.
document examiner held testified consistent with her report that the ethiopian deportation order,a form that has spaces where the individual name and identification number are to be in,is probably not a valid issuance.the document on which tadesse name was written in was a photocopy with a photocopied seal rather than an original with its own seal.held opined that it was therefore not authentic t he appearance of a genuine wet seal impression,is a bench mark of a genuine document.this is not country specific.all documents on which wet seals are used as certifying indicia must have an original wet seal.if it does not,it is not a valid issuance.despite this categorical statement that all photocopied documents issued anywhere in the world are automatically phonies,on held conceded that she did not have a sample of an ethiopian deportation order with which to compare the document,although she did have an ethiopian birth certificate issued by the same office.tadesse counsel then questioned held on the context in which the deportation order had been,between interim and final peace accords ending a war that had involved mass deportations of ethnic eritreans like tadesse from ethiopia.counsel asked whether held was aware that tens of thousands of deportation orders had been issued very recently,but held replied that this was beyond her expertise.counsel then asked whether,assuming many of them were issued,very quickly,as part of a government policy,trying to get people out of the country quickly,is it possible that they were done differently than other documents would have been done the ij sustained the government objection to the question as calling for speculation.
at the end of the hearing tadesse did request a continuance to put on her own expert to rebut held testimony,and the ij granted the request.nevertheless,at the next continued hearing the ij refused to accept the affidavit or testimony of tadesse expert,professor donald levine,an eminent scholar of ethiopian politics and culture at the university of chicago who has written two books and dozens of academic articles about ethiopia.the ij stated 
y ou attempting to bolster your case in chief under the guise of rebutting fdl testimony.and there nothing in this affidavit that leads me to conclude that this professor,while certainly well qualified and,you know,knowledgeable of the situation in ethiopia,i do see anything here that would qualify him as an expert as to issuance of documents.that really the heart of your rebuttal right now,and this is this does address it,so i not going to allow it.
the ij went on to deny the application for asylum and other relief based on the allegedly fraudulent document and various aspects of the testimony which she considered implausible or inconsistent with tadesse asylum application.the bia affirmed,echoing the ij stated reasons.
ii.analysis 
since the bia issued its own opinion,we review that decision rather than the ij directly.see agbor gonzales,cir.tadesse can demonstrate that she is a refugee,and hence eligible for asylum,by showing that she is unable or unwilling to return to ethiopia because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of her race,religion,nationality,membership of a particular social group,or political opinion.a a,b a.ethnic eritreans living in ethiopia constitute a distinct social group.see negeya gonzales,cir.we review the bia decision under the deferential substantial evidence test,and will affirm an adverse credibility finding so long as it is supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.ayi gonzales,cir.
the bia,like the ij,discredited tadesse based on three types of findings her use of a fraudulent document implausible aspects of her testimony and inconsistencies between her testimony and asylum application.moreover,the ij placed very little weight on the affidavit from tadesse torture counselor and the bia approved this decision.we examine these matters in turn.
ethiopian deportation order controversy 
tadesse contends that she was deprived of due process,or at least the protections set out in b b by the ij handling of the ethiopian deportation order.first,she contends,she was given insufficient notice of the government expert conclusions when she was provided a copy of held report on the day of her hearing.second,she argues that the ij arbitrarily barred her from presenting material evidence on her behalf by refusing to allow her to rebut held testimony and report
