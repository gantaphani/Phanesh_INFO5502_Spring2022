opinion of the court 
we ordered rehearing en banc in this case to determine the level of intent required,under the convention against torture the cat for an applicant to show that he is more likely than not to be tortured if sent to the proposed country of removal.paul pierre,who is restricted to a diet because of a injury to his esophagus,appeals the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying him cat relief,claiming that as an he will be imprisoned upon his deportation to haiti,will not be provided with the necessary medical care and diet he requires,and will likely die as a result.he contends that the prison officials knowledge that it is practically certain that he will suffer severe pain if imprisoned in haiti is sufficient for a finding of specific intent to torture under the cat.the government,on the other hand,argues that the jailer knowledge that an action might cause severe pain and suffering is not sufficient for a finding of specific intent.we conclude that pierre is not entitled to relief under the cat because he is unable to sustain his burden of proof to show that,by imprisoning him,the haitian authorities have the specific intent to torture him.accordingly,we will deny his petition.
pierre,a haitian citizen,first entered the united states in and was granted permanent legal resident status on december.on october,pierre broke into the home of his and stabbed her repeatedly with a meat cleaver.when a neighbor interrupted the attack after hearing the victim cries,pierre drank a container full of battery acid,in an attempt to commit suicide.his suicide attempt was unsuccessful,however,and due to his ingestion of the battery acid,pierre suffers from a condition called esophageal dysphagia,limiting him to a liquid diet administered through a feeding tube.according to pierre,the feeding tube must be replaced on a monthly basis and he requires daily medical care.
following a trial by jury,pierre was convicted of various crimes for his attack on his,including attempted murder,and was subsequently sentenced to years imprisonment with a mandatory minimum of years without parole.after he had served his minimum,the former immigration and naturalization service filed a notice to appear charging pierre with being deportable under ina a a iii,for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.
according to the state department country report for haiti the country report,haiti detains its citizens deported by reason of prior convictions in a foreign country.these detentions sometimes last several months and the haitian government justifies its detention policy on the grounds of public safety.the country report indicates that the prisons are overcrowded,poorly maintained,unsanitary,and rodent infested.prisoners suffer from malnutrition,inadequate health care,and a lack of basic hygiene.
at a hearing before the immigration judge ij,pierre conceded that he was subject to removal for his conviction but applied for relief under the cat,asserting that he would not survive in the haitian prison for more than two or three weeks.in his written cat application,he explained that he feared that if he was returned to haiti he would die for lack of medical care while in prison because of the haitian detention policy.app.pierre described the expected failure of haitian authorities to provide him with adequate medical attention as t a ntamount to torture.app.he did not attribute this expected failure to any ill will on behalf of the haitian authorities.rather,pierre claimed that haiti does not have the means to care for his medical condition.app.he appealed to the ij to make a legal exception in his case,notwithstanding any statutory bar to relief,for humanitarian reasons.app.
the ij found that pierre was seeking relief for humanitarian reasons based on his medical needs.the ij concluded that under the interpretation of the cat in auguste ridge,cir,he did not have discretion to grant humanitarian relief.accordingly,the ij denied pierre application for deferral of removal.a single member of the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion.pierre appealed the bia decision to this court.
subsequent to the initial briefing in this case,we decided lavira attorney general,cir.in lavira,a panel of our court granted a cat claim based on evidence that severe pain was the only plausible consequence of a petitioner imprisonment in a haitian prison.id.at.in that case,the panel stated that a jailer willful blindness or deliberate indifference might be enough to satisfy the specific intent requirement of the cat.id.at.the original panel in this case asked for supplemental letter briefs on the impact of lavira on pierre case.after receiving the letter briefs and hearing oral argument,we voted to hear the case en banc to resolve any conflict between auguste and lavira.
in this matter,pierre petitions for review of the final order of removal by the bia.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.because the basis for removal is pierre conviction for an aggravated felony,our jurisdiction is limited under the real id act to constitutional claims or questions of law.id.a c d.
where,as here,the bia affirms an ij decision without opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency determination.berishaj ashcroft,cir.we will review the ij legal determinations de novo,subject to the principles of deference articulated in chevron natural resources defense council,d.see att y,cir wang ashcroft,cir.under the real id act,factual or discretionary determinations are outside of our scope of review.sukwanputra gonzales,cir.
the cat was designed to acknowledge the obligation of nations under the united nations charter to promote universal respect for,and observance of,human rights and fundamental freedoms.see preamble to convention,treaty doc.it was adopted by the united nations general assembly on december,and entered into force on june,to make more effective the struggle against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world.id.since opening for signature in december,countries have signed become parties to the cat.see office of the high commissioner for human rights page on the status of the cat visited may.org english bodies ratification.htm.
article of the cat defines torture as 
a ny act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.it does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.
treaty doc,emphasis added.the cat then commands that no state party shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,treaty doc.
president reagan signed the cat on april,in accordance with the power granted to the president in article ii,section of the united states constitution,and reserved the united states right to communicate,upon ratification,such reservations,interpretive understandings,or declarations as are deemed necessary.see auguste,at citation omitted.president reagan then transmitted the cat to the senate for advice and consent on may,proposing a list of reservations,understandings,and declarations,which were revised and resubmitted by president george bush in january.see convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,exec,at.included in this list,was an understanding that in order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.id.at.in addition,president bush included an understanding that the cat prohibition on returning a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture,treaty doc,would be interpreted to mean if it is more likely than not that he would be tortured.see exec,at.president bush also included a declaration that the cat is not,to clarify that implementation of the cat would be through separate legislation.see id.at.
in october,the senate adopted a resolution of advice and consent that incorporated the understandings and declaration discussed above.see cong.rec.s,s,senate resolution.next,as required by article of the cat,president clinton deposited the instrument of ratification with the united nations on october,and the cat became enforceable in the united states days later see regulations concerning the convention against torture.president clinton included the reservations,understandings,and declarations from the senate resolution in the instrument of ratification.see.
because the cat did not,it needed to be implemented by legislation before giving rise to a private cause of action.ogbudimkpa ashcroft,cir quoting mannington mills,congoleum,cir see also auguste,at.accordingly,in,congress passed legislation to implement the united states obligations under the cat the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act farra.see,div.g,tit.xxii,stat,codified as a note to 
the first section of farra,a,announces that i t shall be the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture,thereby adopting the obligation in article of the cat.see id.next,b directed the appropriate agencies to prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the united states under article of the cat,subject to any reservations,understandings,declarations,and provisos contained in the united states senate resolution of ratification of the cat.id.
in accordance with b of farra,the department of justice doj promulgated regulations setting forth the procedures by which individuals could seek relief under the cat.see,codified at c,a.in a,the doj provided a definition of torture,incorporating the definition of torture contained in article of the cat,subject to the reservations,understandings,declarations,and provisos contained in the senate resolution of ratification of the convention.section a provides a definition of torture which mirrors article of the cat.in addition,the doj included six additional provisions,one of which is relevant to this case in order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.an act that results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain and suffering is not torture.id.a emphasis added.if a petitioner is able to show that it is more likely than not that he or she will be tortured,deferral of removal is mandatory.id.a.
this circuit has previously addressed whether haiti policy of indefinitely imprisoning deportees who have been convicted in other countries violates the cat.we review that history now.
before we ever addressed this issue,in,the bia considered whether indefinite detention,inhuman prison conditions,and police mistreatment constitute torture under a.matter of.relying on the understanding contained in the senate resolution,the bia determined that in order to obtain relief under the cat,a petitioner must show that the alleged torturous acts by the government will be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.id.at.considering haiti policy of indefinitely detaining deportees who have been convicted of crimes abroad,the bia found that there is no evidence that haitian authorities are detaining criminal deportees with the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.id.at.rather,the bia concluded that the haitian prison conditions are the result of budgetary and management problems as well as the country severe economic difficulties.id.at.thus,the bia concluded that the haitian detention policy did not constitute torture for purposes of the cat 
subsequently,in zubeda ashcroft,cir,our court considered the cat claim of an immigrant ordered removed to the democratic republic of the congo dnc.in the context of zubeda claim,we stated that the intentionally inflicted language in the regulations did not impose a specific intent requirement,but simply exclude d severe pain or suffering that is the unintended consequence of an intentional act.id.at.however,the decision in zubeda did not turn on whether there is a specific intent requirement in the cat instead,the court remanded the case primarily for a clarification of the ij basis for determining that zubeda would be detained upon her return to the dnc.
the following year,in auguste,we considered the cat claim of a haitian citizen who had been imprisoned in the united states.in auguste,the petitioner claim ed that he w ould be indefinitely detained upon his arrival in haiti in prisons that are notorious for their brutal and deplorable conditions.at.we found the language from zubeda discussed above to be dicta,and followed matter of,holding that auguste was unable to show the specific intent to torture required for relief under the cat.we determined that the definition of torture under the cat included a specific intent requirement as the court was obligated to apply the standard clearly stated in the ratification record.id.at.we rejected auguste argument that the specific intent requirement could not be incorporated into united states law because it was inconsistent with the accepted international interpretation of the cat.we clarified that a treaty that is ratified with a statement of understanding becomes effective in the domestic law subject to that understanding.id.at quoting restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states,cmt.d.both the president and the senate indicated their understanding that article of the cat contains a specific intent requirement and that understanding has domestic legal effect.
next,in auguste we reviewed,with chevron deference,the bia decision that specific intent should be interpreted with reference to its ordinary meaning in american criminal law and we determined that the bia did not err in this determination.citing to carter united states,d,we held that,in order to act with specific intent,an individual must expressly intend to achieve the forbidden act.id.at.more specifically,we found that for an act to constitute torture,there must be a showing that the actor had the intent to commit the act as well as the intent to achieve the consequences of the act,namely the infliction of the severe pain and suffering.id.at.where the severe pain and suffering is merely a foreseeable consequence of the act,the specific intent standard would not be satisfied.id.at.
thus,where auguste complained of the conditions in the haitian prison but not his particular vulnerability to them,we determined that the bia did not err by concluding that the haitian authorities would lack the requisite specific intent to inflict severe pain and suffering on auguste,as the prison conditions were the result of haiti economic and social ills,and did not derive from any intent to torture detainees.id.at.nevertheless,we cautioned that there is no per se rule that brutal and deplorable prison conditions can never constitute torture i f there is evidence that authorities are placing an individual in such conditions with the intent to inflict severe pain and suffering on that individual,such an act may rise to the level of torture.id.at.
in our most recent case to address whether the deportation of a haitian constitutes torture under the cat,lavira,we granted the petition of an hiv positive,amputee with a lifelong political affiliation with exiled former president aristide.at.lavira interpreted auguste as prohibiting relief where the petitioner relied only on the general conditions of the haitian detention facility.id.at.in contrast,lavira condition set him apart from the petitioner in matter of and the general population incarcerated at the facility.id.at.we held that lavira had a valid claim because he presented evidence that showed that he would be targeted,such as being singled out by the guards because of his status.noting that demonstrating proof of intent is necessarily an inferential endeavor,we concluded that auguste demands no more.id.at.
we also stated in lavira,in dicta,that we could not rule out that specific intent could be proven through evidence of willful blindness.id.as discussed below,we now rule out that possibility.
after lavira was decided,the second circuit decided pierre gonzales,cir.there,the government sought to remove franck pierre,a haitian citizen,because of his aggravated felony and firearms convictions.pierre sought relief under the cat,presenting evidence regarding haiti prison conditions and detention policies,and his diabetes,which could lead to his death if he went without medication and a proper diet.the ij denied him relief,concluding that there was no evidence that the haitian authorities would detain him with the specific intent to inflict severe pain and that his relatives would be able to provide him with his medications while he was in detention.the bia affirmed and pierre sought review from the second circuit.the second circuit denied his petition,concluding that the cat has a specific intent requirement and that pierre failed to meet that standard.calling lavira a wrinkle,the second circuit took issue with our language in lavira that suggests that a government official willful blindness or deliberate indifference,which bear on the official knowledge,could suffice to fulfill the specific intent requirement,which requires an official to intend the actual consequences of his conduct.id.at.in the specific case before it,the second circuit found that the petitioner diabetic condition did not remove his case from the ambit of in re and,accordingly,denied his petition.id.at.in order to obtain relief based on individual circumstances,the petitioner would need to be able to show that petitioners with certain histories,characteristics,or medical conditions are more likely to be targeted.id.at.
the specific issue on appeal concerns what degree of intent pierre must establish in order to obtain relief under the cat.to inform our analysis,we consider first the definition of torture in a.the regulation provides that an act is torture only if it is 
intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
id.here,pierre will not be imprisoned to obtain information or a confession from him,to punish him for an act he committed or is suspected of having committed,to intimidate or coerce him or someone else,or for any discriminatory reason.rather,pierre will be imprisoned because the haitian government has a blanket policy of imprisoning who are deported to haiti in order to reduce crime.the lack of medical care and likely pain that pierre will experience is an unfortunate but unintended consequence of the poor conditions in the haitian prisons,which exist because of haiti extreme poverty.we find that this unintended consequence is not the type of proscribed purpose contemplated by the cat.to the extent lavira suggests that the intentional infliction of severe pain need not be to accomplish one of the proscribed purposes,lavira is overruled.
given the ratification history of the cat,we conclude that the cat requires a showing of specific intent before the court can make a finding that a petitioner will be tortured.in this vein,we note that pierre does not dispute that the cat includes a specific intent requirement.rather,pierre argues that the specific intent requirement can be satisfied by a showing that the haitian officials have knowledge that severe pain or suffering is the practically certain outcome of his imprisonment.we disagree that proof of knowledge on the part of government officials that severe pain or suffering will be the practically certain result of pierre detention satisfies the specific intent requirement in the cat.rather,we are persuaded by the discussion in auguste that the specific intent requirement,included in the ratification history of the cat,requires a petitioner to show that his prospective torturer will have the motive or purpose to cause him pain or suffering.as in auguste,we hold that for an act to constitute torture,there must be a showing that the actor had the intent to commit the act as well as the intent to achieve the consequences of the act.auguste,at.specific intent requires not simply the general intent to accomplish an act with no particular end in mind,but the additional deliberate and conscious purpose of accomplishing a specific and prohibited result.mere knowledge that a result is substantially certain to follow from one actions is not sufficient to form the specific intent to torture.knowledge that pain and suffering will be the certain outcome of conduct may be sufficient for a finding of general intent but it is not enough for a finding of specific intent.
as we discussed in auguste,the bia decision in matter of that specific intent means the intent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with is entitled to chevron deference.id.at.applying that deference,we concluded in auguste that the bia had not erred.id.at.fleshing out the definition of specific intent as it is used within american criminal law,auguste relied on carter united states,at,in which the supreme court discussed the difference between specific intent and general intent.in carter,the supreme court explained that an actor who knowingly commits an act but does not intend the illegal outcome of that act,can only be held liable for a general,not specific,intent crime.
in addition,the supreme court discussed the concept of specific intent in united states bailey,d,finding that purpose corresponds loosely with the concept of specific intent,while knowledge corresponds loosely with the concept of general intent.this formulation of specific intent is found repeatedly in united states law.see,b knowledge is sufficient for liability under the false claims act,and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required babbitt sweet home chapter of cmtys.for a great oregon,d congress amendment to a criminal statute outlawing certain activities related to endangered species,in which willfully was replaced by knowingly,was done in order to make criminal violations of the act a general rather than a specific intent crime quoting conf,cong,callahan,cir stating that a lthough harm to the plaintiffs may have been a probable ultimate consequence of the defendants actions,we do not think they specifically intended to cause such harm united states blair,cir holding that a specific intent crime is one in which the defendant acts not only with knowledge of what he is doing,but does so with the objective of completing some unlawful act.
in our view,a petitioner can not obtain relief under the cat unless he can show that his prospective torturer will have the goal or purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering under this standard,pierre has failed to qualify for relief under the cat because he has failed to show that haitian officials will have the purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering by placing him in detention upon his removal from the united states.
finally,we reject lavira discussion of willful blindness.willful blindness can be used to establish knowledge but it does not satisfy the specific intent requirement in the cat.see united states wasserson,cir stating that evidence of willful blindness satisfies the mental state of knowledge.moreover,to the extent that lavira suggests that mere knowledge is sufficient for a showing of specific intent,we overrule that suggestion.in sum,because we have rejected the knowledge standard discussed in lavira,and because lavira contained no discussion of the illicit purpose requirement in the cat,lavira cat analysis is overruled.
in conclusion,we will deny pierre petition.as the courts in matter of and auguste found,there is no evidence that haitian authorities imprison upon their deportation to haiti in order to cause them severe pain or suffering.rather,the conditions prevalent in the haitian prison are due to haiti economic and social ills.auguste,at.as pierre is unable to show that the haitian authorities specifically intend to cause him severe pain or suffering,he can not fulfill the specific intent requirement of the cat 
the majority is correct that a finding of torture requires an examination of purpose.the examination occurs,however,not in connection with specific intent,but,rather,in connection with the element of illicit purpose.the majority conflates the two by deciding that specific intent to inflict severe pain and suffering only exists if the actor purpose is to inflict pain.in doing so,it has obscured the meaning of specific intent and its proper contours as developed in the criminal law jurisprudence.
the definition of torture in cat and its implementing regulations contains an intent element and a purpose element.see a torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as.in matter of,the bia summarized the test under a as requiring that the act be 
an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted for a proscribed purpose by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim and not arising from lawful sanctions.
the bia decision in matter of also introduced the concept of using the criminal law to interpret the term specifically intend in implementing regulations.id.at citing the definition of specific intent in black law dictionary.
our court subsequently looked to the criminal law for guidance in both auguste ridge,cir,and lavira attorney general,cir.in auguste,we concluded that the bia had correctly defined the specific intent requirement by reference to domestic criminal law as the intent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with while general intent commonly takes the form of recklessness.at.we did not require that a torturer have the purpose to inflict severe pain and suffering,but,rather,simply concluded that mere recklessness was insufficient to satisfy cat specific intent requirement.id.at.in lavira,we similarly resorted to criminal law for guidance,and concluded that the specific intent requirement was satisfied by evidence that,given the petitioner obvious vulnerability and its nearly inevitable consequences and the expert report submitted regarding the treatment of patients,he would be singled out and targeted by prison guards.at.by contrast to auguste,the petitioner in lavira alleged that s evere pain is not a possible consequence that may result from placing lavira in the facility,it is the only possible consequence given what haitian officials know about lavira and about their own facility.id.at.we held that he,therefore,had properly demonstrated specific intent,in the form of the prison official knowledge that severe pain and suffering would certainly result.neither case hinted at a need for a purpose to inflict pain,nor have specific intent crimes historically included purpose as an element today,disregarding the weight of criminal authority,the majority adds this requirement.
the majority equates intentionally inflicted under cat,which requires specific intent,to pain for pain sake.this goes beyond the meaning of intentional infliction under.the specific intent aspect does not speak to,or require a finding as to,the purpose the illicit purpose element does.as discussed below,pain for pain sake would be an illicit purpose.
specific intent,as it has been developed through the criminal caselaw and treatises,is no more than intent to do the prohibited act with knowledge or desire that it will cause a certain result.tison arizona,d united states gypsum,d wayne lafave,substantive criminal law e,at ed see also carter united states,d explaining that general intent,as opposed to specific intent,requires that the defendant possessed knowledge only with respect to the actus reus of the crime.
the source of the majority requirement of purposeful pain is,therefore,somewhat curious.it is regrettable that an errant sentence in a different context in united states bailey,suggesting that i n a general sense,purpose corresponds loosely with the concept of specific intent,veered from the historical meaning,d.the sentence is at best incomplete and misleading and certainly can not be relied upon to establish that specific intent must mean purpose.if,as the government urges,bailey does establish that specific intent can only be proven where an individual acted with the purpose of causing a particular consequence,it would also mean that,since,all prosecutions for specific intent crimes either proved the defendant purpose as to consequences and did not rely on knowledge of the certainty of consequences or resulted in acquittals based on bailey.we know this is not the case.our own jury instructions continue to define intentionally the term used in the cat with intent to mean either that it was defendant conscious desire or purpose to cause a certain result,or that defendant knew that he she would be practically certain to cause that result.third circuit jury instructions.this is the proper definition of specific intent.furthermore,bailey purported only to summarize the state of the law,not to overrule precedent interpreting the common law term.indeed,the term loosely used by the bailey court indicates that specific intent,in fact,has meanings other than purpose.as a common law term,it retains its traditional urged by petitioner.
the issue before us has been the subject of recent commentary that is timely and persuasive.in an august,memo to the white house counsel,jay bybee,assistant attorney general,set forth an interpretation of specific intent that is similar to that espoused by the majority.there,he stated that knowledge alone that a particular result is certain to occur does not constitute specific intent.id.at.it concluded that even if a defendant knows that severe pain will result from his actions,if causing such harm is not his objective,he lacks the requisite specific intent even though the defendant did not act in good faith.id.at.this is the interpretation that was relied upon in defense of the abuse at abu ghraib and the torture of prisoners during interrogations at facilities in iraq and afghanistan.
however,this interpretation of specific intent has since been soundly repudiated by the very office that promulgated it.see justice department,memo on torture policy for deputy attorney general james comey memo.the memo explained that 
in the august memorandum,this office concluded that the specific intent element of the statute required that infliction of severe pain or suffering be the defendant precise objective and that it was not enough that the defendant act with knowledge that such pain was reasonably likely to result from his actions or even that that result is certain to occur.id.at.we do not reiterate that test here.
the memo then went on to state 
it is well recognized that the term specific intent is ambiguous and that the courts do not use it consistently.see wayne lafave,substantive criminal law e,at ed.specific intent is most commonly understood,however,to designate a special mental element which is required above and beyond any mental state required with respect to the actus reus of the crime.id.at see also carter united states,d explaining that general intent,as opposed to specific intent,requires that the defendant possessed knowledge only with respect to the actus reus of the crime.as one respected treatise explains 
with crimes which require that the defendant intentionally cause
