the panel affirmed an illegal reentry conviction in a case in which the defendant argued that in compiling its master jury wheel,the southern district of california violated the jury selection and service act of and the constitution.
applying the absolute disparity rule,the panel held that because a juror source list consisting only of registered voters did not substantially underrepresent african americans or hispanics in the community,the southern district failure to supplement that list did not violate the sixth amendment.the panel also held that because the defendant neither alleged nor showed discriminatory intent,there was no fifth amendment violation.
the panel wrote that the southern district clerk office should not automatically disqualify individuals who express doubt about their english skills,and should not put off preparing statistical forms required by the act,but that these technical violations did not frustrate the act goals and do not warrant merits relief in this case.
the panel held that the southern district dismissal of prospective jurors based solely on a no answer to a question whether jurors read,write,speak and understand the english language was not a substantial violation of the act because it did not interfere with the act key goals of randomness and objectivity.the panel also held that the defendant did not demonstrate that the southern district substantially departed from the requirements of the act by failing to return questionnaires to prospective jurors who failed to answer questions on race ethnicity.
the panel cautioned the southern district to take note of the statutory violations identified and amend its practices in the future.
chief judge kozinski joined by judge watford concurred without enthusiasm because the rule the panel is bound to apply,measuring disparity for fair cross section purposes by looking at absolute disparity,and accepting up to of the total jury pool as a permissible deviation is clearly wrong.
the question in this appeal is whether the united states district court for the southern district of california violated the jury selection and service act of jssa or the constitution in compiling its master jury wheel.although the southern district departed from the requirements of the jssa in several respects,we find no reversible error in the underlying conviction.
salvador hernandez estrada was indicted for being a deported alien found in the united states in violation of.hernandez filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the southern district violated the jssa and the fifth and sixth amendments by using a juror source list consisting only of registered voters.he argued that the list underrepresented african americans and hispanics.hernandez also alleged that the southern district violated the jssa by improperly disqualifying jurors for having insufficient abilities based on their answers on the juror questionnaire improperly disqualifying jurors whose levels of abilities were unclear failing to return questionnaires that omitted information on race ethnicity and failing to keep jury representativeness statistics.
in response,the government conceded that the southern district had violated the jssa,but disputed that any of the violations were substantial enough to warrant relief.see a providing for relief only for a substantial failure to comply with the jssa.the government also disputed that the southern district had violated the constitution.
the district court denied hernandez motion to dismiss,finding no constitutional violation and that any jssa violations were technical,not substantial,and so did not warrant dismissal.the district court nevertheless recommended that the southern district make significant changes to its jury selection practices.hernandez was convicted as charged.
hernandez appeal challenges only the denial of the motion to dismiss.we review independently and a challenge to the composition of grand and petit juries,including challenges under the jssa.united states sanchez lopez,cir.
ordinarily,we would consider statutory claims before reaching constitutional arguments.see califano yamasaki,d.but here hernandez constitutional arguments are intertwined with his jssa claims.the jssa contains a fair cross section guarantee,which is coextensive with the fair cross section requirement of the sixth amendment.united states miller,cir.accordingly,it makes more sense to address hernandez constitutional claims first.
the jssa provides that prospective jurors shall be selected from the voter registration lists or the lists of actual voters of the political subdivisions within the district or division.b.consistent with this requirement,the southern district selects prospective jurors at random from the list of registered voters in the district.the jssa further provides,however,that districts shall prescribe some other source or sources of names in addition to voter lists where necessary to ensure a fair cross section,afford all citizens the opportunity to be considered for jury duty,and ensure that individuals are not excluded on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,national origin,or economic status,b.the southern district does not supplement its source list.hernandez argues that its failure to do so violates the fifth and sixth amendments.
the test for a constitutionally selected jury is the same,whether challenged under the sixth amendment of the constitution or under the jury selection and service act.miller,at.
in order to establish a prima facie violation of the requirement,the defendant must show that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community and that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the process.
duren missouri,d.hispanics and african americans are each distinctive groups under the first prong of this test.united states cannady,cir.
the second prong of the duren test requires proof,typically statistical data,that the jury pool does not adequately represent the distinctive group in relation to the number of such persons in the community.united states esquivel,cir.in analyzing the second prong,we use the absolute disparity test,which requires us to measure underrepresentation by taking the percentage of the group at issue in the total population and subtracting from it the percentage of that group that is represented on the master jury wheel.sanchez lopez,at see also united states rodriguez lara,cir our commitment to the absolute disparity test berghuis smith,d neither requiring nor prohibiting the use of any particular test in addressing claims of underrepresentation although we have never drawn an exact line,we have held that a disparity of is acceptable.rodriguez lara,at.
we must rely on the statistical data that best approximates the percentage of members of the group in the district.united states torres hernandez,cir.in,of the southern district citizen population and over was hispanic and was african american.
we compare those percentages to the percentages of hispanics and african americans in the wheel.sanchez lopez,at.in determining the percentage of hispanics in the jury wheel we exclude those who did not identify their ethnicity on the questionnaire and in determining the percentage of african americans we exclude those who did not identify their race.rodriguez lara,at.excluding these individuals,hispanics made up of the wheel and african americans made up.thus,hispanics were overrepresented by and african americans were underrepresented by.since these percentages do not begin to approach underrepresentation,hernandez sixth amendment claim fails.
hernandez urges that we instead include in our calculations individuals who failed to identify their race ethnicity.as an initial matter,there is no way to know that those who failed to identify their race or ethnicity were not members of a minority group after all,they did not reveal their race or ethnicity.but even if we included them,hernandez claim still fails
