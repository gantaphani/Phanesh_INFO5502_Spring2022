ray alexander,who was born in the panama canal zone,pled guilty to one count charging him with violating b.that statute makes it a criminal offense for an alien who has previously been removed from the united states to reenter the country without the approval of the attorney general.before sentencing,moved to withdraw his guilty plea,primarily contending that newly obtained dna evidence indicates that he may be the biological son of a united states citizen and,if so,he is also a united states than an virtue of a.that statute creates a right of derivative united states citizenship for certain persons born in the canal zone.finding that failed to meet his burden of proof under a,the district court denied the motion and eventually sentenced him to an term of imprisonment.now appeals the denial of his plea withdrawal motion.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and remand this case with instructions to the district court to allow him to withdraw his plea.
a guilty plea is a grave and solemn act,brady united states,d,and is an event of signal significance in a criminal proceeding,florida nixon,d.it is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts it is itself a conviction nothing remains but to give judgment and determine punishment.boykin alabama,d.guilty pleas are indispensable in the operation of the modern criminal justice system,and the finality of such pleas is a matter of particular importance.united states dominguez benitez,d.
consequently,a defendant awaiting sentencing does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.united states bowman,cir.rather,federal rule of criminal procedure d b authorizes the withdrawal of a guilty plea before sentencing only if the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.because of the grim dynamics of plea bargaining,including the prevalence of buyer remorse among those who have pled,united states,cir,a district court should not interpret rule d b to allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea simply on a lark after it conducts a thorough plea colloquy and has made the requisite findings,united states battle,cir,cert.denied,d.as we have explained 
the orderly procedure in our busy trial courts would be disrupted if a fair and just reason were found to lodge in all cases where the vagaries of a defendant were due only to a wish held by many if not all criminal defendants who do not relish the prospects of standing trial but also,in the end,decide to take an unreasonably gamble on beating by standing trial a fair,reasonable and just guilty plea.
united states defreitas,cir see also brady,at.a defendant is not entitled to withdraw his plea merely because he discovers long after the plea has been accepted that his calculus misapprehended the quality of the state case or the likely penalties attached to alternative courses of action.
t he defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that withdrawal should be granted,united states dyess,cir,cert.denied,d in this regard,the defendant bears a heavy burden of persuasion in showing that a fair and just reason exists,united states chavers,cir.the decision to permit the defendant to withdraw a plea is discretionary,and our review is limited to the question of whether the district court abused its discretion.united states lambey,cir en banc.a district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily or irrationally,fails to consider judicially recognized factors constraining its exercise of discretion,relies on erroneous factual or legal premises,or commits an error of law.united states delfino,cir,cert.denied,d.
in light of the fact that a properly conducted rule guilty plea colloquy leaves a defendant with a very limited basis upon which to have his plea withdrawn,we have articulated a list of factors for a district court to consider in deciding a plea withdrawal motion.bowman,at.those factors are whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or not voluntary,whether the defendant has credibly asserted legal innocence,whether there has been a delay between entry of the plea and the filing of the motion,whether the defendant has had close assistance of competent counsel,whether withdrawal will prejudice the government,and whether withdrawal will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.id.the consideration of these factors is not a rigidly mechanistic test,for the conspicuous fuzziness of the operative terms fair and just precludes such an endeavor.united states sparks,cir.however,a district court typically should balance these factors,along with any other pertinent information,to reach its decision.see united states faris,cir.
evidence in the record indicates that was born in october in the coco solo hospital in the canal zone his official birth certificate,which is marked as being certified by the panama canal commission,lists his parents as calvin thompson and elvira riviere,panamanian citizens who were married at the time of birth.calvin thompson and elvira riviere were married for years and are now deceased.
during the,entered the united states.in,he was ordered deported to panama,and he was removed from the united states to panama in.he reentered the united states on the day after he was removed.in,the government indicted him under b for illegal reentry into the united states.to convict him of this offense,the government bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that inter alia he is an alien,united states,cir,which means he is not a citizen or national of the united states,a.having no sufficient reason to doubt that he was an alien,he pled guilty to the charged offense.
has numerous siblings and maternal,but he has always been closest with barbara hughes.before his sentencing,obtained dna evidence showing a probability that he shares the same father and mother with barbara hughes.her official birth certificate,which is marked as being certified by the panama canal commission,states that she was born in in the naval hospital at coco solo to elvira riviere and david hughes,a united states citizen.she is the youngest of several children born to these parents.until this dna evidence was obtained,barbara hughes and believed that they were only maternal.barbara hughes is retired from the united states air force and appears to have resided in the united states since at least the early.
armed with this dna evidence,moved to withdraw his guilty plea.although he briefly addressed all of the pertinent plea withdrawal factors,the thrust of his motion is his assertion of legal innocence.critical to his argument is a,which reads 
any person born in the canal zone on or after february,and whether before or after the effective date of this chapter,whose father or mother or both at the time of the birth of such person was or is a citizen of the united states,is declared to be a citizen of the united states.
argued that the dna evidence creates a real possibility that he is a united states citizen by virtue of a because his father very well may be david hughes who,as noted,was a united states citizen.as explained,if he is a united states citizen rather than an alien,then he necessarily would be innocent of the charged offense.in making this argument,asserted in his legal memorandum 
when was interviewed by special agent robert brown at the lunenburg correctional center in november,he told the special agent during the interview that his mother had told him that calvin thompson was not his real father,that he did not know who his father was,and that he had no further information at that time.therefore,at the time of the plea,there was no firm evidence concerning derivative citizenship.
after the government filed a response to the motion,the district court conducted a telephone conference call with counsel and alerted them to united states connolly,westlaw connolly i,which involved an interpretation of b.similar to a,b creates citizenship rights for certain children born in the republic of panama whose father or mother or both at the time of the birth of such person was or is a citizen of the united states employed by the government of the united states 
in connolly i,the defendant,who was born out of wedlock in the republic of panama,was charged with illegal reentry under however,relying on b,he argued that he was a united states citizen rather than an alien because his biological father was a united states citizen employed by the united states government at the time of the defendant birth.the district court rejected the defendant argument.pertinent to the case before us,the court concluded that the term father in b refers only to a parent that has legitimated the relationship without directly addressing whether b is ambiguous,the court adopted the government interpretation of the statute.because the defendant failed to prove that his biological father had legitimated him,the court held that he failed to establish entitlement to citizenship under b 
several days after the conference call,the district court in the case before us held a hearing on plea withdrawal motion.at the outset of the hearing,the court referred to connolly i and stated 
i t seems to me the issue is very simple here.was ever legitimated or not the law seems quite clear that he has to be legitimated in order to be considered to be a citizen.if you look at the reasoning of connolly it seems to me to apply with equal force to a and it is,as i understand your evidence,he was never legitimated is that correct 
as counsel began to explain why she did not believe that connolly i controlled,the court reiterated its belief that whether had been legitimated was the pertinent issue.
after hearing argument from the parties,the district court identified the six plea withdrawal factors noted above and found that had not asserted that his plea was unknowing or involuntary,the delay between the guilty plea and the motion is insignificant,had close assistance of counsel during his plea,the government would not be prejudiced if the motion was granted,and any inconvenience to the court caused by withdrawal of the plea does not militate against.thus,in the court view,three of these five factors weigh in favor.
the district court then observed that the focus of the motion was really whether had credibly asserted legal innocence,and that issue depended on his citizenship status under.the court noted that it was undisputed that was born in the canal zone,and it seemed to accept the validity of the dna evidence.however,the court then expressly followed connolly i and concluded 
w hat is of record here is that the defendant is not a legitimate child of david hughes,the putative father.and i construe section the same way as the court did in construing section b in connolly 
the rule is that an illegitimate child does not acquire citizenship through a citizen father unless the child is legitimated 
so i think the basic principal of connolly and interpretation is correct.there is no evidence,and the defendant concedes there is no evidence,of legitimization here,and therefore the defendant can not prevail on factor number two,whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence therefore,the motion to withdraw his guilty plea is denied.
subsequent to his sentencing,appealed his conviction,arguing that the district court erred in denying his plea withdrawal motion.on the day before we heard oral argument,the second circuit issued an opinion addressing the appeal from connolly see united states connolly,cir connolly ii.although the court ultimately affirmed connolly i because the defendant could not establish the necessary fact for purposes of b that his father was a united states employee at the time of the birth,it sharply criticized the connolly i court statutory analysis pertaining to the issue of legitimization.
in this regard,the second circuit framed the issue as being whether the term father as used in refers simply to a male parent and therefore includes the biological father of a child born out of wedlock,and it noted that the government presented a more narrow and complex definition that excluded the father of a child born out of wedlock unless the child has been legitimated in accordance with the law of the father domicile.at.the court pointed out that the government position was based on ins interpretation letter,westlaw,a document that had very little information about its genesis or identity and,in any event,may not command chevron deference because it merely appears to be an agency interpretation letter.at.
the second circuit then addressed the connolly i court purported chevron analysis and noted 
in this case,it is unclear whether the district court addressed the first step of the inquiry.indeed,there appears to be little ambiguity in the language of.the statute uses the term father without modification,restriction or exception.ins interpretation itself observed that the precursor statute to makes no distinction between persons born in or out of wedlock.nor is such a distinction drawn anywhere in the legislative history.
at.the court further observed that the ordinary meaning of father is a male parent,and it is the duty of the court to enforce the plain statutory language.id.at.
additionally,the second circuit pointed out that w here congress has wished to distinguish fathers of children born out of wedlock in title,it has not shied away from express language to that effect.id.as the court explained 
for purposes of subchapters i and ii,of chapter,title,congress has expressly excluded fathers of children born out of wedlock from the definition of parent,if the father has disappeared or abandoned or deserted the child or if the father has in writing irrevocably released the child for emigration and adoption.b.however,with regard to subchapter iii which contains,congress specifically established a much broader definition of father.see c providing that father as used in subchapter iii includes the deceased father of a posthumous child.even within subchapter iii,where congress has intended to modify the definition of father it has done so expressly,not by implication.see a imposing additional requirements for grant of citizenship to children born out of wedlock pursuant to select provisions of and.the government argues that the absence of language excluding fathers of children born out of wedlock must be read as a tacit endorsement of the rule that an illegitimate child does not acquire citizenship through a citizen father unless the child is legitimated in accordance with the laws of the father domicile.we are persuaded that the intricate legislative scheme summarized above belies such an interpretation.
as noted,we review the denial of a plea withdrawal motion for abuse of discretion.apart from the issue of whether credibly asserted legal innocence,the district court balanced the other plea withdrawal factors slightly in his favor.the government does not challenge the court findings on any of those factors.however,the court denied the motion based on its conclusion that failed to credibly assert legal innocence because he did not establish that he is the legitimate son of a united states citizen.relying on connolly i,the court deemed that fact essential for purposes of a.on appeal,challenges the court interpretation of a.
in making its ruling,the district court did not find that evidence lacks credibility or is otherwise objectionable.moreover,for purposes of this appeal,the government acknowledges that the dna report seems to indicate that and barbara hughes are brother and sister.brief of the united states,at.notwithstanding this acknowledgment,the government argues that the evidence is insufficient to establish that david hughes is the biological father of barbara hughes and.pointing to the number of children elvira riviere had with calvin thompson and the timing of barbara hughes was born years before government submits it is just as feasible that thompson came upon the scene toward the end of hughes marriage,and that the end result of that union may have been barbara hughes.id.at.the government suggested version of events is certainly plausible,but we find it not determinative at this stage of the case
