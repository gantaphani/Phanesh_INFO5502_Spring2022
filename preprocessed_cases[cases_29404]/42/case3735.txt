juan jose petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,dismissing his appeal from a final order of deportation.petitioner contends he is a united states citizen by virtue of his stepfather united states citizenship and therefore is not deportable under a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.we have jurisdiction under b a,and must determine whether ina g,g requires at least one of a person parents to be married to a citizen at the time of the petitioner birth.we hold that it does,and so deny the petition.
background 
petitioner was born in mexico in january.his biological parents were both mexican citizens and were never married.six months after petitioner was born,his mother thomasa madera madera met and began a relationship with jesus gonzalez gonzales,a united states citizen.
the couple married in february and,in december moved with petitioner and his to california.petitioner has lived there ever since.the record does not contradict petitioner assertion that since he was six months old,gonzalez has held petitioner out and treated him as his son.however,gonzalez never legally adopted petitioner.petitioner mother became a naturalized citizen in.by that time,petitioner was years old.there is no evidence petitioner made any effort to become naturalized.
in october,petitioner pled nolo contendere to attempted murder under circumstances that involved domestic violence with a firearm.he served an enhanced criminal sentence.he was released on september.on september,removal proceedings were initiated against petitioner on the ground that he was deportable as an aggravated felon under ina a a iii.after a merits hearing,the immigration judge found that petitioner was not a citizen and that the government had proven by clear and convincing evidence that he was deportable as an aggravated felon.
on appeal to the bia,petitioner argued that he derived citizenship when his stepfather,gonzalez,allegedly legitimated him as his son in accordance with california legitimation statute.the bia reviewed petitioner case de novo and dismissed his appeal.after reviewing the facts,the relevant statutory framework,and our decisions in scales,cir,and gonzales,cir,the bia concluded that petitioner had not carried his burden to establish citizenship.the bia provided a thoughtful analysis of petitioner argument 
the court decision in scales ins,involved a child who was born to a woman who was married at the time of the child birth to a united states citizen.that man accepted the child and acted as his father,even though he was not the biological father of the child.the court observed in scales that while the blood relationship requirement in applied to an illegitimate child,the requirement applied only to an illegitimate child and that it did not apply to someone who was not born out of wedlock.the court determined that the respondent in that case was not illegitimate,since he was born to parents who were married at the time of his birth,even though the husband in that married couple was not the child biological father.thus,the court concluded that did not apply to him,and then determined that the respondent qualified for united states citizenship under,despite the lack of a blood relationship between the child and the united states citizen parent,since the statute did not require a blood relationship for citizenship,other than the requirement under applicable only to a child born out of wedlock.the court further recognized in gonzales,that there should be no distinction on the issue of legitimation,where an individual such as the respondent in the case before us,who was acknowledged and accepted into the family by the mother united states citizen husband,and was otherwise treated as if he were a legitimate child,and adopted as such and the situation in scales ins,where the father of an illegitimate child acknowledges and with the consent of the united states citizen spouse,brings the child into the family and concluded that public policy dictates that in both instances such child is deemed for all purposes legitimate from the time of its birth.
however,notwithstanding the foregoing discussion,we find the respondent does not benefit from the ninth circuit decisions in either gonzales,or scales ins.as noted above,in both and scales,the court found that there was an existing marital relationship between one of the biological parents and the stepparent at the time the child was born so that the child was not considered to be illegitimate or born out of wedlock and was therefore not barred from establishing citizenship under g.in contrast,in the respondent case,the respondent natural parents were both unmarried and mexican citizens at the time of the respondent birth,and the respondent mother did not marry his united states citizen stepfather until seven years after he was born.consequently,he may not benefit from those decisions.
internal citations omitted.the bia thus concluded that petitioner was not entitled to derivative citizenship and was therefore removable as an aggravated felon under ina a a iii and a u.we agree.
discussionstandard of review 
we review de novo a claim of citizenship,at.because the bia review was de novo,our review is limited to the decision of the bia.scales,at.
there are two sources of citizenship,and two only birth and naturalization.miller albright,d citing united states wong kim ark.evidence of foreign birth gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of alienage,and the burden then shifts to the petitioner to prove citizenship.scales,at.the applicable law for transmitting citizenship to a child born abroad when one parent is a citizen is the statute that was in effect at the time of the child birth.id.at citing united states,cir quoting ablang reno,cir quoting runnett shultz,cir.
in both scales and one of the petitioner biological parents was married to a citizen at the time of the petitioner birth.see scales,at biological mother married to citizen stepfather at time of petitioner birth,at biological father married to citizen stepmother at time of petitioner birth.we have not yet addressed the scenario where neither of the petitioner parents were citizens at the time of his birth,and,as here,the petitioner claims to have derived citizenship under when,subsequent to the petitioner birth,his or her biological parent simply married a citizen.
as recognized by the bia,and scales,upon which petitioner relies,are manifestly distinguishable and thus not controlling.see.in each case,the person claiming citizenship was born into a marital relationship between a citizen and an alien.in contrast,was born in mexico of unwed mexican parents,neither of whom was married to a united states citizen at the time of birth.
we agree with the fifth circuit resolution of a case with similar facts.in gonzales,cir,that court held that a person born of unwed mexican parents in mexico did not become a united states citizen by virtue of her later adoption by a united states citizen,who was married to neither of her parents at the time of her birth.our sister circuit properly distinguished scales and,and quoted the following from an unpublished decision of our own circuit crider was born of parents neither of whom were or are citizens of the united states.he could not have been a citizen at birth.there is no conceivable way to place him within the reach of.id.at,quoting crider ashcroft.cir unpublished citing pangilinan,d.
petitioner relies on california legitimation statute,cal.since repealed by stats,to support his argument,claiming that under,he,as a legitimate son,was not born out of wedlock,and that because he was not born out of wedlock,scales and mandate that he deserves citizenship from his stepfather,gonzales.we find this argument unconvincing,for two reasons.
