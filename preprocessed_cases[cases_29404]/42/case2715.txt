clavenda toby is a native and citizen of liberia.she was detained and charged on november,with removability under a a as an alien inadmissible at time of entry under a a i i for failure to possess a valid entry document.she was also charged with removability under a c i for procuring entry through fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.toby conceded removability and the ij administratively closed the removal proceedings on march,because toby was granted temporary protected status tps.toby petitioned to reopen the proceedings in because a visa number was available for her under a form petition for alien relative filed in by her sister,who is a united states citizen.toby requested adjustment of status and a waiver of any grounds of inadmissibility.in january of,with her petition for adjustment of status still pending,toby filed for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.in the alternative,she requested voluntary departure.
toby testified she entered the united states in early september of,using her sister memie liberian passport and visa.she later changed her testimony and said she used her sister belizabeth united states passport to enter the country.toby testified her father sent her belizabeth passport when he found out toby had been kidnapped at gunpoint and raped by armed men at a refugee camp in liberia.toby remained in the united states illegally until she came to the attention of immigration and customs enforcement ice in when she filed a fraudulent application for tps using a false name and her sister alien registration number she filed another application for tps using her own information,which was the basis for the administrative closure of her removal proceedings.
the government presented documents from the minnesota welfare office showing toby had also applied for and received welfare benefits using the same name and alien registration number she later used to file the fraudulent application for tps.employment documents showed toby had used social security numbers and various permutations of her assumed name to obtain employment.she was married to cyrus barney in liberia but testified she assumed he was dead when he left the house one day and never returned.she married michael sullivan,a united states citizen,in.toby mother testified toby said she married sullivan for immigration purposes,however,no immigration papers were ever filed as a result of the marriage.the couple eventually divorced and toby later reunited with cyrus barney,who was alive and,as it turns out,living in the united states under tps as well.the couple has one son,who is a united states citizen.toby mother is a united states citizen and her siblings are all citizens or legal permanent residents.
the ij denied toby claims because she found toby not to be a credible witness.the ij also denied each of toby claims on the merits and,where applicable,as a matter of discretion.toby appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij decision.toby filed a timely petition for review of that order.
credibility 
the criteria for use in determining credibility during removal proceedings are set forth in c c 
considering the totality of the circumstances,and all relevant factors,the immigration judge may base a credibility determination on the demeanor,candor,or responsiveness of the applicant or witness,the inherent plausibility of the applicant or witness account,the consistency between the applicant or witness written and oral statements whenever made and whether or not under oath,and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made,the internal consistency of each such statement,the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record including the reports of the department of state on country conditions,and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements,without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim,or any other relevant factor.there is no presumption of credibility,however,if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made,the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.
this court has held 
a n ij findings of fact when affirmed by the bia are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.credibility findings in particular are entitled to much weight because the ij sees the witness testify and is therefore in the best position to determine his or her credibility.therefore,we defer to a credibility finding that is supported by a specific,cogent reason for disbelief.

the ij determined that toby was generally not credible because toby used her sister immigration documents to enter the country illegally documents presented by the government showed toby had applied for numerous forms of government and immigration relief using combinations of her sisters names,immigration numbers,and other identifying information because toby mother testified toby married her united states citizen former husband for immigration purposes because toby identification documents,some of which appeared to be forgeries,contained conflicting information and because toby changed her testimony about which immigration documents she used to enter the country illegally.toby does not dispute any of the evidence but argues the ij should have taken into account her state of mind when she did all of those things.toby presented evidence she was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and her counselors testified this made it difficult for her to be forthcoming about the traumatic underlying circumstances of her claim for relief and even about the details of her life.such evidence is relevant to toby worthiness for relief but does not serve to undermine the ij credibility determination.even if toby could prevail on her argument with respect to credibility,she has failed to appeal independent alternative grounds for each form of relief she requested.
adjustment of status 
this court does not have jurisdiction to review an ij discretionary determination to deny adjustment of status.a b i.the statutory provision governing judicial review of orders of removal categorizes adjustment of status as a matter not subject to judicial review as follows 
b denials of discretionary relief 
notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision,and sections and of such title,and except as provided in subparagraph d,and regardless of whether the judgment,decision,or action is made in removal proceedings,no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section of this title adjustment of status 
however,under a d judicial review of certain legal claims,
n othing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions or law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.
while this court has no jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of adjustment of status,it retains jurisdiction over properly raised questions of law and constitutional questions.see hashmi mukasey,cir we lack jurisdiction to review discretionary denials of adjustment of status,but we do review the predicate legal question of whether the ij properly applied the law to the facts in determining the alien eligibility for adjustment.
the ij found toby ineligible for adjustment under a c ii because she was inadmissible for having made a false claim to citizenship when she used her sister united states passport to enter the country.toby cla
