elza avagyan petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia denial as untimely of her motion to reopen removal proceedings to apply for adjustment of status,on account of ineffective assistance of counsel.we have jurisdiction under.a d.see de martinez ashcroft,cir.the denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.we grant the petition for review and remand to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
avagyan,a year old native of turkmenistan and a citizen of armenia,came to the united states on a visitor visa in march.she overstayed her visa and filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal on october,stating that she had been persecuted in armenia due to her political activities.the ins charged avagyan with removal on january,avagyan daughter,naira vartanyan,has lived in the united states since,and became a naturalized united states citizen on march.
in april,avagyan retained ron martinez a notario and joel spence an attorney to represent her.avagyan communicated primarily with martinez,who told her that spence would represent her for.avagyan first met spence at a removal hearing on april.he did not ask her any questions about her case.the immigration judge ij set avagyan removal hearing for november.
avagyan had no contact with spence between april,and november,during that time,she met martinez once,for the sole purpose of paying him in attorney fees.on november,two days before avagyan scheduled hearing,she met spence in the foyer of an office building.spence asked avagyan whether she had any money and whether she wanted to continue the case.when avagyan insisted on proceeding with the hearing,spence instructed her to meet him in court and be ready.he did not ask any questions about her case,describe the hearing process,help prepare avagyan to testify,or provide information about asylum law.
prior to november,avagyan asked martinez if vartanyan,as a united states citizen,could help her stay in the country.martinez told her that if the ij denied avagyan application for asylum and withholding of removal,then avagyan could get a green card because of vartanyan citizenship.martinez never informed avagyan that because she was in removal proceedings,the ij had exclusive jurisdiction over any applications for adjustment of status.nor did martinez inform avagyan that,even if she had a prima facie valid visa application pending,she would be subject to deportation and likely denied the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status if the ij denied her asylum application 
on november,after a hearing,the ij issued an oral decision denying avagyan application for asylum and withholding of removal and ordering her removed to armenia.after the ij decision,avagyan retained gevorg whom she believed was an attorney specializing in immigration appeals to file an appeal to the bia and to file a petition for an immediate relative visa that she believed would,if granted,enable her to apply for adjustment of status.avagyan filed a notice of appeal on november.
on november,one day after avagyan appealed the ij decision,vartanyan filed an immediate relative visa petition on avagyan behalf.gevorg told avagyan that she needed to wait until the petition was approved to apply for adjustment of status.avagyan did what gevorg advised she waited.the bia denied avagyan appeal on february.
significantly,the bia did not specifically inform avagyan that a final order of removal had been entered.the order said,in its entirety the board affirms,without opinion,the results of the decision below.the decision below,therefore,is the final agency determination.
prior to december,avagyan consulted with present counsel,who,on december,entered a notice of appearance and requested avagyan immigration file to review.counsel was given access to the file at the immigration court on january.on january,he reviewed the file with avagyan and informed her that spence,martinez,and gevorg had rendered ineffective assistance.he also informed avagyan that gevorg was not an attorney.on march,avagyan,through counsel,informed spence of the allegations against him.spence did not reply.on march,avagyan filed a complaint against spence with the state bar.
on april,days after reviewing her file with present counsel,avagyan filed a motion to reopen with the bia,claiming that spence,martinez,and gevorg rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.specifically,avagyan alleged that spence and martinez rendered ineffective assistance in preparing her asylum and withholding of removal claims.further,she alleged that spence,martinez,and gevorg failed to advise her that she needed to file a visa petition and application for adjustment of status before her removal proceedings concluded.
on july,the bia denied the motion as untimely.the board held that avagyan had complied with the requirements of matter of lozada,bia but found that avagyan ha d not acted with due diligence and failed to explain her month delay in filing her present motion following the board dismissal of her appeal.the board noted that the motion to reopen was filed two and a half years after the end of spence representation,and concluded that avagyan knew what documents were submitted by spence into evidence before the immigration judge.it stated that avagyan fails to explain the delay in seeking new counsel if she was dissatisfied with the representation that she had previously obtained.the bia did not,however,specifically address avagyan diligence with respect to her claim that prior counsel ineffectively advised her on adjustment of status.avagyan timely petitioned for review.
although there is no sixth amendment right to counsel in a deportation proceeding,the due process guarantees of the fifth amendment still must be afforded to an alien petitioner.mohammed gonzales,cir quoting singh ashcroft,cir.this court has long recognized that i neffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process under the fifth amendment if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.ray gonzales,cir quoting lopez ins,cir see also maravilla maravilla ashcroft,cir iturribarria ins,cir ortiz ins,cir.if the ineffective assistance of an alien counsel prevents him from timely filing a motion to reopen,counsel has prevented the alien from reasonably presenting his case and denied him due process.consequently,we recognize equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of a deception,fraud,or error,as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception,fraud or error.iturribarria,at.
the government argues that recent supreme court decisions have called sharply into question the ability of aliens in removal proceedings to invoke equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel.relying on wallace kato,d,and lawrence florida,d,the government argues that because an alien in removal proceedings has no constitutional right to counsel,she can not assert a due claim of ineffective assistance founded on her counsel alleged failures in removal proceedings.
a panel can not reconsider or overrule circuit precedent unless an intervening supreme court decision undermines an existing precedent of the ninth circuit,and both cases are closely on point.norita mariana islands,cir emphasis removed,quoting united states gay iii,cir see also miller gammie,cir en banc holding that a higher court decision is controlling when it undercut s the theory or reasoning underlying the prior circuit precedent in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.we conclude that neither wallace nor lawrence undermine our existing precedent in this area,particularly in light of the supreme court recent decision in holland florida,d.
wallace and lawrence are on point only to the extent that they reiterate that equitable tolling is a remedy to be applied in exceptional circumstances.wallace responded to the argument that the statute of limitations for a federal false arrest claim should be equitably tolled so long as petitioner was defending his criminal case in state court by noting that e quitable tolling is a rare remedy to be applied in an unusual circumstances,not a for an entirely common state of affairs.at.lawrence held that a ttorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling,particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no constitutional right to counsel.at citing coleman thompson,d neither case even considered whether individuals who have no constitutional right to counsel are categorically precluded from invoking equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel,and thus are not clearly irreconcilable with our equitable tolling jurisprudence.miller,at.
the supreme court decision in holland further supports our conclusion that equitable tolling is based on considerations of fundamental fairness that apply regardless of whether petitioner has a constitutional right to counsel.holland concluded that federal courts could equitably toll the statute of limitations for filing a habeas petition under because petitioner attorney failed to satisfy professional standards of care.at.the court held that at least sometimes,professional misconduct could amount to egregious behavior and create an extraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling.id.conspicuously absent from the majority opinion in holland is any suggestion that equitable tolling is only warranted when petitioner has a constitutional right to counsel even though,like individuals in immigration proceedings,state prisoners do not have a constitutional right to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon the judgment of a state court.see pennsylvania finley,d.two justices dissented in holland,and did so on the ground that when an individual has no constitutional right to counsel,he is out of luck if his counsel files an appeal too late.at scalia,dissenting,joined by thomas.the holland majority also specifically distinguished lawrence as a case involving a garden variety claim of excusable neglect that did not create extraordinary circumstances justifying equitable tolling.at citation omitted.
we conclude that neither wallace nor lawrence undermines our application of equitable tolling to motions to reopen removal proceedings.holland establishes even if a litigant is not constitutionally entitled to counsel,principles of equity can justify tolling a limitations period where counsel behavior is sufficiently egregious.
we next consider whether the bia abused its discretion in holding that avagyan is not entitled to equitable tolling because she failed to exercise due diligence in discovering the fraud or error that prevented her from timely filing a motion to reopen.see socop gonzalez ins,cir en banc.the bia abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.ontiveros lopez ins,cir citation omitted.
the bia and this court are under an affirmative obligation to accept as true the facts stated in petitioner affidavit in ruling upon his motion to reopen unless we find those facts to be inherently unbelievable.ghahremani gonzales,cir quoting maroufi ins,cir.because the bia made no finding that the facts alleged in avagyan affidavit are inherently unbelievable,we accept them as true and undisputed.id.
a motion to reopen must generally be filed within ninety days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.c c i.a motion filed beyond that deadline is untimely,unless subject to equitable tolling.to reiterate,a petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of a deception,fraud,or error,as long as petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception,fraud or error.iturribarria,at.we do not require petitioner to act with the maximum diligence possible only due or reasonable diligence.souliotes evans,cir describing the due diligence standard for habeas petitions in d d wims united states.cir describing the due diligence standard in.
our review of petitioner diligence must be and,assessing the reasonableness of petitioner actions in the context of his or her particular circumstances.rodriguez lariz ins,cir.we recognize that alien petitioners are often in an extremely vulnerable position as the subjects of pending deportation proceedings.id.furthermore,t he proliferation of immigration laws and regulations has aptly been called a labyrinth that only a lawyer could navigate.biwot gonzales,cir.we can not penalize individuals in such circumstances for reasonably relying on the advice of counsel,even if that counsel turns out to have been incompetent or predatory.iturribarria,at rodriguez lariz,at.
in order to assess whether petitioner exercised due diligence,we consider three issues.first,we determine if and when a reasonable person in petitioner position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying her motion to reopen.see ghahremani,at singh gonzales,cir albillo de leon gonzales,cir.second,we ascertain whether petitioner took reasonable steps to investigate the suspected fraud or error,or,if petitioner is ignorant of counsel shortcomings,whether petitioner made reasonable efforts to pursue relief.see ghahremani,f d ray,at.typically,an alien is diligent if he continues to pursue relief and relies on the advice of counsel as to the means of obtaining that relief.see,mejia hernandez holder,cir ray,at id.at.third,we assess when the tolling period should end that is,when petitioner definitively learns of the harm resulting from counsel deficiency,or obtains vital information bearing on the existence of his claim.albillo de leon,at fajardo,at see also socop gonzalez,at.in many cases,this occurs when the alien obtains a complete record of his immigration proceedings and is able to review that information with competent counsel see ghahremani,at,singh,at albillo de leon,at iturribaria,at fajardo,at.
avagyan motion to reopen alleges two distinct forms of ineffective assistance,each of which provides an independent ground to reopen her removal proceedings.first,she alleges that spence and martinez were deficient in preparing her asylum claim for the removal hearing.if the bia granted avagyan motion to reopen on this ground,avagyan would be permitted to introduce evidence that was unavailable at the removal hearing because of spence and martinez deficient representation.second,avagyan alleges that spence,martinez,and gevorg gave her erroneous advice on adjustment of status.if the bia granted avagyan motion to reopen on this ground,it would permit her to submit an application for adjustment of status to the ij,and request that the ij continue her removal hearing until uscis adjudicated her visa application we independently assess avagyan diligence with respect to each claim.
counsel ineffective preparation of asylum claim 
we hold that,under the circumstances,avagyan first had reason to suspect spence and martinez deficient performance with respect to her asylum petition when the bia denied her appeal in february.see rodriguez lariz,at holding that petitioners were on notice of counsel deficient representation when they received denial of a motion for reconsideration,prepared by counsel.avagyan appeal to the bia focused exclusively on the merits of her asylum petition,and its denial would have put a reasonable person in avagyan position on notice that something was wrong with spence and martinez preparation for the removal hearing accordingly,we measure avagyan diligence from that date.
apparently,after february,avagyan took no affirmative steps to investigate whether spence and martinez adequately prepared her asylum claim.see singh,at.further,despite the fact that she had already retained gevorg,who she thought was an attorney,avagyan does not claim that she discussed the bia denial of her appeal with him and perhaps had been informed that spence and martinez had performed adequately,or that there was nothing to be done to remedy their deficiencies,or that gevorg would correct the error.mejia hernandez,at holding that petitioner was diligent when,after his motion was denied for lack of a filing
