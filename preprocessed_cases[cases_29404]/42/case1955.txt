this case involves the application of the crime of violence sentence enhancement under of the sentencing guidelines.defendant pedro sentence for illegally reentering the united states in violation of included a enhancement based on a prior conviction of the texas crime of child endangerment.in accordance with our recent decision in united states,cir en banc,we hold that defendant conviction does not ha ve as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another for purposes of the crime of violence enhancement under.we accordingly vacate defendant sentence,and remand for.
background 
in february,at that time a lawful permanent resident,pleaded guilty to two counts of the texas offense of child endangerment for a january incident involving his two children.he was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment.in april,the ins issued a notice to appear for a removal hearing.at the hearing,the immigration judge determined that the convictions were aggravated felonies under a f,which rendered removable under.after being removed in june,was found unlawfully present in the united states in january and was later indicted for same under.filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,which the district court denied the court then found him guilty on stipulated facts and sentenced him to seventy months imprisonment.the sentence included a enhancement predicated on the finding that child endangerment was a crime of violence within the meaning of cmt.b ii of the sentencing guidelines,the version that was in force at the time of sentencing.
a panel of this court affirmed conviction and sentence,united states,cir i,and later denied panel rehearing,cir ii.we granted petition for rehearing en banc,cir,and now vacate his sentence.
ii.analysis 
was sentenced under of the version of the sentencing guidelines.that section calls for a enhancement if the defendant has previously been convicted of a crime of violence.the relevant commentary defines the term crime of violence as follows 
crime of violence 
i means an offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another and 
ii includes murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses including sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,and burglary of a dwelling.
cmt.b ii the government does not contend that the conviction is an enumerated offense under paragraph ii.thus,the question before us is whether,under paragraph i,the district court properly held that the prior offense has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states,cir.
identifying the elements of the defendant prior offense 
the statute under which was convicted provides,in relevant part 
a person commits an offense if he intentionally,knowingly,recklessly,or with criminal negligence,by act or omission,engages in conduct that places a child younger than years in imminent danger of death,bodily injury,or physical or mental impairment.
ann.c vernon the record in this case contains the state indictments that led to the prior convictions.apart from the name of the child involved,the two indictments are identical and charge that 
o n or about january,did then and there,in harris county,texas unlawfully,intentionally and knowingly engage in conduct that placed his son,a child younger than fifteen years of age and hereafter called the complainant,in imminent danger of bodily injury,namely,by striking a motor vehicle occupied by the complainant with the defendant motor vehicle.
although the actual conduct described in the indictments could be construed to involve the use of physical force against the person of another,that is irrelevant for purposes of this case.the inquiry under paragraph i looks to the elements of the crime,not to the defendant actual conduct in committing it.this rule springs directly from the language of the crime of violence definition itself,which states that a crime of violence is an offense that has as an element the use of force.cmt.b ii i emphasis added.the elements of an offense of course come from the statute of conviction,see united states white,cir,not from the particular manner and means that attend a given violation of the statute prior decisions of this court have accordingly held that the statute of conviction,not the defendant underlying conduct,is the proper focus.see,at concluding that the inquiry is limited to l ooking only at the fact of the defendant conviction and the statutory definition united states,cir same.
the understanding of elements just described comports as well with the supreme court decision in taylor united states,d,which,in the context of a different sentence enhancement,distinguished the question of whether a crime has the use of force as an element from the question of whether the crime involves the use of force in a particular case.id.at.taylor instructed,moreover,that a sentencing court inquiry should,as a general rule,look only to the statutory definition of an offense and the fact of conviction and not to the facts underlying the prior conviction.id.at.
at oral argument in this case,the government contended at certain points that defendants can qualify for the enhancement when they have previously been charged with and convicted of conduct that involved force,notwithstanding that no portion of the statute of conviction itself requires force.according to the government,the elements expand beyond the statute to include factual material about the method of committing the offense that,when alleged in charging papers,must then be proven at trial.that is,the government contends,if the statutory language itself fails to require force,we would turn to the manner of commission in the particular case as charged to see if that involved force.thus,on this view,the ultimate question in this case would be whether act of striking a motor vehicle occupied by the complainant with the defendant motor vehicle involved the use of force.under that approach,of course,the analysis of the statute would be superfluous the determinative factor would be the forcefulness of the defendant underlying charged conduct,regardless of the statute of conviction.each conviction under the statute would then require its own individualized use of force inquiry,asking whether a particular method of a child in a hot car,leaving a child near a deep pool,denying medical treatment,and so on,ad force.this cumbersome approach would essentially excise the element language from the guideline 
moreover,under texas law,the manner and means,even when required to be charged in the indictment,does not constitute an element of the offense,but rather satisfies the due process concerns relating to providing defendants with sufficient notice of the crime for which they have been charged see boney state,an indictment for aggravated assault need not allege the manner and means used to commit the assault as such is not an element of the offense but relates only to the certainty and definiteness required to enable the defendant to reasonably understand the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
the panel that originally decided this case agreed that it would not be proper to look to the indictment to see whether the facts there shown required force.i,at.the panel then contrasted that concededly impermissible activity with the distinct activity of looking to the indictment to determine which elements in a statute of conviction were satisfied.id.it concluded that the sentencing court could look to the indictment or jury instructions for the limited purpose of determining which of a series of disjunctive elements a defendant conviction satisfies.id.under that approach,whenever a statute provides a list of alternative methods of as the statute in taylor referred to burglaries of several different types of structures,at.may look to charging papers to see which of the various statutory alternatives are involved in the particular case.we agree that such a use of the matter not at issue in permissible.united states,cir using allegations from an indictment to determine which of several statutory subsections the defendant had violated 
whether the offense has the use of force as an element 
although the method of using the indictment to pare down a statute is often useful,it is of no help to the government in this particular case.the statute provides that a person commits an offense if he intentionally,knowingly,recklessly,or with criminal negligence,by act or omission,engages in conduct that places a child younger than years in imminent danger of death,bodily injury,or physical or mental impairment.ann.c emphases added.the statute thus sets forth a disjunctive list of elements it proscribes a range of conduct,from intentional acts that create a mortal danger to negligent omissions that risk mental impairment.the indictment,quoted earlier,allows us to narrow down the statutory options,leaving us with the offense of knowingly by act engag ing in conduct that places a child younger than years in imminent danger of bodily injury.but even after we have used the indictment to identify which elements were involved in case,the statute does not have the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the victim person as a required element.
in the instant case it is notable that the offense of child endangerment does not require any bodily contact let alone violent or forceful contact or any injury in order for a conviction to lie to commit the offense,one need only knowingly create a danger of bodily injury the child need not even be aware of the danger.as a matter of simple logic,the endangerment offense need the application of physical force to the child person.under the plain meaning of the phrase use of physical force against the person of another,this offense does not qualify for the enhancement.
we also reject the panel suggestion that prior conviction had as an element the attempted use of physical force against the person of another.in,this court considered the meaning of the crime of violence definition in the precise guideline at issue here.while the court there held that the plain meaning of the term use requires intentionality,at,a second,alternative holding established the meaning of the phrase as an element,id.at.specifically,this court determined 
i n order for to apply,the intentional use of force must be a constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed.if any set of facts would support a conviction without proof of that component,then the component most decidedly is not an or the crime.
id.at quotations and citation omitted.
clearly,the statute can be successfully prosecuted without proof of attempted use of force.one can knowingly endanger without trying to make any bodily contact with the victim person and without trying to inflict bodily injury on the person.our precedents have properly recognized that the attempted use of physical force requires at least that the perpetrator harbor an intent to use physical force against the victim person.see,at white,at.the offense does not require any such intent to use physical force against the victim,for,again,one can knowingly endanger or even intentionally endanger without intending to make any physical contact with the victim or intending to cause the victim any bodily injury.under the plain meaning of the phrase attempted use of force against the person of another,the offense does not qualify.
our decision is further reinforced by the observation that,rather than involving the use of physical force against the victim,the essence of endangerment is the wrongful creation of a risk of harm.but unlike certain other provisions of the sentencing guidelines,the crime of violence definition notably does not contain language referring to the risk of harm compare a encompassing conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.creating a risk of injury,even when done knowingly or intentionally,is clearly not the same as using or attempting to use physical force against the person of another.dalton ashcroft,cir observing that t here are many crimes that involve a substantial risk of injury but do not involve the use of force united states,cir contrasting conduct that involves a serious risk of physical injury with conduct that presents a substantial risk that the defendant will use physical force against another person 
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that sentence should not have included the crime of violence enhancement under cmt.b ii.we leave it to the district court to determine on remand whether prior offense can be considered an aggravated felony that would call for application of sentence enhancement.
accordingly,conviction is affirmed,see supra note,his sentence is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
i share judge smith concern regarding the inutility of this court continuing to hear sentencing guidelines cases en banc.i write separately,however,to dissent from what i believe is the majority pursuit of a approach to sentencing enhancements for crimes of violence.plowed his car into another vehicle containing his children.the enhancement issue is whether this prior crime had as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.cmt.b ii.the majority,interpreting our recent en banc decision in united states,cir,would hold that a criminal act may never be a crime of violence under this and similar enhancement provisions unless every imaginable way that an offense could be committed under a given statute of conviction requires the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force.
this approach is incorrect.it misreads the supreme court opinion in taylor united states,d,misapplies this circuit precedents,does not comport with the more reasoned approach applied by our sister circuits,and reaches a patently absurd result.the proper application of taylor would allow consideration of the facts contained in indictment not only to narrow the statute of conviction,as the majority concedes,but also to demonstrate that the intentional use of force was a key fact in underlying conviction for child endangerment.under this view,his prior crime was a crime of violence that should require enhanced punishment under for this recidivist.
understanding taylor 
taylor held that in applying sentencing enhancements based on prior convictions,trial courts should generally look only to the fact of the conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.see taylor,at.at.the court found such a categorical approach necessary because the legislative history of the enhancement statute there construed,whose language has been a model for later enactments,revealed that congress did not want trial courts to engage in an elaborate process.id.at.at.nonetheless,the supreme court also carefully noted that this approach permits a sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where the jury was required by the indictment or jury instructions to find all the elements of an offense that would fit within the enhancement.id.at.at.taylor,in my view,thus refines the pure categorical approach when a prior conviction is based on a statute that includes various types of conduct,some of which would trigger an enhancement and some of which would not.see id.at.at.
the enhancement of taylor crime by the supreme court explains the technique.the career criminal statute there enhanced offenders penalties based on specific predicate offenses including burglary.id.at.at.the court held that burglary must have a uniform national meaning under a federal statute.it adopted the common definition of burglary as the entry into a building or other structure with the intent to commit a crime.see id.at.at.in some states,however,burglary statutes more broadly encompass places like automobiles and vending machines.id.at.at.the court accordingly reasoned that where a defendant is convicted under a broad burglary statute that include s entry of an automobile as well as a building,if the indictment or information and jury instructions show that the defendant was charged only with a burglary of a building,and that the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building to convict,then the government should be allowed to use the conviction for enhancement.id.at.at emphasis added.i infer that,under taylor,if a state statute encompasses a range of conduct broader than that which invokes a federal enhancement,the sentencing court may properly consider the indictment and the jury instructions to determine whether the enhancement should be applied.
properly read,taylor requires courts first to decide whether a statute of conviction embodies a per se crime of violence under the relevant enhancement provision.taylor,at.at.if it does not,the inquiry ends and the prior offense may not be used to enhance a defendant sentence as discussed in greater detail below,this court decision in opinion broad language made at this step of the taylor inquiry.if,however,a predicate criminal statute contains subsections,or if the offense is described so broadly as to include some acts that fall within the crime of violence definition and some that do not,taylor permits reference to the indictment and jury charge.see united states,cir united states allen,cir.this order of analysis effectuates congress clear intention,in adopting its crime of violence provision,to broaden the class of offenses eligible for certain sentence enhancements,while not bogging courts down in complex over criminal history.i believe the majority adoption of language unfairly exaggerates the latter concern while minimizing the former.
the majority holds that taylor categorical approach requires this court to imagine whether there are any circumstances,no matter how far removed from the plain facts of a recidivist prior crime,under which his statute of conviction may be violated without the use,attempted use,or threatened use of force.this conclusion assertedly derives from the guideline inquiry whether a prior crime has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force.the majority relies on language,which suggests that in order for a component of a conviction to be an element of the offense,the component must be present under any set of facts that constitute a violation of the statute.at.the majority believes not only that it may ignore the facts contained in indictment and guilty plea,but that it is unable to enhance his sentence because,under the language in texas statutory offense of child endangerment,the statute might be violated in a manner.under the majority reasoning,no offense charged under this provision may ever be classified as a crime of violence under,no matter how brutal the conduct.the majority errs in two ways.
first,did not depend on this any set of facts language,at.in,the question before our court was whether the defendant prior intoxication assault conviction in texas could be considered a crime of violence under the same has as an element language of the guidelines.id.at.the en banc majority,which i joined,held that force must be used intentionally for a given offense to qualify for the enhancement.id.at.the majority concluded that because the texas intoxication assault statute,by definition,does not require the proof of any mens rea,the intentional use of force could not be an element of the crime.id.at.analysis stopped at what i have just described as taylor first step.its reference to the any set of facts approach was irrelevant to the case.as the majority acknowledges,the child endangerment statute is not amenable to treatment at least on intentionality,as it can be violated in multiple ways and with various mental states 
a person commits an offense if he intentionally,knowingly,recklessly,or with criminal negligence,by act or omission,engages in conduct that places a child younger than years in imminent danger of death,bodily injury,or physical or mental impairment.
penal code ann.c vernon.the majority and i part company,however,on whether the statute includes conduct that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of force.this disagreement reflects my second major bone of contention with the the definition of elements of an offense under the enhancement.as the opinion notes,black law dictionary defines an element as a constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed,black law dictionary ed.our court has held that traditionally,an offense was defined by its elements,facts necessary to support a conviction for the offense,united states williams,cir.see,at.the elements of an offense may be viewed generically under a statute language,as the majority does,or they may be considered particularly in light of what the defendant actually did to comprise the offense of conviction.where,as here,a defendant pleads guilty to the particular offense based on explicit factual allegations in the indictment,the distinction made by the majority between the elements of the offense and the manner and means of the offense becomes purely theoretical.further,that distinction does not serve the enhancement purpose of identifying and penalizing more strictly recidivists who engaged in violent crimes.
the majority does concede,helpfully,that if a statute has disjunctive elements or multiple subsections,rather than apply any set of facts to prevent all enhancements,the indictment allegations and jury charge may be used to pare down the statute to the precise subsection that was violated.but taking the next logical step,the court should have acknowledged that when a statute may,by the breadth of its language,irrespective of subparts,be violated in both violent and ways,the indictment and jury instructions may then be used to ascertain whether the underlying offense constituted a crime of violence under the guidelines.in failing to do so,the majority opinion forecloses a sensible and obvious path chosen by other circuits.
c.the application of taylor in other circuits 
the majority reiteration of the any set of facts interpretation of taylor runs counter to the approach adopted by a number of our sister circuits,including the first,fourth,eighth and circuits.each of these courts holds that where a statute may be violated in multiple of which qualify an offense as a crime of violence and some of which do court may properly refer to the indictment and jury instructions 
in coleman,for instance,the fourth circuit considered whether a conviction for assault under maryland law constituted a violent felony requiring enhancement under the armed career criminal act of the court held that where a predicate offense may be committed in one of two ways,one of which requires a finding that physical force was used and the other of which does not,a district court must look past the fact of conviction and the elements of the offense to determine which type of offense supported the defendant conviction.at emphasis added.as a result,the en banc court held that the district court properly relied on the charging papers to determine that coleman act of pointing a handgun at a police officer constituted a violent felony for the purposes of the federal sentencing enhancement.id.at.
relying on coleman and its antecedents,the fourth circuit has also held that the record of conviction,the charging document and the jury instructions may be examined,consistent with taylor,to determine whether a conspiracy conviction is a crime of violence.united states ward,cir.
similarly,in kennedy,the circuit held that the hobbs act is one example of a generic criminal statute whose violation requires a district court to examine the underlying indictment to determine whether the conviction qualifies as a crime of violence or a serious violent felony under federal sentencing law.kennedy,at.the kennedy court held this approach acceptable under taylor where a statute provides for both violent and nonviolent means of violation,id.at emphasis added,and the mere fact of conviction under the hobbs act does not establish whether a defendant was convicted of a violent or nonviolent crime.
under the majority any set of facts approach to the taylor categorical inquiry,the result in conspiracy and hobbs act cases,and those of similar ilk,such as retaliation,would necessarily differ from coleman and kennedy.the majority,unfortunately,demonstrates neither its awareness of the overwhelmingly contrary precedents nor any explanation why it alone understands taylor and the other circuits are wrong.
the majority does express concern that going beyond the statutory elements of a crime,even when the conviction underlying facts are plain and admitted,threatens to swallow the categorical approach in favor of sentencing.i disagree.the first circuit aptly explained that u nder taylor categorical approach,burglary is a crime of violence even if no violence was used in the particular case and conversely,being a is not a crime of violence even if the felon happened to shoot someone but was convicted only under the statute.see united states sacko,cir noting that under taylor categorical approach,the facts of the underlying offense are only relevant to identify the statutory or common law offense of conviction and that collateral facts as to the defendant conduct on the earlier occasion are not relevant for any other purpose.the majority concern is groundless.
conclusion 
in this case,applying a refined categorical approach would require us to hold,as dictates,that an individual who intentionally rams his car into another vehicle containing his children has committed a crime of violence.he pled guilty to the child endangerment offense on facts that proved his intention to threaten or use actual force against his children.while i agree with the result in our en banc decision in,unlike the majority,i would jettison that opinion overly broad any set of facts the majority did not actually apply to decide that case.rather,consistent with taylor and the law of other circuits,we should look to the facts contained in the underlying indictment and jury instructions to apply crime of violence enhancements like that before us.i respectfully dissent.
i respectfully dissent from the position taken by a majority of the judges.my disagreement is in regard not only to the result the majority reaches,but also to the manner in which this court is handling its sentencing guideline jurisprudence.
the majority result is intuitively absurd.it holds that a defendant who intentionally rammed his car into a vehicle that he knew contained his young children was not guilty of a crime of violence.we are,of course,bound by the various definitions and explanations set forth in the applicable statutes and sentencing guidelines,from which we must discern the will of the drafters.congress could,if it wanted to,define an ax murder as not a crime of violence,and we would be bound to adhere to that definition.
here,however,as i will explain,there is an easy path to reaching the correct answer in this case,which is that crime is indeed a crime of violence.there is,admittedly,a colorable argument to the contrary,and judge demoss has ably articulated that explanation for the majority.but that does not justify the fact that the court has even taken this case en banc,when the panel had already carefully reconciled its result with our recent en banc decision in united states,cir en banc,and had issued s supplemental opinion on rehearing setting forth that explanation.
some may view it as silly that a court of appeals takes sentencing guideline cases en banc at all.i do not go that far,for indeed there are times when conflicting caselaw needs to be reconciled.this is not one of them.
the en banc court is not,and should not be,primarily a court of error.the decision to take a case en banc is a prudential one that should be based on a host of factors,including,among others,the importance of an issue,the expenditure of judicial resources,whether the issue creates a problem beyond the confines of the case at hand,and the degree to which the panel result is perceived by some not only as wrong,but as so wrong that it effects a grave injustice or disrupts the court jurisprudence in a significant way.
even if,arguendo,the majority were correct in its result,the case does not satisfy the other criteria for en banc review.by taking this case en banc,the majority has created more questions than it has solved and has muddled our guidelines jurisprudence unnecessarily.given,however,that the case is now presented for decision by the en banc court,and that the majority has reached a demonstrably erroneous result,i will explain the flaws in its reasoning.
as i approach the merits of the case,i first note my agreement with the majority handling of the elements of an offense.the government urges that when recitations of particular violent actions are added to an indictment,the proof of those actions becomes elements of the offense for purposes of enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.such an approach would undermine taylor united states,d as the majority notes,the analysis of the statute would be superfluous under the government theory.the elements of an offense are those enumerated in the statute of conviction,and no others.
i also agree with the majority acceptance of the notion that a court may refer to charging papers to determine of which elements of an offense a defendant was convicted.see taylor,at.united states,cir.the paring down of statutes by reference to the charging papers has been applied by other circuits,including the first seventh eighth tenth and especially the ninth 
i depart from the majority reasoning only at a later point.the statute of conviction provides a person commits an offense if he intentionally by act engages in conduct that places a child younger than years in imminent danger of bodily injury.this sufficiently describes the attempted use of physical force in satisfaction of the relevant crime of violence statute,application note b ii i.in a nutshell,because the child endangerment statute requires that a defendant have intentionally created an imminent danger of bodily injury to another,he intended to use physical force on that person,even if that force was of a subtle and indirect nature the majority is mistaken in concluding otherwise.
the majority states in conclusional fashion,clearly,the statute can be successfully prosecuted without proof of attempted use of force.one can knowingly endanger without trying to make any bodily contact with the victim person and without trying to inflict bodily injury on the person.the majority emphasizes elsewhere that the statute can be violated without an attempt to cause physical contact.
it a matter suitable for debate whether the child endangerment statute may be satisfied without a perpetrator trying to inflict bodily injury on a victim.before addressing that issue,however,i must note that the majority goes too far in its mention of bodily contact.
i accept that it is possible knowingly to endanger a person without trying to make any bodily contact or physical contact with him.for instance,a person body may be imminently endangered by poison left for him to consume,without the poisoner intending to achieve bodily contact with his victim.but i can not credit the suggestion that a perpetrator making bodily contact with a victim is a requirement for the physical use of force,or accordingly that a perpetrator attempt to make bodily contact with a victim is a requirement for the attempted use of physical force.
rather,the use of physical force and attempted use of physical force under the guideline should extend to cover those applications of force that are subtle or indirect,rather than only those embracing bodily contact.this is a matter of common sense.
if a someone lures a poor swimmer into waters with a strong undertow in order that he drown,or tricks a victim into walking toward a high precipice so that he might fall,it is a poor excuse for the perpetrator to say,well,at least i did attempt to use physical force against my victim.i was only trying to kill or maim him to the contrary,the perpetrator has at least attempted to make use of physical force against the person of the target,either through the action of water to cause asphyxiation or by impact of earth on flesh and bone.however remote these forces may be in time or distance from the defendant,they were still directed to work according to his will,as surely as was a swung fist or a fired bullet.
this interpretation also is logical,given the sort of criminal statutes that might be considered crimes of violence.numerous statutes covering crimes that most would naturally think to involve the use or attempted use of force may be satisfied by subtle and indirect force.most would agree,for example,that an intentional battery statute requiring the actual injury of the victim describes the use of physical force.as well,it should be uncontroversial that formulations of assault requiring an intent to injury of a victim should be considered to involve the attempted use of force.
but batteries and assaults punishable under such statutes can involve uses or attempted uses of physical force that are subtle or indirect.for example,a person may be indicted and convicted for texas assault if he intentionally causes bodily injury to another,including the person spouse.penal code ann.a vernon.the bodily injury need not result from a violent physical contact between the defendant and the victims subtle or indirect means would do,whether by tricking a person into consuming poison,or luring him to walk off a cliff.
likewise,the crime of murder in many states may be satisfied by subtle and indirect uses of force.a person may be indicted and convicted for texas murder,for example,if he intentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual.penal code ann.b vernon.again,the defendant need never lay a finger on his victim.though murder is,quite fortunately,enumerated as a crime of violence under the second prong of the relevant violence definition,it would be absurd to believe that murder would not involve the use of physical force.see,application note b ii ii.
additionally,although murder is enumerated as a crime of violence,attempted murder is not.attempted murder may be undertaken by other than attempts to cause bodily or physical contact,yet no court reasonably would hold that attempted murder is a crime that does not involve the attempted use of physical force against the person of another.
accordingly,the majority insistence on bodily contact is serious error.physical forces,whether subtle and indirect,are physical forces nonetheless.
as for the majority holding that one can knowingly create an imminent danger of another physical injury without trying to inflict bodily injury on the person,i disagree.i also take issue with the majority related conclusion creating a risk of injury,even when done knowingly or intentionally,is clearly not the same as using or attempting to use physical force against the person of another.this latter statement might contain some truth,because people may not actually expect those harms that flow from de minimis risks they choose to create,but the majority ignores that the statute of conviction required not simply a risk of injury,but an imminent danger of bodily injury emphasis added.
an attempt is the act or an instance at making an effort to accomplish something black law dictionary ed.thus,for example,an attempted crime is an overt act that is done with the intent to commit a crime.id.an attempted use of physical force,accordingly,is an overt act done with intent to use physical force.the pared down child endangerment offense requires just such an attempt.
it is axiomatic that people intend the likely results of their actions after all,intention is the willingness to bring about something planned or foreseen.id.at.therefore,when a person knowingly undertakes actions in order to create a imminent danger of bodily injury,he also demonstrates a willingness to bring about the foreseeable result of his is,his use of physical force against the person of another to cause bodily injury.
this makes sense.when a person intends to create an imminent danger of injury by such obvious means as ramming his car into someone else,or less direct means such as by luring that person to an ocean undertow or placing deadly poison in his drink,he is actually attempting to control,and thus intentionally use,physical force against that person,whether in the form of collision with a automobile,water suffocating lungs,or cyanide disrupting metabolism.
accordingly,calderon was convicted of a crime of violence as described in.because his statute of conviction required him intentionally to have exposed a person to a physical forces either created by him or made subject to his will,it described the attempted use of physical force against the person of another.
thus,i respectfully dissent.
i write separately because i agree with both the use of force analysis in judge smith dissent and with the interpretation of taylor united states,d in judge jones dissent.i do not agree with the portions of judge jones dissent that indicate that the majority opinion in united states,cir en banc,is correct.for the reasons expressed in my dissent in,i continue to believe that was wrongly decided.see,at garza,dissenting.
motion charged that his prior removal,an element of the illegal reentry conviction that he now appeals,was invalid because the immigration judge both incorrectly determined that his prior offenses were aggravated felonies and failed to inform him of certain avenues of relief.we voted this case en banc to resolve issues related to the application of the sentence enhancement,which was the ground urged in the petition for rehearing.we now reinstate that portion of the panel opinion,united states,cir,that rejected attempt to collaterally attack his prior removal.
the and versions of the guidelines retain this same language,though the definition of crime of violence has been rearranged in ways not relevant to this case.compare cmt.b ii,and cmt.b ii,with cmt.b iii.
the relevant portion of this statutory provision has remained unchanged since the time of conviction.
for example,suppose that an indictment charged a defendant with the crime of disturbing the peace or even the crime of littering and also specified that he committed the crime by throwing a bottle at the victim head.under state law,the prosecution might be required to prove that the defendant indeed engaged in that charged conduct,but throwing a bottle at someone is not an element of the statute or of littering.it is,rather,one manner of violating the statute.
many sentencing provisions lack the as an element language at issue here,and we have permitted broader uses of charging papers in such cases.see,united states,cir allowing for use of the indictment and the underlying charged conduct to determine whether a travel act violation under was a drug trafficking offense that necessitated a enhancement pursuant to b a i.
we do not imply that the meaning of the term element in is determined by the law of any particular state,noting simply that texas is not unusual in its understanding of the elements of an offense.the criminal law has traditionally distinguished between the elements of an offense and the manner and means of committing an offense in a given case.indeed,the guidelines themselves recognize such a distinction.compare a using as an element language,with id.a using the phrase involves conduct.the distinction is also recognized in the commentary to.see id,cmt.defining a crime of violence as an offense that either has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or where the conduct set forth in the count of which the defendant was convicted by its nature,presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
judge jones argues in her dissent that the as an element language permits us to look to the particular facts charged in a case when an offense can be committed in both violent and ways.our court approach,she writes,marks us as an outlier,alone among the courts of appeals.we are compelled to disagree with judge jones assessment of the law of our sister circuits as neither our understanding of the as an element language,nor our reading of taylor is novel.see,united states fulford,cir holding,in a case involvin
