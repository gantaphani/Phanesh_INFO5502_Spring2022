the sole issue in this appeal is whether the government is permitted to provide notice of removal proceedings to an alien using a process sending a notice to appear in which the government states that the date and time of the hearing will be provided at a later time and later sending notice of the hearing with the date and time of the hearing.
talida popa,a native and citizen of romania,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision affirming the immigration judge ij order denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings following a removal hearing in absentia.popa contends she did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing because her notice to appear bore no time and place for the hearing it stated popa would be notified of the time and place in a separate and later writing.that later writing,which did contain the date,time,and place of the hearing,was sent to a post office box she no longer checked.we hold the government is permitted to use the process.we deny popa petition.
factual and procedural background 
on july,popa was lawfully admitted to the united states as an exchange visitor authorized to remain in the until october.after entering the united states,popa married jason san souci,a citizen on april,san souci filed a form petition for alien relative with the bureau of citizenship and immigration services uscis on behalf of popa that same day,popa applied to uscis to become a permanent resident based on the form.popa and san souci lived in nevada and used a mail address box,crystal bay,nevada.
in january,san souci informed popa he had to travel to new jersey to attend a child custody hearing regarding his son from a previous marriage.on january,without informing popa,san souci withdrew the form petition accordingly,on february,uscis denied popa application for status as a permanent resident and sent notice of the denied application to popa nevada box address.the same day,the government issued popa a notice to appear nta charging her with removability for being present in the without a valid,unexpired visa to remain in the and for failing to maintain her exchange visitor status,pursuant to a b and a c i.on february,popa received the notice denying her application for status as a permanent resident and the nta at her box address.
the nta ordered popa to appear before an immigration judge at a t ime and date to be set by the immigration court,and provided popa with the immigration court address.additionally,the nta stated 
you are required to provide the immigration and naturalization service ins,in writing,with your full mailing address and telephone number.you must notify the immigration court immediately by using form whenever you change your address or telephone number during the course of this proceeding.you will be provided with a copy of this form.notices of hearing will be mailed to this address.if you do not submit form and do not otherwise provide an address at which you may be reached during proceedings,then the government shall not be required to provide you with written notice of your hearing.if you fail to attend the hearing at the time and place designated on this notice,or any date and time later directed by the immigration court,a removal order may be made by the immigration judge in your absence,and you may be arrested and detained by the ins.
after popa received the nta,she contacted san souci,who was still in new jersey,and san souci confirmed he withdrew the form petition and was considering reconciling with his popa moved in with her childhood friend,voica matis,who lived in riverbank,california popa did not inform the immigration court of her address change.
on february,the immigration court mailed a hearing notice and a form to popa at the same nevada box address to which the government mailed and at which popa received the nta.the hearing notice stated that popa hearing was scheduled to take place at on march,at usins,corporate,reno,nv.however,popa did not receive this hearing notice because she had moved from nevada to california and had not checked the mail at her nevada box,nor had she terminated her use of the nevada box and arranged for her mail to be forwarded.see.
on march,popa failed to appear at her hearing before the immigration court.the ij issued a decision ordering popa removed in absentia.
in june,popa first met with an attorney to determine her immigration status.at this meeting,popa learned of the march,hearing and the ij decision ordering her removed to romania.on september,popa timely filed a motion to reopen her removal proceeding and to rescind her in absentia removal order with the immigration court,contending she never received notice of her hearing.the ij denied the motion.
popa timely appealed to the bia,which adopted and affirmed the ij decision,and dismissed popa appeal popa timely petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.

iii.discussion 
pursuant to a,an alien in removal proceedings must receive written notice to,in relevant part the requirement that the alien must provide the attorney general immediately with a written record of any change of the alien address or telephone number and the consequences of the failure to do so and the time and place at which the proceedings will be held.a f ii iii,g i.if there is a change in the time and place of such proceedings,the government must provide written notice to the alien of the change and the consequences of the failure to attend such proceedings.id.a a.written notice shall be given in person to the alien,or,if personal service is not practicable through service by mail to the alien.id.a.
pursuant to b a,an alien who,after written notice has been provided to the alien or the alien counsel of record,does not attend a proceeding shall be ordered removed in absentia if the government establishes by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable.written notice is sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided by the alien.id.an order of removal entered in absentia may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice of the removal proceeding.id.b c ii iii a.
a.the notice to appear was not statutorily defective.
popa contends the ij erred by ordering her removed in absentia because she did not receive adequate notice of her removal proceeding.popa contends the nta,received on february,was statutorily defective because it failed to state the time and date of her hearing,and instead stated the hearing would take place at a time and date to be set by the immigration court,in violation of a g i.additionally,popa contends the nta was defective because it failed to notify popa she was required to notify the immigration court of a change in address,in violation of a f ii.
the notice to appear did not violate a g i.
although a g i requires a notice to appear to specify the time and place at which the proceedings will be held,this court has never held that the nta can not state that the time and place of the proceedings will be set at a future time by the immigration court.this court silently has adopted the rule that the time and date of a removal proceeding can be sent after the first notice to appear.
