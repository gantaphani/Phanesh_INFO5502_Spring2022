background 
procedural history 
after his entry into the united states,kay submitted an application for asylum and withholding of removal on december,and the matter was referred to an immigration judge ij in chicago,illinois on march.kay appeared pro se for his first asylum hearing on april.the hearing was rescheduled,due to the ij absence,for july.prior to the rescheduled hearing date,kay relocated from chicago to san francisco,california.on july,the immigration court received a correct change of address notice from kay.upon receiving the change of address notice,the court issued another notice postponing the scheduled july hearing until september,and stating in the notice that the hearing was to take place in chicago.kay,under the mistaken belief that changing his address with the court would change the venue of his asylum hearing,failed to appear in chicago on september causing the ij to deny his petition for asylum in absentia and order him removable 
on september,after receiving the in absentia order of removal,kay retained bruce fodiman as counsel.counsel filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings on october,which the ij denied on december.the ij found that kay received proper notice of the hearing and that kay erroneous belief that a change of address notice would change the location of his asylum did not constitute exceptional circumstances sufficient to reopen the proceedings.b c.kay appealed the ij decision to the bia on january.
on november,during the pendency of kay appeal of the ij denial of his motion to reopen,counsel filed a separate motion with the bia,identifying the pleading as a motion to remand,as opposed to correctly labeling it a motion to reopen,seeking protection under cat.in support of this motion,counsel attached a copy of one page of kay form asylum application as well as the state department country report on burma.on july,the bia denied both of kay motions,upholding the ij december,denial of kay original motion to reopen and finding his november,motion for relief under cat untimely.as to kay original motion to reopen,the bia agreed with the ij that kay had failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances because he was given fair notice of the hearing time and location and his failure to appear was not due to circumstances beyond his control.concerning kay cat motion,the board found that in order to seek protection under cat,pursuant to a,kay was required to file his cat motion to reopen prior to june,as he was under a final order of removal that became final prior to march.b.
after retaining new counsel,rhoda wilkinson domingo appellate counsel,kay filed a third motion to reopen on october,arguing that former counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file the cat motion in a timely manner.in support of the october motion,appellate counsel submitted a complaint to the california state bar concerning former counsel a letter to former counsel detailing kay submission to the california bar a copy of the agreement between kay and attorney fodiman the bia july,decision and a psychological assessment of kay conducted by elizabeth schenk as well as her curriculum vitae.the psychological assessment by schenk diagnosed kay with post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and contained a detailed account of kay experiences in burma.at in response to appellate counsel ineffective assistance allegations,former counsel responded that he labeled the cat motion a motion to remand and failed to file the cat motion prior to june,because it was his understanding that it was the longstanding policy of the board to not subject motions to remand in a pending direct appeal of a case,such as kay,to the time restrictions imposed on motions to reopen.at on march,in a per curiam unpublished order,the bia denied kay october motion stating 
we need not determine whether the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel,however,because,in our judgment,the documentation submitted by the respondent falls short of making a prima facie showing that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he were to return to burma.although the country condition material in the record confirms some instances of brutality by the military in burma,it has not been prima facie established that it is more likely than not that respondent will be subject to such treatment.accordingly,the motion is denied.
internal citations omitted.under b,an applicant must petition for review in this court within days of the final order of removal.the board entered its first order of removal on july,and kay filed his first petition for review in this court on august.the board entered its second order on march,and kay filed his second petition for review on april.therefore,both appeals were timely.on april,we consolidated review of the petitioner two appeals of the bia july,order and march,order.
basis for relief 
seeking asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat,kay argues that he will be subjected to persecution and torture at the hands of the burmese government if returned to his native country.the burmese government has a long history of violating human rights,suppressing political speech,and persecuting ethnic and religious minorities.see bureau of democracy,human rights,and labor,united states department of state,burma,country reports on human rights practices march,http last viewed october,burma country report.the burma country report indicates that burma is still ruled by a military junta which has been reported to kill,rape,and place its citizens in forced labor camps,as well as torture and beat political detainees suspected of espousing ideologies.see lwin ins,cir addressing burma authoritarian military regime and its past brutality against student protesters.
during his childhood,kay alleges that his father was an active member and sergeant in the kachin independence association kia,a political opposition group to the burmese government.though kay was not an active member of kia,its members frequently visited his home.he recalls that as a child his father was tortured and his brother killed by government soldiers.he also claims that while attending classes at hlaing college in rangoon,he became involved in student rallies and demonstrations to raise consciousness about the burmese government human rights violations.he states that he was arrested twice by burmese military officials in rangoon.on the first occasion,december,in shwe dagon pagoda,he was arrested after a student protest and detained for several hours.he was subsequently released but went into hiding in kun gyan gon.on the second occasion,he claims he was held by burmese military men for two weeks and beaten severely.according to schenk,he still carries scars on several parts of his body where the soldiers beat him.at.after this incident his family arranged for him to flee burma and seek asylum in the united states 
kay attached the following evidence to his form several newspaper articles which corroborate his account of the atrocities committed by the burmese military a hlaing college registrar form stating that kay was a third year student at the university from to a letter from the pan kachin development society in california stating that kay,as a member of the kachin ethnic minority,faces imminent danger if returned to burma and a united states war department release attesting to the bravery of the kachin rangers in world war ii and discussing their extensive combat training.at.of particular note,kay attached several articles concerning the december,student protests in rangoon.the first article,dated december,from the pacific daily news,entitled burma riot police disperse student protest,states that over heavily armed guards were responsible for breaking up a student protest in the city of rangoon.another article,dated december,from the same newspaper,entitled,students defy burma military,stage protest,stated that over students were detained after the december protest against oppression.kay also attached three other articles which addressed the scope and brutality of the government reaction to the student protests.id.
ii.analysis 
motion to reopen for asylum or withholding of removal 
we first turn to kay motion to reopen for consideration of his asylum and withholding of removal eligibility.under the immigration and nationality act ina,an in absentia deportation order may be rescinded if the applicant files a motion to reopen within days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances as defined in subsection e.b c if an applicant is not alleging exceptional circumstances or a lack of notice for his failure to appear,he must file his motion to reopen within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.id.at c c i c ii.subsection e defines exceptional circumstances as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse,child,or parent of the alien,but not including less compelling circumstances beyond the control of the alien.e internal parentheses omitted.
we review the denial of a motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia for abuse of discretion,nazarova ins,cir ursachi ins,cir,and may only examine the validity of the notice afforded kay,his stated reasons for failing to appear,and whether removability has been established,b d.kay proffer to this court that he suffered from ptsd,understood little english,was pro se,and notified the court of his change of address does not support a finding of exceptional circumstances.kay fails to explain how his ptsd prevented him from attending the september hearing.see ursachi,at finding that illness must be documented and give details sufficient to excuse alien absence.nor does kay argue that he failed to receive or apprehend the notice afforded him.see nazarova,at immigration court may provide notice in english only.kay pro se status,while significant,is alone insufficient to excuse his absence because he does not dispute that he received notice.finally,kay ignorance of the law,his mistaken belief that a change of address notice would serve to change the venue of his hearing,also does not amount to an exceptional circumstance.see b stating an applicant must file a motion to change venue with the immigration court.the immigration court,upon receiving his change of address notice,delayed his hearing but clearly stated it would be held in chicago.therefore,we can not find that the bia abused its discretion by denying kay motion to reopen the proceedings for a determination of his asylum or withholding of removal eligibility.
timeliness of motion to reopen for a determination of cat eligibility 
while we conclude that kay was not entitled to recision of his in absentia order to consider his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal,his motion to reopen for a determination of his cat eligibility is a separate matter we find that the bia incorrectly deemed kay cat motion untimely and failed to provide a reasoned basis for its denial on the merits.
as it relates to the timeliness of kay november,motion to reopen,this case presents the question when does an in absentia order of removal become final for the purposes of determining the deadline for an application to reopen proceedings under cat according to its regulations 
an alien under a final order of deportation,exclusion,or removal that became final prior to march,may move to reopen proceedings for the sole purpose of seeking protection under c.such motions shall be governed by and of this chapter the motion to reopen shall not be granted unless i t he motion is filed within sic june,and ii t he evidence sought to be offered establishes a prima facie case that the applicant removal must be withheld or deferred under c or a.
b emphasis added.however,a n alien who is in exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings on or after march,may apply for withholding of removal under c,and,if applicable,may be considered for deferral of removal under a.id.b.
generally,an agency interpretation of its regulations is entitled to due deference however,when the agency interpretation contravenes the plain language of the regulation,congressional intent trumps.zheng ashcroft,cir citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.we recognize that the ij september,in absentia order was a final order of removal however,once kay filed a timely motion to reopen,under the plain language of the cat regulations,his deportation order did not become final until that motion to reopen was denied by the bia on july.in its july,order,the bia summarily concluded,without analysis,that the in absentia order of removal became final september,the same day it was entered.while we acknowledge that motions to reopen are generally disfavored and aliens who fail to appear for hearings are to be rebuked,for the reasons stated below,we find that kay was not subject to the june,cat filing deadline as he was in deportation proceedings after march.
first,in the context of an in absentia order,the only way to appeal the removal order is to file a motion to reopen the proceedings.b c.the plain language of the cat regulations contemplate that the appeals process affects the timeliness determination by drawing a distinction between the time an order is final and when it becomes final.b.further,this court has held that a motion to reopen is part and parcel of the underlying removal proceeding.nwaokolo ashcroft,cir per curiam.therefore,like a merits determination,such as a denial of asylum relief,we find that an in absentia order of removal becomes final when the board renders its decision in a case on appeal or certification or,where no appeal is taken,when the time allotted for appeal has expired or the right to appeal is waived.in re,bia en banc.
moreover,upon the filing of a motion to reopen after an in absentia removal order has been entered,an applicant removal is automatically stayed,b v,in order to allow the board to conduct an independent review of the order,in re cecilia,bia applying reasoning to the version of the united states code which is not materially different from current version.once a deportation order is stayed,the immigration court is prevented from executing an alien deportation.in re,bia a b if the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of removal of the alien,the board period to effectuate removal does not begin to run until the court final order is entered.we also note that kay could not have appealed the entry of the september,in absentia order directly to this court without first exhausting his administrative remedies and appealing the ij decision to the bia through a motion to reopen.see wijeratne ins,cir finding that bia decision denying motion to reopen is a final order.
finally,cat relief is treated as a separate avenue for relief.an applicant may file a second motion to reopen for cat relief without showing that the information presented was previously unavailable.b.given the board distinct treatment of the review of in absentia orders coupled with the nature of determining cat relief,we find that the september,order of removal did not become final until the appeals process was terminated with the bia denial of kay appeal of his motion to reopen on july.therefore,kay was not required to meet the june,deadline 
even if we were to find that kay was subject to the june,filing deadline,we would still be permitted to review the board substantive decision denying kay cat relief.in its march,order,the board considered and denied kay october,motion to reopen for consideration of his cat eligibility on the merits.the board could have decided the issue of kay cat entitlement as an element of the ineffective assistance of counsel determination,finding that he was not prejudiced by the error and addressing his compliance with the requirements of in re lozada,bia requiring an applicant to file an affidavit explaining the agreement between the applicant and former counsel and listing what actions counsel failed to take grant former counsel an opportunity to respond and indicate whether former counsel error was reported to disciplinary authorities.however,the board deemed the ineffective assistance of counsel issue moot and stated that the documentation submitted by kay failed to establish a prima facie case for eligibility under cat.as the board dismissed kay motion on the merits,we have jurisdiction to review its substantive determination.see ins,cir because the board did not consider the argument waived and addressed its merits,we have jurisdiction to review the board resolution of that issue.we now turn to kay motion for relief under cat.
eligibility under cat 
to qualify for withholding or deferral of removal under cat,an applicant must prove that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.under a,torture is defined as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
an ij reviews the following factors when making this determination evidence of past torture of the alien whether the alien is able to relocate to another part of the country where torture is not likely evidence of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal and other relevant information.id.c i iv.an applicant may meet this standard without corroborative evidence.id.c.upon meeting the standard,relief must be granted.id.a.
generally,the board may deny an applicant motion to reopen if he fails to comport with regulatory requirements or fails to establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought.in re,bia.in addition,where the underlying relief sought is itself discretionary,the board may deny the motion on that ground alone.id.we review this determination for abuse of discretion.mansour ins,cir.the bia decision to deny a motion to reopen will be upheld unless it was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.id.at.a motion to reopen under cat,however,is distinct from an asylum claim and deserves independent substantive consideration.id.
according to the board,when 
ruling on a motion to reopen requires the exercise of judgment regarding eligibility for the relief sought,the board historically has not required a conclusive showing that,assuming the facts alleged to be true,eligibility for relief has been established.rather,we have been willing to reopen where the new facts alleged,when coupled with the facts already of record,satisfy us that it would be worthwhile to develop the issues further at a plenary hearing on reopening.
in re,at internal quotation omitted.and when an applicant is asking that her case be reopened so that she may apply for a form of relief which was unavailable to her and has not had an opportunity to present her application before the immigration judge,the board will look to whether the alien has proffered sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits in re,at.
we find that the bia decision to deny kay relief under cat was made without a rational explanation.see mansour,at see also awe ashcroft,cir affirming in dicta reasoning of mansour that bia is required to issue opinions with rational explanations and adequate analysis of the record.in the first instance,on july,kay motion was denied without review as it was deemed untimely,while in the second instance,the terse march,order leaves this court unable to review the bia factual or legal analysis.
the bia summarily states that the country condition material in the record confirms some instances of brutality by the military in burma.this sentence albeit an understatement of the human rights situation in burma clearly supports kay position.directly following this statement,however,the board regurgitates the legal standard for protection under cat with no analysis or explanation and then summarily denies kay motion for relief.it is unclear to this court what evidence the board reviewed or even considered in coming to its conclusion.see mansour,at vacating and remanding for further proceedings when bia failed to address united states state department report concerning country conditions because bia is required to consider the issues raised,and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.chowdhury ashcroft,cir noting that it is the duty of the court of appeals to ensure that the board legal interpretations stay within the boundaries permitted to it and that it has not unreasonably failed to consider relevant factual information.
moreover,our inability to decipher whether the bia had a reasoned basis for its decision to deny kay relief is further underscored by its citation to in re,bia finding no protection under cat for haitian,jamaican,and dominican applicants convicted of felony crimes because applicants failed to show governmental connection to any possible torture upon removal to native country,in re,bia same rationale for columbian applicant,and in re,bia finding no torture under cat based upon potential indefinite detention of felon deportee to haiti,which are factually distinguishable from the case at bar.the board provides no explanation or discussion concerning the applicability of these cases to the disposition of kay cat claim.we fail to see how the first two cases,which highlight the need for government involvement or inaction as an element for relief under cat,impact disposition of kay application.after all,kay alleged direct government involvement.nor is the board citation to in re,as that case bases its denial of relief on the applicant lack of personal past persecution and kay alleged such past persecution.see guchshenkov ashcroft,cir vacating orders of removal and remanding for further proceedings finding ij and bia decisions unreasoned,incomplete,and lacking in analysis listing cases bace ashcroft,cir vacating order of removal and remanding for further proceedings on asylum eligibility where ij failed to make a credibility or past persecution determination azanor ashcroft,cir remanding for determination of motion to reopen for cat relief where board tersely stated,with no analysis,that applicant failed to establish prima facie case.
most importantly,it is also difficult to see how kay allegations and supporting evidence do not establish prima facie eligibility under cat.first,kay asylum application alleges that he personally suffered past persecution and may suffer future persecution at the hands of the burmese government due to his political activities and family affiliations.he alleges personal prior detention and physical abuse at the hands of the burmese military as well as physical abuse and even murder of his family members.pelinkovic ashcroft,cir affirming bia denial of a motion to reopen application for protection under cat when applicant failed to provide a particularized showing that he or his
