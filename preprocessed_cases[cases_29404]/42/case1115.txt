in this case,we again examine how the presumption against retroactive legislation,a principle rooted in e lementary considerations of fairness,landgraf usi film,d,applies in the context of immigration law.the government appeals from a judgment of the district court weinstein,granting an alien petition for a writ of habeas corpus upon finding that the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act elimination of section c discretionary relief was impermissibly retroactive as applied to him.we hold that the district court rationale for this conclusion was erroneous,but that there is an alternative basis for finding impermissible retroactivity that may apply in this case.we therefore vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
petitioner nevio restrepo petitioner,a colombian national,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in,after a jury trial in federal court,he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of,and he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on october,the immigration and naturalization service ins served petitioner with an order to show cause,charging him with deportability as an aggravated felon under the provision of section a a iii of the immigration and nationality act codified at a a iii.this charging document was filed with the immigration court on november.
at his hearing before an immigration judge ij,petitioner,through counsel,conceded deportability.the ij held that petitioner was ineligible for any form of relief and entered a deportation order on september.petitioner appealed,and the board of immigration appeals bia dismissed the appeal,holding that petitioner aggravated felony conviction rendered him ineligible for c relief under section d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,and that this was so despite the fact that petitioner was convicted prior to the enactment of the aedpa 
petitioner then filed a habeas petition pursuant to in the united district court for the eastern district of new york,arguing that,under landgraf usi film,d,the aedpa section d may not be applied retroactively to his criminal act and conviction,and that section d violates equal protection principles by barring deportable aliens,but not excludable aliens,from applying for c relief.
in a september,order,the district court weinstein,held that section d may not be applied retroactively to petitioner,a conclusion it reached on the basis of its prior rulings.see maria mcelroy,wl august,superseded by d,weinstein,holding that congress did not intend for section d to be applied retroactively and that,even if congress intent were ambiguous,application of section d to an alien criminal conduct would have an impermissible retroactive effect under the second step of landgraf retroactivity analysis pottinger reno,d weinstein,same finding it unnecessary to rule on petitioner equal protection claim,the district court granted the writ,thereby vacating the petitioner final order of deportation and directing the ins to adjudicate petitioner application for c relief.the government appealed.
discussion 
we agree with the government that the specific ground upon which the district court granted habeas has been fatally undermined by our subsequent caselaw analyzing the aedpa retroactive reach under landgraf.under landgraf,a court determines whether a civil statute applies retroactively by first assessing whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach,id.at.if it has,the inquiry is over and the court must implement congress intent.but if congress intent is ambiguous,a court must proceed to the second question,which is whether,in view of the familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations,id.at,the application of the statute to the case at hand would have a retroactive effect,id.at.if it would,then the court will adhere to the traditional presumption that congress did not intend the statute to apply.id.at.
in cyr i,after determining that congress intent on the retroactivity of the aedpa section d was ambiguous,we held that the elimination of c eligibility with respect to aliens who pled guilty to criminal charges before the enactment of the aedpa would have an impermissible retroactive effect.cyr ins,cir cyr i,aff ins cyr,d cyr ii in cyr i,we rejected,though only in dicta,the position that the district court appears to have adopted in the instant the application of section d to such an alien is retroactive because it would attach a new consequence to the alien criminal conduct.we stated that i t would border on the absurd to argue that these aliens might have decided not to commit drug crimes,or might have resisted conviction more vigorously,had they known that if they were not only imprisoned but also,when their prison term ended,ordered deported,they could not ask for a discretionary waiver of deportation.id.at citing greene,cir.
in domond ins,cir,we adopted this dicta as a holding and ruled that section d could properly be applied to an alien whose criminal conduct preceded,but whose guilty plea came after,the enactment of the aedpa.id.at i t can not reasonably be argued that aliens committed crimes in reliance on a hearing that might possibly waive their deportation.and recently,in khan ashcroft,cir,we held that domond holding survives the supreme court reasoning in cyr ii,d.
in the instant case,the district court based its grant of habeas on its prior decision in maria mcelroy,wl,which broadly held that section d could not be applied to an alien whose criminal conduct preceded the aedpa enactment,since doing so would attach a new liability to a past act.given domond,it is clear that this ground is contrary to current precedent,and can not stand.
accordingly,the government argues that we should simply reverse the district court judgment and hold that petitioner is not eligible to seek c relief.we disagree.on appeal,petitioner contends that section d may not be applied retroactively to him for another reason,a reason that the district court had no occasion to address given the broad rationale upon which it disposed of the case.specifically,petitioner claims that,when he was convicted in,ins regulations permitted him to file an application for c relief affirmatively,that is,before being placed in deportation proceedings.see b providing that a c application may be filed prior to,at the time of,or at any time after the applicant departure from or arrival into the united states petitioner goes on to say that he decided to forgo this opportunity in reliance on his ability to apply for c relief at a later time,when,presumably,his c case would be stronger due to a longer record of rehabilitation and community ties,and that the aedpa elimination of that relief would disrupt his reasonable reliance and settled expectations 
the crux of petitioner argument is correct under both the supreme court and our retroactivity jurisprudence.we believe,however,that,on remand,the district court will have to make further inquiries in order to determine whether petitioner may himself claim the benefit of his argument.
in determining whether a statute has a retroactive effect under the second step of landgraf,a court must make a commonsense,functional judgment,martin hadix,d,guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted essentially,petitioner argues that he gave up something of value the opportunity to apply for c relief immediately after his conviction in reliance on his ability to apply for c relief at a later time.when,moreover,one considers the factors that an immigration judge weighs in making a c determination,it becomes perfectly understandable why some aliens convicted of a deportable crime might choose to wait to apply for c relief,but would only do so if they believed that c relief would remain available later.
in evaluating a c application,an immigration judge must balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf.lovell ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.favorable considerations include the duration of the alien residence in the country,his history of employment,the existence of property or business ties,evidence of service to the community,and proof of genuine rehabilitation if the alien has a criminal record.see matter of edwards,bia citing matter of marin,i n,bia.adverse considerations,of course,include the nature,recency,and seriousness of an alien criminal record.id.thus,an alien convicted of a deportable crime would be motivated to wait as long as possible to file a c application in the hope that he could build a better case for that shows longer residence in the united states,deeper community ties,and,perhaps most significantly,stronger proof of rehabilitation.
indeed,the bia itself recognized this commonsense point in matter of gordon,bia.in that case,the district director had sent letters to convicted aliens informing them that they might be deportable and inviting them to make an advance application for c relief without first being put into deportation proceedings.an alien applied,and the ins rejected her application because of her failure,among other things,to show rehabilitation.on appeal,the bia set aside this determination,holding that the director had unfairly induced the application and observing that c onfined aliens and those who have recently committed criminal acts will have a more difficult task in showing that discretionary relief should be exercised in their behalf than aliens who have committed the same offenses in the more distant past.common sense and prudence suggest that a recently convicted alien should prefer to let a considerable time elapse before offering to demonstrate rehabilitation.id.at.
it can not therefore be doubted that an alien such as petitioner might well decide to forgo the immediate filing of a c application based on the considered and reasonable expectation that he would be permitted to file a stronger application for c relief at a later time it seems equally clear that the aedpa undermining of this settled expectation represents a prototypical case of retroactivity.just like the aliens in cyr,who sacrificed something of right to a jury trial,at which they could obtain outright the expectation that their guilty pleas would leave them eligible for c relief an alien like petitioner also sacrificed shot at obtaining c relief by immediately filing an order to increase his chances of obtaining such relief later on.such an alien conformed his or her conduct according to the availability of relief,cyr i,at,and therefore had settled expectations that would be severely upset,were the aedpa to be applied retroactively 
while we do not doubt that congress has the power,within constitutional limits to create a statute that works such a disruption of settled expectations,landgraf,cyr ii,and longstanding practice require us to presume that congress did not mean to do so,at least in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.see,cyr ii,at.requiring clear intent assures that congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.id.internal quotation marks omitted.and vigilant adherence to our presumption against retroactivity would seem particularly important in the context presented here,given both the gravity of the consequences at stake,see,delgadillo carmichael.deportation can be the equivalent of banishment or exile.the stakes are indeed high and momentous for the alien who has acquired his residence here.citation omitted and the status of the group affected,see cyr ii,at.noting that one of the reasons that retroactive legislation raises special concerns is that a legislature may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals internal quotation marks omitted.
the government argues,however,that our recent decision in rankine reno,cir,controls this case.in rankine,we held that the iirira elimination of c relief was applicable to aliens who were convicted by jury trial.while it is true that petitioner,like the aliens in rankine,was convicted after a trial,the government is mistaken in asserting that t he rankine court considered a retroactivity claim identical to that raised by the petitioner in the case at bar.rankine resolved the narrower question of whether an alien detrimentally relied on the continued availability of c relief in deciding to go to trial rather than accepting a plea.petitioner,by contrast,raises a separate and distinct reliance claim that rankine did not have occasion to address since it arose outside the plea bargaining context.
we have no argument with rankine reasoning or conclusion.indeed,rankine underlying rationale suggests that the aedpa may be impermissibly retroactive as applied to petitioner.in discussing cyr ii,rankine explained that it is choosing to forgo fighting the conviction of a qualifying crime and enter a plea that leads to an expectation of relief from removal.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the rankine petitioners,by contrast,assumed no similarly heightened expectation from their decision to go to trial.id.rankine also found that none of these petitioners detrimentally changed his position in reliance on continued eligibility for c relief,id.at,and that the petitioners have pointed to no conduct on their part that reflects an intention to preserve their eligibility for relief under c by going to trial,id.at.the court concluded that the lack of detrimental reliance on c by those aliens who chose to go to trial puts them on a different footing than aliens like cyr.id.at.see also swaby ashcroft,cir.
the grounds upon which rankine distinguished its petitioners from those in cyr serve equally well to distinguish aliens in petitioner situation from those in rankine.as in cyr,aliens like petitioner incurred a heightened expectation of prospective relief flowing from their choice to forgo filing an affirmative application in the hope of building a stronger record and filing at a later date.furthermore,while aliens who elected a jury trial can not plausibly claim that they would have acted any differently if they had known about aedpa,rankine,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted,it is certainly plausible that aliens who decided to forgo affirmatively filing a c application would have acted differently if they had foreseen the aedpa enactment.many might well have chosen affirmatively to file the weaker,but still valid,application.to the extent that aliens like petitioner detrimentally adapted their positions in reliance of their expectation of continued eligibility for c relief,the factors considered in rankine appear to weigh against proscribing such relief retroactively.
the government asserts that such an alien does not show the quid pro quo type of reliance that was critical to the decision in cyr.while it is true that in cyr ii the supreme court discussed the quid pro quo nature of an alien guilty plea,see cyr ii,at.in exchange for some perceived benefit,defendants waive several of their constitutional rights including the right to a trial and grant the government numerous tangible benefits,such as promptly imposed punishment without the expenditure of prosecutorial resources.internal quotation marks omitted,the court never suggested that all parties who claim that a statute has a retroactive effect must show the disruption of a quid pro quo exchange.and it would be out of keeping with the reasoning of cyr ii to read such a quid pro quo requirement into that opinion.for in cyr ii,the court observed that categorical arguments are not particularly helpful in undertaking landgraf commonsense,functional retroactivity analysis,st cyr.ii,at,and cited its decision in martin,at,which warned against a reliance on labels in determining the retroactivity of a statute.what is more,the court has on other occasions,such as in landgraf itself and in hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d,found impermissible retroactivity in the absence of a disrupted bargain 
cyr ii discussion of quid pro quo is a powerful explanation of how the familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations applied in the particular factual setting presented in that case.and while that discussion must serve as one important guidepost in our essentially analogical task of judging,we can not let it prevent us from applying our sound instinct s,landgraf,at.alteration in original,to litigants in different factual situations who conformed their conduct and expectations to the law 
having concluded that petitioner retroactivity argument is valid we remand this case to the district court for it to determine whether petitioner can himself claim the benefit of this argument.we do so because we deem it wise to let the district court decide,in the first instance,whether an alien such as petitioner must make an individualized showing that he decided to forgo an opportunity to file for c relief in reliance on his ability to file at a later date and,if he must,whether petitioner can do so,or whether,instead,a categorical presumption of reliance by any alien who might have applied for c relief when it was available,but did not do so,is more appropriate.
before the supreme court decided cyr ii,some courts of appeal had asked whether a particular alien who pled guilty showed actual and reasonable reliance on the availability of c relief.see,mattis reno,cir suggesting in dicta that,because the court was announcing a new rule,the district court might remand to the bia for a determination of the alien actual reliance,but not deciding the issue because there was little reason to think that the alien had a colorable claim of actual and reasonable reliance ins,cir stating that impermissible retroactivity may be established by a specific factual showing that a plea was entered in reliance on the availability of c relief and remanding to the district court to determine whether the aedpa applied to the alien.
in cyr ii,instead,the supreme court took a categorical approach.it recognized that,as a general matter,alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.at.see id.at.citing evidence that aliens are routinely advised by counsel of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty.and,as a result,it did not require any specific showing that cyr had,himself,based his guilty plea on any particular expectations concerning c relief.
we have not had briefs or oral arguments on whether the approach taken by the supreme court in cyr ii or a more individualized one is appropriate in the circumstances before us.the interest of judicial would remedy that absence by simply asking the parties to submit briefs to us on the question.but given the distinct possibility that the choice between categorical and individualized approaches may turn,at least in part,on facts that the district court is much better placed to evaluate than we are,we deem it prudent to remand the issue to that court for its learned consideration.
conclusion 
we have determined that the basis of the district court issuance of the writ is invalid,but that the application of the aedpa to petitioner may be impermissibly retroactive on a different rationale.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
while not needed to decide this case,i think that an explanation of the current state of the law in this complicated area,and how it relates to the case before us,may be useful.accordingly,and with that end in mind,i write a few pages separately.
in cyr i,this court did three things.see cyr ins,cir.
first,we held that aliens who pled guilty to certain deportable offenses at a time when they were eligible for c relief remained eligible even after the aedpa and the iirira eliminated such relief.id.at.we did this,not because we could say that congress clearly meant these laws to apply only prospectively,but because landgraf presumption against retroactivity required such an interpretation.see landgraf usi film,d.we found landgraf presumption to apply because we concluded that a significant number of aliens who pled guilty did so in the reasonable expectation that c relief would remain a possibility despite their conviction.cyr i,at.
second,in dicta,we rejected the notion that aliens who committed a crime when c relief was available would continue to be eligible for that relief even after the aedpa and the iirira had abolished it.id.at.that is,a we stated that any reliance,in committing a crime,on the availability of c relief was not the kind of reliance that triggered landgraf presumption against retroactivity,and b we implied that other considerations mentioned in landgraf like notice were not sufficiently implicated in the context of such criminal conduct to give rise to a landgraf presumption.
third,we suggested in our we did not yet an alien decision to go to trial did not give rise to landgraf reliance and expectation interests.id.at.
the latter two sets of dicta became the law of the circuit following our holdings in domond ins,cir as we noted in cyr,i t would border on the absurd to argue that domond would have decided not to commit a crime if he had known that he not only could be imprisoned,but also could face deportation without the availability of a discretionary waiver of deportation.citing cyr i,at,and rankine reno,cir we can not ignore the strong signals sent in the cyr decisions that aliens who chose to go to trial are in a different position with respect to iirira than aliens like cyr who chose to plead guilty.
in cyr ii,the supreme court agreed with our holding in cyr i,and,like us,did so on the basis of the expectations that many aliens,reasonably,may have had when they pled guilty at a time when c relief was available.see ins cyr,d.the high court did not address our dicta which in domond became a holding rejecting the landgraf presumption as to aliens who claimed that they relied on c relief when they committed their offenses.the court also did not speak to the question which our court later answered in the negative of whether those aliens who opted to go to trial when c relief was available could claim that they made this decision in reliance on the availability of c relief.
despite the supreme court lack of consideration of whether criminal conduct implicated landgraf presumption,aliens were quick to claim that cyr ii had overturned this court decision in domond.but these contentions were readily rejected in khan ashcroft,cir.similarly,aliens urged us to extend the supreme court holding in cyr ii to cover aliens who decided to go to trial,because,they argued,such aliens also had an expectation that c relief would be available to them if they were convicted.but,following the strong signals given by cyr i and cyr ii,we held in rankine reno that,unlike aliens who decided to plead guilty,aliens who went to trial assumed no similarly heightened expectation of eligibility for c relief from that decision.at.aliens who elected to go to trial,we reasoned,can not plausibly claim that they would have acted any differently if they had known about aedpa,id.at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
the amici in rankine criminal defense lawyers advanced a more subtle reliance argument.they suggested that,had lawyers like them known that,under cyr i and cyr ii,relief would continue to be a possibility following a guilty plea,and not remain available to those who chose to go to trial,they would have advised their clients to plead guilty.hence,the argument continued,aliens who opted for trial were unfairly made subject to a retroactive change.id.at amici claim that,as criminal defense lawyers,they would have counseled aliens like rankine and lawrence to seek pleas that preserved the possibility of c waiver if they had known the true immigration iirira and the decision to go to trial.this second order retroactivity argument,which has nothing in common with the argument that the case before us poses,is also quite different from any ordinary argument under landgraf and its progeny,which are grounded in presumed congressional intent.in any event,this more complicated claim was also rejected by rankine.id.at.
in all of these cases,the critical question was whether the application of the aedpa and the iirira elimination of c relief to certain conduct would disrupt an alien reasonable reliance,settled expectations,or interest in fair notice.if it would,then such an application would be deemed to have an impermissible retroactive effect,cyr ii,at,thus triggering landgraf presumption against retroactivity.one can summarize how this circuit has applied this framework as follows 
a an alien commission of a crime at a time when c relief was available does not give rise to the kind of reliance,expectation,and notice interests protected by landgraf,so landgraf presumption against retroactivity does not apply.thus,there is no impediment to applying congress elimination of c relief to this type of conduct and this is so despite the fact that,were alteration of deportation rules a matter of criminal law,such a change would probably be barred by the ex post facto clause,see,warden,lewisburg penitentiary marrero,d 
b an alien decision to go to trial at a time when c relief was available does not trigger landgraf presumption against retroactivity.thus,congress elimination of c relief can be applied retroactively to such an alien,and this is so even if congress elimination is read by the courts as not applying to those who pled guilty 
c an alien decision to plead guilty to a deportable crime,at a time when c relief was available for those convicted of that crime,does give rise to reliance,expectation,and notice interests under landgraf.therefore,we will presume that congress intended its subsequent abolition of c relief not to apply to those who so pled.
as to the supreme court,only c has been ruled on,and a and b remain technically open questions.with respect to b,there is,to date,no indication whatever that the supreme court would view the issue either in its simple or more subtle form differently from our circuit.as to a,it could be argued that the high court recent preoccupation with constitutional restrictions on civil penalties in other areas,see,state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d dealing with the substantive and procedural due process limitations that apply to punitive damage awards,together with its past comments on the severity of deportation,see,jordan de george.applying the doctrine to a deportation statute because,though not a criminal statute,the statute imposed a drastic measure,which is at times the equivalent of banishment or exile quoting fong haw tan phelan,might make the question a live one.but that would at most be speculation.
none of the prior decisions,by our court or the supreme court,deal with the issue before us today,though they do speak indirectly to one aspect of it whether the rule we uphold today should be applied categorically or only after a examination of the existence of reliance.as a general matter,both the supreme court and our circuit have seemed to favor the categorical approach.thus,as to those aliens who pled guilty when c relief was available for their crimes,the supreme court clearly barred retroactive abolition without requiring individualized allegations of reliance or expectations similarly,if conversely,in swaby ashcroft,cir,we declined to bar retroactive abolition as to aliens who opted to go to trial,after expressly assuming arguendo that the individual alien had relied on the existence of c relief when he declined to accept a guilty plea and instead chose to fight at trial that is,we also adopted a categorical rule as governing situations where interests seem generally unlikely or inapplicable.
the preference for categorical rules seems to me to have two possible bases.first,what is involved in cases is the presumption or not of congressional intent as to the temporal reach of the law,given how the hypothetical retroactive application of the law would affect familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.landgraf,at.given this focus on congressional intent,it is not surprising to find courts guided by the frequency with which the statute retroactive applications would violate settled expectations.for it seems less likely that congress would give a general statute a different effective date case by case as a result,if in many cases those who pled guilty did so relying at least in part on the existence of c relief,the statute should be interpreted to be prospective only,even if such a reading may advantage some who did not so rely.this is the result of cyr i and cyr ii.similarly,if in a certain category of cases aliens were not guided in their choices by the expectation that c relief would remain available,then,even though a particular alien asserts that he was,the statute might well still be read to abolish that relief retroactively.and this is precisely what we held in swaby.
the second,perhaps less principled,rationale for categorical rules is based on convenience.the cost of teasing out individualized expectations,and the possibility of doing so,are great enough so as to make the game not worth the candle.thus,apart from the question of likely congressional intent,a categorical approach might well be preferred strictly as a matter of judicial economy.
the supreme court did not say why it opted for a categorical approach in cyr ii,and neither did our court in cyr i and swaby.and as far as the instant case is concerned,it does not necessarily matter,because the preference for a categorical approach on either ground need not be absolute.that is,if there are a fair number of cases in which settled expectations,are violated by retroactive abolition of c relief,and a fair number in which they would not,it is possible to presume a congressional intent that involves only partial retroactivity.such a reading is not common,but it is not necessarily precluded.similarly,if there are many cases that differ as to the existence of reasonable expectations,the game of individuation may well be worth the candle.
that said,i personally doubt that individuation is appropriate in the case before us.i think it quite plausible that many aliens in fact relied on the continued existence of c relief when they opted not to seek that relief when it was available to them.in that regard,i do not see the significance of the government alternative explanation for aliens failure to seek c relief when it was available to them.the government suggests that,while some aliens may have delayed seeking c relief in order to wait until their case for such relief was stronger,others may have failed to do so hoping to delay the time that the ins would seek to deport them.assuming arguendo that the latter is a plausible scenario,i do not see how it detracts from the presence of landgraf interests.true,an alien,who believes and when the ins may opt to try to deport c relief will be available,may well choose not to precipitate ins action by seeking such relief earlier.but,that is far from saying that the same alien would have failed to bring the issue to a head while c relief was available if that alien believed c relief would be abolished retroactively later on.
in other words,the alien would act in reliance on and in expectation of the continued availability of c relief,regardless of whether he delayed in order to make his c case stronger or to take advantage of the fact that the ins was,famously,slow and inconsistent in bringing deportation cases.as far as landgraf is concerned,both motivations,it seems to me,are ones that are reasonably based on the expectation that c relief would be available.it is this kind of stake in the existing legal regime that landgraf intended its presumption against retroactivity to protect.see landgraf,at.stating that this presumption is rooted in the principle that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly.
for these reasons,i am inclined to think that a categorical reading of the statute would be preferable in the situation before us.and i would be so inclined even to my only motivation that were deemed to be acceptable under landgraf was the quite likely desire to strengthen a c application.for i believe that that motivation was,in fact,frequently present.the precise issue,however,has not been briefed or argued to us,and it may well involve some fact finding.accordingly,i much prefer to have the matter be considered first by the district court.i,therefore,concur fully with today holding,and with the panel decision to vacate and remand the case to the district court.
the record does not indicate the length of this term of imprisonment.
this agency is now called the bureau of citizenship and immigration services,but we will refer to it as the ins in view of the period in which this case arose.
section c of the immigration and nationality act provided in relevant part aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general without regard to the provisions of subsection a of this section,which enumerates grounds for exclusion c.because,read literally,this section only applies to aliens facing exclusion,not deportation,the bia used to require that a deportable alien actually depart the country and return to be eligible for c relief.but in francis ins,cir,we held that this requirement violated the equal protection component of the due process clause,because there was no minimally rational reason to treat differently two classes of aliens identical in every respect except for the fact that members of one class have departed and returned to this country at some point after they became deportable.id.at see also swaby ashcroft,cir noting that this court has long held that section c applies to deportation.the bia adopted our position in matter of silva,bia,holding that no distinction shall be made between permanent resident aliens who temporarily proceed abroad and permanent resident aliens,with regard to their eligibility to apply for c relief.
section d of the aedpa barred certain criminal aliens,including those convicted of aggravated felonies,from seeking c relief.see stat.at.congress later repealed section c and replaced it with a form of relief called cancellation of removal.see illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,a,b,stat.petitioner case,however,is not controlled by the iirira,since that law only applies to deportation proceedings instituted after april.see rankine reno,cir.
the bia based this conclusion on the attorney general decision vacating the bia holding in matter of soriano,wl bia june.see authority of the attorney general to grant discretionary relief from deportation under section c of the immigration and nationality act as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,wl,at op.att y.the bia noted that,while henderson ins,cir,held that the aedpa section d did not apply retroactively to pending deportation proceedings,that decision reserved the question of whether section d applied to criminal convictions that occurred prior to the aedpa enactment.
both of these holdings preceded this court decisions in cyr ins,cir,aff,d,and domond ins,cir,as well as the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d.
cyr i and the other cases discussed here also applied the same retroactivity analysis to the elimination of c relief effected by the iirira section.for convenience,we will only discuss these cases as they relate to the aedpa section d,since that is the only provision at issue in the instant case.
we can not,see jones coughlin,cir per curiam,and do not take issue with this statement.we do,however,note that,in the context of criminal sanctions,similar retroactive increases in penalties have been considered to raise serious concerns under the ex post facto clause,see,warden,lewisburg penitentiary marrero,d concerning retroactive elimination of parole eligibility,presumably because they violate notice rather than reliance interests.see generally landgraf,at,on notice and reliance considerations in retroactivity analysis,and note,infra,on the punitive aspects of deportation sanctions.nevertheless,the ex post facto clause has been held not to apply directly to deportation.see,marcello bonds.
in full,section b provides as follows filing of application.the application may be filed prior to,at the time of,or at any time after the applicant departure from or arrival into the united states.all material facts circumstances which the applicant knows or believes apply to the grounds of excludability or deportability must be described.the applicant must also submit all available documentation relating to such grounds b.
the government points out that this particular reliance argument is new on appeal,although it does not seem to claim that the contention was forfeited.in fact,petitioner decision not to raise this specific argument in his habeas petition is perfectly understandable.almost none of this circuit aedpa retroactivity cases had been decided when he applied for habeas relief.and,having readily won in the district court on a broad ground that had been expressly left open in henderson,see at,he had little reason to spell out more specific grounds on which to base his reliance argument.in any event,petitioner raised the general issue of the aedpa retroactivity under landgraf in his habeas petition,and we enjoy broad discretion to consider subsidiary legal arguments that were not specifically raised below.see ford bernard fineson dev,cir.we also find that petitioner adequately exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to his retroactivity argument.see theodoropoulos ins,cir holding that district court lacked jurisdiction to consider an alien retroactivity argument on habeas review because the alien had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by section d of the ina.petitioner has satisfied this exhaustion requirement,because the bia decision addressed the retroactivity of the aedpa and considered the relevant ins and the attorney general decision vacating matter of soriano see supra note.

as the supreme court noted,in the years preceding the aedpa,over half of the applications for c relief were granted.see cyr ii,at.
see cyr ii,at.relying upon settled practice,the advice of counsel,and perhaps even assurances in open court that the entry of the plea would not foreclose c relief,a great number of defendants in jideonwo and cyr position agreed to plead guilty.now that prosecutors have received the benefit of these plea agreements,agreements that were likely facilitated by the aliens belief in their continued eligibility for c relief,it would surely be contrary to familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations to hold that iirira subsequent restrictions deprive them of any possibility of such relief.citation,footnote,and internal quotation marks omitted.
the same regulations that seem quite clearly to permit an alien to file a c application with a district director before deportation proceedings are instituted,see a,b,also seem to permit the renewal of such an if the previous application had been the alien is in deportation proceedings,see c,e.this does not alter the fact that an alien might well delay making a c application prior to deportation the expectation that c relief will remain order to make his case stro
