petitioner van don nguyen a permanent resident,petitions this court for review of a final order of removal entered by the board of immigration appeals on april,this appeal raises the issue of whether the unauthorized use of an automobile constitutes a crime of violence under b.at least two circuits have rendered conflicting opinions on this question.compare united states,cir based on texas statute concerning unauthorized use of a vehicle with united states,cir based on unlawful use of means of transportation under arizona statute the board of immigration appeals followed the reasoning of the fifth circuit and found that nguyen conviction for auto theft under california law was a crime of violence rendering him subject to removal.
under the immigration and nationality act,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.the list of offenses that constitute aggravated felonies includes a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f.
the definition of the phrase crime of violence in b is incorporated by reference throughout federal criminal and immigration laws.for example,prior convictions for a crime of violence support substantial enhancements under the federal sentencing guidelines and,as in this case,a permanent resident with a conviction found to be a crime of violence is subject to removal regardless of the age of the conviction.unauthorized use of a vehicle is criminalized by most states using language similar to that found in the california statute at issue here.generally,the state statutes do not include elements of force against a person,a crime more likely to be characterized as a carjacking or robbery.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that the theft of an automobile under the california grand theft statute is not a crime of violence under b.the most succinct reason for our conclusion is that the statute in question regarding the crime of violence,as well as the california auto theft statute,is ambiguous and our decision must take into account the rule of lenity.under the ancient rule of lenity,any doubt about this conclusion must be resolved in favor of the defendant,or in this case,the petitioner who is subject to deportation pursuant to an ambiguous criminal statute.see united states santos,d plurality united states bass,d united states ford,cir applying the rule of lenity to a previous conviction for a walkaway escape because it is not unambiguously a crime of violence and therefore can not serve as the basis for career offender status.justice scalia recently explained in santos that the rule of lenity prevents courts from having to read the mind of congress and is a venerable requirement that the federal courts have applied for two centuries when interpreting ambiguous criminal statutes.when a criminal statute is ambiguous as to its intent,the tie goes to the defendant.because we can not find that auto theft is unambiguously a crime of violence under section b,we should follow the ancient rule and overrule the administrative agency in this case.
facts and prior proceedings 
petitioner is a native and citizen of vietnam who came to the united states in as a teenager.he currently lives in michigan,is married to a permanent resident,and his children are united states citizens.nguyen was charged in a criminal information in march.the counts involved possession of a controlled substance,auto theft and two other counts that were subsequently dismissed.nguyen was convicted of the cocaine possession charge and auto theft charge.he was sentenced to a suspended sentence on the auto theft charge and three years probation on the drug charge and served less than one year in the county jail.nguyen does not dispute that the auto theft conviction is considered an aggravated felony under a f of the immigration and nationality act based on the fact that the conviction subjected him to more than one year in prison,even though he served less than one year of jail time nguyen continued to reside in the united states without further criminal involvement and he owns his own nail and salon business.
nguyen was placed in removal proceedings in after he applied for citizenship and his drug conviction,which he had not disclosed on his application,came to the attention of the immigration and naturalization service now the department of homeland security.after congress once again amended the immigration statute definition of aggravated felony to include convictions for theft offenses for which the term of imprisonment was at least one year,the immigration and naturalization service also charged nguyen with deportability based on the auto theft conviction as well.
nguyen sought a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility under former section c of the immigration and nationality act,c repealed in,as relief from deportation.former section c authorized a permanent resident alien with a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years to apply for discretionary relief from deportation.immig.and natural.serv.cyr,d repeal of section c should not be construed to apply to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony through a plea agreement if at the time of the plea agreement the conviction would not have rendered the alien ineligible for discretionary relief from removal under section c.after many amendments in the early and,congress replaced discretionary relief under section c with another form of discretionary relief known as cancellation of removal.like section c,the new law precludes discretionary relief for an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
after an evidentiary hearing in august,an immigration judge found nguyen deportable on all grounds and ineligible for relief from deportation,and ordered him removed to vietnam.immigration judge decision,dated august,at.in august,the board of immigration appeals sustained the finding of deportability but remanded to the immigration judge to afford nguyen the opportunity to apply for discretionary relief in light of the supreme court cyr decision in.board of immigration appeals decision,dated,at.
on remand,nguyen reapplied for a section c waiver allowing discretionary relief from removal,and eight hearings were held between and.in september,the department of justice published a final rule codifying the requirements for section c relief in light of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act of and the supreme court decision in cyr.the rule went into effect immediately and renders an alien ineligible for section c relief if the alien is deportable on a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section of the immigration and nationality act.f in that same time frame,the board of immigration appeals issued two decisions holding that,after cyr,an alien is eligible for section c relief only if there is a comparable ground of inadmissibility under section a of the immigration and nationality act.see in re blake,i n,relief unavailable because the aggravated felony conviction of sexual abuse of a minor that formed the basis for deportability had no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility under section c in re,i n june,texas conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle is a crime of violence and therefore an aggravated felony that had no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility under section c.
