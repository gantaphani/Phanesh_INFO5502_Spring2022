in this appeal from a final order of removal,we must determine whether the board of immigration appeals bia erred in rejecting petitioner claim for political asylum.petitioner claims to fear reprisal by colombian drug criminals for his association with the drug enforcement agency dea and his employment by one of its informants.however,petitioner has not demonstrated how his connection to the drug trade or his collaboration with the dea stemmed from a political position he espouses.because such a showing is vital to an asylum claim grounded in political opinion,a a,the bia did not err in denying petitioner application.we therefore affirm the bia decision and deny the petition for review.
petitioner apolinar is a native of colombia,where he worked as a singer and restauranteur.after performing at an october party,perafan met javier cruz,who offered petitioner a job as an escort and driver.petitioner accepted and accompanied his boss on various trips in and early.
in furtherance of the employment relationship,cruz invited petitioner to travel to roanoke,virginia,and work in a restaurant that cruz was opening there.in february,shortly before departing for the united states with his wife,perafan drove cruz to a meeting attended by two known drug dealers.at this meeting,petitioner observed an exchange of a metal box typically used to transport drugs.he noticed the same type of box while unpacking equipment at the roanoke restaurant later in the month.perafan worked in the restaurant for some eight months in before cruz fired him over a labor dispute.
in the month after petitioner lost his job,the roanoke times published articles reporting that cruz was an informant for the dea.this report was the dea had arrested cruz and his boss leonardo rivera for offenses in.in return for leniency in sentencing,the agency had persuaded the two men to assist in investigating the cartel that employed them.the ensuing undercover scheme was successful and yielded material information concerning the criminal activity of the cartel.
in the process of winding down the operation,the dea had secured passage,including temporary visas,to the united states for cruz,perafan whom cruz had recently hired as a driver,and perafan wife.for some time after their arrival in february,cruz had continued to operate as an informant from the roanoke restaurant.but cruz work was imperiled by the roanoke times expos√© and his cover was completely blown when the colombian press picked up the story from the associated press.the dea moved cruz to miami for his safety and the restaurant ceased to operate.
recently out of work,concerned about the reports in the local media which had confirmed cruz connection to the drug world,and eager to remain in the united states,perafan approached the dea agent in roanoke who was involved with the undercover operation.petitioner offered to cooperate with the agency in its investigation of colombian drug trafficking and professed knowledge gained during his employment by cruz.after several interviews,however,the agent in charge determined that perafan possessed no useful information that was not already known by the dea.in,the officer informed petitioner and his wife that the agency could not assist them in immigration matters.
cruz,meanwhile,had become concerned about the impact of his press exposure on his sentencing deal.despite the publication of the roanoke times articles in the local colombian media,cruz returned to his native land in.he continued his involvement in the drug trade there for some two years,before he was murdered by a bodyguard in.
in april,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued petitioner a notice to appear the notice alleged that perafan was a under a b,who had remained in the united states longer than permitted,making him removable under a b.petitioner conceded his removability,but applied for asylum under a for himself and derivatively his wife and children.see a.
the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to applicants who establish refugee status.b.a refugee is one who is unable or unwilling to return to his native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a.perafan alleged that his employment by cruz,an outed dea informant,put him at risk of reprisal by colombian drug dealers and made him a refugee under this statutory definition.
the removal proceedings and the asylum petition were referred to an immigration judge ij.the ij heard testimony and issued a decision on july.the ij found that perafan had successfully demonstrated a fear of reprisal against him by drug dealers in colombia for his association with cruz.moreover,the retaliation would be on account of a political opinion,as a a requires.the judge therefore granted perafan asylum.
a panel of the bia reversed.a majority of the panel found implausible perafan allegation that he would face retaliation at the hands of drug dealers in colombia on account of a protected statutory ground.the bia therefore entered an order rejecting the asylum claim.petitioner now seeks review of that order in this court.
circuit courts hear appeals from the bia final orders of removal see a,b bia,cir.when the bia has adjudged asylum eligibility,our review of its decision is narrow.see b belbruno ashcroft,cir.we determine only whether the bia decision is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d.when the bia has rejected an asylum claim,we therefore uphold its decision unless the petitioner has presented evidence so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the elements required for asylum in petitioner favor.ins,d belbruno,at,at.these standards reflect the bia expertise in the area of immigration,its status as the attorney general designee in deportation decisions,and the special caution we observe in matters relating to foreign relations,for which the other branches of our government bear primary responsibility.see,at ins,cir en banc.
perafan alleges that the bia erred by overturning the ij decision to grant him asylum.he contends the bia should have respected the ij findings concerning witness credibility and credited the ij conclusion that petitioner fear of reprisal in colombia was.by failing to do so,he says,the bia exceeded its own scope of review and impermissibly overrode factual determinations committed to the ij.see d.petitioner reiterates to us the ubiquity of drug crime in colombia and describes the violent tactics of drug dealers there.he maintains that he will be targeted because of his association with cruz if he must return to colombia.he asks that we reject the bia contrary holding.
quite apart from the question of petitioner apprehensions of reprisal,his asylum claim founders on more fundamental grounds.for in addition to proving a fear of persecution,a party seeking refugee status must also demonstrate that the persecution is on account of one of the protected grounds race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.to satisfy the statutory test,an applicant must make a showing.he must demonstrate the presence of a protected ground,and he must link the feared persecution,at least in part,to it.see,at.ins,cir.
when the protected ground is political opinion,the first showing is prototypically met by evidence of verbal or openly expressive behavior by the applicant in furtherance of a particular cause.see,camara ashcroft,cir demonstrating with students and participating in a protest march for ethnic rights demonstrates political opinion for asylum purposes.less overtly symbolic acts may also reflect a political opinion.see briones ins,cir en banc holding that applicant provision of material information concerning a political insurgency reflected a political opinion.but whatever behavior an applicant seeks to advance as political,it must be motivated by an ideal or conviction of sorts before it will constitute grounds for asylum.because of this requirement,we recently reemphasized that f ears of retribution over purely personal matters or general conditio
