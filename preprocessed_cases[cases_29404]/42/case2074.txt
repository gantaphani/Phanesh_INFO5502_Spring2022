petitioner muhammad mana ahmed,a native and citizen of yemen,seeks review of a final order of removal issued by the board of immigration appeals,denying his motion to remand and affirming the determination of the immigration judge that he was ineligible for consideration of adjustment of status pursuant to the child status protection act of cspa,stat.for the reasons stated below,we hold that the bia abused its discretion by failing to address petitioner newly acquired evidence.accordingly,we grant ahmed petition for review,vacate the bia removal order,and remand to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ahmed,a native and citizen of yemen,lawfully entered the united states on july,as a visitor for pleasure,with authorization to remain in the united states for a temporary period not to exceed january.he overstayed his visa.the immigration and naturalization service now the department of homeland security,or dhs issued a notice to appear on december,in which it charged that petitioner was subject to removal pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina,a b,for having remained in the united states for a longer time than permitted.
on august,ahmed appeared before an ij and,through counsel,admitted to the factual allegations and conceded removability.he indicated,however,that he had applied for an adjustment of status pursuant to the ij granted ahmed request for a continuance to give him additional time to establish the precise receipt date by citizenship and immigration services cis of an petition for alien relative filed on his behalf by his adoptive father,muthana omer ahmed,a naturalized united states citizen in his circumstances,the date on which the petition was filed with cis was crucial to petitioner entitlement to immediate adjustment of status under the terms of the cspa 
the cspa provides that the age of an alien beneficiary on the date of filing of an petition with cis is to be used to determine whether an immigrant relative visa is immediately available to the alien thus,if an petition is filed for the child of a united states citizen when the child is twenty,that child will remain eligible for adjustment as an immediate relative,even if the adjustment does not occur until after the child turns,provided the child remains unmarried.see b a,b a i,and f a matter of,bia.
various regulations govern the filing procedure for immigration petitions such as the filed by ahmed in the instant case.a petition should be filed with the uscis office with jurisdiction over the application or petition and the place of residence of the applicant or petitioner as indicated in the instructions with the respective form.a.in order to pinpoint the receipt date of an petition,a n application or petition received in a cis office shall be stamped to show the time and date of actual receipt and,unless otherwise specified,shall be regarded as properly filed when so stamped,if it is signed and executed and the required filing fee is attached a i emphasis added.the petitioner,however,must establish that he or she is eligible for the requested benefit at the time of filing the application or petition.all required application or petition forms must be properly completed and filed with any initial evidence required by applicable regulations the form instructions.b.if all required initial evidence is not submitted with the application or petition or does not demonstrate eligibility,cis in its discretion may deny the application or petition for lack of initial evidence or for ineligibility or request that the missing initial evidence be submitted within a specified period of time as determined by cis.b ii.a petition will be approved by cis only if the evidence of record establishes both eligibility and that the petitioner warrants a favorable exercise of discretion.b i.
here,the parties do not dispute that ahmed turned on january.therefore,if ahmed could demonstrate that the petition was filed on his behalf prior to his birthday,he would be eligible for an immediate relative position under the cspa.conversely,if he was at the time the petition was filed,although the application might be granted,ahmed would not be entitled to an immediate adjustment of status,but would be required to wait for his visa eligibility date.
ahmed father initially filed an petition for ahmed as beneficiary,along with an adjustment application form and supporting evidence,with the detroit cis district office on november.however,the record shows that detroit cis returned the entire packet to ahmed for failure to comply with certain documentation requirements.specifically,the petition did not include a birth certificate and there was no proof of special nseers registration.see registration and monitoring of certain nonimmigrants,hadayat gonzales,cir.
at the august removal hearing,ahmed maintained that his adoptive father,through his attorney,resubmitted the petition and application,with the requisite information,by placing it in the mail,addressed to the detroit cis office,on december.indeed,the record contains a cover letter dated december,sent by ahmed attorney to cis,in which counsel noted that ahmed petition,application packet,and original birth certificate were enclosed for cis immediate consideration.in the letter,counsel acknowledged that the original petition had been returned as incomplete and emphasized that in light of ahmed impending birthday,it was imperative that the petition be reviewed in an expedited manner.
the detroit cis office received the resubmitted petition and then internally forwarded it to the ins nebraska service center for further processing.a receipt notice,admitted as an exhibit,shows that the nebraska service center received the petition on january,after ahmed birthday there was,however,no evidence available at the time of the august removal hearing indicating when the petition was physically received by detroit cis before being sent on to the nebraska service center.ahmed thus requested,and the ij granted,a continuance so that ahmed could attempt to ascertain the precise receipt date by detroit cis of the renewed petition.
at the continued hearing on february,ahmed again conceded removability,but sought a second continuance.he had filed a freedom of information act request with cis to secure documentation that might establish,with specificity,detroit cis receipt date of the resubmitted petition.although cis received the foia request on october,ahmed had not received a response as of the date of the hearing.ahmed attorney indicated to the ij that through his contacts with an foia officer at the detroit cis office,he learned that cis had not yet begun processing the foia request.counsel for petitioner acknowledged that the only ascertainable filing date of the petition in the record was the january,date reflected in the receipt notice sent from the nebraska service center.counsel for dhs confirmed that his file was void of any information reflecting a physical receipt date other than january.petitioner counsel indicated to the ij that he was not relying on the filing date of the initial,rejected petition as the basis for his claim that ahmed had not aged out under the cspa.instead,as underscored by his request for a second continuance,the gist of his argument was that the date on which the december,resubmitted petition was received by the detroit cis district office was the determinative filing date.
at the conclusion of the continued hearing,the ij issued an oral decision in which she found that ahmed was removable pursuant to a b.the ij denied ahmed request for adjustment of status pursuant to.in this regard,the ij concluded that even though ahmed was the intended beneficiary of an petition filed by his adoptive father on his behalf,he did not qualify for an immediately available immigrant visa under the cspa because the record established that the petition was filed on january,after ahmed birthday,and ahmed provided no evidence to the contrary.thus,the ij held that ahmed had aged out before the petition was received by cis.in light of this finding,the ij denied ahmed request for a second continuance as a matter of discretion and
