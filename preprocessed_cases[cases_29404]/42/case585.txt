luis amaya manzanares amaya,a native of el salvador,apparently entered the united states without authorization the immigration and naturalization service ins,as it was then called,says that it has no record of a lawful entry by amaya.in,amaya applied for asylum and was granted an employment authorization card by the ins,renewed annually while his asylum claim was being considered.see b.the card differs from the alien registration green card available to aliens who are legal permanent residents.see id.
according to the government,amaya sought employment in late and early with two different service companies doing business in secure areas at logan airport in boston.under federal regulations,such employment requires an access badge granted after review of an application to the airport operator and a criminal background check.in support of his applications,the government says that amaya submitted both his genuine employment authorization card and a green card bearing his name,photo,signature and actual alien number issued incident to his asylum application.
thereafter,the government says that it determined that the green card was a forgery.ins records,according to the government,show that no green card was ever issued to amaya.in april,a grand jury indicted amaya for use or attempted use of a forged,counterfeited,altered or falsely made green card.a.thereafter,in october,the district court scheduled trial for january.
on december,the prosecutor told defense counsel that the prosecution had just learned that an ins agent not involved in the case had spoken to amaya on or about january,and that amaya had made inculpatory statements concerning his acquisition of the green card.on january,amaya moved to dismiss the indictment because of the late disclosure.after an evidentiary hearing held the next day,the district court refused to dismiss but ordered that any statements by amaya to the agent be suppressed 
on january,the government also filed a trial brief and list of trial exhibits,including two exhibits provided to amaya counsel on december.one exhibit,entitled certificate of nonexistence of record,was prepared by the chief of the ins records services branch on december,and stated in part that the ins maintained records of entry and that a diligent search showed no lawful admission into the united states by amaya.a second exhibit,similarly titled,said that there was no record of issuance of the green card used by amaya.
on january,the date scheduled for trial,amaya moved to exclude both exhibits on the ground that they had been disclosed unduly late,allegedly in violation of applicable disclosure rules.amaya also argued that the certificate indicating amaya unlawful entry was irrelevant and,if relevant,should be excluded as unduly prejudicial.amaya also moved in limine to suppress,as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial,any testimony that amaya had entered the country unlawfully.
when the district judge took the bench,he announced that he was granting both motions.he said,perhaps referring mainly to first of the two certificates but logically encompassing both,that the evidence had not been turned over in timely fashion.and,apparently referring to the testimony as to unlawful entry,the judge said that he would exclude it too because i do think it is relevant at all to the issue in this case.
the prosecutor then asked to address the court,defended the disclosure of the certificates as timely and urged that evidence of amaya unlawful entry was being offered simply to prove the crime that he is charged with.the district court reiterated its ruling,noting that it was not suggesting bad faith by the government.further argument by a supervising prosecutor was also unavailing and the government then filed this interlocutory appeal from the january ruling.
the controlling issue is whether evidence that amaya entered the country unlawfully is admissible to show an element of the crime charged.although the district court excluded proposed documentary evidence to that certificate indicating lack of lawful a procedural ground,the court also ruled that any testimonial reference to amaya unlawful entry was barred as irrelevant.if the latter ruling is sound,the certificate insofar as it relates to unlawful entry would be inadmissible even without the procedural bar.
nevertheless,the procedural ruling has substantial implications for the government conduct of future prosecutions and so it is best to begin by addressing that ruling.the federal rules of criminal procedure provide that,on request,the government in a criminal case must disclose to the defense 
books,papers,documents,data,photographs,tangible objects,buildings or places if the item is within the government possession,custody,or control and the government intends to use the item in its at trial.
a e.by local rule,the district court requires such production within days of arraignment.c a whether rule a e is intended to apply to substitutes for testimony,such as a deposition or certificate as to what government records do or do not contain,may be open to question but we will assume arguendo that the rules do apply.
nevertheless,the rule by its terms is directed to materials that the government actually possesses.by contrast,the document in question,which was a to avoid having a testify,was created for trial purposes well after the arraignment and then promptly turned over to the defense indeed,it was on a precautionary before the district court ruled,shortly in advance of the scheduled trial,that the government could not offer amaya admission that he had bought the green card.
on the face of the matter,rule a e did not apply to the document until it was created.see united states kahl,cir upholding a district court refusal to grant discovery of government statistical compilations,when such compilations did not exist united states schembari,cir t he government can not disclose what it does not have united states harper,cir holding that the failure to produce records when they do not exist is not a violation of the jencks act.
conceivably a remedy could be found if the government were manipulating the timing for its creation of evidence to prejudice the defense but nothing of the kind is evident in this case.nor is there any reason to think that the defense was prejudiced by the timing of the disclosure.whatever objections the defense might have as to admissibility,it had good reason to fear that the government would offer testimony to show that amaya was an unlawful entrant who knowingly used a forged green card because he could not get a valid one.
this brings us to the broader question of the relevance of any showing of unlawful entry.in order to show that amaya was guilty of the crime of a false green government had to show that amaya used the card or attempted to do so which is probably not in dispute,that the card was false and that he knew it was false.a.the question is whether the proof that the government wants to amaya entered the country as an illegal relevant to either of these last two elements.
the government asserts that amaya unlawful entry is relevant to both falsity and knowledge,but the first of the two something of a red herring.strictly speaking,amaya unlawful entry if proved makes it more likely that the card is false than it would be without evidence of such entry after all,an unlawful entrant would have use for a false green card,while a lawful entrant would have a far better chance of qualifying for a valid card.
but proof that the card was false could be furnished straightforwardly by a certification or other testimony that no such card had been issued to amaya.indeed,in this case the government apparently has the false card in hand and could prove its falsity directly.by contrast,a certificate showing amaya unlawful entry and perhaps his continued lack of eligibility for a green card has only circumstantial bearing on the question whether the card is a fake.
no sensible judge would be likely to let in the unlawful entry evidence to show falsity.rule does not give judges a free hand to refashion the government proof to make cases less dramatic or more.yet a judge who allowed in prejudicial here we mean unfairly prove something that was so easily and definitively proved without such prejudice and by more straightforward means would be courting reversal.this argument for relevance thus tends more to taint than to assist the government position.
the other reason given for the show that amaya knew that the card was much more substance.at first blush one might think,after proof that the card was false,that further independent evidence of amaya knowledge would be unnecessary for conviction.after all,if the card were false,then amaya could not have obtained it from the ins.the most natural alternative explanation would be that he purchased it from someone who deals in green card forgeries,knowing that he was purchasing a fake.
yet conceivably some juror might think that there are means by which amaya might have acquired a false green card without necessarily knowing that it was false.perhaps a lawyer or other intermediary had,for a price,offered to procure a valid green card and then delivered it to amaya representing that it was valid.true,a judge might limit argument by defense counsel about such possibilities in the absence of some proof,but the government was not obliged to gamble and could reasonably look for relevant evidence of knowledge.so relevant evidence to show knowledge was hardly a waste of time.
arguing for relevance,the government says that because illegal aliens can not get green cards until their status is adjusted,amaya must therefore have known that his own card was necessarily false the government does not fully explain its reasoning and certainly did not do so to the district judge but the government conclusion is correct for at least one reason and possibly for two,although the second poses a trickier issue that need not be resolved.
the most straightforward reason for relevance is that amaya status as an unlawful entrant who has not upgraded his status makes it more likely that he acquired the forged green card by buying it from someone who was obviously not a government agent authorized to issue it.this might be conceived of as motive evidence one who is an unlawful entrant has a motive to buy a forged green card or mechanically someone with amaya status would have been rebuffed if he had sought a green card from the ins and so had to resort to the black market.
either way,if amaya bought the green card on the black market,this practically assures that amaya knew the card he acquired was forged rather than valid.it is not simply the possession of a forged document that creates a strong inference of knowledge that it is false someone with a single forged bill in his wallet may as easily be a victim rather than a perpetrator.rather,it is the added proof that amaya status prevented him from getting a valid green card from the ins which greatly increases the chances that he engaged in a transaction that by its nature would also have led him to believe that the document he had obtained was not valid.
thus,we can not agree that the unlawful entry evidence was not relevant to an element of the crime charged.yes,the standard of review on appeal of evidentiary rulings is often said to be for abuse of discretion although the phrase is somewhat misleading,see invessys,cir.but whether a fact tends to make another fact more or less likely depends heavily on the logic of the connection,and there is no discretion to ignore a logical relationship.tiller baghdady,cir.
there is an alternative argument for relevance.conceivably,a jury might be able to infer without independent proof that someone who is an unlawful entrant in the united states is quite likely to know that he or she can not get a valid green card and therefore that amaya,since he was found with a forged green card,quite likely knew that it had to be forged.a jury might think that such knowledge would be widespread among unlawful at least those who,like amaya,had been in this country for a substantial period and had previously sought work.
the state of knowledge in the community is not an adjudicative fact about amaya own knowledge,which would be subject to strict standards of proof.compare.rather,the likely state of knowledge in the community is a background fact about how the world works,and such facts if plausible can be inferred without direct proof.this is an issue not much discussed in the cases and not subject to very clear standards,see united states,cir,cert.denied,d,and we need not resolve the problem here.
it is enough for relevance that unlawful entry increases the likelihood that amaya did acquire the false green card on the black market and therefore knew it to be forged.true,one might ask why amaya needed a forged green card if he had a temporary work card from the ins but perhaps he got the forgery before the work card.anyway,considerations that arguably reduce the probative value of particular acts do not destroy the relevance of the acts altogether.check forest hills,cir.
in moving to exclude the evidence,amaya argued not only lack of relevance but also undue prejudice evidence,although relevant,may still be excluded because its prejudicial impact substantially outweighs its probative value.united states balthazard,cir.in this case the argument for such an exclusion under rule is far from frivolous.it was not expressly resolved by the district court only because the evidence was excluded on other grounds.
proof of amaya unlawful entry is prejudicial in the sense intended by rule.this is not because it hurts relevant evidence by the government does because it introduces a factor into the case that might encourage the jury to dislike or disapprove of the defendant independent of the merits.see united states varoudakis,cir evidence invit ing the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis.
the extent of likely prejudice should not be overstated some jurors might not care whether amaya was an unlawful entrant and others might well without the government direct amaya had entered unlawfully,just because of proof that the green card was not genuine.still,amaya would be better off without proof of unlawful entry,especially in a case that some jurors might think was overcharged and should not have been brought after all,amaya had a temporary employment card.
curiously,the government suggests that proof of unlawful entry is essential to its case,but it is hard to see why.if the government proved that amaya used a forged green card and did not get it from the ins,a jury could impute knowledge of falsity to least absent proof from amaya that the forged card was acquired in surely unusual circumstances leading him to believe that it was valid.unlike a single forged bill,illegal green cards with name,photo and alien number do not show up in one pocket by chance.
thus,we have a debatable case under rule.the proof of unlawful entry is not crucial to the government case,which is adequate without such proof and which is bolstered by the proof only to a limited degree at least in theory,amaya could have entered unlawfully and still somehow ended up with a false green card that he believed to be valid.and the unlawful entry evidence is prejudicial.yet the rule provides for exclusion only if the prejudice substantially outweighs probative value.
ordinarily the district judge is entitled to latitude in applying rule to particular facts,partly because the issue turns on a balancing of unquantifiable considerations,united states pitrone,cir dente riddell,cir,and in this case the call is close enough that a judgment either way is defensible.but we can not affirm the district judge on a ground he did not adopt,unless the issue could be decided only one way.vincent louis marx,cir.
amaya is entitled to present this alternative rule ground for exclusion to the district judge and if the judge excludes the evidence on this ground as appears likely,his resolution must stand whether or not the government then chooses to dismiss the case.if the case goes forward and amaya chooses to testify,the district judge has explicitly reserved the question whether unlawful entry evidence might be admissible for impeachment.
one issue remains.amaya has suggested
