petitioners sumaira urooj urooj and her husband,khalid mahmood turk turk,seek review of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissal of their appeal from a final order of removal.the order terminated their asylum status and held them removable under a b of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b,for remaining in the united states longer than permitted.the order also held urooj removable for misrepresenting a material fact,and declared that urooj had filed a frivolous asylum application.
petitioners seek review on three bases first,the department of homeland security dhs failed to establish grounds for termination of asylum by a preponderance of the evidence.second,the ij violated urooj due process rights when he did not require dhs to adhere to the local operating procedures requiring advance disclosure of both witnesses and exhibits.finally,the bia decision affirming the ij finding that petitioners asylum application was frivolous was not supported by substantial evidence.
because we agree that the bia erred in finding that dhs established grounds for termination of asylum by a preponderance of the evidence we grant the petition for review.
petitioners sumaira urooj and khalid mahmood turk are a married couple from pakistan admitted to the united states on visas in and.both visas expired in.while in the united states,petitioner urooj submitted an application for asylum in.her husband,petitioner turk,was a derivative beneficiary of this application.in her application,petitioner urooj stated that while in pakistan she was detained or arrested on at least three occasions,during which she was beaten,interrogated,tortured,and threatened on account of her membership in the pakistan people party ppp,and she feared similar mistreatment or worse if removed to pakistan.petitioner urooj asylum application was granted on december.
in august,petitioner urooj was interviewed by dhs.dhs prepared a record of sworn statement from the interview,which urooj signed.the statement reflects that urooj paid an acquaintance to help prepare her application and her acquaintance told her to memorize the story that he created for the asylum interview and reminded her of details while serving as her interpreter during the asylum interview.it also reflects that urooj was a member of a ppp student organization but was never persecuted,arrested,or tortured in pakistan because of that affiliation and did not fear persecution if she returned to pakistan.
following the interview,petitioners received notices to appear and notices of intent to terminate asylum status.the notices to appear charged petitioners with being subject to removal pursuant to a b of the immigration and naturalization act ina,a b,as immigrants who remained in the united states for a longer period than authorized and aliens present in the united states in violation of law,on account of a prior misrepresentation of a material fact pursuant to section a c of the ina,a c.
dhs did not provide notice of its proposed witnesses or exhibits before the hearing on petitioners removability,as required by the local operating procedures lop of the san francisco,california immigration court at the hearing,dhs called petitioner urooj as a hostile witness and offered the following documents as evidence petitioner urooj asylum application the record of sworn statement and the record of oath pertaining to her asylum application.
counsel for petitioners objected,relying on the lack of proper notice under the lop.questions were propounded by dhs,but petitioner urooj refused to answer on advice of counsel.while petitioner urooj was on the stand,dhs offered the documents as impeachment evidence,which is excepted from the lop notice requirements,and the ij admitted them as such.the ij also found that petitioner urooj did not need to be disclosed as a proposed witness within the meaning of the lop because she was a party to the proceedings.the ij drew adverse inferences from petitioner urooj refusal to answer each question she was asked.
following the removal hearing,the ij terminated petitioners asylum and held that petitioner urooj filed a frivolous asylum application.the ij ordered petitioners removed to pakistan.
petitioners sought review of the ij decision to the bia.the bia dismissed petitioners appeal,affirming the ij decision.petitioners timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction under a d to review final orders of removal.see morales alegria gonzales,f d,cir.on review from a decision to terminate asylum status,this court reviews the bia factual findings for substantial evidence.brezilien holder,cir.questions of law are reviewed de novo.id.where,as here,the bia adopts the decision of the ij,we review the ij decision as if it were that of the bia.abebe gonzales,cir en banc quoting hoque ashcroft,cir.
in proceedings to terminate a grant of asylum,dhs must establish the grounds for termination by a preponderance of the evidence.c.f.the pivotal legal question before this panel,which we review de novo,is whether dhs can satisfy its burden through impeachment evidence only.our conclusion is that it can not.
where,as here,the sole witness refuses to answer questions,dhs can not satisfy its burden,in the absence of any substantive evidence,based solely upon the adverse inference drawn from silence.matter of guevara,bia.as the bia aptly observed in guevara,if the burden of proof were satisfied by a respondent silence alone,it would be practically no burden at all.id.at.
the ij distinguished the evidentiary record in this case from that in guevara and justified the different result by relying on the impeachment evidence offered by dhs.the ij held that petitioner urooj refusal to testify,taken in conjunction with the documentation submitted by the dhs is sufficient to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a showing of fraud in her application.we disagree.impeachment evidence alone can not satisfy dhs burden where there was no substantive evidence and thus nothing to impeach.
it is clear both from the transcript of the proceedings and the ij written decision that the ij admitted the documentary evidence proffered by dhs for impeachment purposes only impeachment evidence is limited to show ing background facts which bear directly on whether the factfinder ought to believe one witness rather than other and conflicting witnesses.gordon united states,see also,impeachment includes attacking witness credibility and character for truthfulness or untruthfulness jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence,ed.t he technicalities surrounding impeachment tend to submerge the basic aim of all credibility rules to admit evidence that enables the trier of fact to determine whether or not the witness is telling the truth.where there is no act of telling,there is no need to determine the credibility of the witness 
rather than terminating the proceedings for lack of substantive evidence,the ij and bia relied on the impeachment evidence for proof of the facts in dispute.this reliance was error,as it improperly conflated impeachment evidence with substantive evidence see,united states webster,cir emphasizing subtle distinction between impeachment and substantive evidence robert jones,et,federal civil trials evidence impeachment evidence proves only that the declarant lacks credibility substantive evidence proves the facts in dispute.the ij found the impeachment evidence to be probative on the issues of fraud and give n full evidentiary weight.similarly,the bia found the impeachment evidence to indicate that urooj knew her asylum application contained false statements and that she made false claims in support of it during her asylum interview.the decisions of the ij and the bia in this case relieved dhs of its burden of proof,allowing it to prove the facts in dispute by offering only impeachment evidence unconstrained by the procedural rules of notice 
we agree with the first circuit that the united states government should not be bailed out from the need to present an adequate prima facie case we should not encourage the cutting of corners by an agency having such significant responsibilities.navia duran immi
