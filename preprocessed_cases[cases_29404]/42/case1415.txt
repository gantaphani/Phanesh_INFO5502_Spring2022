opinion of the court 
petitioner xiu ling zhang,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,petitions for review of an order by the board of immigration appeals bia denying asylum and withholding of removal she argues,among other things,that the immigration judge ij failed to reconcile his decision with the documentary evidence she produced.we grant zhang petition for review,vacate the order of the bia,and remand to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this court opinion in liu ashcroft,cir.
in november,zhang arrived in the united states without a valid immigrant visa.joint appendix app.at.an asylum officer found that she had a credible fear of persecution if repatriated to the people republic of china and issued her a notice to appear before an ij so that she could apply for asylum.id.in march,zhang filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under article iii of the united nations convention against torture she alleged that chinese family planning authorities had,among other things,subjected her to a forced abortion and demanded that she or her husband be sterilized to prevent any further violations of the country policy.
at a preliminary hearing on july,zhang lawyer gave the ij and opposing counsel a number of documents to corroborate these claims.see id.at.the materials included birth certificates for zhang,her husband,and her three children zhang marriage certificate a receipt indicating that zhang was fined yuan for removing an intrauterine device iud without permission and another receipt showing that zhang was fined yuan for attempt to give birth secretly.id.at.the latter receipt was dated march.app.at.
zhang also submitted two other potentially important documents.the first was a birth control surgery certificate from changle city stating that zhang was conducted with a abortion operation and iud installation on march,at our clinic.app.at.this document is affixed with a seal.the second is a notice addressed to zhang and her husband from the birth control office of shouzhan town changle city.as translated,this notice states 
according to the result of our investigation,you gave two over birth boys in somewhere else,which violated the nation family planning policies severely.therefore,according to the penalty regulation of the family planning policies,you must pay a fine of thousand yuan within thirty days.i n the meantime,one of you must go to the local hospital for the sterilization operation.otherwise,we will be force d to complete the sterilization operation,and punish severely as well.
pp.at emphasis added.this document is also affixed with a seal.
after zhang counsel furnished these documents during the july preliminary hearing,the government lawyer asked if zhang counsel intended to comply with and have any documents authenticated by the consulate in china.app.at.zhang counsel responded that he had no intention to do so at that point.the ij then interjected 
bear with me a second.that one of the more troubling regulations because it a regulation that imposes a requirement upon people to get things authenticated.the reality,i think,is that it almost impossible to get that actually done.but there is a requirement.i make a decision on that at the time of the hearing.i not going to make a decision now.
the ij,however,never revisited the question whether the documents had been adequately authenticated.the ij referred to the documents at the outset of his oral opinion,stating the court also has exhibit which consists of some documents submitted by the respondent to corroborate her claim.see app.at.but what the ij meant when he said that he ha d the documents is unclear.it is possible that he meant that the documents were part of the official record that was before him,but it is also conceivable that he merely meant that the documents had been submitted and not that he regarded them as part of the record.
at her merits hearing on october,zhang testified that chinese family planning officials subjected her to a forced abortion,fitted her with an iud on three separate occasions,and demanded that she or her husband be sterilized to prevent any future pregnancies.the ij denied zhang petition based entirely on an adverse credibility determination.see app.at,i did believe any of your testimony.he explained that zhang story appeared scripted and unbelievable because neither the overall story nor certain pieces of it seemed plausible.app.at.after mentioning several perceived inconsistencies in zhang testimony,the ij observed that there is nothing really in the state department profile that would lead us to believe that forced abortions are anything other than a very rare exception.app.at.he continued 
there is evidence that forced abortions have occurred but there is also evidence that meteors have landed in the united states.i mean the fact that there evidence that something happened to someone else does mean that it happened to zhang.there has to be a background of country conditions that form a context and make the story plausible.when someone is going to come in and say th ey had a forcible abortion it not enough to say,well,i guess that possible.i going to want some proof that it more than just possible,that there is a substantial chance that this thing,in fact,happened.
app.at emphasis added.the ij concluded that we basically have a long shot happening here,which is a forced abortion,and we also have very poor testimony.so when you combine the two things together you have no way of succeeding in a case like this.app.at.
the ij acknowledged that zhang testimony was quite consistent with her written asylum application,but he never explained why the documents that she submitted did not bolster her credibility.app.at.in fact,it is impossible to tell precisely what documents played in the ij analysis.
the ij obviously did not take the documents at face value.if authentic and accurate,they powerfully corroborate zhang claims the abortion certificate would show that she had an abortion on or about march.viewed in conjunction with this certificate,the march,notice fining zhang for an attempt to give birth secretly would give rise to a strong inference that the abortion was involuntary.and of course if zhang was forced to undergo an abortion,that would mean that she was subjected to past persecution,and she would be entitled to the benefit of a rebuttable presumption that she has a fear of further persecution if removed to china.see a a and b b.similarly,the document ordering zhang or her husband to submit to a sterilization procedure on pain of severe punishment would corroborate zhang testimony that the chinese authorities threatened her with forced sterilization and would bolster her claim that she has a fear that she would again be threatened with forced sterilization if she were sent back to her native country.
because of the significance that the documents in question would have if they are authentic and accurate,it is obvious that the ij must have given them reduced weight or no weight at all.liu ashcroft,cir discussing an ij evidentiary rulings on two abortion certificates that are ambiguous as to whether he intended to give the certificates little weight or no weight.the ij never explained which of these options he chose or why he did so.
on appeal,the bia issued a affirmance.it adopted the ij decision and added a single sentence of its own.in light of the questions raised by the respondent credibility,the authenticity of the supporting documents that she presented,and the respondent failure to adequately explain the lack of corroboration,the respondent did not meet her burden of proof to establish her eligibility for the reliefs requested.app.at.
this court must review the administrative record on which the final removal order is based.see gao ashcroft,cir.the final order to be reviewed is usually that of the board of immigration appeals,but when the bia simply states that it affirms the ij decision for the reasons set forth in that decision,the ij opinion effectively becomes the bia,and,accordingly,a court must review the ij decision.abdulai ashcroft,cir quoting chen ins,cir internal citations omitted.here,to the extent that the bia adopted the ij opinion,we treat that opinion as the opinion of the board see miah ashcroft,cir reviewing both the decision of the ij and the bia because the bia adopted some parts of the ij opinion abdulai,at when the bia defers to an ij,a reviewing court must,as a matter of logic,review the ij decision to assess whether the bia decision to defer was appropriate.
ordinarily,we will affirm the ij decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.see balasubramanrim ins,cir.this deferential standard dictates that the ij findings must be upheld unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it.abdille ashcroft,cir citing ins,d.however,remand is appropriate where we have made a legal determination,regarding the admissibility of evidence that fundamentally upsets the balancing of facts and evidence upon which an agency decision is based.liu ashcroft,cir.see also leia ashcroft,cir diallo ins,cir.in liu,the improper rejection of unauthenticated abortion certificates by the ij infected the adverse credibility determination,justifying a remand.chen ashcroft,cir.
as previously noted,it is possible that the ij in this case refused to admit the documents in question and thus gave them no weight.it is also possible that the ij admitted the documents but found that they were entitled to less weight than they would appear to merit if accepted at face value.without further explanation,however,neither approach can be sustained.
we can not sustain the exclusion of the documents without an explanation of the basis for the ruling.the ij may have excluded the documents for failure to comply with,which states that an official record shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof,or by a copy attested by an officer so authorized id.emphasis added.this regulation adds that t he attested copy,with the additional foreign certificates if any,must be certified by an officer in the foreign service of the united states,stationed in the foreign country where the record is kept.id.our court,however,recently held that is not an absolute rule of exclusion,and is not the exclusive means of authenticating records before an immigration judge.liu,at.see also leia ashcroft,cir remanding for consideration under liu where an ij found that was the exclusive means to authenticate documents accordingly,exclusion of the documents on this ground would be legal error.because of the real possibility that the ij excluded the documents in question pursuant to this regulation,we must vacate the order of the bia and remand for clarification on this point.
it is also possible,as noted,that the ij did not rely on but found for some other reason or reasons that the documents were not entitled to any appreciable weight.but because the ij opinion does not disclose his reasoning on this matter,it is impossible for us to discharge our responsibility to determine whether,as zhang contends,the evidence in the record compels the conclusion that she faces a probability of or at least has a fear of persecution if she is removed to the people republic.as noted,the documents at issue,if accepted as genuine and accurate,strongly corroborate zhang testimony.thus,unless they were excluded for some undisclosed procedural reason the propriety of which we obviously can not review or unless they were properly deemed to be unreliable or untrustworthy,see ezeagwuna ashcroft,cir,they could compel findings quite different from those that the ij reached.
several possible grounds for the ij treatment of the documents come to mind.one possibility is that the ij thought that the of zhang provided a basis for doubting the documents authenticity.the government attorney asked zhang why some of the chinese notarial certificates that she had submitted were dated february,which was after she entered the united states.see app.at.the hearing transcript unhelpfully reports zhang answer as my indiscernible just helped me to obtain it.id.at.the government lawyer apparently believed that zhang said that her husband had helped her obtain the notarial certificates,and the lawyer thus began questioning zhang about her husband,who was in hiding kilometers from fujian province.when the government lawyer eventually returned to his original question about who helped zhang acquire the certificates,the transcript records zhang answer as follows that my husband did.id.at.shortly thereafter,when asked again,zhang replied,no.it not my husband himself.i said my husband dad got them i never say my husband.i just keep on saying that my husband dad.id.at.
this exchange,as translated from foo chow to english,is muddled at best.it is difficult to say that this supposed discrepancy in testimony is enough in itself to impugn the authenticity of the birth certificates in the record.moreover,even if it did,the abortion certificate and the documents relating to the fine for removal of the iud and the threat of involuntary sterilization were never directly discredited.
another possibility,which was discussed at oral argument,is that the ij relied on a state department report,dated april,noting that documentation from certain parts of china,including documents that purportedly verify birth control measures,is subject to widespread fabrication and fraud.app.at.according to this report,in the fujian province in particular,where zhang lived,no reliable documents existed to prove relationships.id.at.indeed,the report notes,when the consulate general in the region requested in that officials in fujian investigate suspected fake documents,of the that were investigated were determined to be incorrect or fake.app.at.
persuasive as the report might seem,we have previously counseled wariness regarding wholesale reliance on the department of state country reports.chen ashcroft,cir citations omitted holding that the bia erroneously rejected the validity of two abortion certificates based on nothing more than the country report.see also lin ins,cir quoting galina ins,cir.a cautious approach is justified in this case,where the report relies on data from,and devotes only a single paragraph to the topic of documentation.at this juncture,however,it would be unduly speculative for us to address the question whether this country report alone could justify a refusal to give any weight to the documents at issue in this case.until we know whether and,if so,to what degree the country report figured in the ij evaluation of the evidence,consideration of that issue is plainly premature.
for these reasons,we hold that the order of the bia must be vacated and the case must be remanded.see liu,at abdulai ashcroft,cir remanding b ecause the bia failure of explanation makes it impossible for us to review its rationale.the bia may proceed on remand as it does with respect to any evidentiary question,evaluating issues of materiality,relevance,probity,and the general requirements of due process.id.at citations omitted.see also yongo ins,cir enumerating methods of authentication.if it determines that the documents were excluded,it must explain the basis for exclusion.if it decides that they were admitted,it must square them with the ij decision.
i fully join my colleagues opinion.however,i write separately to express my concern with the immigration judge reasoning in this matter.i am particularly troubled because the immigration judge ignored evidence corroborating zhang claim while apparently going out of his way to find problems with it.consequently,as i shall explain,the ij opinion reads like a progression of flawed sound bites that gives the impression that the ij was looking for ways to deny zhang claim,rather than adjudicate it.dia ashcroft,cir.
the ij states that zhang testimony 
right at the beginning,appears to be a script.this is subtle but it an indication of what was to follow.i referring to when the respondent,in her oral testimony,stated right at the outset,i have suffered persecution from the family planning.real refugees are not throwing around the word persecution that often in the cases where the persecution is lacking because the story is not true the word persecution tends to be used more and more.
app.the ij reaction to this testimony,by his own account,seems to have predisposed him right at the beginning to conclude that zhang was not being truthful.given the evidence supporting her claim,absent some explanation,that reaction is simply unsupportable.
zhang used the word persecution exactly once during her entire testimony.she did not throw around the word that often.the single instance in which she referred to persecution is as follows 
question why did you leave china 
answer because i have suffered persecution by the family planning.
question can you describe what family planning is 
answer they just forced me to undergo abortion and have the iud inserted,but i do not go willingly.
app,lines.based upon that one reference to persecution,the ij concluded right from the beginning that zhang was being untruthful.he thereafter viewed her claim through jaundiced eyes despite substantial documentary evidence that corroborated it.
zhang reference to persecution is hardly remarkable even if that word is not part of her daily vocabulary.zhang may well have become familiar with that word and learned its relevance to her claim during the course of the hearings into the issue of persecution.zhang was,after all,represented by an attorney who would have discussed her case with her before the hearing she could easily have realized that the treatment she was describing was tantamount to persecution under our immigration laws.however,for reasons that are not apparent on this record,the ij never allowed for that possibility.
although we do expect an immigration judge to search for ways to sustain an alien testimony,neither do we expect the judge to search for ways to undermine and belittle it.if the ij reference to zhang single use of persecution were the only troubling aspect of his opinion,it could be dismissed as hyperbole.however,the rest of the ij opinion is also troubling.
the ij believed it was implausible that a woman as relatively humble and who has as little education as zhang would be familiar with the chinese government mistreatment of those chinese citizens that return to china after leaving for the united states.app.however,the ij never bothered to explain why he discounted the very real possibility that someone in zhang position could learn her government policies through word of mouth.indeed,given the absence of a free press so typical of authoritarian regimes,information about official mistreatment of citizens would more likely spread by word of mouth than written word.yet,the ij concluded,without citing any supporting evidence,that zhang came about this knowledge because someone,probably the smuggler or someone who arranged for her to come forward with this asylum,told her to throw that one in.see app.that is nothing short of rank speculation.
the ij assumed that zhang manufactured a dramatis personae sic in testifying about the doctor who removed iuds because he was purportedly able to remove them and avoid prosecution by the authorities.the ij was skeptical that residents in her community knew the doctor identity,yet the identity remained hidden to the authorities.the ij reasoned 
according to the respondent a lot of people knew about this doctor who was taking iud out in the particular area of china.apparently,no one in the planning office knew about this doctor.everybody else knew about him but the people who count,the officials,did seem to know that as they were putting iud into women he was down the street taking them all out.one could just imagine what kind of punishment a person like that would suffer if the rest of these allegations about the severity of the birth control policies in china are to be believed.
once again,given the evidence corroborating zhang claim,his skepticism of that testimony is as unfounded as it is naivé.the ij reasoning proceeds as follows zhang said she and others knew of a doctor who was illegally removing iuds.the doctor had not been arrested even though villagers knew what he was doing.therefore,the doctor must not exist and zhang must have manufactured him for her testimony.
of course,the ij had no way of knowing whether the doctor was eventually prosecuted.moreover,it is not that improbable that a doctor could perform illegal procedures and not be arrested.even in a society as advanced as our own,not every law breaker is arrested.one need only recall that a few years ago,women in the united states were able to find doctors willing to perform abortions even though the practice was then illegal.
today we need look no further than many american cities where open air drug markets prosper even though residents,and even police,know drugs are being sold there.for example,in united states miller,d,the court refers to the drug enforcement agency refusing to renew a lease on a property because of nearby open air drug markets.the court explained this property is an older building at one point the drug enforcement administration was the tenant.ironically,the dea did not renew the lease because of narcotic activity in open air drug markets in the area.united states edmonds,the officers included a veteran who had worked in that neighborhood intermittently for some years.it is notorious as one of the many open air drug markets infesting the nation capital united states baptiste,cir the government presented evidence at trial that an open air drug market existed in the seventh ward beginning in the early.united states gibbs,counsel objected when the witness testified the defendant was up around street,the open air drug market.according to the logic that was used to deny zhang claim,these open air drug markets simply do not exist because officials would know about them.
there is,however,an even more troubling aspect of the immigration judge decision.given the judge analysis,i can not help but wonder if his decision here was influenced by his view of zhang parenting.the judge stated 
so she has three children.this is like a bird in the hand versus two in the bush.to zhang two in the bush is more important than the one in the hand.she has three children which she can take care of,which she can cherish and be part of their upbringing,or she could say,no.i not really interested in that.what i think i do is i just discard those three kids and i worry about some other kids who may in the future materialize somehow or other.i not quite sure how because,by the way,my husband happens to be in china as i sit here and speak.but let forget about the kids that i have and we worry about the kids that i do have and in all probability never will have.
in fairness,it is possible that the ij summarized zhang testimony in this manner to explain why he found her asylum claim inconsistent with her leaving her three children in china,and that this undermined her credibility.however,given the judge willingness to ignore so much of this record that is consistent with zhang testimony,i can not help but be concerned that such a bias played a role in this decision.the issue before the judge was,after all,whether zhang qualified as a refugee,not the quality of her parenting,or her presence in the home.see ins,cir in considering claims of persecution it is highly advisable to avoid assumptions regarding the way other societies operate.
in overlooking the evidence corroborating zhang testimony,the ij explained w hen someone is going to come in and say they had a forcible abortion i going to want some proof that it more than just possible,that there is a substantial chance that this thing happened app.though he demanded some proof,the judge totally ignored proof that zhang had introduced to corroborate her claim.this included birth certificates for zhang,her husband,and her three children a receipt indicating that zhang was fined yuan for removing an iud without permission another receipt showing that zhang was fined yuan for attempt to give birth secretly a birth control surgery certificate from changle city stating that zhang was conducted with a abortion operation and iud installation on march,at our clinic and a notice addressed to zhang and her husband from the
