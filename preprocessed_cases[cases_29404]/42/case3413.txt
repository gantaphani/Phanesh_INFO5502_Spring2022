the united states of america government appeals the sentence imposed on jose leal vega for illegal reentry following deportation.the district court declined to apply a enhancement pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines,for leal vega prior conviction under california health safety code.the government contends that the enhancement should have been applied because section is categorically a drug trafficking offense under.alternatively,the government contends that even if section does not categorically qualify,leal vega conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense applying the modified categorical analysis because the substance involved was tar heroin,a substance covered by the federal controlled substances act csa,et.
we hold that a conviction under section does not qualify categorically as a drug trafficking offense for the purposes of.however,we hold that leal vega prior section conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense using the modified categorical approach,and we reverse and remand for resentencing.
factual and procedural background 
on march,leal vega was charged in count of a felony complaint with committ ing a violation of health and safety code section,a felony,in that on or about march,in the county of riverside,state of california,he did wilfully and unlawfully possess for sale and purchase for purpose of sale a controlled substance,to wit,tar heroin.he was concurrently charged with another count.leal vega pled guilty to count,and the second count was dismissed.
on august,leal vega pled guilty to illegal reentry following deportation,under.the information charged leal vega with a prior felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance for sale,in violation of california health safety code.
in the presentence report psr,the probation office recommended a enhancement based on the prior conviction,which it categorized as a drug trafficking offense.leal vega objected to this categorization,arguing that section is categorically broader than the sentencing guidelines definition of a drug trafficking offense.after initially arguing that section was a categorical fit,the government later conceded that the statute was too broad.prior to sentencing,the district court requested more information for the purpose of conducting the modified categorical analysis.the government subsequently retracted its concession regarding the inapplicability of the categorical analysis to section,and claimed that since the sentencing guidelines do not incorporate the csa definition of controlled substance,section is not overbroad,and that the statute is a categorical fit.
the district court concluded that section was not categorically a drug trafficking offense,and also found that the record of conviction for leal vega conviction was insufficient to establish a modified categorical fit.thus,the district court only applied a sentence enhancement and imposed a sentence of thirty months imprisonment,based on a calculated guidelines range of to thirty months.the government timely appealed.

discussion 
the crime of unlawfully entering the united states under carries a base offense level of under the sentencing guidelines.see united states ballesteros ruiz,cir.a defendant base offense level may be increased by sixteen levels if he has a prior conviction for a drug trafficking offense,and the sentence on the prior conviction exceeded thirteen months.b a.the sentencing guidelines define drug trafficking offense as 
a n offense under federal,state,or local law that prohibits the manufacture,import,export,distribution,or dispensing of,or offer to sell a controlled substance or a counterfeit substance or the possession of a controlled substance.
id,application notes b iv emphasis added.
we apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches described in taylor united states,d,to determine whether a defendant prior conviction satisfies b a.united states pimentel flores,cir.we first apply the categorical analysis.under this approach,we do not examine the facts underlying the prior offense,but look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.id.at quoting united states corona sanchez,cir en banc,superseded on other grounds by,cmt.if the statutory definition of the prior offense criminalizes conduct that would not constitute a drug trafficking offense,then the statute is not a categorical fit,and we must consider whether the prior conviction may still be used for a sentencing enhancement using the modified categorical approach.id.we may not use the conviction for a sentencing enhancement unless the record includes documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate for enhancement purposes.id.quoting corona sanchez,at.finally,if both the statute and the documents containing judicially noticeable facts would allow the defendant to be convicted of an offense that would not be a drug trafficking offense,then the sentencing enhancement may not be applied.see corona sanchez,at.
the predicate offense here,california health safety code,criminalizes possess ion for sale or purchases for purposes of sale any controlled substance specified in subdivision b,c,or e of section,specified in paragraph,or of subdivision d of section,or specified in subdivision b or c of section,or specified in subdivision h of section,or any controlled substance classified in schedule iii,iv,or v which is a narcotic drug.cal.health safety code.
categorical analysis 
applying the initial step in the taylor analysis,we first determine whether section categorically qualifies as a drug trafficking offense,as defined under the sentencing guidelines.in particular,we must determine how to interpret the term controlled substance,as it is used in the sentencing guidelines definition.if we construe the term as being tied to the federal definition of controlled substances from the csa,section can not qualify categorically because it criminalizes possession or purchase of substances that are not included in the csa.see infra.however,were we to adopt the definition of controlled substance urged by the government that it takes on its ordinary,common sense meaning,as a drug regulated by would automatically qualify categorically.
while we have not applied the taylor categorical analysis to determine whether various california drug statutes would qualify as a drug trafficking offense in the sentencing guidelines context,we have found occasion to do so in the immigration framework.first,in ruiz vidal gonzalez,cir,we held that california health safety code could not serve as a predicate offense for removal under a.we stated that there was no categorical fit because california law regulates the possession and sale of numerous substances that are not similarly regulated by the csa.id.at.next,in mielewczyk holder,cir,we held that california health safety code was categorically too broad,under a.we held the same in s yong holder,cir,addressing california health safety code.
were we to interpret drug trafficking offense in the sentencing context to be consistent with our interpretation in the immigration context,that its meaning is defined by the csa,section would be too broad to categorically qualify as a drug trafficking offense.the statute at issue in mielewczyk,california health safety code a,differs from section only in that it includes cocaine base.compare cal.health safety code listing numerous subsections and subparagraphs of controlled substances schedule statutes with id.a listing same subsections and subparagraphs,with one addition,subparagraph f of section see id.f cocaine base.cocaine base was not the reason we found section to be too broad in mielewczyk,because cocaine base is covered by the csa.see b a iii,b b iii.thus,like section,section also criminalizes possession or purchase of substances that are not covered under the csa.
we acknowledge that our holdings in the immigration context do not definitively resolve the issue we address here because the text of the immigration statute a differs from the text of the sentencing guidelines we interpret.the immigration statutes make deportable 
any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana.
a b i.thus,the text of the immigration statute states that the controlled substance must be one that is defined in section of title,which is the csa.
in contrast,the pertinent language in the sentencing guidelines differs from that of a b i because the term controlled substances is not therein expressly linked to the csa.the government asks us to find that this lack of explicit incorporation of the csa into the sentencing guidelines means that the sentencing guidelines do not limit the definition of controlled substances to the substances found in the csa.in support of its position,the government points to other portions of the sentencing guidelines which explicitly incorporate federal statutory definitions.see,application notes b i defining alien smuggling offense to refer to the meaning in a n id.application notes b v defining firearms offense to refer to firearms as described in.the government also contends that the history of the drafting of the sentencing guidelines counsels against incorporation of the csa into the definition of controlled substances.we reject these arguments,which are rooted in canons of statutory interpretation and presumptions of congressional intent under russello united states,d,because accepting the government position would undermine the reasoning underlying the categorical analysis in the first place,as articulated in taylor,as well as the purpose of the sentencing guidelines.
taylor aspires to a single national definition of a given crime under its categorical approach and we have recognized that the definition should include generic elements of the offense at issue.see estrada espinoza mukasey,cir en banc.
the underlying theory of taylor is that a national definition of the elements of a crime is required so as to permit uniform application of federal law in determining the federal effect of prior convictions without defined elements a comparison of the state statute with a generic offense is not possible.
id.internal citations and footnotes omitted.the purpose of the generic definition as envisioned in taylor was to ensure that there is some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by various s tates criminal codes.united states aguila montes de oca,cir en banc quoting taylor,at.applying these principles to the issue before us,the meaning of drug trafficking offense should not depend on the definition adopted by the state of conviction.taylor,at see also united states hudson,cir there is no reason why the guidelines sic must be restricted to a particular state concept of what is meant by that term.
the government contends that its position is still viable notwithstanding taylor focus.the guidelines include a specific national definition for drug trafficking offense the only question is whether the phrase controlled substance within that definition should take its broad ordinary meaning or should incorporate the specific list of the substances under the csa.this contention fails because defining the term controlled substance to have its ordinary meaning of a drug regulated by law would make what offenses constitute a drug offense necessarily depend on the state statute at issue.
the criminal act at issue here possession or purchase of a controlled substance is a crime because california defined certain substances,such as tar heroin,as being controlled.this crime is of a different nature than certain other crimes for which the courts have provided generic definitions.for example,in taylor,the court defined burglary to be any crime with the elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or other structure,with intent to commit a crime.taylor,at.thus,even if a state named a crime with these elements something different than burglary,the generic definition of the crime of burglary would still be met as long as the crime,under whatever name,required those elements.on the other hand,what makes the act of possessing or purchasing a substance for sale illegal under section is the fact that the substance must be controlled,under state law.thus,under the government position,the definition of what is a controlled substance is necessarily dependent on the state law.
the government next suggests that we can properly incorporate the ordinary meaning of the term controlled substance into section in the same way that courts have adopted an ordinary meaning for the term counterfeit substance.several circuits have found the meaning of counterfeit substance to be based on its plain,ordinary meaning,without reference to the csa,even though the term counterfeit substance is also defined in the csa.see,united states hudson,cir united states mills,cir united states robertson,cir united states crittenden,cir united states frazier,cir.
we find an important distinction between the terms counterfeit substances and controlled substances.the word counterfeit has a normal,everyday meaning that we all understand.see merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed defining counterfeit as made in imitation of something else with the intent to deceive forged black law dictionary ed defining counterfeit as to unlawfully forge,copy or imitate an item or to possess such an item without authorization and with the intent to deceive or defraud by presenting the item as genuine.accordingly,various courts have defined this term to include two components based on plain meaning made in imitation and with intent to deceive.see robertson,at crittenden,at.this definition of counterfeit substances has an independent meaning from however it may be defined in a specific state or federal statute.
the same is not true of the word controlled.while the word controlled may have a plain and ordinary meaning whether a substance is controlled must,of necessity,be tethered to some state,federal,or local law in a way that is not true of the definition of counterfeit.to construe the term controlled as the government urges would require the sentencing guidelines to take into account the substances that individual states control.this would be contrary to the goal of the sentencing guidelines to seek reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.ch.one,pt.
in light of the above,we decline to adopt the government position that the term controlled substance should mean any substance controlled by law.in order to effectuate the goal set forth in taylor of arriving at a national definition to permit uniform application of the sentencing guidelines,we hold that the term controlled substance,as used in the drug trafficking offense definition in,means those substances listed in the csa.our holding today harmonizes the definition in the sentencing guidelines with the immigration statute,and makes the taylor analysis under these two schemes consistent for these offenses.our holding is also consistent with the reasoning of the eighth circuit,which reached the same conclusion regarding whether california health safety code constituted a drug trafficking offense under.united states sanchez garcia,cir recognizing that the california statute and sentencing guidelines used the term controlled substance but that the sentencing guidelines did not define the term,and adopting the defendant position that the term should be defined as substances listed in the csa see also united states los santos,cir assuming that csa applies and that the categorical analysis does not apply to california health safety code under the sentencing guidelines.
