in this appeal we must determine whether a conviction under former georgia code ann.for felony attempted child molestation qualifies as a crime of violence within the meaning of sentencing guidelines manual b a ii.we hold that it does.a violation of former georgia code ann.categorically constituted sexual abuse of a minor,which the sentencing guidelines define as a crime of violence.we therefore affirm sentence.
raul is a native and citizen of mexico and an illegal alien in the united states.in august,a clayton county,georgia grand jury indicted him on two counts of felony attempted child molestation,in violation of ann.at the time,provided that a person commits the offense of child molestation when he does any immoral or indecent act to or in the presence of or with any child under the age of years with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of either the child or the person.ann.the indictment charged that,on two occasions and with two different children,attempted an immoral and indecent act with a child under years of age,with intent to arouse and satisfy the sexual desires of said accused by offering the child a cigarette if she would remove her clothes and show the accused her.at.pleaded guilty to both counts,and the state court sentenced him to one year imprisonment for each conviction,with the sentences to be served concurrently.
on january,an immigration judge ordered that be deported to mexico.was deported the next day,but between and,he illegally reentered the united states at least twice.during his illegal tenures in the united states,was convicted of a number of state crimes,including in both georgia and south carolina simple battery georgia possession of cocaine virginia theft maryland and taking indecent liberties with a child virginia 
on november,the virginia department of corrections contacted federal immigration agents and informed them that was in virginia custody but would soon be released.on december,a federal grand jury sitting in the eastern district of virginia indicted,charging him with being found in the united states after having been deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony,in violation of a and b west.pleaded guilty to the indictment the benefit of a written plea agreement.
thereafter,a probation officer prepared a presentence report psr for.the psr recommended an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.as part of the range calculation,the probation officer applied a enhancement to base offense level based on his conclusion that georgia convictions for felony attempted child molestation constituted crimes of violence under guideline b a ii.
both before and at his sentencing hearing,objected to the psr characterization of his georgia convictions as crimes of violence.although he conceded that the convictions supported an enhancement under b c because they qualified as aggravated felonies,contended that the enhancement was improper because his offenses involved no physical contact of any kind and were not violent in nature.at.the district court overruled objection,concluding that application of the b a ii enhancement was warranted because convictions for felony attempted child molestation qualified as crimes of violence.accordingly,the district court sentenced to months imprisonment,within the recommended advisory guidelines range.

if the end point of a sentencing proceeding is the district court selection of a reasonable sentence,the starting point,as the supreme court recently reiterated,is the correct calculation of the applicable guidelines range.gall united states,d stating that a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range.an error in the calculation of the applicable guidelines range,whether an error of fact or of law,infects all that follows at the sentencing proceeding,including the ultimate sentence chosen by the district court,and makes a sentence procedurally unreasonable even under our deferential standard.gall.at koon united states,d a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.
this appeal focuses on the starting point of sentencing he claims that the district court incorrectly calculated his advisory guidelines range.specifically,contends as he did below that the district court erred in applying the enhancement under guideline b a ii because his georgia convictions for felony attempted child molestation do not qualify as crimes of violence.of course,whether the district court erred in its characterization of crimes as crimes of violence is a question of law that we review de novo.united states smith,cir.
for defendants like who are convicted of unlawfully entering or remaining in the united states,the sentencing guidelines mandate a offense level enhancement if the defendant previously was deported,or unlawfully remained in the united states,after a conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence.b a ii.the application notes to define crime of violence as follows 
any of the following murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses,statutory rape,sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,burglary of a dwelling,or any offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.
cmt.emphasis added.
on appeal,as they did below,the parties focus their arguments on whether georgia convictions for felony attempted child molestation amounted to sexual abuse of a minor.we think this focus on sexual abuse of a minor is appropriate,for violations of ann.do not fit within any other specific criminal conduct listed in the guidelines definition of crime of violence.our discussion will thus center on whether crimes constituted sexual abuse of a minor.
to make this determination,we apply the categorical approach set forth in the supreme court decision in taylor united states,d.see also shepard united states,d describing taylor categorical approach.under taylor,we look only to the statutory definition of the state crime and the fact of conviction to determine whether the conduct criminalized by the statute,including the most innocent conduct,qualifies as a crime of violence.taylor,at.taylor does not require that we strain credulity or apply our legal imagination to the statute language to arrive at some violation of the statute that would not qualify as a crime of violence.gonzales,d.rather,there must be a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the definition of crime of violence.james united states,d.
in a narrow range of cases,however,resort to the statute of offense and fact of conviction will not confirm the predicate nature of the state crime.taylor,at.in those cases where the state statute is categorically is,where it is evident from the statutory definition of the state crime that some violations of the statute are crimes of violence and others are apply what sometimes is referred to as the modified categorical approach,which was also set forth in taylor and later discussed in shepard.soliman gonzales,cir.under the modified categorical approach,we determine whether a defendant specific conduct qualifies as a crime of violence by looking to the terms of the charging document and,if necessary in a nonjury case,to the terms of a plea agreement,the transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant,or some comparable judicial record revealing the factual basis for the plea.shepard,at.in shepard,the supreme court confirmed that the limits on the type of evidence that we may consider under the modified categorical approach are of constitutional dimension they prevent appellate courts from usurping the jury role and thus violating the defendant sixth amendment rights by finding facts about a past crime under the guise of determining the nature of the crime.id.at.
with this framework in place,we turn to consider whether georgia convictions for felony attempted child molestation constituted sexual abuse of a minor,and thus qualify as crimes of violence under the sentencing guidelines.
before we can determine whether crimes constituted sexual abuse of a minor,however,we must know what sexual abuse of a minor means.because the sentencing guidelines do not define the phrase,we interpret it by employing the common meaning of the words that the sentencing commission used.see pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d courts properly assume,absent sufficient indication to the contrary,that congress intends the words in its enactments to carry their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.internal quotation marks omitted.our interpretive task is streamlined here because concedes that a violation of former ann.by definition was sexual in nature and involved a minor.he could hardly argue otherwise the common meanings of sexual of or relating to the sphere of behavior associated with libidinal gratification,webster third new int l dictionary and minor a word whose meaning is fairly the conduct prohibited by the statute,which criminalized child molestation and applied only if the victim was under years of age.this leaves us only to determine the meaning of abuse as that term is used in the phrase sexual abuse of a minor,and then to consider the phrase as a whole to arrive at its meaning.
we begin with dictionary definitions of the word abuse.see united states,cir per curiam looking to dictionary definitions to define sexual abuse of a minor united states,cir same united states,cir same.black law dictionary defines abuse as a departure from legal or reasonable use misuse p hysical or mental maltreatment,often resulting in mental,emotional,sexual or physical injury.black law dictionary ed.similarly,webster defines abuse as improper or incorrect use misuse application to a wrong or bad purpose the act of violating sexually.webster third new int l dictionary.these definitions reveal that,at the highest level of generality,abuse means misuse or use for an incorrect or bad purpose.
in addition to dictionary definitions,our understanding of sexual abuse of a minor must also take into account recent changes in the guidelines definition of crime of violence.until,the application notes to defined crime of violence as follows 
a n offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another and includes murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses including sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,and burglary of a dwelling.
cmt.concerned that this definition often led to confusion over whether the specified offenses listed in that definition,particularly sexual abuse of a minor and residential burglary,also had to include as an element of the offense the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,amendment,in the sentencing commission amended the definition of crime of violence to read as follows 
any of the following murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses,statutory rape,sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,burglary of a dwelling,or any offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.
in amending the definition of crime of violence,the sentencing commission wanted to make clear the enumerated offenses are always crimes of violence,regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.amendment.thus,it is clear that a crime that otherwise qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor will not escape that designation simply because it does not require the use,or threatened use,of physical force against another.
our discussion to this point has not covered contentious ground,for the parties generally agree that sexual abuse of a minor involves the misuse or mistreatment of a minor and that it does not require the use of physical force.they part ways,however,over whether sexual abuse of a minor requires some physical or psychological injury to the child.claims that it does the government claims that it does not we agree with the government.
we begin by noting that the almost irresistible inference to be drawn from the sentencing commission amendment to the definition of crime of violence is that sexual abuse of a minor does not require physical injury to the abused.if offenses that do not involve the use,or threatened use,of force may qualify as sexual abuse of a minor,then it stands to reason that sexual abuse of a minor does not per se require physical injury to the abused,even if such injury is,unfortunately,common.
quite apart from this strong clue to the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor,we think that the ordinary meaning of the phrase sexual abuse confirms that no physical or psychological injury is required for the abuse to be complete.employing the common meaning of the words sexual and abuse,the phrase sexual abuse means the use or misuse of a person for purposes of sexual gratification.the clear focus of the phrase is on the intent of the on the effect on the abused.however one styles it,sexual abuse is an phrase the misuse of the child for sexual purposes completes the abusive act.
we are not alone in this conclusion.in,the ninth circuit defined sexual abuse of a minor as t he use of young children for the gratification of sexual desires.at.in doing so,the court held that the effect on the victim is irrelevant,id.at,and that the use of young children as objects of sexual gratification constitutes maltreatment,no matter its form,id,in,the eleventh circuit,focusing on the perpetrator intent,defined sexual abuse of a minor as a perpetrator physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.at.although the court noted that sexual abuse usually results in psychological injury for the victim,regardless of whether any physical injury was incurred,id.emphasis added,it did not engraft such injury into the definition of sexual abuse of a minor.these courts share our view that once a defendant misuses the minor with the intent to achieve sexual gratification,the act of abuse is complete,irrespective of whether the minor suffered some physical or psychological injury.
the contrary sexual abuse of a minor requires,at a minimum,some psychological injury to the enmesh the courts in thorny issues of psychology and perhaps insulate some of the most reprehensible forms of sexual molestation of children from enhancement under b a ii.first,it would be difficult to determine in many cases whether a sexual crime necessarily results in psychological injury to the child.consider,for instance,the molester who chooses as his victim a very young child.the child may be too young to understand the nature of the molester advances,at,but is the child too young to suffer some minimal psychological injury we are confident that the sentencing commission did not intend the application of b a ii to turn on whether judges have a subscription to the american journal of psychology,as we are confident that the commission did not intend application of the enhancement to depend on whether the government or the defendant wins in a battle of psychology experts.
this illustration also highlights another conceptual problem with requiring some injury to the child,be it physical or psychological,for sexual abuse of a minor to have occurred.such a requirement would potentially exonerate certain defendants from application of b a ii enhancement simply because they chose to commit their act in the presence of or to a child too young to understand the nature of the defendant perverted act,and thus perhaps too young to suffer some psychological injury.in our view,this result is more than just anomalous it is absurd.instead,we believe that a sexual abuser is guilty of sexual abuse of a minor even if he chooses very young victims,molests sleeping
