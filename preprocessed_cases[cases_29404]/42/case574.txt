mary newman afful,a native and citizen of ghana,petitions for relief from an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge decision.afful argues that the bia committed three reversible errors affirming the immigration judge denial of her applications for political asylum and withholding of deportation affirming the immigration judge denial of her application for suspension of deportation as pretermitted and denying her motion to remand the case to an immigration judge.we affirm the bia order in full.
afful entered the united states at new york,new york in october using another person passport.on march,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause charging afful with entering the united states on may,without inspection.at a hearing before the immigration judge on october,afful admitted the allegations against her,conceded removability,and requested asylum,withholding of removal,and suspension of deportation.on september,the ins amended the order to show cause to read that afful entered the united states in october.on the same day,the immigration judge held a hearing on afful asylum application,continuing the case to may.on october,the ins added a charge for procuring entry into the united states through fraud or willful misrepresentation of material fact because afful had admitted at the september,hearing that she had used another person passport to enter the united states.
on october,the immigration judge denied afful applications for asylum,withholding of deportation,suspension of deportation and voluntary departure.afful appealed to the bia on november.on june,afful filed a motion to remand to the immigration judge so that she could apply for adjustment of status due to the filing of an approved form filed by her employer.on march,the bia affirmed the immigration judge decision and denied afful motion to remand.this appeal followed.
denial of asylum and withholding of deportation 
section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a,authorizes the attorney general to exercise his discretion to grant asylum to refugee aliens.the alien bears the burden of demonstrating eligibility for asylum.see albathani ins,cir.an applicant may meet that burden by demonstrating past persecution or a fear of future persecution based on race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.quoting b internal quotation marks omitted.to establish past persecution,an applicant must provide conclusive evidence that she was targeted on any of the five grounds.fesseha ashcroft,cir quoting albathani,at.to show a fear of future persecution,an applicant must meet both subjective and objective prongs.id.citation omitted.to satisfy the objective prong,an applicant testimony alone may be sufficient,but it must constitute credible and specific evidence of a reasonable fear of persecution.el moraghy ashcroft,cir.to meet the subjective prong,the applicant must show her fear is genuine.see ins,cir.
determinations of eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard fesseha,at.the agency decision is upheld if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.quoting ins,d.under the substantial evidence standard,t o reverse the bia finding,we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion,but compels it,at.emphasis in original.
afful testified that she had a fear of persecution on account of her affiliation with the popular front party pfp,a political group opposed to the military regime in ghana run by general jerry rawlings.according to her testimony,afful attended pfp rallies two to three times a month.she helped her two brothers,and joe donkor,by distributing leaflets,participating in meetings,and keeping important party documents that were critical of military rule.she testified that her brother took the papers from her around.when the immigration judge asked afful what happened in the five years between and when she left ghana,afful testified that her brother was arrested and that the government was mistreating people.afful testified that her brother,a leader of the pfp,lost his property and was arrested at least three times by the government because of his involvement with the pfp.he was never physically harmed.her brother joe donkor lost his job and had his house ransacked due to his membership in the pfp.afful testified that the government was aware of her membership with the pfp because of her affiliation with her brothers,although she was never arrested.
afful admitted that she used another person passport to enter the united states.when asked why she had pled to entering the united states without inspection when she had actually entered with another person passport,afful responded that she was afraid.the immigration judge then asked afful if she told her attorneys that she entered the united states using another person passport.after the immigration judge admonished afful several times to tell the truth,afful testified that she had not told her attorneys but then contradicted herself and said that she had.
afful asylum application stated that she entered the united states on may,during testimony she admitted,however,that she actually entered in october.the immigration judge asked afful whether she told her attorneys about the incorrect date before or after it was filed with the ins.afful had to be reminded repeatedly to answer the question and tell the truth fully before afful stated that she told her attorneys about the incorrect date after the application was submitted to the ins.the immigration judge also asked afful whether she told the immigration officer at her asylum interview about the incorrect date.afful admitted that she did not tell the immigration officer about the incorrect date and instead told the officer that everything in her application was true.
credibility determination 
the immigration judge found that afful testimony concerning her fear of returning to ghana was not credible.w hen a hearing officer who saw and heard a witness makes an adverse credibility finding and supports it with specific findings,an appellate court ordinarily should accord it significant respect,at citations omitted.we begin by confirming that the immigration judge offer ed a specific,cogent reason for his disbelief.qin ashcroft,cir quoting el moraghy,at,and review the immigration judge reason on the substantial evidence standard,at.
the immigration judge discussed the fact that afful asylum application said she entered the country in,when she actually entered the country in.the immigration judge noted that afful failed to inform anyone,including her attorneys,that she had fraudulently entered the country using someone else passport.the immigration judge also discussed afful admission that she did not give truthful answers to the immigration officer who interviewed afful under oath in connection with her asylum application.finally,the immigration judge found that afful testimony was evasive and contradictory.these findings were amply supported by the record,which shows that the immigration judge had to ask afful questions repeatedly before she answered,and that the immigration judge had to admonish afful on numerous occasions to tell the truth.for example,the immigration judge had to ask afful repeatedly if she told her attorneys that she had used another person passport to enter the united states before afful gave an answer that was both evasive and contradictory
