yu zhao,a native of the people republic of china,attempted to enter the united states illegally.at a hearing before an immigration judge ij,zhao applied for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij refused to withhold removal and denied asylum on the ground that zhao showed neither past persecution nor a fear of future persecution.
the board of immigration appeals bia or board dismissed zhao appeal.he filed a motion for reconsideration,contending that his fear of future persecution was reasonable and that the ij should have given more weight to certain documentary and testimonial evidence.
zhao petitioned this court to review the bia determinations he consolidated that petition with the one he had filed before moving for reconsideration.we grant the petition for review and reverse the board decision.
posing as an american citizen,zhao tried to enter the united states illegally in march.the government issued a notice to appear,alleging that zhao was subject to removal for falsely representing himself as a citizen.zhao conceded that he was subject to removal but asked for,and was granted,permission to file an application for asylum and withholding of deportation,which he did in july.
at his initial hearing,zhao attempted to submit,among other things,three contested documents to the ij two written notices issued to him from guantou town village committee demanding his appearance at the town government and a police summons demanding his appearance at the police station.the government objected,arguing that the documents did not conform to,the regulation governing proof of official foreign records.
the ij agreed with the government but gave zhao more time to authenticate the documents.in february the ij held a hearing on the merits of zhao application for asylum and withholding of deportation.zhao had not authenticated the documents pursuant to by the beginning of that hearing,so the ij excluded them.
zhao was the only person to testify at the hearing,but the ij credited all of his testimony,which established the following falun gong is a movement that professes to help its practitioners gain through spiritual and physical development.zhao started to practice falun gong in to cure his dizzy spells and back pain.zhao began his falun gong practice under the tutelege of master zhao kai feng,a mentor he had known since childhood.
in april,zhao joined about forty other participants in a silent protest outside the town hall for quanto county in fujian province.that protest and zhao participation in it were filmed.later that year,while he was visiting a friend,zhao mother told him the police had been looking for him and that authorities had arrested feng.she cautioned zhao not to return home.
zhao bicycled to his aunt house and hid for several weeks.he then learned that the police had arrested other falun gong followers.after hiding out at his aunt,zhao traveled by bus to fuzhou city,where he helped his uncle at a construction site,but this activity was limited,and he was there primarily to hide out.during his stay in fuzhou city,zhao mother visited him and told of further police visits to their house.
at the end of february,zhao traveled to beijing by bus because the government had begun a massive crackdown on falun gong practitioners.zhao family soon arranged for him to travel to the united states.zhao found it too difficult to hide in the people republic of china because authorities were hunting down falun gong practitioners everywhere,and he believed the united states would afford him the protection he needed.in march,he traveled to the united states with his fake passport.
since then,zhao has learned that approximately to falun gong practitioners have died during torture and that about practitioners have been exiled or sentenced to hard labor without a conviction.he learned that the chinese authorities had incarcerated some practitioners in mental facilities and injected them with medicine that mess ed up their nervous systems.zhao was afraid to return to the people republic of china,where he believes the authorities will imprison and torture him.
zhao practices falun gong every morning for twenty to thirty minutes.he has participated in one public,organized falun gong activity in the new jersey area since his arrival there.
after hearing zhao testimony,the ij denied the application for asylum and withholding of deportation.although the ij found that zhao was a credible witness and grudgingly that falun gong falls within the state department operative definition of religion,the ij found that zhao had not established either past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of a protected characteristic.
on appeal,the bia,in a per curiam opinion,affirmed the ij decision under e.the bia affirmed the ij determination that zhao had not established past persecution and that his fear of future persecution was not objectively reasonable.the board also noted that zhao had testified that he currently seldom practices falun gong and,when he does,he practices in private.the board found that zhao had never had any contact with government officials despite traveling about china for months after the police expressed interest in him.
zhao timely filed a motion to reconsider,the arguments he had raised before the ij and,for the first time,including an appeal of the ij exclusion of his three unauthenticated documents.he also sought to submit other items documenting worsening conditions in the people republic of china.
in december,the bia denied reconsideration.it declined to consider the ij evidentiary ruling because zhao had failed to raise it in his initial appeal.zhao timely petitioned this court to review both the bia initial decision affirming the ij findings and its denial of his motion to reopen.
seeking to introduce the unauthenticated documents and the two state department reports,zhao contends that the bia erred in rejecting his motion to reconsider.although zhao labels his motion as one for reconsideration,he both current documents and arguments and seeks to submit new evidence.
because he seeks to introduce new evidence,his motion is also one to reopen.see pierre ins,cir.these two types of motion are distinguished primarily by the fact that a motion for reconsideration does not present new evidence to the bia.irrespective of how zhao labels it,we will consider his motion as both one to reopen and one to reconsider.see id.at.
we review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion a motion for reconsideration urges an adjudicative body to the record evidence only.see ghassan,at.insofar as zhao motion was one for reconsideration,his effort fails because he did not identify a change in the law,a misapplication of the law,or an aspect of the case that the bia overlooked.see pierre,at.
zhao sought to reopen the record to introduce two new documents.those documents are the department of justice international religious freedom reports religious freedom reports,issued in october and the department of justice country reports on human rights practices for country reports,issued in march.
in this circuit,the degree to which a b ii precludes judicial review of motions to reopen immigration proceedings is an open question we have pretermitted this thorny question where there were alternative means of resolving the relevant issues.see,assaad,at declining to reach the issue because the court lacked jurisdiction for other reasons.we now at last address the issue.although the parties did not raise or brief this question,we must examine the basis of our subject matter jurisdiction,on our own motion if necessary 
section a b ii proscribes judicial review of any decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general emphasis added.the government does not raise the issue,but there is a question whether bars judicial review of all motions to reopen,and we may not exercise appellate jurisdiction that we do not have.in ashcroft,cir,the court held that a b ii does not impose a complete jurisdictional bar.the instant circumstances present a question that is in all meaningful respects identical,and we agree with the ninth circuit reasoning.
the subsection explicitly excepts asylum determinations,made pursuant to a,from its jurisdictional prohibitions.the operative statutory text precludes judicial review of all actions specified as discretionary under that provision subchapter other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.a b ii.we therefore have two potential sources of appellate jurisdiction either zhao motion to reopen is a granting of relief under a or his motion is not specified as seeking discretionary relief under subchapter ii of title.we do not consider the first possibility,because we may easily resolve the question in zhao favor using the second justification.
outside of the a proviso,the text of a b ii makes plain that we do not have the jurisdiction to review certain discretionary actions of the attorney general.the law,however,proscribes judicial review of a discretionary action only where it is specified under the subsection of title that governs immigration proceedings.
before the authority to reopen a deportation proceeding derived exclusively from a regulation promulgated by the attorney general,c in c,however,congress set forth a set of rules governing review of motions to reopen immigration proceedings.that subsection states that an alien may file one such motion,c a specifies that the motion shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material,c b and sets forth relevant deadlines,c c.these provisions,however,only set forth the standards for evaluating a motion to reopen they do not furnish us with a level of deference to afford the attorney general in making that evaluation.
a federal regulation,b,furnishes the quantum of discretion the attorney general enjoys when entertaining motions to reopen.that regulation provides that an immigration judge has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party has established a prima facie case for relief.id.
one might mistakenly read a b ii as stripping us of the authority to review any discretionary immigration decision.that reading,however,is incorrect,because a b ii strips us only of jurisdiction to review discretionary authority specified in the statute.the statutory language is uncharacteristically pellucid on this score it does not allude generally to discretionary authority or to discretionary authority exercised under this statute,but specifically to authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general.id.emphasis added.
in ruling on zhao motion,however,the bia exercised no such statutorily delineated discretion that discretion instead derived from regulations promulgated by the attorney general.one might argue that the statute authorizes such a regulatory delegation of discretion and that the underlying activity should therefore be immune from our scrutiny,but such a construction would belie congress conspicuous selection of the phrase specified under this subchapter.aware that there is some caselaw from other circuits to the contrary,we conclude that we have authority to review the motion to reopen 
in exercising that authority,we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen or to reconsider under a highly deferential standard our standard of review is the same irrespective of whether the petitioner seeks withholding of deportation or makes an asylum request with regard to how we actually apply this standard to the board denial of a motion to reopen,
t he standard is whether the board has acted within the bounds of an abundant discretion granted it by congress.it is our duty to allow the decision to be made by the attorney general delegate,even a decision that we deem in error,so long as it is not capricious,racially invidious,utterly without foundation in the evidence,or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.
pritchett,at cir quoting osuchukwu ins,cir alterations in original.
in doherty,the court held that m otions for reopening of immigration proceedings are disfavored for the same reasons as are petitions for rehearing and motions for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.doherty,at.citing abudu,at.indeed,c states that a motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the board that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing 
the board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen the record to admit the unauthenticated documents.those documents had been presented before the ij,who excluded them,and zhao failed to contest this ruling on direct appeal.although the documents are material,c is stated in the conjunctive,and the documents were plainly available and considered in the hearing before the ij.
the bia failure to the record to admit the international freedom reports and the country reports,however,rests on far more precarious logic.the bia dispenses,in a single sentence,with zhao attempt to reopen the record to admit these documents to the extent that zhao seeks reopening for the submission of previously unavailable evidence,we find insufficient cause to reopen,as zhao new evidence largely repeats the extensive country condition information already in the record.as we overturn this ruling,we take full account of the broad discretion delegated to the board in adjudicating these motions.here,however,the board erred egregiously in its conclusion.
the board requires an applicant to provide corroborating evidence where it is reasonable to do so.specifically,general background information about a country,where available,must be included in the record as a foundation for the applicant claim.matter of,wl emphasis added.
the ij issued her decision on february,before publication of the international freedom reports and the country reports.although deals with an asylum applicant failure to include crucial background documentation,it would be a bizarre policy indeed to require the applicant to provide the country reports before the issuance of an ij final order,but categorically to refuse to allow him to introduce them,once they become available,on a motion to reopen.that is not to say that any or even a substantial variety of documentation should require the bia to reopen asylum proceedings,but it is to say that,in the name of legal consistency,there must be some situations in which the content of the new documentation requires that result.
the government argues,as the bia reasoned,that the country reports do not justify reopening the record because they merely restate the conditions described in the country reports.here the government is somewhat disingenuous.when,at oral argument,the government sought to rebut the contention that the chinese government persecutes mere practitioners of falun gong,it reminded us that evidence regarding chinese persecution of was contained in the country reports,not the reports.the government can not simultaneously argue that,on the one hand,the country reports contain a crucial piece of evidence that is absent from the country reports in the record and,on the other,that the two new documents are redundant.
according to the department of state international religious freedom report,
since the chinese government banned the falun gong in and began a comprehensive nationwide repression of the movement,the practice of falun gong or possession of its literature has been sufficient grounds for practitioners to receive punishment ranging from loss of employment and education opportunities to imprisonment.some falun gong members have been tortured in custody and there have been reports that several hundred or more falun gong adherents have died in detention since.falun gong members who disrupt public order or distribute publications may be sentenced to to years in prison 
emphasis added.the next paragraph of that document adds that e ven practitioners were forced to attend gong classes.those who refused to recant their belief were sent to camps,where,in some cases,beatings and torture were used to force them to recant their beliefs.
the country reports echo this description of practitioners treatment since the chinese government banned the falun gong in,the mere belief in the discipline and since january,even without any public manifestation of its tenets has been sufficient grounds for practitioners to receive punishment ranging from loss of employment to imprisonment.emphasis added.
if the position of the united states government is that the record evidence introduced at the initial administrative hearing does not demonstrate that mere practitioners were the objects of chinese government persecution,then the previously unavailable documents zhao sought to introduce into the record must be admitted on a motion to,because they establish precisely that crucial proposition the bia abused even its abundant discretion in failing to allow the documents to be introduced 
under a the attorney general enjoys authority to grant asylum to any alien who qualifies as a refugee under a a.for purposes of this statute,a refugee is 
any person who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
a a emphasis added.
the decision to grant or deny asylum involves two components.first,the alien must demonstrate that he has been persecuted or has a fear of persecution on account of one of the factors listed in a a that the alien qualifies as a refugee under the statute does not,however,automatically entitle him to asylum.the language of is precatory,and the decision to grant or deny asylum is within the ij discretion 
the ij found that there was no evidence of past persecution and that zhao credited testimony was legally insufficient to establish a fear of future persecution.specifically,the ij found that zhao had presented no evidence that any chinese government official ever confronted him at any time for any reason.the ij did not question zhao veracity but stated that zhao simply failed to make his case.that the ij did not doubt zhao testimony is significant,because we must accept as true all the facts to which zhao testified.the question is merely the interpretation and legal sufficiency of those facts.
we use the substantial evidence standard to review the ij factual conclusion that an alien is not eligible for asylum.see chun,at citing adebisi,at.under substantial evidence review,we can not reverse the bia factual determinations unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion,but also that the evidence compels it.id.citing ins,d.the alien must prove that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.see id.i t is the factfinder duty to make determinations based on the credibility of the witnesses.id.citing ins,cir.we will not substitute our judgment for that of the bia or ij with respect to the credibility of witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.id.
there is no error in the ij determination that zhao has failed to demonstrate past persecution.zhao points to no evidence that the government ever arrested,detained,interrogated,or harmed him or his family.see faddoul,at.as the ij noted,there is no evidence in the record that a government official ever confronted zhao because of his involvement in falun gong.
to establish a fear of future persecution,an alien must demonstrate a subjective fear of persecution,and that fear must be objectively reasonable.eduard ashcroft,cir quoting ashcroft,cir.the ina does not define persecution,but we have described it as t he infliction of suffering or harm,under government sanction,upon persons who differ in a way regarded as offensive,race,religion,political opinion,in a manner condemned by civilized governments.ins,cir.the harm or suffering need not be physical,but may take other forms,such as the deliberate imposition of severe economic disadvantage or the deprivation of liberty,food,housing,employment or other essentials of life.id.the applicant,however,need not provide evidence that he would be singled out for persecution,if 
a he establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his country of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion and 
b he establishes his own inclusion in,and identification with,such a group of persons such that his fear of persecution upon return to that country is reasonable.
b iii a b.there are therefore two different ways for zhao to prove the objectivity of his persecution claim.first,he can show that he would be singled out for persecution.alternately,he can satisfy the two prongs of b iii.
the ij explicitly credited zhao testimony,so zhao possession of a subjective fear is not at issue.with regard to the fear of future persecution,the alien subjective fear will satisfy this standard if a reasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution if he were to be returned to his native country.faddoul,at quoting guevara flores ins,cir.this standard,however,does not require zhao to demonstrate that he will be persecuted on returning to the people republic of china.it requires a lesser showing of must show to a reasonable degree that his return there would be intolerable.see eduard,at citing mikhael,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
this court regards the reasonableness inquiry as one into both subjective and objective fear.to establish the objective reasonableness of a fear of future persecution,the alien must prove that 
he possesses a belief or characteristic a persecutor seeks to overcome by means of punishment of some sort the persecutor is already aware,or could become aware,that the alien possesses this belief or characteristic the persecutor has the capability of punishing the alien and,the persecutor has the inclination to punish the alien.
eduard,at citing matter of mogharrabi,i n,bia.
two further legal points merit repeating.first,the test does not require zhao to prove that he had been personally targeted,because such an interpretation would render the future persecution inquiry redundant of the past persecution analysis.see id.at.second,zhao need not prove that the chinese government was actually aware that he was a falun gong practitioner although it is fairly certain from the record that it was,but merely that that government easily could become aware of such status.see id.at.
with regard to zhao alleged fear of future persecution,the ij found that 
t he respondent argues that he is concerned about the future persecution.however,the respondent also has indicated that he has not been very much involved in the practice of the spiritual exercise.in fact,he indicated in his initial testimony that he did have time because he studying and trying to better himself.he had an education.
that passage is the extent of the ij finding concerning zhao alleged fear of future persecution on returning to the people republic of china.in determining the objective justification for that fear,the ij focused solely on zhao falun gong practice in the united states.
in essence,the ij reasoned that zhao could not have a fear of future persecution because he seldom practices falun gong publicly in new york.zhao argues that the ij drew the wrong conclusions from the record testimony and failed to consider other testimony that supports his claim.noting the flaws in the ij apparent inferences,we agree.
with respect to the first element of the reasonableness the applicant possesses a belief or characteristic that a persecutor seeks to overcome by means of punishment of some government does not dispute that zhao is a falun gong practitioner.the ij explicitly notes that falun gong fits within the statutory meaning of the word religion.in her mystifying analysis,the ij infers from zhao infrequent public falun gong participation that he no longer qualifies for pr
