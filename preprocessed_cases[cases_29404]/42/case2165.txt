petitioner,ferenc csekinek,appeals the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the finding of the immigration judge ij that csekinek is removable pursuant to a e i based on his march domestic violence conviction.he also appeals the ij decision denying as untimely his application for asylum and denying him withholding of deportation.csekinek claims that the ij impermissibly used the date of his sentencing hearing as the date of his domestic violence conviction,as that term is used in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira.csekinek argues that an earlier date on which he allegedly pled guilty to the domestic violence charge should have been used as the date of his conviction,and that because that guilty plea was entered before the effective date of the iirira,it can not be the basis for his being found to be removable.csekinek also asks this court to hold that civil deportation proceedings are,in essence,criminal proceedings which can violate the ex post facto clause contained in article i of the united states constitution,or,alternatively,that to apply iirira to him would violate due process.finally,csekinek claims that he has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances justifying the untimeliness of his application for asylum,and that his application should not have been rejected on that ground.because csekinek claims are either without merit or are unreviewable,we affirm the judgment of the ij and the bia.
csekinek entered the united states on a visitor visa.he married a united states citizen in january,and his immigration status was adjusted to that of permanent resident.csekinek was thereafter twice convicted of domestic violence in the state of ohio.following the second conviction,the immigration and naturalization service the service instituted removal proceedings and served csekinek with a notice to appear.the ij conducted the first hearing on the merits of the charge of removability on november.after reviewing the only evidence presented with regard to the domestic violence convictions,the ij concluded that the service had proven both convictions by clear and convincing evidence.the ij stated,however,and the service conceded,that the earlier of the two convictions was not material to the proceedings because it predated iirira.
the ij found,and csekinek counsel conceded,that the date of the second conviction was march,the date on which judgment was pronounced and csekinek was sentenced.that date was well after the effective date of iirira.the ij found csekinek removable pursuant to a e i on the basis of the second conviction.however,the ij continued the proceedings in order to permit csekinek to file an application for asylum,noting that although csekinek had failed to apply for asylum within one year of his last arrival in the united states or by april,whichever was later,csekinek circumstances were sufficiently unusual that he might be able to demonstrate justification for the untimeliness of the application.
csekinek filed an application for asylum and for withholding of removal,and after several additional continuances,the ij held another hearing on those matters.at the conclusion of that hearing,the ij ruled that the service had proven by clear and convincing evidence that csekinek was removable under a e i on the basis of his domestic violence conviction dated march,that csekinek had not demonstrated cause for his failure to file an application for asylum within the statutory period that his application for asylum was untimely and that csekinek was therefore not eligible for asylum and that csekinek had not established any basis to support his application for withholding of removal.the ij therefore ordered csekinek removed to hungary and denied the applications for asylum and withholding of removal.the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision and csekinek timely appealed to this court.
because the bia affirmed the decision of the ij without opinion,the ij decision is the final agency determination.a.accordingly,it is the ij decision that we review in this appeal.we review the ij factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard,which requires that we affirm those determinations unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it.hammer ins,cir quoting adhiyappa ins,cir.we review all questions of law de novo.id.
csekinek assigns as error the ij determination that his second domestic violence conviction occurred on march,after the effective date of iirira.he correctly notes that iirira defines a conviction as a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or,if adjudication of guilt has been withheld,where i a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt,and ii the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty or restraint on the alien liberty to be imposed.a a.although he has provided no evidence to support his claim,csekinek maintains that march,was the date of his conviction because on that date he pled guilty and the judge ordered him to report to probation and imposed a personal bond upon him.
before reaching the question of which date is proper for conviction purposes,we must determine whether csekinek exhausted his administrative remedies as to this issue.exhaustion of administrative remedies requires the petitioner to first argue the claim before the ij or the bia before an appeal may be taken.d juarez ins,cir.the petitioner failure to do so strips this court of jurisdiction to review the bia decision.d perkovic ins,cir.the ins contends that csekinek never argued before the ij that his second conviction predated the effective date of iirira,and this court therefore lacks jurisdiction to review this claim.csekinek maintains that he either raised the error under an umbrella assignment of errors or that he preserved the issue by arguing it in a slightly different manner,citing ins,cir.
it is clear that csekinek did not raise this assignment of error before the bia.the regulations in effect at the time that csekinek pursued his appeal to the bia required that his notice of appeal explicitly identify the grounds for his appeal.
b statement of the basis of appeal.
the party taking the appeal must identify the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal form or form or in any attachments thereto,in order to avoid summary dismissal pursuant to d i.the statement must specifically identify the findings of fact,the conclusions of law,or both,that are being challenged.if a question of law is presented,supporting authority must be cited.if the dispute is over the findings of fact,the specific facts contested must be identified.
in his notice of appeal to the bia,csekinek stated ten grounds for appeal.except for the umbrella assignment of error,each ground was specific and particularized,and made no mention of any claim that his conviction predated the effective date of iirira.the umbrella assignment of error states,other errors of law and facts were made which will be fully cited and briefed upon receipt of the transcripts of the hearing.this general statement contains nothing that is required by section b,and is wholly inadequate to raise any claim before the bia.viewed in the most charitable light,his umbrella assignment of error is a general objection to the decision of the ij.the regulations contain no provision authorizing the use of a general objection to preserve any issue for review.
csekinek alternatively contends that he argued this issue in a slightly different manner in front of the ij and has therefore preserved this issue on appeal.see,at.failing to argue an issue at all before the ij is not the equivalent of arguing the issue in a slightly different manner.and csekinek not only failed to argue the issue at all,he conceded the point.upon being told the effective date of the iirira,csekinek counsel responded,
q.the reason i ask is because in fact the march date refers to his sentencing but he 
which is unfortunately the date when the conviction was final.
considered final,okay.
this exchange clearly indicates that csekinek acknowledged and conceded that,for purposes of this removal hearing,the date of his conviction was the date of his sentencing hearing.we hold that csekinek failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to this assignment of error,and that we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider it.
even if we could find that csekinek exhausted his administrative remedies,we would also hold that the ij did not err in using the march sentencing hearing as the date of his conviction.in order to conclude to the contrary,we would have to ignore the mandate of b a that the court of appeals shall decide the petition for review of an order of removal on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.there are no court documents in the record either identifying the date on which csekinek pled guilty to this offense,or corroborating his contentions that he pled guilty on march,that he was ordered to report to probation or that a personal bond was imposed on that date.even csekinek own unsworn statement apparently submitted as part of his application for asylum does not support these claims,but says that csekinek was charged with domestic violence in,that he fled the jurisdiction prior to being sentenced,and that in i pled guilty to an amended charge 
csekinek next argues that the application of the iirira in these deportation proceedings violates the ex post facto clause and denies him due process.the service does not challenge csekinek ability to raise these constitutional claims for the first time before this court.we need not,and therefore do not,address this question because csekinek provides no basis for either claim.
csekinek argues that immigration proceedings are criminal rather than civil proceedings,and that they can therefore violate the ex post facto clause.according to csekinek brief on appeal,t he deportation of criminal aliens is intrinsically inseparable from the criminal conduct for which the alien is being deported and courts can not continue to ignore factors favoring the designation of judicial deportations as criminal proceedings.interwoven in csekinek ex post facto claim is his contention that application of the iirira in this case violates due process requirements,because deportation was not a consequence of csekinek criminal acts at the time that he pled guilty to them.n oncitizens legitimately rely on their knowledge of deportation consequences for their crimes when they enter a guilty plea,his brief contends,and a permanent resident has a reasonable expectation to know the severity of the consequences flowing from his conviction at the time his guilty plea or nolo contendere is entered.
each of csekinek claims is baseless.the supreme court has specifically held that immigration and deportation proceedings are civil,and not criminal,in nature.ins,d a deportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country.the supreme court has thus definitively stated that the ex post facto clause does not apply to such proceedings.see galvan press.i t has been the unbroken rule of this court that the ex post facto clause has no application to deportation.csekinek brief recognizes this,and suggests that we look at the accepted legal fiction of deportation as a civil procedure and treat it for what it truly is a penalty intertwined with violations of criminal statutes and criminal procedures.the failure to accept this position,his brief complains,results other things the lazy reliance of courts on precedent.in fact,of course,we are bound by supreme court precedent on this issue.a precedent of the supreme court must be followed by the lower federal courts hutto davis,d emphasis added.nothing in this case presents an ex post facto problem.
csekinek due process claim,to the extent that it differs at all from his ex post facto claim,relies entirely on his assertion that deportation was not a consequence of his criminal acts at the time that he pled guilty to them.this is,in essence,merely another attempt to raise the claim that he pled guilty to the second charge of domestic violence prior to the enactment of the iirira.but as we have held hereinabove,csekinek can not argue that factual issue before this court because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.see d.
csekinek further contends that his due process rights were violated even if his second conviction occurred in march,and not,as he posits,in march.no one informed him during his sentencing on march,that the immigration law had been changed and he had become deportable petitioner pled guilty before the enactment of iirira.this contention is equally without foundation.section a e i was enacted on september.the adjudication occurring in march obviously occurred after that date.csekinek failed to raise before the bia either his claim that he pled guilty before september,or his claim that he was not aware of the changes in immigration law these factual allegations are the sine qua non of his due process claim,and,for the reasons set forth above,we can not entertain them on appeal.
csekinek also asserts that the ij erred in denying his application for asylum.that issue is unreviewable by this court.a clearly bars judicial review of the agency determination regarding an application timeliness.ins,cir.consequently,we can not and do not review the bia determination that csekinek application for asylum was untimely.
finally,csekinek has failed to meet his burden of showing that he is entitled to a withholding of deportation.he was required to show a clear probability that if he is returned to hungary he will be persecuted on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a ins stevic,d,at.the ij found that csekinek claims of future persecution are unsubstantiated,and his past claims of persecution related merely to punishment for failing to obey orders from a superior officer when he was in the military.the ij findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.ali reno,cir quoting b b and c.
the evidence is not such that a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find in csekinek favor.csekinek presented only his own testimony in support of his application.with regard to csekinek credibility,the ij noted two material inconsistencies in csekinek version of events.first,csekinek testified that he left hungary because he believed that the communist party was returning to power.this testimony contradicted his own asylum application,which stated that csekinek left the country because he believed that serbians were infiltrating hungary and looking for individuals who had delivered supplies to ethnic hungarians in croatia.the ij was correct in noting that this is a fairly significant inconsistency.second,the ij noted that csekinek had failed to present any evidence of his alleged military background,and in fact never explained his reasons for allegedly destroying the evidence that would support his claims.
although the ij did not expressly determine that csekinek is not credible,csekinek application for withholding of removal necessarily relied on his testimony.where that testimony is unreliable,his claim must fail for lack of proof.even if we take csekinek testimony in its best light,he has not established that he would probably be persecuted if he is returned to hungary.the ij made several determinations in denying csekinek application.first,the ij noted that despite its prior status as a communist country,hungary is now a parliamentary democracy with an active and independent judiciary which seeks to adhere to its constitution.the ij further found that csekinek alleged past punishment at the hands of the hungarian military,if it occurred,was lawful discipline that resulted from csekinek failure to obey orders or act within the military accepted mores and standards.the ij also noted that csekinek did not leave hungary until,when he feared he might be prosecuted for gun running,an activity which is itself in violation of the law,and for which lawful sanctions do not constitute persecution.the evidence here is not such that it would require a court to come to a conclusion different from that reached by the ij.see ins,d stating that substantial evidence is lacking only in those cases where the petitioner establishes that the evidence of the record was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find in his favor.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgments of the ij and the bia.
i concur with the majority regarding csekinek due process and asylum claims.however,since i disagree regarding the issues of exhaustion and applicability of iirira due to the dates of csekinek convictions,i respectfully dissent.
the following facts place my discussion in context.csekinek,a native and citizen of hungary,entered the united states on july,as a visitor.he obtained the status of a lawful permanent resident on august.
two criminal offenses triggered the deportation proceedings.on november,csekinek had pleaded guilty and was sentenced in the parma municipal court in parma,ohio for committing a domestic violence offense against his wife,in violation of section a of the parma municipal code.on march,csekinek had pleaded guilty to a second domestic violence charge for violating ohio revised code.on march,he was sentenced to one year in prison for that charge,although on that same date,the sentence was suspended and csekinek was ordered to serve one year of probation and to pay court costs and a probation supervision fee.
on june,the immigration and naturalization service ins served on csekinek a notice to appear,charging that he was subject to removal from the united states pursuant to a e i,which renders deportable any alien convicted of a domestic violence offense after entry into the united states.in the notice,the ins cites both of the domestic violence charges as support for removal,noting that csekinek had been convicted of the first offense on november,and the second on march.
hearings before immigration judge elizabeth hacker ij were held on dates between march and august.in the hearings,csekinek initially denied that he was twice convicted of domestic violence offenses.the ins,however,submitted the following evidence 
a parma municipal court record indicating that on november,csekinek had pleaded guilty to a domestic violence charge and,on that same date,he was given a three day suspended jail sentences,ordered to be on probation for months,and ordered to pay a fine and in court costs.
a cuyahoga county court of common pleas journal entry dated march,memorializing the proceedings of march,where csekinek was sentenced on a second domestic violence charge to which he had entered a plea of guilty on a previous date which the journal entry does not specify.in addition,the journal entry indicates that on march,the court formally pronounced judgment against csekinek for this charge.
the ij issued her decision in an oral decision and order dated august.first,the ij concluded that csekinek was removable pursuant to a e i,citing both domestic violence convictions as a basis for removal.
csekinek filed a timely notice of appeal to the bia.however,his counsel failed to file a timely brief in support of that appeal,and on december,the bia denied csekinek request to file a late brief.
nevertheless,despite the lack of an accompanying brief,the bia considered csekinek case on the merits and,in an order dated april,affirm ed,without opinion,the results of the decision of the immigration judge.as the bia noted,the ij decision became the final agency determination.
on appeal,csekinek no longer denies that he was twice convicted for domestic violence offenses.instead,he argues that the ij failed to consider the definition of conviction set forth in the ina pursuant to the statutory definition,both of his convictions iirira and therefore the ij erroneously relied on these convictions to find him eligible for deportation pursuant to a e i.
in his first claim,csekinek contends that he is not removable pursuant to a e i because both of his conditions for domestic abuse occurred before the enactment of iirira.however,d provides that a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.the ins asserts that csekinek failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies.i disagree.
first,this claim was raised and partially vetted at the november,hearing before the ij.there,csekinek counsel advised the ij of his claim that csekinek second conviction took place before the enactment of iirira.csekinek counsel and the ij engaged in an exchange about the date iirira was enacted.the discussion was interrupted and never brought up again.but,as the hearing turned towards other matters,csekinek counsel specifically indicated that he would like to reserve the right to appeal the ij finding that march was the date of csekinek second conviction within the meaning of the ina.
the government characterizes the exchange as having involved a concession by csekinek counsel to the ij comment that the march date refers to the date when the conviction was final.however,the transcript gives no indication that csekinek counsel conceded this point.to the contrary,csekinek counsel attempted to respond when the government attorney interjected,directing the ij attention to other matters.furthermore,upon recognition that the ij and the government were moving on to other issues,csekinek counsel explicitly announced his desire to appeal the issue.
in short,csekinek counsel raised this issue before the ij in a form sufficiently related to the claim he now brings forth on appeal and also indicated his intention to pursue the matter on appeal to the bia.
second,csekinek filed a timely notice of appeal to the bia,challenging the ij decision concerning a broad array of issues.amongst other issues not specifically related to this claim,the notice of appeal included an umbrella provision whereby csekinek sought to reserve his right to challenge o ther errors of law and facts which will be fully cited and briefed upon receipt of the transcript of the hearing.csekinek counsel failed,however,to file a timely brief and his formal request that the bia accept a late brief was denied on december.although one could maintain that this umbrella ground for appeal was too generalized to render the claim concerning csekinek convictions properly raised,since this issue was raised before the ij and csekinek counsel explicitly indicated his intention to the ij to appeal the issue,it is reasonable to read this claim into the umbrella provision.
indeed,the bia considered the merits of csekinek appeal despite the lack of an accompanying brief,and the bia affirmed,without opinion,the results of the decision below.by affirming the ij opinion in its entirety,we should presume that the bia considered the merits of csekinek challenge to his eligibility for removal.that is,after all,the most consequential issue in these proceedings and an issue fairly inferred from the notice of appeal and specifically designated by counsel as an appeal issue before the ij.see sagermark,cir whether or not the decision on the merits was technically before the bia,the bia addressed it thoroughly enough to convince us that the relevant policy concerns underlying the exhaustion an administrative agency should have a full opportunity to resolve a controversy or correct its own errors before judicial been satisfied here.
finally,it is worthwhile to note that some courts decline to reach the exhaustion question entirely when they feel that it is important to do so and,particularly,where they determine that the decision of the court below was erroneous.see drax reno,cir.in this case the ij conclusion with respect to the date of csekinek second conviction was clearly erroneous and this error proceeds to decide csekinek fate.
accordingly,i believe csekinek satisfied the exhaustion requirements.
we review de novo the agency construction of a statute that it administers,though subject to established principles of deference.see,d chevron,natural resources defense council,d.under those principles,if the intent of congress is clear with respect to
