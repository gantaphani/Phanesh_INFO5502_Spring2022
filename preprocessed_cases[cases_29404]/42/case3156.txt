hector giovanni ramirez petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision that his conviction under california penal code section a for felony child abuse constitutes a crime of violence under a and b and therefore qualifies as an aggravated felony under a f.we conclude that section a is not a categorical crime of violence and is not divisible.we thus agree with ramirez that his conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony,and grant the petition and remand.
ramirez is a native and citizen of el salvador.he immigrated to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in,and all of his immediate family members are citizens.ramirez graduated from high school in the united states and subsequently enlisted in the navy,serving for four years.
in february,ramirez was convicted of felony child abuse,in violation of section a,and was sentenced to years and months of imprisonment.ramirez appealed his conviction,which the california court of appeal affirmed.
the department of homeland security commenced removal proceedings against ramirez in february,alleging that he was subject to removal from the united states under a a iii as an alien convicted of a crime of violence,which is a deportable aggravated felony under a f and.the immigration judge found him removable as charged and ordered him removed.ramirez appealed to the bia,arguing that his conviction did not constitute a crime of violence and therefore did not constitute an aggravated felony.the bia affirmed the ij,concluding that a section a is a divisible statute and b it contained a direct infliction prong,which incorporated a mens rea element of general intent,and was therefore a categorical match for the federal definition of a crime of violence.the bia,employing the modified categorical approach,examined the records of conviction contained in the administrative record and concluded that ramirez had been convicted of the direct infliction prong.ramirez filed a timely petition for review.
although we lack jurisdiction to review the final orders of removal of aliens convicted of certain crimes,a c,we retain jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.therefore,when the issue at hand is whether an alien has committed an aggravated felony,the jurisdictional question and the merits collapse into one.see ye ins,cir.where,as here,the bia conducts an independent review of the ij findings,we review the bia decision and not that of the ij.romero ruiz mukasey,cir.

to assess whether a state conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony,we generally employ the categorical approach to determine whether the state offense matches the generic federal definition of the pertinent offense listed in the ina here,a crime of violence under a or b moncrieffe holder.we do so by compar ing the elements of the statute of conviction with a federal definition of the crime to determine whether conduct proscribed by the statute is broader than the generic federal definition.rodriguez castellon holder,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in making this comparison,we must rely exclusively on the elements of the two crimes,b ecause we examine what the state conviction necessarily involved,not the facts underlying the case,and so must presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of th e acts criminalized.moncrieffe.at emphasis added.we then determine whether even those acts are encompassed by the generic federal offense.descamps united states,the key is elements,not facts.
in identifying the elements of the statute of conviction,we look not only to the text of the statute,but also to how state courts have interpreted and applied the statute.covarrubias teposte holder,cir.we must determine whether there exists a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.gonzales duenas alvarez.additionally,if the federal generic offense is not itself a crime,but rather a classification of crimes,like crime s of violence,then we also compare the crime of conviction with other crimes determined to fall within that classification.cerezo mukasey,cir.if,after conducting this categorical analysis,we conclude that the state statute of conviction criminalizes more conduct than the federal generic offense,then the state conviction does not fall within the federal definition,and will not qualify as an aggravated felony crime of violence for immigration purposes.see descamps.at.
in a narrow range of cases,when the statute at issue is divisible,we may employ a modified categorical approach.id.at citation omitted.a divisible statute lists alternative sets of elements,in essence several different crimes.id.at.if at least one,but not all of those crimes matches the generic version,a court needs a way to find out which the defendant was convicted of.id.at.in these instances,we may look beyond the elements of the statute to the documents of conviction,to the state charging document,a signed plea agreement,jury instructions,guilty pleas,transcripts of a plea proceeding and the judgment,to determine whether the petitioner was convicted of a set of elements that falls within the generic definition.fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir citing hernandez martinez ashcroft,cir.the modified categorical approach is thus a tool that allows us to apply the categorical approach.descamps.at.moreover,i t retains the categorical approach central feature a focus on the elements,rather than the facts,of a crime,as well as its basic method.id.
with these principles in mind,we first examine the generic federal definition of a crime of violence under,and then turn to section a of the california penal code.
the initial briefing in this case took place before the supreme court issued its opinions in moncrieffe and descamps,and before we issued our opinion in rendon holder,cir.while ramirez initially agreed that the modified categorical approach was appropriate,he now contends that section a is indivisible and categorically is not a crime of violence.the parties filed supplemental briefs,which we have duly considered,addressing the impact of these decisions on ramirez case.
the government does not dispute that section a is not a categorical match to the federal generic definition of a crime of violence.instead,the government argues,as it has throughout,that section a is a divisible statute,and that we should therefore apply the modified categorical approach.the government further contends that the court may determine from documents in the administrative record that ramirez was convicted of the direct infliction prong of section a,which provides criminal penalties for any person who,under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death inflicts upon a child unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering.the government argues that this prong falls within the generic definition of a crime of violence under both a and b.
the federal generic crime at issue,defines a crime of violence as either 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
in leocal ashcroft,the supreme court determined that use of force signifies intentional conduct active employment and encompasses a mens rea element greater than negligence.the petitioner in leocal had been convicted of drunk driving,and the court held that this conduct could not fall within either a or b,because b,like a,does not encompass negligent conduct.id.at.rather,t he reckless disregard in relates not to the general conduct or to the possibility that harm will result from a person conduct,but to the risk that the use of physical force against another might be required in committing a crime.id.at footnote omitted.a person who drives while intoxicated incurs a substantial risk that people in the vicinity will experience force.id.however,even in the event that the drunk driver victims experienced force,the driver could not be said to have used that force.id.at.nor does the drunk driver intend to accomplish some criminal purpose and foresee the risk of force that purpose entailed.id.thus,the probability that victims of the crime will experience force does not alone render criminal conduct a crime of violence.id.
following leocal,in fernandez ruiz,we held that offenses committed through reckless,or grossly negligent,use of force likewise can not constitute crimes of violence,under either a or b.at.recklessness,though more culpable than negligence,does not encompass the level of intent required to meet the definition of use of force laid out by the court in leocal.moreover,although it is not entitled to deference,the bia agreed with our interpretation that does not encompass crimes with mens rea elements of recklessness or negligence in its recent decision,matter of chairez castrejon,bia,vacated in part on other grounds,bia.thus,in order for a person conviction to qualify as a crime of violence,he or she must have use d force with a mens rea that incorporates a degree of intent greater than does negligence or recklessness.
turning to the state statute at issue,california penal code section a provides 
a any person who,under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death,willfully causes or permits any child to suffer,or inflicts thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering,or having the care or custody of any child,willfully causes or permits the person or health of that child to be injured,or willfully causes or permits that child to be placed in a situation where his or her person or health is endangered,shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year,or in the state prison for two,four,or six years.
brackets and numbers added.it is undisputed here that section a criminalizes conduct that would not necessarily entail any affirmative use of force,and encompasses passive,negligent conduct.for example,the statute criminalizes conduct that permits any child to suffer,permits the person or health of that child to be injured,and permits that child to be placed in a situation where his or her person or health is endangered.california case law confirms that section a is an omnibus statute,meaning that a violation can occur in a wide variety of situations the definition broadly includes both active and passive conduct,child abuse by direct assault and child endangering by extreme neglect.people sargent,cal quoting people smith,cal.
although section a requires a mens rea of willful ness for the three prongs of the statute that criminalize indirect infliction of harm or passive conduct,the california supreme court has interpreted willful ness in this context to require proof only of criminal negligence.people valdez,cal holding that criminal negligence is the appropriate standard for the indirect infliction prongs of section a,and explaining that w e do not think the legislature use of the word willful is inconsistent with a criminal negligence standard see also people peabody.cal,cited with approval by walker superior court,cal.because willfulness under section a does not require greater proof of culpability than criminal negligence,willfulness in this context does not meet the definition of use of force elucidated by the court in leocal.at see also fernandez ruiz,at.a review of california case law confirms that courts have applied section a to criminally negligent conduct.see,people kinkead,d affirming the conviction of a defendant who fell asleep next to his daughter,after ingesting methamphetamine,marijuana,and alcohol and being up for days,and asphyxiated her people toney,d affirming the conviction of a defendant who left several containers of highly flammable and caustic chemicals on the floor of a residence inhabited by his wife son.thus,we agree with the government that section a is not a categorical match to the federal generic definition of a crime of violence because it criminalizes conduct that falls outside this definition.
while section a is not categorically a crime of violence,the indirect and direct infliction prongs of the statute are phrased in the disjunctive.therefore,we next consider whether section a is divisible.descamps.at see also medina lara holder,cir.we hold that it is not.
in descamps,the supreme court clarified that a prosecutor charging a violation of a divisible statute must generally select the relevant element from its list of alternatives.and the jury,as instructions in the case will make clear,must then find that element,unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.at emphasis added citation and footnote omitted.applying descamps,we recently explained that t he critical distinction is that while indivisible statutes may contain multiple,alternative means of committing the crime,only divisible statutes contain multiple,alternative elements of functionally separate crimes.rendon,at.therefore,the key question we must ask when determining a statute divisibility is whether a jury would have to be unanimous in finding those separate elements.chavez solis lynch,cir lopez valencia lynch,cir rendon,at.otherwise,the court express purpose for separating indivisible statutes from divisible statutes preventing sentencing courts from finding facts on which a jury did not have to agree,rather than elements on which a jury did have to be undermined.rendon,at.
in almanza arenas lynch,we recently outlined a process for conducting this divisibility analysis under descamps,slip op.at cir.first,we examine the text of the statute of conviction to determine whether it contains multiple crimes with distinct elements,or instead describes alternative means for accomplishing a single crime.we next examine the conviction documents to determine whether we may confirm our statutory analysis.finally,we verify that our reading is consistent with the way in which state courts have construed the statute of conviction.
we turn first to the statutory text.the first part of section a requires that the conduct at issue be done under circumstances or conditions likely to produce great bodily harm or death.the second part of the statute contains four prongs,worded in the disjunctive,which enumerate the ways in which a person can criminally abuse or endanger a child.although this part of the statute is worded in the disjunctive,t he mere use of the disjunctive term or does not automatically make a statute divisible.almanza arenas,slip op.at.here,the text of section a suggests that the four prongs constitute separate means of committing a single offense.however,because the text of the statute is not clear on its face,we turn to the available conviction documents since such documents may disclose whether the statute is divisible.see id.at.
where,as here,the defendant was tried and convicted by a jury,we look first to the charging document and jury instructions.see taylor united states,see also shepard united states.the charging no distinction between the direct and indirect infliction prongs of section a.the information alleges three separate violations of section a,two of which occurred on the same day,with each count alleging an enhancement under california penal code section a.each count simply repeats the text of the statute,listing all four prongs and alleging violations of each.the abstract of judgment similarly does not draw a distinction between the indirect and direct infliction prongs.it succinctly records that ramirez was convicted of three violations of section a,each with a section a enhancement the administrative record in this case does not contain the trial court jury instructions.however,there was a model jury instruction in place at the time of ramirez conviction,california jury instructions criminal ca
