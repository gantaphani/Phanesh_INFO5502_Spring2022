rafael antonio,a native and citizen of el salvador,seeks review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia finding him removable based on his conviction for third degree sex offense under maryland criminal law article.the bia determined that state conviction qualifies as the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor under a a of the immigration and nationality act ina and affirmed the immigration judge finding that is therefore removable.we find that the bia erred as a matter of law and hold that conviction does not constitute the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor under the ina because maryland criminal law article proscribes more conduct than does the generic federal offense.we therefore grant petition for review,vacate the order of removal,and order his immediate release from department of homeland security dhs custody.

the circuit court for montgomery county,maryland,sentenced to days in prison,all suspended,and five years of supervised probation and medical treatment.it also ordered him to register as a sexual offender.in july,when failed to report to his probation officer or register as a sexual offender,the court issued a warrant for his arrest.id.at.was arrested approximately one month later and ordered held without bond.id.at.
in october,dhs issued a notice to appear.dhs charged him with removability based on his conviction under,which dhs contended constituted the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor under a a of the ina.id.at.on march,the immigration judge upheld the charge of removability and ordered removed from the united states to el salvador.id.at.appealed to the bia.
there was no dispute on appeal that a conviction under without more information on what part of violated would not constitute sexual abuse of a minor under the ina.what the parties contested was whether the bia could consider a narrower portion of to determine if the particular elements of conviction constituted sexual abuse of a minor.the questions for the bia,then,were whether is a divisible statute,meaning that it creates multiple alternative offenses,at least one of which constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,and if so,what portion of was necessarily convicted of,and whether the elements of conviction matched the elements of the generic federal offense.
in an unpublished opinion issued by a single member,the bia first concluded that is a divisible statute because it create s multiple versions of the crime of sexual offense in the third degree.id.at.the bia then reviewed the record of conviction and concluded that was convicted under a.the bia enumerated the essential elements of an offense under a as that the defendant had sexual contact with the victim,that the victim was under years of age at the time of the act,and that the defendant was at least years older than the victim.id.it further found that although the conduct specified in the indictment fellatio falls within the definition of sexual act under maryland law,such conduct is also encompassed by the definition of sexual contact,id.at,which is the conduct element in a.
the bia then concluded that an offense under a categorically constitutes sexual abuse of a minor under the ina.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the bia did not adopt a definition of the generic federal offense.nor did it refer directly to any interpretations set forth in either bia or fourth circuit precedent.instead,it compared a elements to the elements of a california statute that the bia had determined constituted the federal generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor in in re,aff,lynch,cir,cert.granted,wl.the bia here held that because a elements are narrower than the california statute,a also categorically matches the generic federal offense.
the bia accordingly affirmed the immigration judge determination that is removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under a a of the ina,and it dismissed his appeal.timely filed this petition for review of the bia decision.
we generally lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien removable as an aggravated felon.a c kporlor holder,cir.we have limited jurisdiction,however,to review constitutional claims or questions of law,including whether a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.a d amos lynch,cir.we review this question of law de novo.castillo holder,cir.
under the ina,an alien is removable if he or she is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.a a iii.the ina contains a long list of crimes that qualify as an aggravated felony,including sexual abuse of a minor.a a.
to determine whether conviction under qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor under the ina,we would usually apply the categorical approach set forth in taylor united states.under this approach,we ask whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.moncrieffe holder,quoting gonzales duenas alvarez.we answer this by first considering the elements of the generic federal crime.see taylor,at.the state statute is a categorical match with the federal definition only if a conviction of the state offense necessarily involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.moncrieffe,at quoting shepard united states,alterations in original.we therefore focus on the minimum conduct necessary for a violation of the state statute,while ensuring that there is a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.castillo,at quoting gonzales,at.we look to the decisions of maryland appellate courts to see both the minimum conduct to which the statute has been applied and those courts pronouncements on the minimum conduct to which the statute might be applied.see id.at.and t o the extent that the statutory definition of a has been interpreted by the state appellate courts,that interpretation constrains our analysis of the elements of state law.id.quoting united states aparicio soria,cir.
here,the parties do not dispute that under the categorical approach,is broader than any conceivable federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor because enumerates several offenses that do not require the victim to be a minor.see.code,crim.law a.under the categorical approach,then,would easily prevail.but the supreme court has recognized a narrow range of cases in which courts,when faced with an overbroad but divisible statute,may consider whether a portion of the statute is a categorical match to the federal generic definition.descamps united states,quoting taylor,at.this is called the modified categorical approach.
in order for a court to apply the modified categorical approach,a statute must be divisible.a statute is divisible when it sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative,and at least one of those elements or sets of elements corresponds to the federal definition at issue.id.at see also united states,cir.stating that general divisibility is not enough a statute is divisible only if at least one of the categories constitutes,by its elements,an aggravated felony.for the first prong,the focus is on the statute elements,not the facts of the crime.then,the inquiry is whether the statute has listed multiple,alternative elements,effectively creat ing several different crimes.descamps,at quoting nijhawan holder.the supreme court has emphasized that a statute setting forth merely alternative means of committing an offense will not satisfy this requirement.mathis united states.this is because a federal penalty may be imposed based only on what a jury necessarily found or what a defendant necessarily pleaded guilty to,and the means of commission is not necessary to support a conviction.id.
if a statute is divisible,then the modified categorical approach is appropriate.this approach permits courts to examine a limited class of documents,known as shepard documents to determine which of a statute alternative elements formed the basis of the defendant prior conviction.descamps,at.it is then possible to compare the particular elements of the conviction,rather than the elements of the statute as a whole,to the federal generic definition.
the supreme court has underscored the narrow scope of the modified categorical approach.id.it is to identify,from among several alternatives,the crime of conviction so that the court can compare it to the generic offense.id.at.the court has made clear that review under this approach does not authorize a sentencing court to substitute a inquiry for an one.a court may use the modified approach only to determine which alternative element in a divisible statute formed the basis of the defendant conviction.id.at.once a court has made this determination,it can compare that part of the statute to the generic federal offense using the traditional categorical approach,which remains centered on elements,not facts.id.at stating that the modified categorical approach preserves the categorical approach basic method.and where an element of the conviction is defined to include multiple alternative means,courts must consider all of those means an element is not further divisible into its component parts.see id.at see also mathis,at.
to begin this analysis,we must determine whether is a divisible statute.we agree with the bia that it is.we recently held in united states alfaro,cir,that lists alternative sets of elements that create multiple versions of the crime of sexual offense.alfaro thus confirms that meets the first prong of the divisibility inquiry.alfaro does not,however,resolve the second prong of the divisibility test,which is whether any set of elements in constitutes sexual abuse of a minor.
in alfaro,we held that is divisible,but we were comparing to crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines.id.here,we must determine whether any set of elements in constitutes an aggravated felony under the ina a question not answered by alfaro.we emphasize the point that a statute might be divisible as compared to one federal statute and not divisible as compared to another.whether any set of elements meets the generic federal definition will vary depending on the generic federal definition at issue.the second prong of the divisibility inquiry sometimes merits less discussion,see,but it is an important and required step in the analysis here,at least one set of elements in must qualify as sexual abuse of a minor in order for the statute to be divisible.
we find that at least the set of elements in a constitutes sexual abuse of a minor under the ina.section a prohibits engag ing in vaginal intercourse with another if the victim is or years old,and the person performing the act is at least years old.this clearly constitutes sexual abuse of a minor under any conceivable federal generic definition because at least one set of elements matches the generic federal offense,the second prong of the divisibility inquiry is satisfied.section is thus a divisible statute for purposes of its comparison with ina a a,and we may use the modified categorical approach to determine which statutory elements formed the basis of conviction and whether those elements match the federal generic definition.
the shepard documents show that was convicted under the elements listed in a,sexual contact with another if the victim is under the age of years,and the person performing the sexual contact is at least years older than the victim.the factual basis for plea details one instance in which asked the victim to touch his erect penis,which she did for minutes,and two instances in which asked the victim to perform fellatio on him,which she did for seconds each time.fellatio is specifically categorized as a sexual act under maryland law.see.code,crim.law d.fellatio could also qualify as sexual contact,which maryland defines as an intentional touching of the victim or actor genital,anal,or other intimate area for sexual arousal or gratification,or for the abuse of either party.id.e see partain state.spec.app.holding that cunnilingus constitutes both sexual act and sexual contact.the shepard documents thus reveal that an element of conviction was either sexual act or sexual contact.the shepard documents also establish the age elements of the offense.was eighteen years old,and the victim was four years old.therefore,necessarily pleaded guilty to all of a elements and we affirm the bia finding that was convicted under a.
having established that is a divisible statute and that was convicted under a,we now turn to whether a elements categorically match the elements of the generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor.a threshold question that we must answer before we can compare these statutes is how to define sexual abuse of a minor.the ina does not define it,and this court has not done so in a published opinion interpreting the ina.therefore,we must consider the bia interpretation of this generic federal offense,because under chevron,nat.res.def.council,we are required to defer to the bia precedential interpretation of a silent or ambiguous statute so long as that interpretation is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,id.at.
although the bia decision here is not precedential because it is unpublished and was issued by a single board member,it relied on a precedential bia decision.we therefore must determine whether that decision warrants deference.see hernandez holder,cir.
the bia in considered whether the california offense of unlawful intercourse with a minor categorically constitutes sexual abuse of a minor under the ina.in concluding that it was a categorical match,the bia did not adopt a definition of the federal offense to which we might defer here.instead,it relied on the interpretive framework set forth in in re rodriguez rodriguez,at.we therefore must consider that framework.
in rodriguez rodriguez,the bia looked to a a statute that provides procedural protections for child victims and witnesses and that lists crimes constituting sexual abuse and determined that it might serve as a guide in identifying the types of crimes the bia would consider to be sexual abuse of a minor.rodriguez rodriguez,at.the bia expressly stated that it was not adopting that statute as a definitive standard or definition for purposes of a a of the ina.id.for that reason,we held in amos lynch that there was no statutory interpretation to which to defer under chevron and that a might provide guidance but was not the interpretive touchstone for determining whether a state conviction qualifies as a removable offense at.we also pointed out that because a includ es a broad range of maltreatment of a sexual nature,it does not clarify the scope of the generic federal crime of sexual abuse of a minor.id.at quoting,at.accordingly,we cast serious doubt on the usefulness of interpretive approach.
in,the bia relied on to support its conclusion and did not adopt a definition of the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor,at.therefore,we need not give chevron deference to for the same reason we declined to give it to rodriguez rodriguez the bia did not adopt a federal generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor.indeed,the sixth circuit confirmed that the bia approach is to interpret sexual abuse of a minor through adjudication,at.
in sum,the bia here issued a nonprecedential decision to which we need not defer.the bia did rely on a precedential decision,that might guide our review,but we already held in amos that this approach is not due any chevron deference.therefore,we are not required to give chevron deference to either the bia opinion here or to 
we are thus left to consider the bia determination that a constitutes sexual abuse of a minor under the ina using the principles outlined in skidmore swift.under the skidmore framework,which prescribes a more modest amount of deference,we may defer to the agency opinion,based on the agency body of experience and informed judgment,but the degree of deference that we accord depends on our consideration of the persuasiveness of the bia analysis as demonstrated by its thoroughness,validity of reasoning,and consistency with other decisions.amos,at quoting skidmore,at.
we are not persuaded by the bia analysis.before the bia could answer the question whether a conviction under a constitutes the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor,it had to compare a elements to the elements of the federal offense.but here,the bia did not establish the elements of the federal offense.in fact,it did not even explain what federal definition it was using.instead,the bia compared a elements to the elements of a california statute that was found to constitute sexual abuse of a minor.
this approach is problematic for two reasons.first,the california statute was found to be a categorical match using the framework,which we have held is neither due any deference nor is particularly useful as an interpretive tool.see amos,at.and second,the supreme court has made clear that the categorical approach requires a comparison of the elements of the state statute of conviction to the elements of the generic federal offense,see moncrieffe,at,not to the elements of another state statute of conviction.by attempting to fit a within the elements of a california statute,the bia essentially used california law to determine whether a maryland conviction constituted a removable offense under federal law.
even if this type of statutory comparison was a reasonable way to determine whether a matches the generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor,the bia erred in its analysis.it failed to determine what conduct the california statute encompassed and whether that conduct was also proscribed by a.had the bia done so,it might have seen its mistake.
the bia concluded that because the offense in with the elements of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under years old who is more than years younger than the perpetrator categorically constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,then a,which include s a younger victim and a greater age difference than the corresponding elements in the statute at issue in matter of,also constitutes sexual abuse of a minor under the ina.the bia held this notwithstanding that the sexual contact proscribed by a may potentially be less egregious than the unlawful sexual intercourse in.id.at.this is entirely incorrect.that a criminalizes potentially less egregious conduct than the california statute in is precisely the reason that the california statute has no utility as a comparator and in fact suggests that a is more likely not to constitute the generic federal offense.
ultimately,we conclude that the bia decision on this question is not entitled to skidmore deference.while we recognize that the agency has a wealth of immigration expertise,we find that the bia was neither thorough in its analysis,valid in its reasoning,nor consistent with precedent in the bia or the fourth circuit.see amos,at citing skidmore,at.accordingly,we proceed to consider this question of law de novo,without deferring to the bia determinations in this case.
we begin by defining sexual abuse of a minor.we agree with the petitioner that this court has already established a generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor in the sentencing context and that the definition is equally applicable here.in united states,we defined sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of applying the sentencing guidelines.cir.we looked to the eleventh circuit reasoning in united states,cir,an immigration case,and we adopted that court definition wholesale.see,at.
in,the court looked to the common meaning of the phrase sexual abuse of a minor.at.it determined that it made more sense to consider the phrase plain meaning than to other federal statutes,because where congress intended an aggravated felony subsection to depend on federal statutory law it explicitly included the statutory,and so the lack of an explicit statutory reference in the a a subsection indicates congress intent to rely on the plain meaning of the terms.id.at.
the court explained that a mong the relevant definitions for abuse,webster includes misuse to use or treat so as to injure,hurt,or damage to commit indecent assault on the act of violating sexually and rape or indecent assault not amounting to rape.id.at.and for sexual,webster includes of or relating to the sphere of behavior associated with libidinal gratification.id.the court concluded that the word sexual in the phrase sexual abuse of a minor indicates that the perpetrator intent in committing the abuse is to seek libidinal gratification,and that the common understanding of abuse in this context is that it does not require physical contact.id.the court therefore concluded that the phrase sexual abuse of a minor means a perpetrator physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.id.
significantly,the eleventh circuit in crafted the definition of sexual abuse of a minor in the immigration context under a a of the ina.in,we held that the definition also applies to sexual abuse of a minor under the sentencing guidelines.at.in doing so,we implied that the federal generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor is the same in the sentencing and immigration contexts.
this is further confirmed by the commentary to the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time,which stated that aggravated felony under the guidelines has the meaning given that term in section a of the immigration and nationality act a.sentencing guidelines manual cmt.a sentencing comm because the crime is the same under the sentencing guidelines and the ina,the definition of sexual abuse of a minor adopted by this court in the sentencing context is also applicable in the immigration context and this makes sense,because the utility of a generic definition is that it applies in different contexts.to find otherwise would mean sexual abuse of a minor has multiple generic federal definitions,an outcome that ordinarily will contravene both the categorical approach governing principles and common sen
