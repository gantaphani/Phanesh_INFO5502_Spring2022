marvel johnson appeals his conviction on one count of travel document fraud.prior to trial,the government moved in limine to exclude both the results of polygraph examination,and evidence that he suffered persecution as a christian in his predominantly muslim home country of nigeria.during the course of the jury trial,the district court granted both portions of the government motion,thereby excluding both the polygraph evidence and the evidence of persecution.in his appeal,asserts that the evidentiary exclusions constitute reversible error.for the reasons stated below,we disagree and affirm.
arrived at dulles international airport after a flight from lagos,nigeria,by way of amsterdam,on october.at border control,he presented his nigerian passport,with an enclosed united states tourist type visa foil stamp,to immigration and naturalization service inspector warren blair.inspector blair had reservations concerning the authenticity of the visa and referred to secondary inspection for further investigation.the secondary inspector found additional problems with the visa and determined that it was not genuine.
on october,was arrested and was charged by criminal complaint with travel document fraud,to wit,that he did knowingly use,and attempt to use,a false,forged,counterfeited and altered nonimmigrant visa knowing it to be forged,counterfeited,altered,and falsely made,in violation of a.on november,a grand jury in the eastern district of virginia returned an indictment charging with the same offense as the criminal complaint.
during january,jury trial,the government presented the testimony of forensics examiner lurline trizna.examiner trizna concluded that,while the passport was genuine and unaltered and the visa was genuine when issued,various subtle abnormalities indicated that the visa had subsequently been altered.at the conclusion of examiner trizna testimony,the government introduced a state department document showing that visa foil had originally been issued to a nigerian woman.
at trial,did not challenge the government contention that his visa had been altered.rather,his defense was that he never intended to get a fraudulent visa that his failure to realize the visa had been altered was reasonable and that his ignorance of the proper procedure for obtaining a visa,coupled with his culture practice of paying officials to do what they are supposed to do,prevented him from realizing that his visa was counterfeit,altered,falsely made or otherwise unlawfully obtained.
took the witness stand at trial to explain the circumstances surrounding his acquisition of the visa.this,he stated,was the first time that he had ever needed a visa.given his inexperience,he accepted the offer of a friend,tony igberi,to assist him.igberi travelled with to lagos,where they went to the united states embassy and met a man who appeared to be an embassy employee.the purported embassy employee had previously been given certain documentation passport,birth certificate,and bank statements,as well as,all of which had brought with him to lagos.completed a visa application and departed.
several weeks later,returned to the embassy on the appointed date to receive his visa.an embassy employee handed him both his passport and what he believed to be a legitimate visa.testified that he did not notice any irregularities nor was he made suspicious by the fact that attainment of the visa had required the payment of such a large sum he was inexperienced with foreign travel,and,in nigeria,it is common to have to tip officials to do their jobs in a timely fashion.furthermore,when checked with two airlines klm and british airways concerning flights to the united states,both airlines indicated that they had confirmed the visa.and when the visa was checked during the amsterdam stopover of his klm flight to dulles,the visa was again confirmed.thus,testified,when he presented the visa to inspector blair,he believed it to be legitimate.
prior to trial,had taken and passed a polygraph examination regarding whether he knew the visa to be false,altered,counterfeit,or forged.the test,according to the retired fbi forensic polygrapher who administered it,indicated that was truthful when he stated that he did not know that the visa was illegitimate.before trial,the government moved in limine to exclude this opinion from evidence,citing our circuit per se rule that the results of polygraph tests are inadmissible.on the day of trial,after hearing argument on the government motion to exclude polygraph evidence,the court granted the motion.
also hoped to present evidence showing that he was a prominent christian in nigeria and that,as such,he faced persecution from his country muslim majority.when asked during his polygraph examination did you come to the as you were afraid for your personal safety because of your religious beliefs,the test indicated that affirmative answer was truthful.prior to trial,however,the government had also moved in limine to exclude all evidence relating to the defendant past or future persecution.at the start of trial,the court withheld judgment on the admissibility of the persecution evidence,in order to wait and see what you all present to see whether or not it becomes relevant.ultimately,the court found that the persecution evidence was irrelevant to the central issue in the case,that is,whether the defendant got a forged document and knew whether it was forged.accordingly,the court granted the government motion to exclude all evidence of past or future religious persecution.
the sole issue before the jury was whether,when the defendant used the nonimmigrant visa,he knew it was counterfeit,altered,falsely made or otherwise unlawfully obtained and did not act because of ignorance,mistake,or accident.the jury convicted,and the court sentenced him to three months in prison which amounted to time already served two years of supervised release a fine of and a special assessment of.filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review rulings on the admissibility of scientific evidence,such as polygraph test results,for abuse of discretion.united states ruhe,cir.in so doing,we keep in mind that a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.united states stitt,cir internal quotation omitted.an abuse of discretion standard also applies to evidentiary issues such as relevancy.united states ellis,cir.
first contends that the district court exclusion of his polygraph evidence constitutes reversible error.though he recognizes that we have previously held polygraph evidence per se inadmissible,he maintains that recent advances in polygraph testing have rendered it sufficiently reliable for admission under the standard enunciated by the supreme court in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.the error is a reversible one,he maintains,because the polygraph test results reached the critical issue in his case,to wit,whether he was truthful when he stated that he did not know that his visa was false,forged,counterfeit,or altered when he presented it for inspection.
prior to daubert,this circuit consistently maintained a per se rule that the results of an accused or a witness polygraph test are not admissible to bolster or undermine credibility see united states chambers,cir united states v.a s council oil,cir united states morrow,cir describing polygraph evidence as traditionally excluded see also united states porter,cir holding that it is impermissible even to mention that a witness has taken a polygraph test united states tedder,cir same.absent an en banc overruling or a superseding contrary decision of the supreme court,we,as a circuit panel,are bound by these precedents.scotts united indus,cir.the questions before us,then,are two did daubert work a change in the law governing the admissibility of expert opinion testimony,such that the viability of per se rules barring admission of polygraph evidence has been thrown into doubt and,if so,have our precedents already resolved the matter by reestablishing this circuit adherence to our longstanding per se bar against polygraph evidence we address these issues in turn.
the impact of daubert 
the federal rules of evidence provide that i f scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.in daubert,the supreme court made clear that it is the duty of the trial court to perform the gatekeeping function with respect to expert testimony the trial judge must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant,but reliable.at.emphasis added.
the daubert court announced five factors that the trial court may use in assessing the relevancy and reliability of proffered expert testimony whether the particular scientific theory can be and has been tested whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication the technique known or potential rate of error the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique operation and whether the technique has achieved general acceptance in the relevant scientific or expert community.id.at.rather than provide a definitive or exhaustive list,daubert merely illustrates the types of factors that will bear on the inquiry.id.at.the analysis must be a flexible one.id.at.see also kumho tire,carmichael,d holding that testing of reliability should be flexible and that daubert five factors neither necessarily nor exclusively apply to every expert.in short,daubert requires that a trial court give broad consideration to all of the various factors that may illuminate the reliability of proffered expert testimony.
our per se bar on the admission of polygraph evidence daubert.we established our rule pursuant to the frye test,which,until replaced by daubert in,was for decades the dominant standard governing the admissibility of scientific evidence.see charles alan wright victor james gold,federal practice and procedure.under frye,scientific evidence was admissible only if it was based on principles generally accepted as valid by the relevant scientific community.see frye united states.though daubert maintained general acceptance as one of the relevant factors to weigh in the decision of whether to admit proffered expert evidence,the court held that the federal rules of evidence require that a district court ultimately resolve questions of admissibility on the basis of a broader assessment of reliability.daubert,at.frye made general acceptance the exclusive test for admitting expert scientific testimony.that austere standard,absent from,and incompatible with,the federal rules of evidence,should not be applied in federal trials.
several of our sister circuits have,in light of the daubert decision,reexamined the viability of their similar,per se rules against the admission of polygraph evidence.in particular,the fifth and ninth circuits have held that daubert effectively overturned their respective per se bars.both now leave the admission or exclusion of such evidence to the discretion of the district courts.see united states cordoba,cir remanding for district court determination of whether proffered evidence was admissible under rules and united states posado,cir same united states messina,cir noting,that second circuit has not decided whether polygraphy has reached a sufficient state of reliability to be admissible under rule.as the fifth circuit put it,a fter daubert,a per se rule is not viable.posado,at.
at the very least,by reserving the reliability assessment to the district courts,daubert throws into doubt the viability of our per se rule that the results of an accused or a witness polygraph test are inadmissible to bolster or undermine credibility.under one possible interpretation of daubert,the court below should give the opportunity to present evidence in support of his claim of polygraphy newfound reliability and,if it is satisfied that polygraphy is indeed today reliable a matter on which we express no opinion,that court should be free to admit the polygraph test results in evidence.the question remains,however,whether we,as a panel,are free to adopt such an interpretation today.we turn to that question now.
our intervening decisions 
this circuit has,subsequent to daubert announcement of the new,multifactored test for admissibility of expert testimony,continued to invoke its longstanding per se rule against the admission of polygraph evidence.see ruhe,at adhering to this circuit per se ban on polygraph evidence united states sanchez,cir the rule that polygraph evidence is never admissible to impeach the credibility of a witness remains in this circuit.however,in each instance,we have also noted the change in the law effected by daubert.in both ruhe and sanchez,we suggested that it may be necessary to overturn our longstanding per se rule against admissibility of polygraph evidence,and that en banc consideration may not be required to do so.on the basis of these suggestions,contends that our precedents have reserved,rather than resolved,the questions of whether daubert requires that this circuit change its position on polygraph evidence,and whether a mere panel is free as panels of the fifth and ninth circuits found themselves to be to announce that change.
our consideration of the impact of daubert on this circuit per se ban against polygraph evidence is traceable to a suggestion raised in united states toth,cir.july,unpublished.there,our unpublished,per curiam opinion noted the fifth circuit decision that,due to the change in the law effected by daubert,en banc consideration was not necessary to overturn that circuit per se rule against admissibility of polygraph evidence.nonetheless,we adhered to our precedents and recited the rule in this circuit that evidence that an accused or a witness has taken a polygraph test is inadmissible.id.at.while we suggested that we might be inclined to agree with the fifth circuit in an appropriate case,we decided that it was not necessary to reach that issue in toth case,because the trial court was within its discretion in excluding the evidence under rule.id.at.
a year later,in sanchez,we returned to the toth suggestion,noting that we recently suggested that it is possible to change our prohibition against polygraph evidence without the approval of the en banc court in light of daubert.at.nonetheless,we held in sanchez that t he rule against polygraph evidence remains in this circuit,and is binding upon us in this case at.i n any event,we continued,we would find any error in excluding this evidence harmless as having no significant relevance to any material issue going to the defendant guilt.id.
in ruhe,we again took note of the toth suggestion that a panel could rely upon daubert to alter the circuit law on polygraph evidence.at.however,as in toth itself,we adhered in ruhe to our per se bar,reasoning that the appellant had not advanced the toth argument and we do not pass upon it.id.
although both ruhe and sanchez ultimately applied the per se bar,it is nonetheless not immediately clear that either case forecloses the possibility that we,as a panel,might act on the toth suggestion and rely on the daubert change of law to alter our circuit precedent on polygraph evidence in ruhe,the panel did not reject the toth suggestion outright,but rather sidestepped the suggestion on the ground that the appellant there had not raised it.by contrast,has advanced the toth argument.and while sanchez did come closer to simply rejecting the toth suggestion,it stopped short when it invoked,in the alternative,the doctrine of harmless error.again by contrast,an error in excluding the polygraph evidence indicating that was telling the truth when he stated that he did not know his visa to be false has significant relevance to a material issue going to the defendant guilt.
these distinctions notwithstanding,we conclude that,to the extent that daubert alteration of the legal landscape threw into doubt the viability of our per se rule against polygraph evidence,ruhe and sanchez effectively resolved those doubts in favor of the rule.in each case,we treated our polygraph decisions as continuing to carry precedential force.see ruhe,at holding that as a simple panel,we are bound by prior precedent to adhere to the per se ban emphasis added sanchez,at holding that the traditional rule that polygraph evidence is never admissible to impeach the credibility of a witness is binding upon us in this case emphasis added.in so doing,we effectively reaffirmed our per se ban on polygraph evidence.united states scheffer,d citing our sanchez decision for the proposition that this circuit has recently reaffirmed its per se ban on polygraph evidence.
in sum,while we might otherwise be inclined to hold that daubert requires a more nuanced evaluation of polygraph evidence than that dictated by the per se rule on which the district court relied,and that the change in law effected by daubert leaves a mere panel free to acknowledge this requirement,our precedents foreclose our abandonment today of this circuit per se rule.accordingly,we conclude that only the en banc court has the authority to consider whether,a fter daubert,a per se rule is not viable.posado,at.we affirm the district court to our per se rule,and with no daubert inquiry into the reliability of the proffered expert the results of polygraph test.
next maintains that his religious persecution was an important part of his defense,in that it tended to explain why he would not question the large sum of money that he had to pay to obtain his visa.as a result,he argues,exclusion of this evidence violated his constitutional right to present a defense.the government responds that the district court was within its discretion in excluding the evidence of persecution,since the defendant fear of persecution was irrelevant to whether intended to use an altered visa to enter the united states.
as the government correctly notes,a defendant right to present a defense is not absolute criminal defendants do not have a right to present evidence that the district court,in its discretion,deems irrelevant or immaterial.see taylor illinois,d the accused does not have an unfettered sixth amendment right to offer testimony that is incompetent,privileged,or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.see also montana egelhoff,d applying same rule in due process context.
the only issue that the jury considered was whether actually knew his visa to be counterfeit,altered,falsely made or otherwise unlawfully obtained.while testimony on persecution may have been relevant to counter the government proffered willful blindness instruction and,in fact,so the defense argued,this point of potential relevance was mooted by the court refusal of that instruction.see supra note.similarly,such testimony might have been relevant in support of a duress defense however,did not present such a defense.the only issue before the jury was whether the defendant actually knew of his visa illegality.since evidence of religious persecution does not tend to prove his claim that he did not have actual knowledge that his visa was false,the district court was within its discretion in excluding the evidence of persecution as irrelevant.
for the foregoing reasons,the conviction of marvel johnson is affirmed.
this circuit has never addressed the question of whether our per se rule banning the admission of polygraph evidence to bolster or undermine the credibility of a witness is consistent with the principles concerning the admission of scientific or technical evidence enunciated in daubert merrell dow,d.that question,which is finally squarely before the court,must be answered in the negative.for this reason,the district court should have given the opportunity to demonstrate that his proffered polygraph evidence was admissible under daubert.because,on the record before the court,the exclusion of proffered polygraph evidence was not harmless error,i am constrained to conclude that a conviction should be vacated and the case should be remanded to the district court with instructions to conduct a proper daubert inquiry.if,on remand,the district court concludes that proffered polygraph evidence is inadmissible,the district court would be free to reinstate the conviction.
the first seminal case addressing the admissibility of polygraph evidence was frye united states.in frye,the trial court refused to admit the results of a systolic blood pressure test a crude precursor to the polygraph test,which the defendant sought to introduce in his murder trial.id.at.the issue before the frye court was whether the results of the systolic blood pressure test should have been admitted into evidence.id.the frye court used a general acceptance standard in order to determine the admissibility of scientific or technical evidence in the context of the science of polygraphy.id.at.the general acceptance standard required the proponent of the evidence to show that the science was generally accepted in the relevant scientific community from which it emerged.id.according to the frye court,
j ust when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define.somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized,and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a scientific principle or discovery,the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.
id.because the systolic blood pressure test had not yet gained such standing and scientific recognition among physiological and psychological authorities as would justify the courts in admitting expert testimony deduced from the discovery,development,and experiments thus far made,evidence of its results was ruled inadmissible.id.
frye became the seminal polygraph case and,consequently,over the next five decades,virtually every state and federal court prohibited the admission of polygraph evidence.see generally james mccall,misconceptions and admissibility after rock and daubert,analyzing frye and its progeny.in this circuit,and,we concluded in numerous cases that the admission of polygraph evidence to bolster or undermine the credibility of a witness was per se inadmissible.see,united states chambers,cir united states v.a s council oil,cir see also united states porter,cir holding that evidence of a plea agreement containing a provision that the government witness has agreed to take a polygraph test to verify trial testimony constitutes impermissible bolstering of the witness credibility united states tedder,cir holding that evidence that the accused or a witness has taken a polygraph test is inadmissible united states morrow,cir holding that stipulated admission of polygraph test results was,at most,harmless error but see united states webster,cir holding that district court has broad discretion to admit polygraph evidence 
in daubert,the supreme court held that scientific expert testimony is admissible under rule of the federal rules of evidence if the expert testimony is based on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.daubert,at.daubert expressly rejected the frye general acceptance standard,holding that the frye standard was superseded by the adoption of the federal rules of evidence.daubert,at.in its stead,the supreme court outlined a flexible inquiry driven primarily by federal rules of evidence,and.after discussing the thrust of the federal rules,as reflected in rules and,the court noted that nothing in rule,which governs the admissibility of expert testimony,makes general acceptance an absolute prerequisite to admissibility.daubert,at.what rule does require,the court held,is that the district court make initial determinations that the proffered evidence possesses sufficient evidentiary reliability to be admissible as scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge and that the proffered evidence is relevant in the sense that it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.daubert,at.with regard to the reliability and relevance determinations,the court emphasized a number of factors,including whether t
