elizabeth rodriguez vega appeals the magistrate judge denial of her to vacate her conviction of misdemeanor attempted transportation of illegal aliens in violation of a a.she asserts that she was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because her attorney failed to advise her that her plea agreement rendered her removal a virtual certainty,and that the court erred in dismissing her petition without holding an evidentiary hearing.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing,but that it did err in failing to hold that under the controlling law rodriguez vega counsel assistance was ineffective.accordingly,we order the conviction vacated.
rodriguez vega was born in mexico in.she came to the united states with her family when she was twelve years old,and became a lawful permanent resident the following year.in,she was arraigned on an information charging her with felony attempted transportation of illegal aliens and aiding and abetting in violation of a a ii and v ii.
rodriguez vega initially presented her with a plea agreement requiring her to stipulate to removal following her criminal sentence.a section entitled stipulated removal provided that i f defendant is not a united states citizen or national,defendant agrees to an order of removal from the united states following completion of her criminal sentence,and waives any right to appeal,reopen or challenge the removal order.when rodriguez vega rejected the agreement her attorney obtained a revised plea agreement that did not include the stipulation for removal upon completion of her sentence,reduced a assessment to,and recommended a base offense level of and downward departures of points each for acceptance of responsibility and fast track.the revised plea replaced the stipulated removal provision with a provision entitled immigration consequences,stating that 
defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect to her immigration status if she is not a citizen of the united states defendant nevertheless affirms that she wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that his sic plea may entail,even if the consequence is his sic automatic removal from the united states.
the final section of the plea stated that defendant has discussed the terms of this agreement with defense counsel and fully understands its meaning and effect.both plea agreements were to a reduced charge of misdemeanor transportation of an illegal alien 
rodriguez vega pled guilty to a single misdemeanor.at her plea colloquy,the magistrate informed rodriguez vega that potentially you could be deported or removed,perhaps.emphasis added.later,at her sentencing hearing,rodriguez vega counsel,addressing the court,stated that even though this is a misdemeanor,there is a high likelihood that she still be deported.it still probably considered an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.emphasis added.the district court sentenced rodriguez vega to days in custody followed by one year of supervised release.fifteen days later,rodriguez vega was issued a notice to appear,alleging that she was removable because her conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under a a iii.
rodriguez vega filed a petition to vacate her conviction under on the ground that her counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately advise her regarding the immigration consequence of her plea.in the alternative,she requested that the court order an evidentiary hearing.in support of her petition,rodriguez vega filed a declaration denying that her counsel ever told her that her plea would cause her to be removed.
the district court ordered an expansion of the record and supplemental briefing,and directed the government to file a declaration from rodriguez vega counsel.her counsel stated in his declaration that 
p rior to rodriguez sic guilty plea i had several conversations with here sic regarding potential immigration consequences.i explained to rodriguez that there was a potential to be deported based on her immigration status.i explained to rodriguez that i believed she had a better chance with immigration with a misdemeanor than a felony.
the district court denied the petition without holding any further hearing.it held that her counsel was required to advise his client only that her plea created a general risk of removal.the district court found this duty satisfied by his statement prior to rodriguez vega guilty plea that she faced a potential of removal,and by his statement at the sentencing hearing that she faced a high likelihood of removal.it also found that even assuming that counsel performance was ineffective,rodriguez vega was not prejudiced by that conduct.rodriguez vega appeals.
to prevail on her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,rodriguez vega must demonstrate that her attorney representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that she suffered prejudice as a result.strickland washington,u.
with respect to the ineffective performance prong,the district court erred because it applied the wrong legal standard.when the law is not succinct and straightforward,a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.padilla kentucky.however,where the law is succinct,clear,and explicit that the conviction renders removal virtually certain,counsel must advise his client that removal is a virtual certainty.id.at w hen the deportation consequence is truly clear,the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.united states bonilla,cir a criminal defendant who faces almost certain deportation is entitled to know more than that it is possible that a guilty plea could lead to removal he is entitled to know that it is a virtual certainty.emphasis in original 
where the immigration statute or controlling case law expressly identifies the crime of conviction as a ground for removal,the deportation consequence is truly clear.padilla,at.here,as in padilla and bonilla,the immigration statute expressly identifies rodriguez vega conviction as a ground for removal.see a n,a a iii see also padilla,at padilla counsel could have easily determined that his plea would make him eligible for deportation simply from reading the text of the statute.her conviction of a removable offense renders her removal practically inevitable.padilla,at.accordingly,we hold that rodriguez vega counsel was required to advise her that her conviction rendered her removal virtually certain,or words to that effect.see bonilla,at.
that rodriguez vega might theoretically avoid removal under the family member exception for offenders,see a n,by receiving withholding of removal,see b,or by qualifying for relief under the convention against torture cat,see c,does not alter our conclusion that on the record before us her removal was virtually certain 
we also reject the government arguments that counsel performance was not ineffective because rodriguez vega received notice that she might be removed from a provision in the plea agreement and the court plea colloquy under federal rule of criminal procedure.the government performance in including provisions in the plea agreement,and the court performance at the plea colloquy,are simply irrelevant to the question whether counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.see padilla,at quoting hill lockhart,white,concurring in the judgment it is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so clearly satisfies the first prong of the strickland analysis.emphasis added see also libretti united states,united states urias marrufo,cir it is counsel duty,not the court,to warn of certain immigration consequences,and counsel failure can not be saved by a plea colloquy.
nor do counsel statements made after rodriguez vega had already pled guilty,that she faced a high likelihood of removal,satisfy his duty to accurately advise his client of the removal consequences of a plea before she enters into it.see padilla,at before deciding whether to plead guilty,a defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of competent counsel emphasis added lafler cooper,s,during plea negotiations defendants are entitled to the effective assistance of competent counsel.citation omitted emphasis added.this is because,had she been properly and timely advised,rodriguez vega could have instructed her counsel to attempt to negotiate a plea that would not result in her removal.see padilla,at counsel who possess the most rudimentary understanding of the deportation consequences of a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain creatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation,as by avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically triggers the removal consequence.vartelas holder,armed with knowledge that a guilty plea would preclude travel abroad,alien defendants might endeavor to negotiate a plea to a nonexcludable offense see also hernandez cruz holder,cir discussing a plea agreement in which t he state secured convictions on the charges that are punished more harshly under state law without incurring the expense and hassle of a trial and the defendant agreed to plead guilty to a charge that,although more serious,had a smaller chance of causing adverse immigration consequences.in order that the benefits of plea bargaining can be realized,however,criminal defendants require effective counsel during plea negotiations.anything less might deny a defendant effective representation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and advice would help him.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original emphasis added.missouri frye.
the undisputed evidence clearly demonstrates that counsel performance was constitutionally ineffective.according to counsel own declaration,before rodriguez vega pled guilty he never informed her that she faced anything more than the mere potential of removal.because the immigration consequences of her plea were clear and her removal was virtually certain,we hold counsel performance constitutionally ineffective.strickland,at.
the government also argues that rodriguez vega did not satisfy the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel test.to satisfy the prejudice prong,a petitioner must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a standard of proof sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome and is somewhat lower than a preponderance of the evidence.id.t o obtain relief on this type of claim,a petitioner must convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.padilla,at.where ineffective assistance leads a petitioner to accept a plea bargain,a different result means that but for counsel errors,rodriguez vega would either have gone to trial or received a better plea bargain.howard,at.
rodriguez vega alleges that she would not have accepted the plea had she known she would be removed.instead,she declares,i would have insisted on a proceeding to trial or b an offer that would not have caused my deportation.
a petitioner may demonstrate that there existed a reasonable probability of negotiating a better plea by identifying cases indicating a willingness by the government to permit defendants charged with the same or a substantially similar crime to plead guilty to a offense.united states raya yaca,cir statistical evidence regarding proportion of aliens receiving relief in conjunction with individualized evidence supports finding of a plausible basis for alien relief.in her opening brief,rodriguez vega cites four recent cases from the southern district of california in which defendants originally charged with transportation of illegal aliens in violation of pled guilty to being an accessory after the fact in violation of these cases demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for counsel deficient performance,rodriguez vega could similarly have negotiated a different plea agreement not requiring her removal.
a petitioner may also demonstrate a reasonable probability by showing that she settled on a charge in a purposeful attempt to avoid an adverse effect on her immigration status.see kovacs united states,cir finding petitioner focus in the plea negotiations on the risk of immigration consequences and evidence that he settled on the felony charge for the sole reason that counsel believed it would not impair petitioner immigration status show ed a reasonable probability that he could have negotiated a plea with no effect on his immigration status.rodriguez vega rejected an initial plea bargain containing a stipulated removal provision,and accepted the revised plea bargain only after this provision had been removed.in addition,counsel declaration states that his client accepted the revised plea after he advised her that she had a better chance with immigration with the misdemeanor conviction than with the charged felony.these facts indicate that rodriguez vega settled on the misdemeanor charge with the stipulated removal provision deleted specifically in order to limit her chances of removal and,consequently,showed a reasonable probability that,but for counsel failure to provide adequate advice,she would have negotiated a plea bargain not requiring her removal.
alternatively,rodriguez vega has demonstrated prejudice by showing a reasonable probability that,even in the absence of a more favorable plea agreement,she would have gone to trial.it is often reasonable for a facing nearly automatic removal to turn down a plea and go to trial risking a longer prison term,rather than to plead guilty to an offense rendering her removal virtually certain.see padilla,at p reserving the client right to remain in the united states may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.quoting ins cyr,alteration omitted.we have found prejudice where a demonstrates clearly that she placed a particular emphasis on the immigration consequence of a plea in deciding whether or not to accept it.united states kwan,cir,abrogated on other grounds by padilla.
here,as noted,rodriguez vega made a concerted effort to avoid separation from her family,all of whom reside in the united states,by rejecting an initial plea agreement containing a stipulated removal provision.see id.at kwan has also gone to great lengths to avoid deportation and separation from his wife and children,who are all united states citizens.see also united states akinsade,cir we have found prejudice where the defendant,whose counsel misinformed him of deportation consequences,had significant familial ties to the united states and thus would reasonably risk going to trial instead of pleading guilty and facing certain deportation.she also demonstrated that she placed great emphasis on remaining in the united states by having numerous conversations with her counsel regarding the immigration consequences of her plea.see kwan,at alteration in original that kwan asked counsel about the immigration consequences of pleading guilty before agreeing to do so demonstrates clearly that he placed particular emphasis on immigration consequences in deciding whether or not to plead guilty.quoting hill,at.
rodriguez vega was just years old at the time she entered into the plea agreement.had she gone to trial on the initial felony charge,she faced a prison term likely spanning just months a young lawful permanent resident may rationally risk a far greater sentence for an opportunity to avoid lifetime separation from her family and the country in which they reside.see united states orocio.cir,abrogated on other grounds by chaidez united states.orocio was only years old at the time he entered the plea agreement,and he rationally could have been more concerned about a of multiple decades of banishment from the united states than the possibility of a single decade in prison.taken together,these facts demonstrate that rodriguez vega placed a particular emphasis on preserving her ability to remain in t
