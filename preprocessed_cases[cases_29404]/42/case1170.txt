yoselin linet martinez cazun,a native and citizen of guatemala,entered the united states illegally in.she was detained and removed under an expedited removal order.later that year,she attempted to the united states,was detained again,and her previous removal order was reinstated.when she attempted to apply for asylum,the board of immigration appeals bia held that she was statutorily ineligible to apply because her previous order of removal had been reinstated.cazun appeals that ruling.
this case thus presents a question that many of our sister circuits have already answered in the negative may an alien subject to a reinstated removal order apply for asylum because we find that congress has not spoken clearly on the issue in the relevant statute,we will give chevron deference to the agency reasonable statutory interpretation that aliens subject to reinstated removal orders are ineligible to apply for asylum.
background 
factual background 
in march,cazun fled her native guatemala following threats against her life by unknown persons.upon arrival in the united states,cazun was detained by immigration authorities.because cazun expressed a fear of returning to guatemala,an asylum officer interviewed her.the asylum officer made a negative credible fear determination,and an immigration judge ij affirmed that decision.thus,an expedited order of removal was issued to cazun,and she returned to guatemala.
upon cazun return to guatemala,her circumstances grew more dire.the head of a drug trafficking gang threatened,tortured,and sexually assaulted her to escape,cazun fled again to the united states,this time with her son.on her attempted,cazun was detained by border patrol.
after determining that cazun had already been removed from the united states once before,the department of homeland security dhs notified cazun that it intended to reinstate her previously entered removal order.through this reinstatement process,the dhs would simply her previous removal order and deport her rather than initiating an entirely new removal process.but before deportation,cazun expressed fear of returning to guatemala,so she was interviewed by an asylum officer the asylum officer made a negative reasonable fear determination,and an ij affirmed that decision.
subsequently,but still before deportation,cazun consulted counsel and urged that she had been unable to reveal the full details of her suffering in her previous interview due to the psychological trauma she had endured in guatemala.consequently,she obtained a new interview with an asylum officer.at this interview,cazun described being sexually assaulted,tortured,and facing threats against her life and the life of her son.the asylum officer concluded that cazun testimony was credible and that it established a reasonable fear of persecution.but because cazun previous removal order had been reinstated,she was placed in hearings before an ij to determine her eligibility for withholding of removal and convention against torture cat protection only.
the ij granted cazun withholding of removal and protection under the regulations implementing obligations under the cat,but would not consider cazun asylum request he stated that under current statutes and regulations,cazun was ineligible to apply for asylum due to her reinstated removal order 
cazun appealed to the bia,which agreed with the ij that cazun was ineligible for asylum.the bia based its decision on a,which states that aliens like cazun who are subject to a reinstated removal order are not eligible and may not apply for any relief under ch.the bia further cited applicable regulations of the attorney general that allow an alien fearing persecution to apply for withholding of removal only.emphasis added citing e,g e.cazun timely appealed the bia ruling to this court,urging that she is eligible for asylum pursuant to the asylum provision,and it should apply notwithstanding her reinstated removal order.
statutory background 
the issue presented by cazun appeal arises from two separate but related statutes,the asylum statute,and a,the reinstatement bar 
asylum statute 
the initial version of was enacted by the refugee act of,affording an alien the right to apply for asylum irrespective of immigration status.see refugee act of,pub,codified as amended at.the purpose of the act was to provide a permanent and systematic procedure for the admission to this country of refugees of special humanitarian concern to the united states.marincas lewis,cir.quoting pub,tit.i,b,stat.
in,congress altered the statutory scheme enacting the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,pub,div.c,stat.iirira preserved and in many ways replicated the initial version of.in its updated form,a instructed that a ny alien who is physically present in the united states irrespective of such alien status,may apply for asylum in accordance with this section.
despite this seemingly broad guarantee,congress carved out exceptions for several classes of aliens making them statutorily ineligible to apply for asylum those who could be safely resettled into another country,see a a,those who failed to timely apply,see a b,and those previously denied asylum,see a c.however,even in the face of these exceptions,a d created an exception to the exceptions despite a previous denial of asylum or tardy asylum application,an alien could apply if she could demonstrate changed circumstances which materially affect her eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.
ii.reinstatement 
iirira also altered the effect of a previously entered removal order.before iirira,previous removal orders were not reinstated against aliens who the country.instead,these aliens were placed in the same removal proceedings as other aliens who had not previously been removed.reinstatement of a previous removal order was reserved for only a subset of individuals.see gonzales.
but in iirira,congress hardened the effect of a reinstated removal order.as the supreme court noted,in enacting this provision congress toed a harder line with respect to reinstatement.id.at.the act broadened the applicability of reinstatement,and it explicitly insulate d the removal orders from review,and generally foreclose d discretionary relief from the terms of the reinstated order.id.at.
the new reinstatement provision reads 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter,and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after reentry.
a emphasis added.t his chapter refers to chapter of title of the code,which contains both the asylum statute and the reinstatement bar.
iii.attorney general interpretation of the statutory scheme 
three years after congress enacted iirira,the attorney general promulgated e instructing that i f an asylum officer determines that an alien subject to a reinstated removal order has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture,the officer shall so inform the alien and issue a r eferral to an immigration judge,for full consideration of the request for withholding of removal only.emphasis added.
the attorney general clarified that under the regulations aliens subject to reinstated removal orders were ineligible for asylum but may be entitled to withholding of removal or cat protection.regulations concerning the convention against torture,fed.reg.this distinction between withholding of removal and asylum for those subject to reinstated removal orders allow ed for the fair and expeditious resolution of claims without unduly disrupting the streamlined removal process applicable to aliens subject to reinstated removal orders.id.at in brief,the attorney general determined that the statutory scheme forbade aliens subject to reinstated removal orders from applying for asylum,but allowed such aliens withholding of removal.the bia relied on this interpretation in deciding cazun case.
ii.discussion 
the issue before us is whether an alien whose removal order is reinstated is statutorily ineligible to apply for asylum.we must reconcile two apparently conflicting provisions of the ina,both enacted on the same day.on the one hand,a allows any alien irrespective of such alien status to apply for asylum.on the other hand,a instructs that an alien subject to a reinstated removal order is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter.
we are not the first court to consider the effect of a reinstated removal order.to date,four courts of appeals have addressed this question.each has concluded that individuals subject to reinstated removal orders may not apply for asylum,though the courts have parted ways in their rationales three of these courts have found the reinstatement bar clear on its face but these courts mention the asylum provision only in passing,or not at all.only the ninth circuit explicitly considered the interplay between the asylum provision and the reinstatement bar.following the analytic path set forth in chevron natural resources defense council,that court determined that the statutory scheme was ambiguous,and that the attorney general interpretation forbidding aliens subject to reinstated removal orders from applying for asylum to be reasonable.lynch,cir,reh g and reh g en banc denied cir.we agree.
using the same chevron framework that the ninth circuit employed,we first assess whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if we can discern congressional intent using the plain text and traditional tools of statutory construction,our inquiry ends we give effect to congress intent.see id.at.if,however,the statute remains ambiguous,we defer to the agency reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme,even if the interpretation is not what we would otherwise choose.see cable telecomm.ass brand x internet.
chevron step one 
in discerning congressional intent,we look first to the plain text of the statute.csx,inv.dep t of revenue.in this case,the text does not indicate clear and unambiguous congressional intent.both provisions at play use broad language to characterize their mandates that any alien can apply for asylum,a,but that aliens subject to reinstated removal orders are barred from any relief,a.read naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning united states gonzales.it means one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.id.quoting webster third new international dictionary.
but despite use of the word any,neither section is as broad as it first seems.as to a,despite claiming that any alien may apply for asylum,the section then lists specific groups of aliens who may not in fact apply.a a c.so,it is not any alien who can apply,but only certain classes of aliens.as to a,although the section bars any relief under the chapter,precedent and the attorney general own interpretation clarify that withholding from removal and cat protection both forms of relief are actually still available to individuals in reinstatement proceedings.see,at e,c.here,the plain language of the statute offers no insight into congress intent as to how we should interpret the interplay between the two sections at issue.
nor can we discern congress clear intent using traditional tools of statutory construction.chevron,at.to start,both sides rely on the canon generalia specialibus non derogant,that the specific governs the general in interpreting a statutory scheme.see,howard.the logic behind this canon is quite simple when there are two conflicting provisions,we can assume that congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems with specific solutions.radlax gateway hotel,llc amalgamated bank,quoting varity v.how e,thomas,dissenting.thus,the more specific section targets the specific question at issue and that section should control our interpretation.
here,however,the canon does not help us resolve the question definitively,because each subsection is more specific in certain respects and more general in others.section a speaks with specificity as to a type of relief cazun seeks asylum.but a speaks with specificity as to a subset of aliens those,like cazun,subject to reinstated removal orders.while judge hardiman makes several persuasive arguments as to why he finds the reinstatement bar the more specific provision,concurrence typescript at,we are not convinced that this canon renders the statutory scheme clear at chevron first step,especially given the asylum bar explicit applicability to aliens irrespective of their status.
nor does legislative history clarify congress intent on the matter.iirira amendments to the ina show congress intended to add more detail to the existing asylum scheme while simultaneously expanding the scope and consequences of the reinstatement of an earlier removal order,at.because congress enacted the two conflicting provisions on the same day,cherry picking statements from legislative history tends to ignore congressional intent on the opposing provision.legislative history is of little use in helping us resolve this question.
cazun offers a number of other arguments to support her position that the statute is clear on its face.none are convincing.first,she emphasizes a minor textual change congress made when it recrafted the ina in.the original text of the asylum provision had stated that an alien could apply for asylum irrespective of status the updated text provided that any alien could do so.compare a,with id.a.we think this change is of little interpretive significance,because on the same day that congress made the change it forbade those subject to reinstated removal orders from obtaining any relief.certainly this minor alteration does not clearly express congress intent on the matter.
second,cazun suggests that making aliens subject to reinstated removal orders ineligible for asylum risks running afoul of treaty obligations under the united nations protocol relating to the status of refugees protocol or that treaty obligations should at least inform our reading of the statute.but,given the availability of withholding of removal and cat protection,there is no treaty obligation in conflict with the government reading.see lynch,cir.denying rehearing en banc 
finally,cazun argues that our reasoning in marincas lewis,cir,counsels that we find the ina to be clear and unambiguous here.in that case,we considered whether the refugee act of required that stowaways receive the same asylum proceedings as aliens.one provision of the ina commanded that the attorney general establish a procedure singular for aliens to apply for asylum irrespective of the alien status.a.but an provision instructed that stowaways,a specific class of aliens,were not entitled to an exclusion hearing,where the asylum determination took place.marincas,at.thus,the bia reasoned such stowaway applicants for asylum were not entitled to the same adversarial adjudication before an ij that other aliens received at an exclusion hearing.see id.at.instead,the bia concluded that stowaways applying for asylum should receive only a interview before an ins employee.see id.at.
we rejected the bia distinction between stowaways and other aliens with respect to asylum proceedings.we found that,regarding the question we faced there,the plain meaning of the refugee act is clear and unambiguous at the first step of chevron.id.at.because the statute required a uniform procedure for an alien to apply for asylum irrespective of such alien status,we found that congress did not intend to allow one procedure for stowaways and another for other aliens.see id.at.however,we noted that stowaways hearings could be limited to the issue of asylum,and that their hearings need not reach any other exclusion issue.
cazun likens her case to marincas one provision of the ina singles out her group those subject to reinstated removal orders for less favorable immigration procedures than other aliens,while another provision envisions equal asylum procedures for all aliens.
cazun analogy fails,however,for several reasons.first,as cazun herself agreed at oral argument,in marincas we considered a different statute altogether than the one we analyze today.there,we interpreted the refugee act of,not iirira.although the language of the asylum provision remained largely unchanged by iirira,the statutory scheme as a whole shifted dramatically.therefore,marincas interpretation of the asylum provision enacted in does little to clarify what congress intended when it enacted iirira,which included the broad reinstatement bar,sixteen years later.
second,even setting this difference aside,common principles of statutory interpretation distinguish cazun case from marincas.when interpreting statutes,we work to fit,if possible,all parts of a statute into an harmonious whole.food drug admin.brown williamson tobacco,quoting ftc mandel.in marincas,we were able to so harmonize the statutory scheme without doing serious damage to either of the provisions at issue.for although we held that stowaways were entitled to the same adversarial hearing as other aliens,we nonetheless reasoned that the stowaway hearing could be limited to the issue of asylum eligibility consistent with the stowaway provision dictates,the asylum hearing need not reach any other issue of exclusion.marincas,at.thus,our ruling harmonized the seemingly contradictory provisions,and we were able to preserve the basic thrust of the stowaway provision.id.here,cazun offers no similar way for us to preserve both a and a.
finally,at the core of our reasoning in marincas was a commitment to discerning congressional intent.we found strong support for the idea that congress clearly intended a single,uniform procedure be established with respect to asylum proceedings.id.so when we interpreted the weighty asylum provision alongside a somewhat cursory,technical provision regarding stowaways,it was not difficult to conclude that congress intended that the asylum provision should control.but here,we must square the asylum provision that affords relief with the reinstatement bar that takes such relief away.we know that congress intended the reinstatement bar to be taken seriously,see,at,and that the provision should be given considerable weight in interpreting the provisions.thus we can not say,as we did in marincas,that congress clearly intended that one provision or the other should control.because of these differences,we can not reconcile the provisions so as to find the ina clear and unambiguous here 
the attorney general arguments that the text is clear and unambiguous fare no better than cazun.for while the government focuses on language barring aliens from any relief,it ignores the affirmative asylum provision,which applies on its face to any alien,irrespective of such alien status.accordingly,because the statute does not clearly indicate congressional intent,we proceed to the second step of chevron.
chevron step two 
at the second step of chevron,we defer to the agency interpretation of the statute as long as that reading is reasonable.brand x internet,at.deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials must make complex policy judgments.see,at yosupov,at.we must therefore decide whether e which prevents individuals subject to reinstated removal orders from applying for asylum is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme 
it was reasonable for the agency to conclude that the statutory reinstatement bar foreclosing any relief under this chapter means just what it says no asylum relief is available to those subject to reinstated removal orders.certainly this interpretation was not unreasonable two courts of appeals have explicitly adopted the same interpretation without even finding the statutory scheme ambiguous,at,at 
even independent of these courts conclusions,at least four factors lend support to the agency interpretation.first,as discussed at length in judge hardiman concurrence,the reinstatement bar is,at least in some respects,more specific than the asylum provision.it applies to a far narrower group of aliens those subject to reinstated removal orders than the asylum provision,which applies to all aliens.from a purely textual standpoint,this in and of itself might compel us to agree with the attorney general were we forced to decide the issue without resorting to chevron.
second,the supreme court has already emphasized congressional intent as to iirira in,at congress meant to strengthen the effect of the reinstatement bar.see also i,at t he ability to cross into the united states over and over with no consequences undermines the credibility of our efforts to secure the border.the agency interpretation is faithful to that intent.for aliens who our shores illegally despite previous removal and instructions not to return,the attorney general interpretation takes asylum off the table while allowing other forms of relief that fulfill humanitarian commitments.
third,the supreme court has emphasized that the attorney general can deny asylum in the agency discretion even when an alien meets the criteria for asylum,at see also d b.it would be strange to find that granting asylum is discretionary,but that the attorney general must allow cazun to apply,even in the face of contradictory statutory text.
finally,the agency has expertise making complex policy judgments related to asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.deference regarding questions of immigration policy is especially appropriate.see,at.
all this is not to say that the agency position is flawless.to start,the attorney general interpretation bars from asylum those like cazun whose compelling claims arose after their first removal order was issued.this is at least in tension with the text of a d,which allows aliens who can demonstrate changed circumstances to apply for asylum even when a previous application was rejected.
further,the attorney general reading seems counterintuitive as applied to someone in cazun situation.an alien like cazun who complies with a removal order is barred from asserting an asylum claim on illegal reentry.but aliens ordered to be removed who evade deportation are not similarly barred those aliens never left the country,so their first removal order remains in effect and is not subject to reinstatement.thus,such aliens avoid the reinstatement bar and may apply for asylum in the face of changed circumstances,while those who comply with the removal order but reenter illegally can not.
however,these points are not fatal to the government case.for while the government reading leaves vulnerable those like cazun whose claims for asylum arose after they were previously removed,as the government urged in briefing and oral argument,reinstatement of a removal order is not automatic.see a,at t he government has discretion to forgo reinstatement and instead place an individual in ordinary removal proceedings.citing holder,cir.the agency may rely on this flexibility when deciding whether to reinstate a previous removal order.exercising this discretion in cases like cazun speaks to the wisdom of the agency policy,rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by congress.chevron,at as a result,we will defer to the agency expertise on complex matters of immigration policy such as the one before us today.see,at.
iii.conclusion 
in summary,the agency interpretation of the ambiguous statute is reasonable.when congress enacted iirira,it set the agency adrift between an interpretive scylla and charybdis.no reading including cazun could harmonize the statutory scheme perfectly.but because the attorney general reading,bolstered by its own expertise,is reasonable,we will defer to it and uphold the decision of the bia.
under chevron,res.def.council,we do not defer to an agency construction of a statute when congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.at issue in this appeal is whether yoselin cazun may apply for asylum even though she is the subject of a reinstated removal order.to answer that question we must analyze two provisions of the immigration and naturalization act the asylum provision and a the reinstatement bar.the asylum provision permits a ny alien to apply for asylum,while the reinstatement bar precludes aliens subject to reinstated removal orders from applying for any relief.based on the text,history,and structure of the statute,i would hold that the reinstatement bar precludes cazun from applying for asylum.this interpretation fulfills our duty to fit,if possible,all parts of this statute into an harmonious whole.fda brown williamson tobacco,citation omitted.
three of our sister courts agree that the ina precludes aliens like cazun from applying for asylum.see att y,cir.holding an alien with a reinstated removal order is not eligible for and can not seek asylum lynch,cir.holding the reinstatement bar,read plainly,broadly denies all forms of redress from removal,including asylum,pet for reh g en banc denied,cir.holder,cir.accepting regulations applying restrictions to aliens subject to reinstatement removal orders as correct statutory interpretations see id.at discussing the availability of suspension of deportation or asylum and noting the terms of the reinstatement bar preclude such relief.but see lynch,cir.finding the statute ambiguous and deferring to the agency.and while i agree with the ninth circuit in and with the majority that the agency interpretation here is reasonable,i would join the eleventh,fifth,and second circuits in finding that it is compelled by the statute.
the provisions at issue in this appeal were codified in as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,pub,div.c,stat.iirira recodified the asylum provision at and enacted for the first time the reinstatement bar codified at a,which prohibits illegal reentrants from applying for any relief under the statute.
the asylum provision as recodified in iirira retained its original scope and was reformatted in two sections.one section provides that a ny alien,irrespective of such alien status,may apply for asylum if present in the country,and the other section lists some exceptions to the general provision.a.
iirira also implemented a more efficient process for the reinstatement of removal orders.before,those who entered the united states illegally after having been deported typically were placed in a new round of regular deportation proceedings.gonzales.iirira streamlined the system by reinstating prior orders of removal as of their original start date,thus hastening the removal process as such,aliens with reinstated orders may be removed at any time after the reentry,without new administrative hearings or any opportunity for review.a.most important for purposes of this appeal,reinstated orders disqualify those who reenter after prior removal from obtaining any relief under this chapter.id.
as the supreme court noted,the reinstatement bar toed a harder line by appl ying to all illegal reentrants,at emphasis added.this harder line,id.at,punishes and deters the criminal act of reentering the country illegally,see.see generally in re briones,o ne of the chief purposes of the iirira was to overcome the problem of recidivist immigration violations by inter alia escalating the punitive consequences of illegal reentry.citing iirira a,b,a,a,b,a,b,which expedite the detection,deterrence,and punishment of recidivist immigration violators.
the immigration and naturalization service implemented the reinstatement bar by promulgating regulations that established expedited removal proceedings for illegal reentrants subject to a prior removal order,a,c,and precluded those aliens from filing asylum applications,id.e allowing reasonable fear proceedings for full consideration of the request for withholding of removal only emphasis added.
at chevron step one,we use traditional tools of statutory construction to ascertain whether congress had an intention on the precise question.hanif att y,cir.citation omitted.in doing so,we consider the text and structure of the statute in question.united states geiser,cir.
cazun and the government agree that the statute is clear,but they disagree about whose position it supports.cazun claims she should prevail because the asylum provision states that a ny alien may apply for asylum,irrespective of such alien status.a.for its part,the government argues that cazun is ineligible for asylum because she is subject to a reinstated removal order and the reinstatement bar says she is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under chapter of title of the united states code,which includes the asylum provision.a.
we previously found both sections at issue to be clear when read independently.we held in marincas lewis that under the plain meaning of the asylum provision,congress clearly and unambiguously intended that the attorney general establish a uniform asylum procedure that is to be applied irrespective of an alien status,cir.disallowing unequal procedures for alien stowaways.marincas does not control this appeal,however.as my colleagues note,op.at,marincas did not analyze the reinstatement bar because it had not yet taken effect.after our decision in marincas,in a case dealing with the reinstatement bar,we assumed in dicta that asylum is not available to aliens who face reinstatement of a prior order of removal under a.att y,cir.because neither marincas nor analyzed the interplay between the asylum provision and the reinstatement bar,this appeal requires us for the first time to attempt to harmonize two statutory provisions that seem,at first blush,to conflict with one another.air guard fed.labor relations,cir.see also morton mancari,the courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments,and it is the duty of courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.
our effort to harmonize these provisions begins with the text of the statute.csx.dep t of revenue.as the majority notes,both provisions use the word any,which typically has an expansive meaning.op.at citing united states gonzales.yet neither section is as broad as it first seems.id.
after stating that any alien,irrespective of status,may apply for asylum,the asylum provision then lists several exceptions preventing certain aliens from doing so in specific circumstances.see a.it is thus clear that some aliens may not apply for asylum.in a similar way,after the reinstatement bar states that aliens with reinstated removal orders may not apply for any relief,the statute goes on to allow them to seek withholding of removal to certain countries.see b a.thus,that section does not bar all types of relief.so neither provision is absolute,and both may be limited by other provisions.therefore,we must turn to canons of construction and the statute structure to see whether the two provisions can be harmonized.
cazun and the government both invoke the specificity canon of statutory construction.op.at.simply put,this means that a narrow,precise,and specific statutory provision is not overridden by another provision covering a more generalized spectrum.radzanower touche ross,see also antonin scalia bryan garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts explaining that because the more specific text comes closer to addressing the very problem posed by the case at hand,it is thus more deserving of credence.
instead of challenging this canon of construction,the parties each claim that their favored provision is more specific than the other one.although both parties provide reasonable arguments i am convinced that the reinstatement bar is more specific than the asylum provision.while the asylum provision establishes general rules for asylum applications,the reinstatement bar deals specifically with a particular subset of illegal aliens those who are subject to reinstated removal orders.as such,it is most naturally read as an exception to the general permission,scalia garner,supra,at,to apply for asylum.by making relief unavailable to certain aliens,the reinstatement bar nullifies every relief provision to which it applies with respect to certain persons no longer eligible for that relief.
cazun argues that the reinstatement bar is a blunt instrument that is less detailed,and thus less specific,than the asylum provision.cazun br.i disagree.the reinstatement bar ap
