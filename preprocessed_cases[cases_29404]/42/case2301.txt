miguel is a native and citizen of mexico who is fighting removal charges.he entered the united states without inspection in or and remained for about two years before returning to mexico.in,again entered the united states without inspection and has been here ever since.when the department of homeland security dhs caught up with him,it filed charges seeking his removal.by then,father a permanent resident had filed a petition for adjustment of status to permanent resident on behalf of,and the petition had been approved.unfortunately for,these petitions represent only one step along the road toward adjusted status.the critical final requirement is a current priority date.as of the time was placed in removal proceedings,his priority date had not yet come up.in plain english,that meant that was not yet eligible to complete the process of adjusting his status.
the immigration judge ij initially granted a continuance to see whether his priority date would become current in the reasonably foreseeable future,but eventually the ij concluded that even if that happened,was statutorily ineligible for permanent residence because he had accumulated more than a year of unlawful presence.immigration and nationality act ina a b i ii,a b i ii.the ij also held that i the life act,which allows aliens illegally in the united states to adjust their not change the fact of inadmissibility because was otherwise inadmissible under a b i ii.the board of immigration appeals board or bia agreed with the ij.because we conclude that the board did not adequately take into account the difference between a b i ii and a c i i,we grant petition for review and remand the case for further proceedings.
was born in mexico and lived there for most of his early life.in march,when was years old,father became a lawful permanent resident of the united states and immediately filed a form,petition for alien relative,for his children.the petition was approved on june,this gave a priority date of march.the priority date determines the order in which the responsible actual visas.for reasons not apparent from the record,in or,entered the united states without inspection.he stayed in the country unlawfully for approximately two years before returning to mexico.in,again entered the united states without inspection and has remained here since that time.
on march,dhs placed in removal proceedings,charging him under a a i with removability as an alien present without admission or parole.responded on september,with an application to register permanent residence or adjust status form,which he filed with the immigration court.in his application,he asserted that he was eligible to adjust his status pursuant to the life act,i,notwithstanding his unlawful entry,based on his approved visa petition.at a master calendar hearing on october,the ij granted a continuance,in the expectation that priority date might be reached.as of october,dhs was issuing visas for aliens from mexico in preference category with priority dates earlier than march,it later lost ground and was handling applicants with priority dates before january.at the same time that he granted the continuance,the ij warned that he might be inadmissible anyway.the ij pointed out that under a b i ii,an alien is inadmissible if he 
has been unlawfully present in the united states for one year or more,and again seeks admission within years of the date of such alien departure or removal from the united states.
emphasis added,the judge thought,might fit that bill.the ij concluded that inadmissibility would be addressed at the next hearing and invited him to seek a hardship waiver pursuant to a b v.
at the december,hearing,requested another continuance because the visa numbers in his preference category still had not become current in fact,as we noted earlier,they had retrogressed.did not offer any argument or evidence in support of a hardship waiver.the ij refused to grant another continuance.this time,the judge squarely decided that even if a visa were immediately available to,he was inadmissible under the terms of a b i ii which we abbreviate as b i ii from here on.
appealed to the bia.the board gave case its full attention,admitting supplemental briefs and hearing oral argument.in a published,precedential opinion,it dismissed his appeal.see in re miguel,wl bia cited as bia below.the bia began with the question whether,as a threshold matter,b i ii rendered inadmissible.the bia rejected argument that this section was inapplicable to him.had contended that the term departure in the section,which we have emphasized above,referred only to a departure accomplished through some kind of legal process,such as a grant of voluntary departure or permission to depart under threat of removal.had also argued that the heading of subsection,aliens previously removed,indicates that its provisions apply only to aliens who have been formally removed from the united states through some kind of removal proceeding,not to aliens who have left the country of their own volition.
the bia was not persuaded.it held that the term departure in b i ii applied to because,in its view,the plain language of the term encompasses any departure from the united states,regardless of whether it is a voluntary departure in lieu of removal or under threat of removal,or it is a departure that is made wholly outside the context of a removal proceeding.bia at,wl.the bia also held that the heading to subsection did not limit its meaning.even though,as the board conceded,some provisions of a do explicitly refer to previously removed aliens,the board observed that it is well settled that the heading of a section can not limit the plain meaning of the text,and it is of use only when it sheds light on some ambiguous word or phrase.bia at,wl.because it found the meaning of b i ii to be clear,the board concluded that the section heading did not modify or otherwise explain it.
the board then turned to what it had identified as the principal issue in case whether an alien who is inadmissible to the united states under b i ii may obtain adjustment of status under the life act,i.bia at,wl.it turned for guidance to its precedential opinion in in re briones,bia.in briones,the board held that aliens inadmissible under a different part of the statute,a c i i,which covers a liens unlawfully present after previous immigration violations,are ineligible for adjustment of status under i.see at.for the sake of readability,we abbreviate a c i i as c i i from here on.even though case involved b i ii,the board found no reason to come to a different conclusion.it saw no distinction between aliens such as briones who were inadmissible under c i i for making or attempting to make an illegal reentry into the united states following a prior period of more than year of unlawful presence,and aliens such as who were inadmissible under b i ii because they had accrued more than year of unlawful presence,illegally reentered the country,and then sought admission through adjustment of status within the united states.bia at,wl.the board concluded that the plain language of i a unambiguously requires an applicant for adjustment of status to prove that he is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and that aliens inadmissible under b i ii necessarily fail to meet that requirement,absent an available waiver.id.further,the board reaffirmed its statement in briones that in every case where congress has extended eligibility for adjustment of status to inadmissible aliens,it has done so unambiguously,that is,by express waiver.id.
the board rejected the possibility that its conclusion that aliens inadmissible under b i ii are ineligible for adjustment of status under i might lead to absurd consequences.this was a risk,it admitted,if aliens generally inadmissible under a a i,aliens who have entered without inspection were held to be ineligible under i such a holding would effectively eliminate the entire adjustment of status option.but,the board thought,a a i is not coextensive with either b i ii or c i i at issue respectively in case and briones case.unlike the latter two provisions,a a i is not punitive in nature.it does not seek to punish persons who enter the united states without inspection.in contrast,the board reasoned,b i ii is intended to punish aliens who seek admission after having previously accrued a period of unlawful presence.the board concluded that this interpretation of b i ii was consistent with the purpose of a as a whole that purpose,it said,was to compound the adverse consequences of immigration violations by making it more difficult for individuals who have left the united states after committing such violations to be lawfully admitted thereafter bia at,wl quoting in re,bia.
petition for review raises two issues first,whether the board erred in its determination that b i ii applied to him and second,whether the board correctly found that i is inapplicable to aliens found inadmissible under b i ii.the government urges us to give chevron deference to the bia interpretation of both statutes.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.we agree that the chevron framework applies,see negusie holder,d,but we hasten to add that chevron does not simply hold that the agency interpretation always prevails.instead,we must first ask whether the language of the statute at issue is clear.if so,then we follow the plain language of the statute.if not,then we go on to consider whether the bia reading is a permissible one whether or not is the one that we would have chosen.chevron,at.see also a ins,d a.
the central question before us is whether the board acted within its chevron powers when it concluded that b i ii and c i i were essentially equivalent.for convenience,we set forth the relevant language of each one,including the language in a that precedes both subparts 
a classes of aliens inadmissible for visas or admission.except as otherwise provided aliens who are inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the united states 
aliens previously removed.
b aliens unlawfully present.
i in general.any alien other than an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who 
ii has been unlawfully present in the united states for one year or more,and who again seeks admission within years of the date of such alien departure or removal from the united states,
is inadmissible.
c aliens unlawfully present after previous immigration violations.
i in general.any alien who 
i has been unlawfully present in the united states for an aggregate period of more than year 
and who enters or attempts to reenter the united states without being admitted is inadmissible.
although a quick glance at b i ii and c i i might leave the impression that they are redundant,we can not leave matters there.the supreme court has cautioned us to read statutes carefully,see,jama immigration and customs enforcement,d,and it has warned against easy assumptions that differing language in two subsections of a law has the same meaning,see,russello united states,d.that said,one can see that both subparts of a address the general situation of aliens who at some point have been present in the united states unlawfully.indeed,both address the case of aliens who were unlawfully present in the united states for one year or more.but at that point,the two subparts diverge in a way that the board did not recognize.
before addressing these differences in detail,we must resolve a preliminary point having to do with the meaning of the term admission in b i ii.argues that it refers only to formal admission to the united states,both at the time of the first entry into this country and at the time of.the alternative is to understand admission as a broader term that might refer to illegal entry in some contexts,and to lawful entry in others.if the term admission were limited to formal admissions to the united states,then would be correct that b i ii would not apply to him,since he did not formally apply for admission during his first stay here and indeed did not do so until he filed his form on september.the bia,however,found no merit in the contention that the section does not apply to aliens,like himself,who are not applying for admission at a foreign consulate.in fact,we have expressly concluded otherwise in in re.bia at,wl.in fact,a closer look at in re,bia,shows that it does not dispose of claim,since it rejected only the argument that b i ii applies only to aliens seeking admission at the border.the board explained that 
the term admission in the ina generally refers to adjustment of status from within the united states,as well as lawful entry at the border if the term admission did not include lawful admission to permanent residence by means of adjustment of status,then section a b i ii would preclude an alien from acquiring lawful permanent residence through admission as an immigrant at the border,but would permit the very same alien to evade this preclusion by simply entering the united states unlawfully and applying for adjustment.we do not believe that congress intends the immigration and nationality act to be interpreted in a manner that would give aliens an incentive to enter the united states illegally.
we have no reason to disagree with the board position that the word admission means different things,depending on the particular part of the ina that is at issue.this is true despite the fact that the definition of admission in a a appears to limit the term to lawful entry.the board has read the definition as if it were prefaced with the phrase unless the context otherwise provides.see in re,bia.we recognized this in abdelqadar gonzales,where we noted that to accept that the term admission extends beyond the statutory definition in the context of one clause is not to imply that the word must have the same meaning in another,cir.t he whole point of contextual reading,we wrote,is that context the context of the word admission in one part of the statute differs substantially from its context in another.id.at.
returning,therefore,to b i ii and c i i,we reiterate that both are triggered by an initial sojourn in the united states that was unlawful.both address the terms of.but here the similarities cease.subpart c i i applies to an alien who enters or attempts to reenter the united states without being admitted.subpart b i ii,in contrast,speaks of an alien who again seeks admission within years of the date of such alien departure or removal from the united states.only two possibilities exist either these two statutes cover exactly the same ground,or congress choice of different words means something.as we noted,we should not lightly come to the former conclusion.in fact,as we now explain,there is an important line that is being drawn,and it is a line that has significance for the kind of relief that is seeking.
the key phrase in b i ii is the one we have emphasized above it applies to the alien who has is to say,asked to the united states within the window.subpart c i i itself acknowledges that there must be some avenue for this kind of lawful petition for reentry,since it makes inadmissible only those who enter or attempt to reenter without being admitted.no one is entitled to be admitted without seeking admission from the attorney general or the secretary of the department of homeland security.there might be every reason to hold,as the board did in briones,that aliens inadmissible under c i i that is to say,aliens who have not legitimately sought admission to the united states after their previous immigration ineligible for adjustment of status under the life act,i.but to equate the unlawful with someone who is seeking admission is another matter entirely.
with these distinctions in mind,we turn to the core of petition his claim that the bia erroneously concluded that he was barred as a matter of law from taking advantage of the life act.the board equated the inadmissibility of someone who is subject to c i i with the inadmissibility of a person subject to b i ii,without asking how the difference that we have identified between the two subparts intersects with the life act.
other circuits that have looked at this general problem have focused only on how c i i affects eligibility under the life act.most have agreed with the board,especially
