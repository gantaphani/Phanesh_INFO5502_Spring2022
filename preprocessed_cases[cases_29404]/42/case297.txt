factual and procedural background 
makieh,a syrian citizen,was born and grew up in latakia,syria.latakia is also home to the family of syria president,bashar,whom the state department country report on human rights practices for described as authoritarian.while makieh is fearful of the president family and of the islamic extremism on the rise in his home country,neither he nor any member of his family has ever been harmed by the syrian government or by anyone else in syria.in the,makieh brother,mohammed,and father,ahmad,came to the united states.both subsequently became citizens.makieh mother and sisters continue to live in syria makieh testified before the immigration court that they do not face any threat of actual because they live a simple life away from people,just family.
in october of,when makieh was years old and facing conscription into the syrian military,he entered the united states on a student visa.that visa authorized him to remain in this country for duration of status,or,which meant the time during which makieh wa s pursuing a full course of study at an educational institution approved originally by the immigration and naturalization service ins,and later by the department of homeland security dhs f i.makieh never enrolled in the educational program for which he had been approved.
remaining in the united states without permission,makieh lived with his brother and father.in july of,makieh father,who by then had attained permanent resident status through his son mohammed,filed an immigrant petition for relative the visa petition on makieh behalf.pursuant to a b,the visa petition named makieh as the unmarried adult son of a permanent resident.if granted,the visa petition would have made makieh eligible to apply for adjustment of his residency status to that of lawful permanent resident.see taing napolitano,cir see also.
on january,the ins initiated removal proceedings against makieh.just over six months later,makieh married a citizen,and in june of,she filed a visa petition on his behalf.before that petition could be adjudicated,however,the couple formally separated,and they divorced in december of.makieh marriage also voided the earlier visa petition filed by his father,because the marriage rendered makieh ineligible,under the immigration and naturalization act ina,for consideration as an unmarried adult son of a permanent resident,a.following makieh divorce,ahmad makieh filed a second visa petition for makieh as his unmarried adult son.
just before his divorce,in october of,makieh had filed an application for asylum and for withholding of removal,cancellation of removal,and protection under the cat.at his final hearing before the ij on the merits of this application,makieh testified that he had come to the united states to be with his brother and father,and to embrace american freedom and democracy.he also testified,in broad terms,as to his fear of the syrian government as motivating him to come to the united states.makieh further testified that he became truly afraid of returning to syria after the events of september,and the invasions of iraq and afghanistan that followed.the administrative record includes evidence of an increase,since those invasions,in violence perpetrated by syrian extremists against american interests.that violence included the bombing of the american embassy in damascus the month prior to makieh final hearing in immigration court.
according to makieh,because he has spent his adult life in the united states,islamic see him as being like americans,and thus like a traitor or something.as a result,he fears for his safety and believes he will be tortured if he returns to syria.however,makieh father,an american citizen,returns to syria on a regular basis for holy days he generally spends several months at a time there before returning to the united states.ahmad makieh has never been harmed by the syrian government or by islamic extremists.makieh brother,also an american citizen,likewise has returned to syria on a number of occasions and has not been harmed.makieh himself has not returned to syria since he left in.finally,makieh,his father,and his brother all testified or averred that ahmad makieh would suffer extraordinary hardship if makieh were removed to syria,because makieh is the principal caregiver for his father.
the ij ruled on makieh application in an oral decision handed down on october.the ij first denied the application for asylum as untimely,ruling that makieh failed to file his application within the period,starting from the date of arrival in the united states,mandated by the ina,a b.the ij explained that makieh was not eligible for consideration of an untimely application because even if the court accepted his contention that changed circumstances in syria materially affected his eligibility for asylum,makieh failed to file his application within a reasonable time after learning of those changed circumstances and makieh failed to show any other extraordinary circumstances that would justify untimely filing.see a d.
the ij went on to deny makieh application for withholding of removal and for protection under the cat,finding that makieh failed to demonstrate a clear probability,that it is more likely than he would be persecuted on the basis of one of five statutorily enumerated grounds or that he would be tortured.see b a withholding of removal b same id.c,implementing the cat holder,cir reciting clear probability standard for withholding of removal sulaiman gonzales,cir applying same standard for protection under the cat 
on makieh appeal,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision in full,summarizing the decision and adding the observation that makieh alleged unawareness of the availability of asylum did not qualify for an exception to the filing deadline for asylum applications.the bia dismissed the appeal on august,and makieh timely filed his petition for review before this court.
makieh seeks review of the following the ij alleged failure to consider his argument that he is eligible to have his untimely application for asylum considered on the merits because his reliance on his father and wife petitions for visas on his behalf constituted an extraordinary circumstance and the ij determination that it is not more likely than not that makieh would be persecuted or tortured if he were removed to syria.
