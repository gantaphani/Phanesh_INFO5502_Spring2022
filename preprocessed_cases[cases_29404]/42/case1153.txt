ming lam sui sui petitions for review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision dismissing his appeal of a removal order issued by an immigration judge ij who found sui deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under a a iii.specifically,the ij and the bia found that sui had been convicted of an attempt to commit an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to victims exceeds and thus had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in a m i,a u.
background 
sui federal conviction 
sui immigrated to the united states from china in when he was years old.in may,in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin,he pleaded guilty to a indictment charging him with knowingly and unlawfully possessing counterfeit securities with the intent to deceive another in violation of a.specifically,the indictment alleged that sui possessed approximately counterfeit chase visa traveler checks with a total face value of approximately.the presentence investigation report psr prepared in connection with sui sentencing described the underlying circumstances of sui conviction as follows.in february,wisconsin state troopers stopped a car in which sui and a companion were traveling near eau claire,wisconsin,after the troopers clocked it at miles per hour.when the troopers approached the car,they noted that it was filled with a large amount of merchandise,shopping bags,and cartons of cigarettes.the troopers asked if they could search the car for drugs or large sums of money,and sui consented.chase visa traveler checks were found in the car,and a call to visa established that the checks were counterfeit.
sui and his companion were arrested,and checks were found on sui in a search incident to arrest.during booking,a further checks were found in sui possession.the secret service subsequently recovered checks that had been passed by sui and his companion at businesses in wisconsin.not all the counterfeit checks cashed by sui were recovered by the secret service,but three more victim businesses were identified,with losses of 
according to the psr,sui told the probation office that he was on his way to a shopping mall in minnesota with the checks.sui companion indicated that they planned to buy as much merchandise as possible at the minnesota mall and then bring it back to new york to sell it.sui did not object to these portions of the psr.in july,sui was sentenced to months imprisonment and ordered to pay in restitution.
immigration proceedings 
as a result of this conviction,the immigration and naturalization service ins instituted removal proceedings against sui,charging that he was subject to removal pursuant to a a iii as an alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in the immigration and naturalization act ina,a that definition section of the ina lists subsections,each identifying one or more offenses qualifying as an aggravated felony.however,the initial ins document charging sui,dated october,did not identify the particular aggravated felony statutory subsection under which the ins sought sui removal.in july,the ij,rejecting the ins position,determined that sui conviction did not fall within the definition of an aggravated felony contained in subsection d of a,that is,an offense described in section of title relating to laundering of monetary instruments or section of that title relating to engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specific unlawful activity if the amount of the funds exceeded.the ij then adjourned the hearing to give the ins time to amend the charging document to identify other charges that would qualify as an aggravated felony.
on december,the ins served a new charging document on sui,which alleged that he was subject to removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as described in subsection m i of a,that is,an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to victims exceeds.thereafter,at a hearing in march,the ij also asked for briefing regarding whether the conviction fell under subsection g as a theft offense or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year and whether the conviction might fall under any other subsection of a 
in may,the ins submitted a brief to the ij arguing that sui was removable both under subsection g and under subsections m i and u of a.subsection u provides that a conviction for an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the offenses described in the other subsections of a is an aggravated felony conviction.although the actual loss to victims in sui case was only,the ins argued that sui conviction should be understood as an attempt to undertake a crime of fraud or deceit in which the loss to victims would exceed.sui responded to these arguments in writing and at a hearing in early june.on june,the ij held in a written opinion that even though the actual loss to victims in sui case was less than,sui conviction constituted an aggravated felony under subsections u and m i,considered together,as an attempt to commit an offense involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to victims would be over.in addition,the ij rejected the ins subsection g argument.the ij thereafter ordered sui removal,and sui motion for reconsideration was denied.the bia accepted the ij analysis and dismissed sui appeal.this petition for review followed.
ii.analysis 
in his petition,sui argues to us principally that he is not removable under subsection u of a as it relates to subsection m i because even if his conduct in fact constituted an attempt to defraud victims of more than,he was not convicted of an offense denominated as an attempt,and therefore subsection u is inapplicable.he also argues that the ins charging documents failed to notify him of the charges against him in violation of the constitution and federal regulations.because we conclude,for reasons somewhat different from sui,that sui is not removable pursuant to subsection u,we do not reach the constitutional question.
jurisdiction 
the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction to review any final removal order against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.a c.however,this court retains jurisdiction to review the underlying jurisdictional fact at,whether sui has been convicted of an aggravated felony.bell reno,cir.the jurisdictional inquiry thus merges with the question on the merits if sui is in fact removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony as defined by subsection u and subsection m i,we must dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction,while if he is not removable under these subsections,we may exercise jurisdiction and vacate the order of removal.see ye ins,cir.
before turning to the merits,we must address the ins contention that sui has waived his argument regarding the inapplicability of subsection u.the ins asserts that sui never claimed before the ij or the bia that subsection u did not apply to him because he had not been formally convicted of an attempt to commit a crime.
during the ins proceeding,in reply to the ins contention that under in re onyido,int,wl bia,sui was removable pursuant to subsection u,he argued that onyido was not controlling in his case.sui argument stressed that in onyido,the alien found deportable under subsection u had actually presented a fraudulent insurance claim for payment,thus taking a substantial step toward commission of the ultimate fraud,rather than merely possessing the fraudulent materials.sui also argued in his brief that in onyido,attempt was a lesser included offense of the fraud crime of which the alien had been convicted,which was not true in sui case.similarly,in oral argument before the ij,sui counsel emphasized the difference between sui possession of counterfeit checks and onyido actions,arguing that possession,in contrast to presenting a false claim,did not constitute a substantial step toward commission of the fraud crime.while sui did not explicitly argue before the ij that he had not been formally charged with the crime of attempt,he clearly argued that his conviction did not constitute an attempt under subsection u,and he also argued that attempt was not a lesser included offense under his statute of conviction.
in his appeal to the bia,sui simply stated that t he ij erred as a matter of law by finding that respondent is an aggravated felon and pretermitting all applications for relief and noted that he reserved all constitutional issues.he did not file a memorandum in support of his appeal prior to the deadline set by the bia nevertheless,by filing his appeal and arguing that the ij erred as a matter of law in finding that sui was an aggravated felon,which the ij found pursuant to subsection u,we find that sui sufficiently preserved his argument that his conviction did not constitute an attempt.this conclusion is supported by the decision of the bia,which explicitly addressed whether sui actions constituted an attempt to commit the fraud defined in subsection m i.we therefore find that sui has not waived his arguments regarding the applicability of subsection u.
standard of review 
our research has disclosed no published opinion considering whether an alien may be removed pursuant to subsections u and m i when he or she has not been convicted specifically of an offense formally denominated as an attempt,but only of another offense involving fraud or deceit,where the facts related to that other offense arguably permit the conclusion that he or she did attempt to defraud victims of more than.a divided bia,however,answered this question in the affirmative by a vote of to in onyido,holding that an alien who was convicted of submitting a false insurance claim in the amount of with intent to defraud was deportable under subsection u and subsection m i although no actual loss had occurred and the alien had not formally been convicted of an attempt to commit a crime.int.at.in affirming the ij decision in the present case,the bia relied on onyido,and the ins argues that the bia interpretation of the ina in onyido and in the present case is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.sui,on the other hand,argues that the question of whether he is removable pursuant to subsection u is a pure question of law and thus subject to de novo review.the first question we must face,therefore,is the level of deference to which the bia conclusions and interpretations are entitled in this case.
as is,chevron requires reviewing courts to defer to an agency interpretation of the statute it administers when the intent of congress is unclear and the agency interpretation is reasonable.see bell reno,at.nevertheless,several circuits have concluded,either implicitly or explicitly,that the bia determination that a particular conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony is entitled to no particular deference.see ins,cir reno,cir ins,cir ins,cir ramsey ins,cir but see le united states attorney general,cir.the ninth circuit comes to this conclusion by reasoning that since the bia has no special expertise in interpreting state and federal criminal statutes and since interpretation of these statutes has not been consigned to bia discretion,reviewing courts do not owe deference to the bia analysis of these statutes and their application to the immigration laws,at,at but see ins,cir.other circuits have held that since the question of whether a conviction is an aggravated felony is a jurisdictional analysis under the iirira,the issue is reviewed de novo,since the determination of jurisdiction is exclusively for the court to decide,at see also,at.
while this court has not previously addressed the role of chevron deference in reviewing an aggravated felony determination made by the bia,it has recently considered analogous questions in reviewing the bia determination that an alien was removable pursuant to a e i because he had been convicted of a crime of domestic violence,sutherland reno,cir,and pursuant to a a ii because he had been convicted of multiple crimes involving moral turpitude,michel ins,cir.in michel,we affirmed the bia interpretation of the term moral turpitude under the chevron standard,finding that the bia had considered its interpretation in a reasoned and detailed fashion and that its interpretation was reasonable.at.nevertheless,in determining whether the elements of a conviction under new york law for possession of stolen property met the bia interpretation of moral turpitude,we undertook de novo review.this is because where the bia is interpreting the ina,chevron deference is warranted,but where the bia is interpreting state or federal criminal laws,we must review its decision de novo since the bia is not charged with the administration of these laws.michel,at.this conclusion was reaffirmed in sutherland,at.
we believe the reasoning set out in michel and sutherland is equally applicable here.the bia has made two subsidiary decisions in determining that sui has committed an aggravated felony.first,the bia has determined that subsection u does not use the word attempt to mean conviction of an offense formally denominated as an attempt,but instead means conduct that satisfies a generally accepted definition of an attempted offense.second,the bia has,in effect,determined that the offense for which sui was convicted under a meets the bia interpretation of an attempt.the first decision involves a construction of subsection u entitled to chevron deference if reasonable.the second decision,as in michel and sutherland,does not,and we review it de novo 
the broad question before us is whether,as the bia and ij found,sui conviction for possession of counterfeit securities constitutes an attempt to commit an offense involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to victims is greater than,pursuant to subsections u and m i of a.as just indicated,this broad question involves two subsidiary questions what is the meaning of attempt in subsection u and does sui underlying conviction fall within that definition the first step in determining whether the bia interpretation of subsection u in this context is entitled to deference is to ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,chevron,at,since neither an agency nor the courts may disregard clear congressional intent.the ina states that any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable,a a iii,and,as noted above,defines aggravated felony to include an attempt or conspiracy to commit a variety of offenses,including an offense involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to victims exceeds,a u,m i.see supra note.while a conviction is clearly required,the term attempt is not defined in the ina,and legislative history does not shed light on the meaning intended by congress.
the second step of the chevron analysis requires us to consider whether the bia interpretation of the statute was reasonable.in rejecting sui appeal,the bia briefly analyzed whether sui conviction was properly categorized as an attempt,concluding that sui possessed counterfeit checks with the intent to deceive and that it was irrelevant that no actual fraud occurred this discussion does not clearly explicate the manner in which the bia interpreted attempt,though it necessarily implies that the bia concluded that attempt as used in subsection u need not be limited to convictions under statutes setting out crimes formally labeled attempts.
sui disputes the appropriateness of this conclusion,arguing that attempt must be understood only to refer to the substantive offense of attempt,rather than to convictions for other crimes that might involve facts showing an attempt to commit another listed offense.nevertheless,to the extent that the bia rationale rests on the conclusion that congress did not intend to allow the ina definition of attempt to vary solely according to the labels applied by the jurisdiction in which an alien was charged,we find it reasonable.as the ins points out,the supreme court addressed an analogous issue in taylor united states,d,when it considered whether the term burglary,as used in a federal sentence enhancement statute,meant burglary however a jurisdiction chose to define it,or was instead premised upon a uniform definition of the crime,which might not include some offenses formally labeled burglary.see id.at.the court concluded that it was implausible that congress intended the meaning of burglary to depend on the definition adopted by the state of conviction,since such a conclusion would mean that exactly the same conduct could have different results for sentencing if state labeling schemes varied.id.at.indeed,the general rule is that unless congress gives plain indication to the contrary,federal laws are not to be construed so that their meaning hinges on state law,because the application of federal legislation is nationwide and at times the federal program would be impaired if state law were to control.dickerson new banner institute,d.we agree that in the aggravated felony context,p ronouncing a flower to be a rose does not necessarily make it one.drakes zimski,cir.thus,whether or not it would be reasonable for the bia to interpret the ina as attaching varying immigration consequences to convictions based only on the labels given to them by various jurisdictions,it is clearly reasonable for the bia to proceed under the theory that the label given to the offense by the charging jurisdiction is not alone determinative of its status as an aggravated felony.
if the label given to the offense is not determinative,however,the bia must offer an alternative yardstick by which to determine whether a conviction renders an alien removable under the aggravated felony provision.there is no general statutory definition of criminal attempt in the federal system that we may assume the bia used,but onyido,relied on by the bia in the present case,provides some insight into the bia definition of attempt.there,the bia considered a conviction under an indiana statute that proscribed the presentation of false insurance claims with an intent to defraud.int.at.the bia noted that the statute did not require proof of loss,and therefore concluded that it encompassed both successful frauds and unsuccessful attempts to defraud an insurance company.id.at.the bia then cited an indiana case involving a conviction under the state generic attempt statute for the proposition that all that was necessary to show attempt to defraud under indiana law was an intent to defraud plus the occurrence of a substantial step toward the commission of the fraud.id.the bia concluded that the record of conviction demonstrated that both elements were present in onyido case.id.at.
it is somewhat unclear whether the bia meant by this analysis to indicate that it was adopting indiana definition of attempt only because this was an indiana conviction,thus implying that it might apply a different definition of attempt in another case,or whether it meant that the indiana requirements of intent plus a substantial step were the elements of a generic definition of attempt that it would apply in every such case.nevertheless,we believe the latter to be the more likely rationale underlying the bia onyido decision,given the preference in statutory construction for avoiding interpretations of federal law that hinge on state law,see dickerson,at,and given the bia general practice of apply ing a federal standard in determining whether a state offense fits within the aggravated felony definition,in re,int,wl,at bia.we believe that this generic definition of attempt by reference to the presence of criminal intent and the completion of a substantial step toward committing the crime is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term.
indeed,even were we to conclude that the bia consideration of the appropriate definition of attempt as used in subsection u was not sufficiently reasoned and detailed to command deference,see michel,at quoting chevron,at,we would adopt the same definition ourselves.see generally drakes,at finding it unnecessary to determine the level of deference to pay to the bia scant analysis and somewhat barebones conclusion when the court agreed with the bia in the result.given the absence of a general federal statutory definition of attempt,the most likely sources for a generic definition of attempt are common law and the model penal code.the classical elements of an attempt are intent to commit a crime,the execution of an overt act in furtherance of the intention,and a failure to consummate the crime.united states stallworth,cir.this court,when previously considering what must be shown to demonstrate attempt,has derived from this classic test a inquiry has the defendant acted with the culpability otherwise required for the commission of the crime he or she is charged with attempting and has the defendant engaged in conduct that constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the crime and that is strongly corroborative of the actor criminal purpose united states ivic,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by national organization for women,scheidler,d.this is substantially the approach undertaken in the model penal code,and represents a standard more inclusive than one requiring the last proximate act before attempt liability would attach,but less inclusive than one which would make every act done with the intent to commit a crime criminal.united states jackson,cir.the rationale given by this court in adopting a generic definition of attempt based on the model penal code definition would lead us to apply the same definition in this context,as would the rationale given by the supreme court in adopting a generic definition of burglary in taylor similar to that set forth in the model penal code.at.as in taylor,the modern meaning of attempt has evolved from the classic definition of the term,and the elements of intent and a substantial step toward commission set out in the model penal code make up the most commonly used attempt definition today.
having accepted the bia interpretation of attempt in subsection u,we must now consider whether the offense for which sui was convicted fits within that definition,int,at see also note,supra.on this issue,our review is de novo.the ins argues that if sui had succeeded in reaching the minnesota shopping mall,he would have cashed the traveler checks found in his possession,just as he had already begun to cash other counterfeit traveler checks during his trip from new york.in making this argument,the ins looks behind the statutory description of the offense and the charging document to facts set out in the psr regarding sui destination and his activity in cashing other counterfeit checks on his trip.but the bia undertook no such factual examination in its affirmance of the deportation order.it simply stated that t he conviction record shows that the respondent possessed travelers checks with the intent to exchange them with unsuspecting victims for either cash or items of value.this appears to be no more than a gloss on the language in sui indictment,which stated that sui possessed counterfeited securities of an organization,with intent to deceive another person or organization,specifically,approximately counterfeited chase visa traveler checks.thus,in contrast to the ins argument,the bia seems to have examined only the statutory description of the offense and the language of the indictment in determining that sui was deportable pursuant to subsection u.
this approach is consistent with both precedent and sound policy.both reviewing courts and the bia have applied a categorical approach in this and analogous contexts,generally looking only to the elements of the offense of conviction and not to the factual circumstances of the crime again,the taylor opinion provides valuable guidance.there,in considering the application of a sentence enhancement for the defendant prior burglary conviction,the supreme court considered whether the sentence enhancement statute required the sentencing court to look only to the statutory definition of the prior offense,or whether the sentencing court was also permitted to consider other evidence concerning the defendant prior crime.at.the supreme court noted that the relevant statute spoke in terms of convictions,not crimes committed,suggesting a focus on the statute of conviction rather than the defen
