after jose martinez was convicted of bank fraud,in violation of,the united states sought to remove him,pursuant to a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira.a a iii.ruling the conviction constitutes an aggravated felony,the immigration judge ij sustained the removability charge and denied martinez statutory eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility.both on direct appeal and in denying a joint motion to reconsider,the board of immigration appeals bia agreed with the ij.martinez maintains his conviction is not an aggravated felony and,in the alternative,he is eligible to seek a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility.denied in part granted in part remanded.
born in argentina,martinez,at age twelve,was admitted to the united states as a visitor in.ten years after that admission entry,he adjusted his status,under amnesty provisions of ina,to that of a lawful permanent resident.martinez married an american citizen,in,by whom he has two children.
both before and after he became married,martinez worked as an clerk at a management firm in new york.in that employment,martinez illegally took checks and money orders,altered the payees,and deposited the instruments in personal accounts he maintained.martinez both withdrew,and wrote checks against,those funds.
in june,when his criminal actions were discovered,martinez pleaded guilty in new york district court to one count of bank fraud,in violation of.he was sentenced that december to serve five months in prison,followed by five months of home detention and supervised release.martinez was also ordered to pay approximately in restitution.
after martinez served his prison term but before he served any of his home detention,customs officials took him into custody and instituted removal proceedings.the requested removal was premised on the assertion that martinez had committed an aggravated felony,as defined by ina a m i,and was therefore removable under ina a a iii.the ina has numerous definitions for what constitutes an aggravated felony.one is found in the subsection a m i an aggravated felony is an offense involving fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.a m i.martinez does not contest that the loss exceeded.
martinez was transferred to a detention facility in oakdale,louisiana,for removal proceedings.there,an ij held a hearing on removal vel non.
in february,the ij sustained removability,on the basis that martinez had been convicted of an aggravated felony.it ruled by the very terms of,fraud is an element of the offense.
the ij also ruled martinez was ineligible to seek relief under ina h.it allows the attorney general,in his discretion,to waive certain enumerated criminal grounds for inadmissibility for qualifying aliens.h.receiving that waiver would enable martinez to seek to obtain adjustment of status as the spouse of a united states citizen under ina.
concerning h,the ij ruled that martinez underlying conviction being an aggravated felony precluded a waiver of inadmissibility.in that regard,the ij rejected martinez contention that the statutory bar for h relief did not apply,finding in re,bia en banc,controlling.
the ij also rejected martinez claim to united states nationality pursuant to his voluntary registration in for military service in this country.conceding the nationality issue is foreclosed,martinez does not raise it here.
in july,by a brief opinion,the bia agreed with the ij ruling that martinez conviction constituted an aggravated felony.the bia also found in re rosas controlling on eligibility vel non for the h waiver of inadmissibility.
following the bia decision,instead of filing a petition for review to this court,martinez applied for habeas relief in new york district court,pursuant to.martinez ashcroft.after briefing and oral argument,however,the parties submitted a joint motion for reconsideration to the bia.it is not clear why the parties jointly sought reconsideration the record and martinez counsel at oral argument here suggest the original bia decision insufficiently addressed the presented issues.as a result,this matter was remanded to the bia,and martinez was released from the oakdale facility pending removal.
in april,the bia denied reconsideration,concluding that neither party identified additional legal arguments,a change in the law or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked.nevertheless,the bia also reaffirmed,in far greater detail,its previous determination and rejection of h eligibility.this greater detail may have resulted from the government joining martinez motion to reconsider.
following the bia second ruling,martinez new york habeas application was not acted on until may,when his application was transferred to the second circuit,pursuant to c of the real id act,c,stat.in november,the second circuit granted the government motion to transfer this matter to our court.
under real id act c,because martinez habeas application was pending on may,it is treated as a timely petition for review of the bia order,without the jurisdictional period for filing such petitions.
a ll collateral proceedings pending on may,when the real id act took effect,and transferred to courts of appeals under c,must be treated as timely petitions for review,no matter how long it has been since the board rendered its decision.collateral proceedings filed on or after may,however,will be dismissed outright the window for belated judicial review has closed.

martinez presents two alternative bases why he should be granted relief he is not removable because his conviction is not an aggravated felony,as that term is defined under ina a and he is eligible to seek a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility under ina h.as discussed infra,because both issues present questions of law,our review is de novo,ziglar,cir.
the bia ruled martinez removable for committing an aggravated felony under a a iii.the real id act amended a c to preclude judicial review of any removal order based,inter alia,on an alien commission of an aggravated felony.a c moore,cir,cert.denied,d.the act provides,however,that none of its provisions shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.a d emphasis added.
martinez presents a question of law whether his conviction was an aggravated felony,as defined by ina a.therefore,we are limited initially to determining our jurisdiction in doing so,we are limited to deciding whether the conviction was an aggravated felony under the ina.james gonzales,cir.if it was,as discussed above,we lack jurisdiction to review the removal decision.concerning the removal decision,martinez contests only whether he committed an aggravated felony therefore,in deciding jurisdiction,we concomitantly decide the basis for removal under ina a a iii.
in determining whether martinez prior conviction falls within the ina definition of aggravated felony,we first accord substantial deference,if warranted,to the bia interpretation of the ina.omari gonzales,cir quoting smalley ashcroft,cir.having afforded any necessary deference,we then review de novo whether the particular statute that the prior conviction is under falls within the relevant ina definition.id.citations omitted.
in his opening and reply briefs here,martinez contended because bank fraud does not require proof of two elements of and conviction is not an offense involv ing fraud or deceit,as required to constitute an aggravated felony under ina a m i subsection m i.this assertion,as martinez counsel conceded at oral argument here,is foreclosed by our court following decision,rendered after briefing was completed james,at the plain language of necessarily entails fraud or deceit.under our precedent,bank fraud is an aggravated felony under subsection m i.
alternatively,martinez maintains even with,under james,bank fraud meeting the definition of aggravated felony as defined by subsection m i,it also contains elements of theft,making it a hybrid offense.therefore,martinez asserts,in addition to the elements contained in subsection m i,there must be proof of the elements in ina a g subsection g,another definition.
subsection g defines an aggravated felony as a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a g emphasis added.according to martinez,because bank fraud is a hybrid offense,his conviction can not be an aggravated felony because he was sentenced to less than the year in prison required by subsection g.
martinez theory is premised on nugent ashcroft,cir.in nugent,an alien was convicted under pennsylvania law.ann.a,of theft by deception.nugent,at.based on this conviction,the bia affirmed removal based on the alien commission of an aggravated felony,as defined by subsection g.id.at.
the third circuit agreed subsection g was satisfied.id.at.the court did not stop there,however if we decide that nugent conviction is an offense that involves fraud or deceit as well as a theft offense,then to qualify as an aggravated felony under the ina it must also meet the requirements of subsection m i.id.at.the court held theft by deception also involved fraud or deceit and the alien conviction under that statute could not meet the aggravated felony standard,because the victim loss did not exceed,as required by subsection m i.id.at.nugent holding was premised on the following polysyllogism as defined at id.at 
depriving another of property by fraud or deceit is an offense subsection m.
the offense of theft by deception deprives another of property by theft subsection g.
therefore,the offense of theft by deception is an offense under subsections m and g.
the offense of theft by deception is an offense under subsections m and g.
a violation of pennsylvania theft by deception statute is an offense of theft by deception.
therefore,a violation of pennsylvania theft by deception statute is an offense under m and g

martinez urges our adopting this reasoning.in the light of james,this is his only remaining basis for challenging being classified as an aggravated felon.he asserted this theory before the bia on direct appeal and on motion to reconsider.it did not address it in either instance.
our court has not decided whether an offense may properly be characterized as a hybrid offense,which must meet the requirements of both subsections g and m i.see omari,at declining to address the issue,after ruling the underlying offense of conviction,conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property was not an aggravated felony because it did not involve fraud or deceit.assuming arguendo we would apply a theory,martinez conviction would have to meet the requirements for a theft offense under subsection g,in addition to those for fraud or deceit under subsection m i.on that basis,it would not constitute an aggravated felony because,as noted,martinez did not serve a term of imprisonment of at least one year,as required by subsection g.
as stated,pursuant to james,martinez conviction involves fraud or deceit.therefore,in assessing whether he committed an aggravated felony under a theory,we must determine whether his offense also constitutes a theft offense under subsection g.in doing so,we employ the categorical approach provided in taylor united states,d we look at the statute under which the alien was convicted rather than at the particular underlying facts to determine whether the offense falls within a particular definition of aggravated felony,as defined under ina a.omari,at citing reno,cir.
theft is not defined by the ina nor has the bia done so.as a result,we apply its commonly understood legal meaning.see james,at.the generic definition of theft offense is the taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership,even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.burke mukasey,cir formally adopting definition emphasis added citations omitted.
viewing the text of the statute in the light of this definition,it is not a theft offense under subsection g.section provides 
whoever knowingly executes,or attempts to execute,as scheme or artifice 
to defraud a financial institution or 
to obtain any of the moneys,funds,credits,assets,securities,or other property owned by,or under the custody or control of,a financial institution,by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,or promises 
shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
emphasis added.
applying the categorical approach,neither of the two prongs of,by its terms,requires property being obtained without the owner financial institution critical element,as stated above,of a theft offense.see also soliman gonzales,cir nugent,at noting theft requires property to be taken without consent.rather,under,the property must be obtained by fraud,which is a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment.see james,at quoting blacks law dictionary ed internal quotation marks omitted.the key and controlling distinction between these two crimes is therefore the consent occurs without consent,while fraud occurs with consent that has been unlawfully obtained.soliman,at emphasis added.
indeed,applies to situations in which a financial institution voluntarily consents to giving the perpetrator moneys,funds,credits,assets,securities,or other property,as a result of fraud.see,united states frydenlund,cir conviction for check kiting scheme united states farmigoni,cir conviction where defendant issued unauthorized letters of credit in favor of his cohort,who used the documents to obtain funds from other financial institutions.although always,in varying degrees,involves a deprivation on terms different than those to which the victim believed she was assenting,this hardly means the definition of fraud is subsumed within the definition of theft.given this distinction,it would be passing strange,for purposes of ina a providing definitions for aggravated felony,to hold a crime involving fraud or deceit is also a theft offense.
moreover,on a level,it is well to remember that martinez was not charged with the theft,the taking caption and carrying away asportation of the funds he unlawfully obtained through his employment he was charged,instead,with fraudulently obtaining such funds from a financial institution,under a statute that is materially the same as many other fraud statutes.accordingly,in the light of our circuit definitions of the terms,and again assuming arguendo we would apply the theory,a offense would not be a hybrid offense.
this is consistent with congressional intent.see soliman,at.as part of discerning such intent,we look to the statutory language as a whole,construing each section in harmony with every other part or section,because act s of congress should not be read as a series of unrelated and isolated provisions.id.at citing gustafson alloyd,d alteration and omission in original.we must assume that,by giving separate definitions to offenses involving fraud and deceit and theft,congress intended them to be different.see,united states nordic village,d.in this regard,we are mindful not to construe a definition within a to be so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words,thus giving unintended breadth to the ina.gustafson,at.quoting jarecki searle,d internal quotation marks omitted.
martinez conviction is an aggravated felony for purposes of the ina.therefore,we lack jurisdiction to review the removal order.
for his alternative legal issue,martinez contends contrary to the two bia decisions,he is eligible to seek a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility based on hardship from the attorney general under ina h.although we are without jurisdiction to review a decision of the attorney general to grant or deny a h waiver,h,our court has jurisdiction,as discussed supra,to review the question of law presented by martinez challenge to the bia construction of h.a d permitting review of questions of law notwithstanding review
