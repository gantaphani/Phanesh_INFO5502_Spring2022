rutilio hereinafter petitioner or petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals the bia order denying his asylum request and denying him relief pursuant to the convention against torture.petitioner is a native and citizen of guatemala who entered the united states in,having fled guatemala with his cousin because the gang mara posed a threat to their lives.previously,mara killed petitioner older brother,and gang members threatened to kill,his other brother and his cousin if they did not join the gang.as petitioner and his cousin attempted to flee to the united states,his cousin was apprehended by mexican authorities then deported to guatemala.shortly after the cousin returned to guatemala,mara murdered him as well.
while it is clear that petitioner has an objectively reasonable fear for his life if he is to return to guatemala,the bia determination that petitioner was not persecuted on account of his familial membership is supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we must deny petitioner asylum claim.furthermore,we find that the bia properly rejected petitioner convention against torture claim.for the detailed reasons that follow,we deny the petition for review.
petitioner was born in quesada,jutiapa,guatemala in.when he was,members of mara violent street gang formed in los angeles,california,but which now also has a strong presence in honduras,el salvador and recruited and harassed his two brothers,edgar then and rubilio then twenty.both brothers had served in the guatemalan army,and mara believed that they had military training and access to weapons.the mara threat,as is consistent with the gang practice,was to join or die.both brothers refused to join.
in april,members of mara killed edgar by stabbing him eighteen times at rio de paz,a town in jutiapa.witnesses to the death notified his family and identified the two killers.petitioner father filed a police report in may,stating the names of the individuals believed to be the killers.the killers were never apprehended.petitioner father declined offers from edgar military friends to take care of the killers after receiving letters from mara threatening his life,rubilio fled to the united states.in his affidavit filed before the ij in petitioner case,rubilio stated because of my family continued opposition to mara,gang members have targeted young male members of my family for recruitment because of our continued resistance,mara has threatened and attempted to kill off the young male members of my family.
in january,after petitioner turned sixteen,the first incident in which mara threatened petitioner occurred when members of the gang threatened petitioner and his cousin,elmer estuardo lopez mejia elmer in a park.in his affidavit petitioner stated that when members of mara confronted and threatened petitioner and elmer in the park,the boys,fearing violence,falsely said that they were going to think about joining the gang so that the gang would let them leave the park.id.at.he also stated that his parents were terrified that if i left the house,i would be killed like edgar.id.during his testimony before the ij,petitioner recounted the park incident similarly and stated that when he told his parents about it,they remembered what happened to my brother.id.at 
after this incident,the gang made continuous threats.during the summer of,mara mailed the boys threatening letters at their homes.the ij found that the letters stated the boys could either join mara and have everything,or refuse and you will be killed.id.the ij further recognized that petitioner and his father both feared that petitioner would be killed by mara,as his brother had been killed in.id.
because of such fears,petitioner father and elmer parents arranged for the boys to flee quesada,with the intention of fleeing guatemala entirely.in september,petitioner and elmer drove seven hours roughly northeast to the city of puerto barrios,guatemala to stay with a friend of petitioner father while the family arranged for the boys to leave the country.the boys stayed in puerto barrios for approximately one month,and petitioner did odd jobs while there to support himself.during that time in puerto barrios,petitioner did not have personal trouble with mara.however,while he was in puerto barrios,petitioner parents received two more threatening letters,the last one of which stated that petitioner would be stabbed like edgar if he did not join the gang and warned him that attempts to escape would be futile 
on november,the boys left for the united states,traveling northward through mexico.the boys attempted to avoid mexican immigration authorities because they feared being deported.on november,at a bus stop in oaxaca,mexico,immigration officials stopped the boys for questioning.petitioner escaped by running,but elmer was caught and deported.petitioner continued onward to the united states,and he was detained by ins near the texas border on december.
on january,while in ins custody,petitioner spoke with his parents by phone,and they informed him that elmer had been deported and killed by mara upon his return to guatemala.on february,mara shot elmer younger brother danny.
on january,petitioner was released from the ins children facility in texas into his brother rubilio custody.petitioner traveled with his brother to los angeles where he lived.petitioner testified that he left out of fear,because he saw people that resembled the mara and moved to virginia to stay with another family member.
on november,petitioner admitted deportability at his deportation hearing,but requested relief in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,relief under the convention against torture,or,in the alternative,voluntary departure.at his hearing on april,the ij heard testimony from petitioner and jan perlin,an expert qualified in the affairs of the guatemalan justice system.the ij also accepted numerous documents,including the aforementioned affidavits as well as other affidavits,copies of official documents,reports on guatemala and those concerning mara itself.
although the ij held that petitioner was credible,oral decision at and gave the documentary evidence great weight,id.at,he issued an oral decision declining to grant petitioner relief.based on the state department country reports and perlin testimony,the ij found that the guatemalan justice system is dysfunctional and that while the guatemalan government is willing to protect its citizens from these mar a gangs they are unable to protect the citizens.id.at.however,the ij found that petitioner would not suffer persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group,namely his family,because there is no nexus between the killing of edgar and the threats to petitioner or the threats to petitioner family,and that the petitioner family in this case does not constitute a particular social group.id.at.in short,the ij found that while petitioner had a reasonably objective fear of harm from the gang,he determined that petitioner was being recruited and harassed because he was a teenaged male living in the area,not on account of any family reasons.id 
additionally,the ij found that petitioner was not entitled to protection pursuant to the convention against torture because the torture feared was not government sponsored.while the ij acknowledged mara grip on the country and law enforcement inability to control them,the ij concluded that convention against torture protection does not extend to persons who fear entities that the government is unable to control.id.at.
on appeal,the bia affirmed.in re,no,slip op.at bia,per curiam.the bia held that,respondent has failed to establish that the harm he fears is on account of a protected ground.we also agree that respondent has failed to establish eligibility for relief under the convention against torture because he has not shown that the government acquiesces in the torturous activities of the gang,the mara.id.this petition for review followed.
our review of a bia asylum eligibility determination is most narrow.see gonahasa ins,cir.our standard of review recognizes the respect we must accord the bia expertise and its status as the attorney general designee in deportation decisions.bia,cir see also ins,cir en banc.specifically,bia determinations concerning asylum eligibility are conclusive if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted accord blanco de belbruno ashcroft,cir.we have noted,t he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency finding from being supported by substantial evidence.gonahasa,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.this standard is extremely deferential to the bia determinations indeed,we will uphold the bia determination unless a petitioner can show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,at emphasis added accord blanco de belbruno,at,at.finally,we review legal issues determined by the bia de novo.blanco de belbruno,at citing nwolise ins,cir.
petitioner argues that the bia ruling that he is not eligible for asylum is not supported by substantial evidence.the immigration and nationality act authorizes the attorney general to confer asylum on any refugee.b.a refugee is one who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a emphasis added.in short,to qualify for asylum,one must show a fear of persecution on account of one of the above described enumerated statutory grounds by an organization that the government is unable or unwilling to control see generally,at see also,at stating asylum is warranted if petitioner can show the government is unwilling or unable to control the offending group citing ins,cir.petitioner bears the burden of proof with respect to his eligibility for asylum.a ngarurih ashcroft,cir.regarding the level of proof required by a petitioner seeking asylum because of future persecution who,as here,has not demonstrated past persecution the statute is less clear than one might hope.the most reasonable reading of the statute,however,is that a petitioner must demonstrate fear of persecution based on a protected characteristic by a preponderance of the evidence.see zhu ashcroft,wl,at cir.
in this case,there is no dispute that petitioner has a fear of persecution by an organization which the government is unable to control.the ij found as much,and the bia did not disturb his holding.oral decision at has a subjective fear of persecution and based upon the evidence presented,there is an objective fear of harm by the ma ra gang to this respondent.see also chen ins,cir discussing fear.further,the ij held that the guatemalan government is unable to protect the citizens from the ma ra gangs,oral decision at,thus satisfying the third prong.
however,the ij rejected claim on the ground that there is no nexus between the possible harm to this respondent and any of the grounds listed under the act,id.at,and the bia affirmed because petitioner failed to establish that the harm he fears is on account of a protected ground.bia slip op.at at.thus,the narrow question presented for review is whether the persecution at issue is on account of petitioner status as a member of a protected group.accordingly,we turn to petitioner claim that the bia determination that he was not persecuted on account of his family membership is unsupported by substantial evidence.
the bia denied asylum claim on the ground that he does not face persecution on account of a protected ground.slip op.at.as noted above,to establish a viable asylum claim,petitioner must show his persecution was on account of his membership in a particular social group.a a.to make such a showing,the applicant must specify the particular social group,show that he is a member of that group,and show that he has a fear of persecution based on his membership in that group.see generally,at.petitioner argues that the bia conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence because he claims that there is evidence that he was persecuted on account of his membership in two particular social groups his family and the young male members of his family.
we have never reached the issue of whether family constitutes a cognizable particular social group within the meaning of the statute.however,our sister circuits that have considered the issue all appear to have recognized that family so qualifies.see iliev ins,cir citing cases fatin ins,cir accepting bia ruling in acosta,infra,that kinship ties qualify as a particular social group gebremichael ins,cir there can,in fact,be no plainer example of a social group based on common identifiable and immutable characteristics than that of the nuclear family.ins,cir perhaps a prototypical example of a particular social group would consist of the immediate members of a certain family,the family being a focus of fundamental affiliational concerns and common interests for most people.in re acosta,wl bia describing membership in a particular social group and stating t he shared characteristic might be an innate one such as sex,color or kinship ties emphasis added,overruled on other grounds by in re mogharrabi,wl bia.we join our sister circuits in holding that family constitutes a particular social group under a a thus,we must turn to the question of causation and determine whether petitioner persecution was on account of such family membership.
as detailed above,the ij concluded that there is no nexus between the killing of the respondent brother and the threats to the respondent or the threats to the family,and the bia affirmed,holding that petitioner has failed to establish that the harm he fears is on account of a protected ground.instead,the ij found that petitioner was being recruited and threatened by mara because he was a male living in the area,and not because he was a member of a particular family.petitioner,however,argues that the determinations of the ij and the bia ignored the applicable legal standard in reaching their conclusions.argues that the bia examined his evidence and erroneously required him to show that mara was motivated solely by petitioner family membership,rather than merely showing that his persecution had some nexus to a protected ground.thus,petitioner argues that while part of mara motivations may have been that he was a young male living in guatemala,the bia erred in failing to recognize that his family membership was another causal aspect of his persecution.
petitioner is correct that to qualify for asylum,the persecution feared falls within the statute so long as the illicit motive was a necessarily the sole the persecution.see lukwago ashcroft,cir a persecutor may have multiple motivations for his or her conduct,but the persecutor must be motivated,at least in part,by one of the enumerated grounds.citing chang ins,cir borja ins,cir en banc holding that proof of persecution solely on account of protected status is not required osorio ins,cir stating that persecution on account of does not mean persecution solely on account of see also girma ins,cir per curiam following borja and osorio and applying a mixed motive analysis.however,the immigration and naturalization act makes motive critical,and the applicant must provide some evidence of it,direct or circumstantial,at.as noted above,the statute requires an applicant to prove such motivation by a preponderance of the evidence.
in support of his claim that mara was motivated in part by his familial membership,appellant points to three pieces of evidence within the record first,the testimony of an expert witness,credited by the ij,who testified in an affidavit that mara teaches that refusing to join will result in their death or the deaths of their loved ones.second,the testimony of his brother rubilio that every young member of his family has been targeted by mara lastly and relatedly,petitioner testimony that mara sent a letter to his family with an explicit reference to his brother edgar.
our determination of whether an illicit motive exists such that the persecution falls within the ambit of the statute presents a narrow factual inquiry.in this respect,our hands are tied by the great deference owed to the attorney general determination.in this case,while petitioner presented expert testimony that mara targets family members of those who refuse to join,the expert further testified regarding mara reasons for doing so.he stated mara will target a family member of an individual who they have already killed for refusing to join the gang.this is because the gang fears that if it does not target that person,that person will seek revenge on mara by joining a rival gang.the ij,however,found as a matter of fact that mara did not target petitioner for such reasons,explicitly refuting that proposition.supra note.specifically,the ij stated 
there is no evidence that mara believed that petitioner would take revenge in,nine years later and it is,as i stated in my credibility finding,implausible that mara would believe that he could take revenge on them,and revenge was not mentioned in any of the letters.
there is no evidence that the respondent was going to join a rival gang and take revenge on the ma ra group.there is no evidence that the group believed he would join a rival gang.as i stated,if they believed that,it is the opinion of the court he would have been killed earlier.
oral decision at.similarly,the ij found that at least one of mara threats to petitioner did refer to edgar,but the ij concluded that it did not demonstrate that petitioner was recruited on account of edgar,as opposed to the fact that petitioner was a male living in the area whose brother happened to have been killed by the same gang.in fact,undisputed record evidence indicates that gang violence in guatemala has reached pandemic proportions and that over children are in gangs in guatemala and that young males are a target of gang violence.indeed,petitioner expert witnesses gave affidavit testimony stating that guatemalan gang violence is an epidemic and that boys and young men often face torture or murder if they do not join.see.
moreover,in examining the motivation of mara,the record reflects that the gang did not threaten petitioner concerning his brother death until,at the earliest,september,when petitioner parents received a letter from the gang instructing petitioner to meet the gang on november,at rio de paz,the place where the gang killed his brother.see id.this letter arrived after petitioner had left for puerto barrios and at least eight months after the gang initial contact with petitioner in the park in january.during this eight month period,from the initial incident to the last letter,petitioner testified that the gang continuously threatened him 
they said that if i did join them,that they were going to kill me.they said that i would have everything with them,money,drugs,everything.i never listened.i never paid attention to them.but by seeing that they were threatening threatening me by death and that i could leave,i we decided that i had to leave the country.
id.at.however,none of these repeated threats ever mentioned petitioner brother until after petitioner had fled his home.id.if the gang was motivated even in part by petitioner familial relationship,the evidence in the record should show that at some point during these continuous threats the gang threatened him because of his relationship with his brother 
on these bases,we are not compelled to conclude that the ij determination that petitioner failed to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence is one a reasonable judge could not make.on this record there is no evidence so compelling that no reasonable could fail to find causation.specifically,the only piece of evidence petitioner presents regarding causation is his brother affidavit,stating 
because of my family continued opposition to mara,gang members have targeted young male members of my family for recruitment.i believe that mara is particularly attracted to young male members of my family because of our demonstrated resistance to joining.because of our continued resistance,mara has threatened and attempted to kill off the young male members of my family.
emphasis added.besides that affidavit,petitioner largely presents evidence of correlation.in finding that petitioner evidence would not compel a reasonable fact finder to conclude that he was persecuted on account of his family membership,we recognize that a reference to an event does not demonstrate that what follows is because of that event.to illustrate stating that petitioner would be killed like edgar is not necessarily the same as declaring he would be killed because edgar was killed.rather,the reference to the ij be observation,not a statement germane to causation.
for mara to threaten petitioner in the letter by reminding him of edgar death is admittedly vicious and terrifying.however,the ij and the bia reached the factual conclusion that,in this context,such a comment was essentially a normative,anecdotal statement that put petitioner on notice that mara knew his brother was edgar,whom they killed nine years earlier.in that regard,the statement is materially different than one compelling a finding of causation,because your brother did not join our gang nine years ago,we will kill you.compare ins,cir reversing a bia determination and holding applicant was persecuted on account of his political opinion where threats to his life and business were made after the guerillas learned of his political orientation,and gebremichael,at finding persecution on account of family membership where ethiopian security forces persecuted applicant in an effort to force him to reveal his brother whereabouts.
thus,under our limited and deferential standard of review,we can not say that it is unreasonable to find as did the bia on these facts.we take pains to make our reasoning as clear as possible we do not find that evidence like the petitioner could not support a determination by the ij and the bia that was targeted on account of his family status among other variables.rather,we hold only that the evidence does not compel such a conclusion.for,of course,if an applicant seeks to obtain judicial reversal of the bia determination,he must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could find otherwise,at.stated otherwise,we do not conclude that the bia determination,that mara desire to harm petitioner was not on account of his relationship to edgar,is unsupported by substantial evidence 
petitioner further argues that he is entitled to withholding of removal and protection pursuant to article of the united nations convention against torture the convention or cat.see united nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.under the convention,the united states will not expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of,div.g,title xxii,stat.codified as note to see elien ashcroft,cir discussing implementation of the convention khouzam ashcroft,cir discussing the convention with exhaustive detail.the convention was made judicially enforceable through c,b.pelinkovic ashcroft,cir.
as we have recently noted in camara ashcroft,cir,convention claims are analytically distinct from asylum claims and judged under a different standard.in this case,to be entitled to relief under the convention,petitioner must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be if returned to guatemala,c,and such torture is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity,id.a emphasis added.
here,neither the ij nor the bia disputed that it was more likely than not that would be tortured if removed.rather,the bia concluded that petitioner failed to establish eligibility for relief under the convention against torture because he has not shown that the government acquiesces in the torturous activities of the gang,the mara.bia slip op.at see also oral decision at ij holding that was not eligible.the only question,then,is whether the conclusion that the government does not acquiesce in such torturous activities is supported by substantial evidence.
petitioner argues that the bia and ij committed legal error in focusing exclusively on the national government than that of local requires,at minimum,a remand to the bia for it to determine whether local government officials acquiesced in the torturous activities of mara.see br.for pet.at see also li chen zheng ashcroft,cir discussing acquiescence of local chinese officials in smuggler torturous acts ali reno,cir finding no acquiescence based on actions of the local level of a national police force.the government argues that petitioner is barred from raising the argument regarding acquiescence of local government because he failed to raise it before the ij or bia.br.for gov t at.the government argument is misplaced the record demonstrates that petitioner has continuously advanced his cat claims with reference to local as well as national authorities.see supp l app.despite this,even accepting arguendo petitioner argument that the ij and the bia committed a legal error by not analyzing acquiescence of local government officials,we find that the bia holding that the government does not acquiesce in mara activities is supported by substantial evidence.
acquiescence as used in does not require knowing acquiescence in or willful acceptance of such torture.see zheng,at.rather,a cquiescence of a public official requires that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.a emphasis added accord zheng,supra.to qualify for relief under the convention,petitioner must prove that the torture inflicted by mara would be carried out with the awareness of the local government officials.that awareness includes both actual knowledge and willful blindness.zheng,at citations omitted see also khouzam,at following zheng and applying willful blindness standard ashcroft,cir willful blindness suffices to prove acquiescence.citation omitted.here,petitioner made no such showing.
while the bia affirmed the ij,who acknowledged that the guatemalan government is powerless to stop mara and has a dysfunctional justice system,supra at,the record nonetheless lacks evidence in support of local acquiescence.rather,the ij is clear from petitioner other than reporting the death of edgar to authorities petitioner family did not seek help of the police or other authorities.see oral decision at petitioner did not go to the police with that letter because he believed that it would do no good to go to the police and feared that there might be retaliation on his family if he went to the police.while the record may show that,in the abstract,government officials know of mara activities,and are generally unable to stop them,it does not petitioner local government officials demonstrate willful blindness to the torture of their citizens by third parties.zheng,at.here,failed to make the appropriate showing that the local officials were aware of,let alone willfully blind to,the harassment suffered by petitioner,his cousin elmer,or other family members accordingly,we deny petition for review of his cat claim.
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that the bia did not err in denying claims for asylum relief or protection under the convention.accordingly,we deny petition for review.
petition denied 
rutilio should be granted asylum in the united states.he is the youngest of three brothers,all of whom have been threatened with death by the mara street gang in guatemala.one brother died after being stabbed eighteen times by mara,and the other fled to the united states as a result of the gang threats.rutilio fled guatemala with his cousin elmer lopez mejia after they,too,were threatened by mara.elmer did not make it to the united states he was caught in mexico and returned to guatemala,where he was promptly shot and killed by the gang.elmer brother danny was also shot by mara just a few months after elmer was killed.the immigration judge who was affirmed summarily by the bia found all of these facts,but he denied rutilio asylum after concluding that he was not persecuted on account of his family membership.the ij also denied asylum for the alternative reason that rutilio could safely relocate within guatemala,even though mara was hounding him as he fled.the majority affirms the ij denial of asylum on the ground that mara did not persecute rutilio on account of his family membership.i respectfully dissent because any reasonable would have to conclude the opposite.
the following facts,many of which come from rutilio testimony and affidavit,are undisputed.mara began targeting the family in,when rutilio,the asylum applicant,was eight years old.the gang approached rutilio brother edgar,who had just been discharged from the guatemalan army.as the immigration judge found,edgar military training made him an attractive candidate for recruitment by the gang.edgar knew he would endanger himself by resisting the gang,but he was very religious and for this reason would never join a gang.when edgar was attending a party in the town of rio de paz on april,two mara members killed him by stabbing him eighteen times the killers were reported to the police,who did nothing.after edgar death the gang targeted rubilio,rutilio brother,also an army veteran.the gang warned rubilio that if he did not join,he,too,would be killed.after consulting with his parents,rubilio decided that it would be safer for his family and for him if he left guatemala.rubilio fled to the united states in,the same year edgar was killed.
mara targeted rutilio in early,after he turned sixteen.rutilio and his cousin elmer lopez mejia were in a park in their home town of quesada when they were approached by a large group of mara members.the boys were told that if they did not join the gang,they would be killed.mara has a practice of targeting family members of persons it has killed for refusing to join because the gang fears that if it does not target the family members,they will seek revenge on mara by joining a rival gang.joining a rival gang,however,does not ensure safety.mara kills rival gang members,too,and if the victim bears the rival gang tattoo,mara will cut the flesh bearing the tattoo from the victim body and leave it in a place where members of that rival gang will find it.in the summer of,rutilio and elmer received threatening letters from mara at their homes.the boys fled in september to puerto barrios,a town seven hours away from quesada,their hometown.in puerto barrios they stayed with a friend of rutilio father while they prepared to leave guatemala.during the time roughly a month that rutilio and elmer were in puerto barrios,rutilio family continued to receive threatening letters from mara.the last two letters warned rutilio that if he did not join the gang,he would be stabbed eighteen times just as his brother edgar was.mara pressed rutilio for an answer,and the last letter instructed him to meet the gang on november in rio de paz,the place where edgar was murdered.the gang added that it knew rutilio intended to flee the country and warned that any such effort would be futile.this last letter prompted rutilio father to call rutilio and tell him that he must flee guatemala immediately.rutilio,like his father,feared that if he did not show his allegiance to the gang by meeting it in rio de paz,mara would find him and murder him.after mara targeted rutilio,he twice applied for a visa at the united states embassy in guatemala,but he was denied the document each time.
in november rutilio and elmer left guatemala and traveled north through mexico,by bus and by hitchhiking,in an effort to reach the united states.rutilio took only clothing,food,money,and a map.whenever the boys ran out of money,they would work on a construction job for a day or so,until they made enough to resume their travel.as they journeyed northward,the boys tried to avoid mexican immigration checkpoints however,at a bus stop in oaxaca,immigration officers spotted the boys and released dogs in an effort to catch them.the two started running,but elmer fell down,was caught,and deported to guatemala.within days of his return,elmer was shot in the head by mara.three months later elmer younger brother,samuel danny lopez mejia,was shot five times by mara.danny recovered from his wounds and was able to flee guatemala.in the meantime,rutilio managed to evade the mexican authorities in oaxaca,and he resumed his journey toward the united states.he arrived at the texas border on december,with only his map,and he was detained by the ins.rutilio contacted his family from the ins detention center in january and learned of elmer death.a short time later he learned about the shooting of his other cousin,danny.at the hearing in his removal proceeding,rutilio was asked what would happen if he was returned to guatemala.he replied,i would only arrive to receive my death.
the immigration judge found rutilio testimony credible with two exceptions.the ij rejected only rutilio opinions that the maras feared that he would take revenge on them because of the killing of his brother,and also that the maras would take revenge on rutilio because they feared he would join a rival gang.the ij explained that rutilio is a religious person and against violence,and therefore it would be implausible that the maras would impute to him the belief that he would take revenge on them.the ij added that if the gang had believed rutilio might take revenge on it for killing his brother,he would have been killed earlier.the ij further concluded that mara did not fear that rutilio would join a rival gang.according to the ij,no evidence suggested that mara believed rutilio would join a rival gang,and rutilio religious beliefs made it unlikely he would join such a gang.because the ij reasoned that mara was not likely to believe either that rutilio would avenge his brother death or that he would join a rival gang,the ij concluded that rutilio was not targeted on account of his family.rather,the ij determined that rutilio was being recruited because he was and a male in that area,and not because of any family reasons.the ij therefore denied the application for asylum.in the alternative,the ij denied the application on the ground that rutilio could have relocated to other areas of guatemala.rutilio could relocate,the ij found,because he drove seven hours away from home to puerto barrios,where he worked briefly,stayed there for one month and had no problem with the maras.id.the majority affirms based on the ij first determination,so it does not reach the alternative ground.
to be eligible for asylum as a refugee,rutilio must show that he has a fear of persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group,in this case,his family and that he can not reasonably relocate elsewhere in guatemala.b,a ins,cir.
no one disputes that rutilio has a fear of persecution the critical issue is whether his fear is on account of his family membership.as the majority correctly points out,for an asylum applicant to fear persecution on account of his family membership,the persecution need not stem solely from family membership.rather,the applicant falls within the statute so long as the illicit motive his family membership was a necessarily the sole the persecution.ante at emphasis in original.see also lukwago ashcroft,cir explaining that persecutor may have multiple motivations as long as one of those motivations is one of the enumerated grounds borja ins,cir en banc holding that persecution on account of does not mean solely on account of emphasis in original.the burden of establishing the persecutor motive is straightforward the applicant must simply provide some evidence of illicit motive,direct or circumstantial.ante at quoting ins,d emphasis in original.at the hearing the applicant must prove his persecutor motive by a preponderance of the evidence,the majority holds.id.of course,the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a.
we owe substantial deference to an immigration judge factual determinations we treat them as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.see also,at.bia determination that applicant is not eligible for asylum can be reversed only if the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.nevertheless,when the ij findings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the record,they are not sustainable on review.dia ashcroft,cir en banc.further,when an ij rejects an applicant testimony as unworthy of belief,he must provide specific,cogent reasons for doing so and in reviewing the ij credibility determinations,we must examine the record to see whether substantial evidence supports the determinations and decide for ourselves whether the reasoning employed by the ij is fatally flawed.gui ins,cir.the ij legal determinations are reviewed de novo.tarvand ins,cir.the ij decision to deny rutilio asylum can not be sustained under these standards.first,in concluding that mara did not persecute rutilio because of his family membership,the ij made a series of faulty inferences stemming from his finding that rutilio family is religious.see del valle ins,cir conclusions reached through unreasonable inferences are not supportable.second,the ij failed to apply the principle that persecutors may have multiple motives so long as a statutory motive here,family membership played some part in the persecution.when this principle is applied to the evidence,it compels the conclusion that rutilio persecution was on account of his family membership.
mara targets family members of those who resisted recruitment and were killed as a result because the gang fears that the surviving family members will either seek revenge on mara directly or join a rival gang.after finding that rutilio was not likely to take either course,the ij inferred that mara did not view rutilio as a threat.both rutilio and his brother,rubilio,testified that their opposition to mara stemmed from their religious faith.also,when rutilio father was approached by edgar army friends who offered to avenge edgar death,the father said he did not want to take vengeance,but would leave it up to the good lord.based on this and other evidence,the ij found that rutilio and his entire family are practicing evangelical christians who are opposed to criminal activity and opposed to organizations that violate the law and that rutilio was not likely to avenge his brother death or join a rival gang.this finding led the alj to infer that it would be implausible that the maras would harbor the belief that rutilio would take revenge on them personally.after inferring that the maras would not view rutilio as a threat,the ij then concluded that rutilio was not persecuted on account of his relationship to his brother.
the ij chain of reasoning is supported by speculation and faulty inference,not by substantial evidence.there is no evidence that the mara knew that rutilio was religious or that he was unlikely to seek revenge or join a rival gang.see del valle,at conclusions must be based on substantial evidence,not conjecture.as a result,there was no basis for the ij to suppose that the gang would have treated rutilio any differently than the family members of others it failed to recruit and then killed.even had mara both known of rutilio religious beliefs and believed that he was unlikely to pose a threat,it still does not follow that rutilio was not persecuted on account of family membership.indeed,it was consistent with the gang regular practice for it to target rutilio in retaliation for his brother refusal to join.moreover,rutilio opinions on why he and his family members were targeted are superfluous.the ij was free to reject those opinions,but they can not be used to defeat rutilio basic claim of persecution.at bottom,rutilio is only required to provide some evidence that the gang did in fact target him partly because of his family.rutilio has done this by showing a pattern of mara retaliation against him and his family members as a result of his brother edgar refusal to join the gang.
the ij also speculated that if mara actually believed rutilio would join a rival gang,then he would have been killed earlier.this statement has no support in the record and ignores mara interest in filling its ranks in addition to eliminating its enemies.rutilio was only eight years old when his older brother was stabbed,and an boy was no threat to the gang.when rutilio reached his mid enough to pose a gang forced him to show his allegiance or face death.in short,the record makes clear that mara knew that rutilio was the brother of edgar,whom the gang murdered,and the gang threatened rutilio with reminders of his brother brutal murder.the inquiry into whether rutilio was persecuted on account of family membership should begin with these facts.
moreover,the inquiry must proceed on the premise that family membership need only play a partial role in mara motivation.the evidence about mara general methods combined with its actions against rutilio and his family compel the conclusion on review that mara persecuted rutilio at least partly on account of family membership.rutilio brother,rubilio,stated in his affidavit that b ecause of my family continued opposition to mara,gang members have targeted young male members of my family for recruitment.i believe that mara is particularly attracted to young male members of my family because of our demonstrated resistance to joining.other evidence establishes that mara teaches its targets and young members that refusing to join and leaving the gang will result in their death or the deaths of their loved ones.indeed,after edgar,the original target in the family,refused to join the gang and was killed,both of his brothers were persecuted.the gang,even nine years later,recalled edgar death and told rutilio in at least two threatening letters that if he did not join,he would meet the same fate as his murdered brother.mara focuses its general recruiting on young males who demonstrate strength and courage,especially those with military training.rutilio,of course,had no military training,which indicates that he was targeted because of his relationship to his brother edgar.and after rutilio cousin and companion in flight,elmer,was returned by the mexican authorities to guatemala,mara promptly murdered elmer and shot elmer brother danny.the threats against rutilio,with repeated references to edgar,and the attacks against other family members,are undisputed.these actions demonstrate that mara remembers those who refuse to join with it and retaliates against them and their family members.a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that mara was motivated at least partly on account of family membership in carrying out this systematic persecution.
the majority dismisses the pattern of persecution against rutilio and his family as a mere correlation of events.ante at.explaining that a reference to an event does not demonstrate that what follows is because of that event,the majority asserts that threats that rutilio would be killed like edgar are not necessarily the same as declaring he would be killed because edgar was killed in other words,mara references to edgar could be observation s,not statement s germane to causation.id.though any reasonable target of the statement,join us or be killed like your brother edgar,would understand it as a threat based on a family connection,the majority treats it as essentially a normative,anecdotal statement that put rutilio on notice that mara knew his brother was edgar,whom they killed nine years earlier.id.the majority explains that had mara told rutilio,because your brother did not join our gang nine years ago,we will kill you,it would have compel led a finding of causation.id.thus,the majority concludes,rutilio largely presents evidence of correlation rather than evidence of causation or motive.i respectfully disagree.
in the supreme court acknowledged that an applicant for asylum can not be expected to provide direct proof of causation,that is,his persecutors motives.at.for this reason,a n applicant for asylum need not show conclusively why persecution occurred in the past or is likely to occur in the future but must produce evidence from which it is reasonable to believe that the harm was motivated,at least in part,by an actual or implied protected ground.borja,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.see also in re,i n,wl the task of the alien is to demonstrate the reasonableness of a motivation which is related to one of the enumerated grounds.internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,i n some cases,the factual circumstances alone may provide sufficient reason to conclude that acts of persecution were committed on account of one of the protected grounds.ernesto navas ins,cir emphasis added.rutilio presented factual circumstances sufficient to prove that he was persecuted on account of his family membership.as the ij found,after edgar refused to join mara,the gang targeted family members rubilio,rutilio,elmer,and danny over a span of nine years,sent letters to rutilio home that ordered him to meet the gang at the place where edgar was murdered,and gave rutilio the choice of joining the gang or being killed like edgar.
the majority tries to downplay mara threats to rutilio that emphasized the death of his brother edgar because those threats did not come until eight months after the gang initial contact with rutilio in the park in january.ante at.according to the majority,i f the gang was motivated even in part by rutilio familial relationship,the evidence in the record should show a threat that mentioned edgar at some earlier point.ante at.this argument overlooks the hiatus between the first threat and the final series of threats it also overlooks the context of the threats referring to edgar and the expert evidence about mara routine practice.after mara first threatened rutilio in early,he managed to avoid the gang for about five months by hiding in his home.mara renewed its effort to contact rutilio when it sent a threatening letter to his home in july and again in august.the very next month,september,the gang sent rutilio two letters warning that he must join the gang or be stabbed eighteen times just like his brother edgar.the last letter contained mara final ultimatum to rutilio meet us on november in rio de paz the place where edgar was killed and join our gang,or be killed like your brother.mara thus telegraphed a rutilio was being targeted because of family soon as it decided to bring matters to a head.this motive is corroborated by the undisputed affidavit of an expert witness who confirms that mara targets the family members of those it murders for refusing to join the gang.
in summary,rutilio offered ample evidence to prove at the hearing that he was persecuted on account of his family membership,and this evidence is sufficiently compelling on review to reverse the ij ultimate finding to the contrary.
the immigration judge also denied asylum to rutilio on the alternative ground that he could safely relocate within guatemala.for asylum to be denied on this basis,the evidence must establish that it would be reasonable,under all the circumstances,for the applicant to relocate.b ii melkonian ashcroft,cir.whether internal relocation is reasonable is determined by considering whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation any ongoing civil strife administrative,economic,or judicial infrastructure geographical limitations and social and cultural constraints,such as age,gender,health and social and family ties.knezevic ashcroft,cir.see also b.the regulations further provide that there is a presumption against an applicant ability to safely relocate once he demonstrates as rutilio has here that he suffered past persecution.b i b see singh,at.there is no need for an applicant to show countrywide persecution rather,the only relevant question is whether conditions in the country have so changed that the threat no longer exists upon his return.singh,at em
