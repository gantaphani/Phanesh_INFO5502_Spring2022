wen chiang chiang appeals from a district court decision in an immigration case,dismissing his amended complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.we affirm.
we recite the complex and protracted proceedings in the district court only to the extent relevant to the appeal.
chiang,a citizen residing in arlington,massachusetts,sought a fiancée visa to permit his fiancée,wen hua zhang who took the anglicized name amy,to come to the united states so that the two could be married.chiang skeirik,slip op.at.june.under a k i,a visa may be granted to a alien who is the fiancée or fiancé of a citizen of the united states and who seeks to enter the united states solely to conclude a valid marriage with the petitioner within ninety days after admission.
the regulations provide a process for securing such a visa.first,the united states citizen must file a petition with the secretary of homeland security,through the united states citizenship and immigration service uscis,for such a visa.see d second,if the petition is granted,the visa must also be approved by a consular official in the country in which the alien resides.see a.chiang filed a petition with uscis on september.
on october,the uscis approved chiang petition for a fiancée visa.on march,amy case was sent to the consulate in guangzhou,china the consulate for further consideration.
on march,chiang filed the complaint in this case.the complaint sought to compel uscis to act promptly on the visa application and sought damages on various theories.soon thereafter,sometime during the month of april,chiang and amy participated in a marriage ceremony of some sort in china.chiang skeirik,slip op.at.june.
on september,the consulate interviewed amy.chiang alleges that several improprieties occurred during the interview.these improprieties include making amy wait until she was the last person interviewed not allowing chiang to accompany amy into the interview room taking chiang file of documents and photographs and refusing to return them and acting in a concerted effort to deny chiang constitutional rights.at the conclusion of the interview,a consular official handed amy a piece of paper informing her that her application for a visa had been denied based on the conclusion that she did not have a bona fide relationship with chiang.this determination was largely based on the fact that chiang had previously filed applications for two other chinese women to come to the united states on fiancée visas.the consular official also advised chiang that amy case would be returned to uscis for review.
on december,the district court,finding a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,dismissed chiang complaint to the extent that chiang sought review of the reasons for the consulate denial of his fiancé petition chiang skeirik,d.the district court directed chiang to file an amended complaint on or before january.id.chiang then filed an amended complaint hereinafter first amended complaint,which asserted various counts against various government officials in their official capacities and against the united states.
four counts of the first amended complaint are at issue in this appeal.count i was a monetary claim against the united states,which chiang described as a claim,alleging that the employees of the consulate violated chiang fifth amendment rights by denying him due process during the processing of the visa application.count ii was also for money damages against the united states and was also described as a bivens claim,alleging that the employees at the consulate violated chiang fourth amendment rights by unlawfully seizing his photographs and documents.count iii alleged that various government officials in their official capacities,the consulate,and the united states violated chiang seventh amendment right to a jury trial because the consulate denied the visa application in retaliation for filing this lawsuit.count iii sought money damages and other relief.count iv alleged that processing delays and other actions of the consulate,apart from the decision to deny the visa application,violated chiang constitutional right to marry and sought damages and other relief against the united states.
following return of the petition from the consulate,on may,the uscis denied chiang petition.the uscis did not base its decision on a lack of a bona fide relationship the ground for the consulate action.instead,the uscis concluded that amy and chiang were married in china and that amy was therefore no longer eligible for a fiancée visa.
on june,the district court denied a preliminary injunction to require the issuance of the visa,finding that even under the assumption that the district court had jurisdiction to review the denial of the visa,there was not a likelihood of success on the merits.chiang then filed an interlocutory appeal to this court challenging the denial of the preliminary injunction.chiang subsequently dismissed that appeal.
the government then moved to dismiss the first amended complaint.on july,a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that the district court grant the defendants motion.specifically,as pertinent to this appeal,the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the first amended complaint for failure to state a proper claim for money damages against the united states for failure to state a claim because the complaint failed to allege a violation of chiang constitutional rights because the doctrine of consular nonreviewability precluded review of the denial of the visa and because the district court did not have jurisdiction over the uscis denial because it was done for a facially legitimate and bona fide reason.chiang skeirik,slip op.at.july.
on july,chiang filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and filed objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.in the proposed second amended complaint,chiang sought to add bivens claims against brian ferinden the vice general consul in guangzhou,china,individually,and to add bivens claims against two unknown consular officials.
on august,the district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge.on august,amy gave birth to a son,who now resides in the united states with chiang.on august,the district court denied chiang motion to amend his first amended complaint b ecause the proposed amendment would be futile and plaintiffs do not get repeated bites at the apple.on august,the district court dismissed the case pursuant to the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge.

the district court had jurisdiction over chiang constitutional claims pursuant to,which gives the district courts jurisdiction over civil cases arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.see burrafato dep t of state,cir stating that the federal courts clearly had jurisdiction over immigration disputes grounded on an alleged violation of first amendment rights of american citizens see also am.acad.of religion chertoff,d,abourezk reagan,vacated on other grounds.
chiang argues that his right to marry was violated by the denial of the visa,the processing delays,and other actions of the consular officials.even assuming that a united states citizen has a constitutional right to marry a foreign national,chiang has always been free to marry amy in china in a third country,or,possibly,in the united states by proxy there is no authority supporting the view that a united states citizen has a constitutional right to engage in a marriage ceremony in the united states at which the foreign national is present.the district court did not err in concluding that chiang had failed to state a claim based on this theory.
chiang also claims that the denial of the visa was improper because his traditional marriage to amy in china is not regarded as legal by the uscis for other imm
