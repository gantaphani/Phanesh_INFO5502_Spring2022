we have consolidated for decision two petitions to review decisions by the board of immigration appeals denying asylum.the petitions raise different issues,but are related in suggesting,together with other recent cases in this and other circuits,see,georgis ashcroft,cir kerciku ins,cir per curiam begzatowski ins,cir mansour ins,cir vujisic ins,cir ins,cir ins,cir hernandez reno,cir ins,cir,a pattern of serious misapplications by the board and the immigration judges of elementary principles of adjudication.in galina ins,cir,we stated forthrightly the board analysis was woefully inadequate,indicating that it has not taken to heart previous judicial criticisms of its performance in asylum cases citing cases.the elementary principles of administrative law,the rules of logic,and common sense seem to have eluded the board in this as in other cases.
we begin with niam,who was an official of the government of sudan when it was controlled by the umma party.the umma regime was overthrown in by omar.niam was promptly fired and the following year was arrested and detained for three and a half weeks,during which he was questioned to the accompaniment of death threats,slaps,and kicks.he was released after agreeing to tell the authorities if he left town but without telling them he fled to egypt and then to chad,where sudanese exiles had reconstituted the umma party.the party leaders persuaded niam to agree to return to sudan and act as a spy for the party and help members escape.but when he entered sudan from chad he was apprehended by sudanese border police.they took his passport and directed him to follow them to an office where he could retrieve it.he demurred and they let him return to chad,but without the passport.he left chad for nigeria,later returned to chad,and then went back to nigeria.but when he learned that a sudanese security officer had come to the nigerian town where he lived,asking questions about him,he managed using a new chadian passport to obtain a visa to study in the united states.once here,however,he did enroll in school,and so was ordered removed deported.
because he had requested asylum within a year of arriving in the united states missing the deadline by days,he was ineligible for asylum.a b a ins,cir.but he was eligible to request withholding of removal.t he attorney general may not remove an alien to a country if the attorney general decides that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b see tarrawally ashcroft,cir.but to obtain that relief niam had to show a clear probability that he would be persecuted if he returned to sudan.ins stevic,d tesfu ashcroft,cir.the immigration judge ruled that niam had proved this and so turned down his request,and the board of immigration appeals affirmed.
the immigration judge analysis was so inadequate as to raise questions of adjudicative competence.the first point he made in support of his refusal to grant withholding of removal was that there had been a regime change since niam being fired,arrested,detained,and beaten,so niam has nothing to fear should he return to sudan.there has been no regime change omar remains in power.next the immigration judge said that there is no evidence of recriminations following niam attempted reentry to sudan.the choice of the word recriminations is peculiar.if what the immigration judge meant was that the sudanese government did not react to niam attempted reentry,it is another factual error,since it was after the attempted reentry that sudanese security was asking questions about niam in nigeria.maybe what the immigration judge meant by no evidence of recriminations was that the border police who seized niam when he reentered the sudan let him return to chad rather than dragging him off to prison,but the immigration judge did say that nor is there any suggestion that the border police had access to a database listing all members of the umma party or all officials of the former regime.
the immigration judge also latched onto niam statement that the bashir regime was not interested in him personally niam acknowledged that he had been only a minor rather was targeting all members of opposition parties.the immigration judge said there was no evidence of this.he was again wrong.the state department sudan country report stated that the bashir regime has a practice of routinely persecuting political opponents government forces regularly tortured,beat,harassed,arbitrarily arrested,and detained opponents or suspected opponents of the government with impunity.and two members of the umma party,both sudanese who had been granted asylum in the united states,testified that niam would still be targeted by the bashir regime as a political opponent even after an he would be arrested at the airport or on the borders and disappear for a long time.
the immigration judge stated that even if it were established that the government persecutes all opposition party members,niam admitted that he has not been active in the omma sic party since his arrival in the united states.this is a non sequitur.if the regime is after all opposition party members,it is irrelevant whether a member of an opposition party is active,especially when he in a foreign country.moreover,niam did come to the until and for some and maybe all of the seven preceding years since he had left sudan he had been active in the affairs of the umma party.remember that the party had sent him back to sudan to spy for it.furthermore,niam attended graduate school in nigeria during this period with financial assistance from the party.
finally,the immigration judge thought it significant that niam remaining relatives in sudan had not been persecuted.however,those relatives are women,who were never active in political affairs.niam two brothers,who were,also fled the country.the immigration judge did not discuss the distinction.his analysis flatly failed to engage with the evidence presented to him.
on niam appeal from the immigration judge decision,the board of immigration appeals noted that the immigration judge had incorrectly identified the regime in power in sudan during his arrest.but the board declared the error harmless,without,however,explanation.so far as appears,the board did not notice any of the immigration judge other errors.
when the board writes an opinion,the opinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining.ins ventura,d per curiam begzatowski ins,supra,at.when as in this case the board opinion merely supplements the immigration judge opinion,the latter opinion as supplemented by the board opinion becomes the basis for review.angoucheva ins,cir per curiam krouchevski ashcroft,cir.so it as if the immigration judge,after writing his opinion,had,perhaps in response to a motion for reconsideration,discovered his error about the regime,acknowledged it,but pronounced it harmless.e russell delco remy division of general motors,cir charles daley,cir.the difficulty with applying the analogy to this case is that the remainder of the immigration judge opinion is riven with errors as well,as we have seen,and these were not noticed by the board and so the board conclusion that the one error it did catch was harmless does not validate the immigration judge decision to deny niam relief.
sudan terrible human rights,state department,report on human rights practices in sudan human rights watch,world report for sudan,amnesty international,sudan no impunity for torturers,http sudan peace act,stat,the acts of the government of sudan constitute genocide and congress hereby condemns the government of sudan overall human rights record which the immigration judge acknowledged,suggests that niam is likely to be persecuted should he return to sudan.for once the sudanese authorities discover who he is,they will realize that he violated the terms of his release,they will in all likelihood take him in for questioning,and,given the methods that sudanese interrogators use,they will no doubt elicit a confession that he tried to reenter sudan to spy for the umma p
