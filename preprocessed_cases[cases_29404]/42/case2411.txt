the petitioner sought asylum in the united states on the ground that if he is returned to cameroon,his native country,he is likely to be persecuted because of his political opinions.the board of immigration appeals affirmed the immigration judge denial of asylum,agreeing that the judge was entitled to disbelieve the petitioner.the petitioner testified that when living in cameroon he was politically active in parties that advocate but do not attempt to achieve by violence or other unlawful means secession of the southern part of the country,see,piet konings,opposition and change in africa the social democratic front in cameroon,commonwealth comparative politics,dep t of state,country reports on human rights,cameroon secessionist minority anglophone group silenced,irin humanitarian news and analysis,www.irinnews.org report.aspx report id visited,and that as a result of his activity he was arrested many times,repeatedly detained,and often beaten and otherwise tortured.had the immigration judge believed his narrative,the petitioner would have been found to be a victim of persecution on the ground of his political beliefs and would therefore have been entitled to a presumption that his fear of persecution if he is returned to cameroon is well founded.b gomes gonzales,cir.
judicial review of a credibility determination is limited,especially when it is based on the witness demeanor,which the reviewing court can not review,or is made by a jury,which does not give reasons for its judgment.credibility assessments can embody a struggle between norms of subjective and objective.subjective assessments are highly personal to the,dependent on personal judgment,perceptions,and disposition,and often lacking in articulated logic.they are very difficult to review and are likely to be inconsistent from one to another.michael kagan,is truth in the eye of the beholder objective credibility assessment in refugee status determination,geo.immigration.yet we noted in iao gonzales,cir,that immigration judges insensitivity to the difficulty of basing a determination of credibility on the demeanor of a person from a culture remote from the american is a disturbing feature of many immigration cases,and in djouma gonzales,cir,that immigration judges often lack the cultural competence to base credibility determinations on an immigrant demeanor.
in a case such as this,in which the basis for the evaluation of the witness credibility is set forth in detail by the trier of fact and has nothing to do with demeanor but consists instead of inconsistencies or falsehoods in the witness testimony that the trier of fact enumerates in his opinion,the reviewing court has more than suspicion to work with in deciding whether the determination of credibility was reasonable.gao board of immigration appeals,cir credibility determinations that are based on the ij analysis of testimony,as opposed to demeanor,are granted less deference chen dep t of justice,cir arulampalam ashcroft,cir ins,cir.as the supreme court has explained,when findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses,rule a of the civil rules demands even greater deference to the trial court findings for only the trial judge can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener understanding of and belief in what is said.this is not to suggest that the trial judge may insulate his findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations,for factors other than demeanor and inflection go into the decision whether or not to believe a witness.documents or objective evidence may contradict the witness story or the story itself may be so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable factfinder would not credit it.where such factors are present,the court of appeals may well find clear error even in a finding purportedly based on a credibility determination.anderson city of bessemer,d.
review still is deferential in such a case,as we implied in posing the question as whether the determination of credibility was reasonable,not whether it was correct.indeed,the standard of review remains the same reasonable or,the more conventional but equivalent formula,supported by substantial evidence even if the determination is based entirely on documents rather than live testimony,onsongo gonzales,cir sterkaj gonzales,cir.it is merely that,as suggested by the supreme court in anderson,the reviewing court is in a better position to decide whether the credibility determination was reasonable if the determination was based entirely on documentary evidence.see also hanaj gonzales,cir kourski ashcroft,cir ashcroft,cir.
in recent years an avalanche of asylum claims has placed unbearable pressures on the grossly understaffed immigration court,and we and other courts have frequently reversed the credibility determinations made by immigration judges and affirmed by the also sorely overworked board of immigration appeals,tarraf gonzales,cir benslimane gonzales,cir solomon gonzales,cir fiadjoe attorney general of united states,cir ins,cir.an article by edward grant,laws of intended consequences iirira and other unsung contributors to the current states of immigration litigation,cath,reports that of the judicial reversals of asylum decisions in the first two months of involved problems with credibility determinations.grant criticizes these reversals,yet he member of the board of immigration discovered to have decided more than immigration cases in one day,requiring a decision nearly every minutes if he worked a day without a break.lisa getter jonathon peterson,speedier rate of deportation rulings assailed,los angeles times,www.usdoj.gov eoir press speedierrate.visited.if he worked eight hours and took a lunch break,he had no more than minutes per case.
deference is earned it is not a birthright.repeated egregious failures of the immigration court and the board to exercise care commensurate with the stakes in an asylum case can be understood,but not excused,as consequences of a crushing workload that the executive and legislative branches of the federal government have refused to alleviate.
in this case there were a number of inconsistencies between the petitioner testimony at the immigration hearing and the written statement that he had submitted earlier in support of his application for asylum,and in addition the documentary evidence that he submitted contained anomalies.a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that the petitioner had lied about his political activities in cameroon and their consequences.but the immigration judge made a number of mistakes,uncorrected by the board,in his assessment of the evidence,and we can not be confident that had he not made those mistakes he still would have disbelieved the petitioner.so although the doctrine of harmless error is applicable to judicial review of immigration decisions,ahmed ashcroft,cir ngarurih ashcroft,cir,as to other administrative review,keys barnhart,cir,it can not save the day for the government in this case.
the immigration judge failed to distinguish between material lies,on the one hand,and innocent mistakes,trivial inconsistencies,and harmless exaggerations,on the other hand.in effect,he applied the discredited doctrine of falsus in uno,falsus in omnibus false in one thing,false in all things,which wigmore called primitive psychology,john wigmore,a students textbook of the law of evidence,a characterization that we endorsed in united states schimmel,cir an absolutely false maxim of life.wigmore,evidence in trials at common law,james chadbourn,ed see also yongo ins,cir united states weinstein,cir friendly,virginian ry.armentrout,cir.anyone who has ever tried a case or presided as a judge at a trial knows that witnesses are prone to fudge,to fumble,to misspeak,to misstate,to exaggerate.if any such pratfall warranted disbelieving a witness entire testimony,few trials would get all the way to judgment.
it is true that the real id act allows an immigration judge in asylum cases to consider,in determining credibility,falsehoods or inaccuracies without regard to whether an inconsistency,in
