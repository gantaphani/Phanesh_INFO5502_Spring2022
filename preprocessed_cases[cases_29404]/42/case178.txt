javed iqbal khattak,along with his wife naheed alam khattak and their children fatima javed and shahbaz khan,all natives and citizens of pakistan,petition for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming an immigration judge ij denial of their joint application for asylum 
javed iqbal khattak,age hereinafter khattak,was born in the nowshera district in pakistan northwest frontier province,now known as the khyber pakhtunkhwa province.until,khattak and his family lived in narri,a village outside the nowshera district principal city which is also named nowshera.khattak owned a marble business in nowshera his wife naheed worked as a schoolteacher in narri and the family owned agricultural land nearby on which they raised vegetables,wheat,and sugarcane for additional income.khattak also owned and continues to own a house in pakistan capital,islamabad,which he rents out according to his and his wife testimony,khattak acquired the house in but lived in islamabad only briefly before returning to nowshera when his father became ill.
khattak is an active member of the awami national party anp,which he describes as a secular alternative to the taliban.according to his testimony in immigration court as well as documentary materials that he appended to his asylum application,khattak has been a member of the anp for approximately years and was the president of the local anp chapter for about years.he also served as mayor of khairabad,a municipality of people that evidently includes the village of narri,from to 
more recently,khattak served as vice president of the pakistan international human rights organization and,starting in august,as a member of the nowshera peace committee.that month,he began working for the peace committee as a volunteer special police officer his task was to tell people and advise people that the fight that the taliban are fighting is not a fight of islam.he spread this message at the local mosque and at hujras,or social spaces.khattak stated that volunteer special police officers like himself are authorized to carry weapons,as he did,but that he never had to use his weapon in.
in march or april of,according to affidavits by khattak and his wife naheed,an anonymous caller placed two telephone calls to the family home within the span of three days.naheed answered the phone on both occasions.the first time,the caller asked for khattak,and when naheed said that her husband was not home,the caller hung up.the second time,the caller asked naheed who she was,and when she identified herself as khattak wife,the caller told her to tell khattak that he should stop his activities against the taliban because they know everything and it will be very bad for him and his family.
khattak also stated in his affidavit that a fter the phone calls,the taliban began sending threatening letters to the schools that his children attended,and that t he principal of his daughter school asked that he and his wife start sending their daughter to school wearing a burka to avoid any problems.khattak wife offered a similar account in her affidavit 
the threatening calls to the family home coincided with a series of attacks against anp members across pakistan.in early,approximately political activists including anp members as well as members of three other parties were killed in karachi during interparty clashes.in february,an anp member of the provincial assembly was killed by a bomb in peshawar,the capital of the khyber pakhtunkhwa province.the following month,a senior anp leader in that province narrowly escaped an assassination attempt,but four other people were killed in the incident.khattak also testified that fellow peace committee members received similar threats in the weeks before the two anonymous calls to his home.
at some point during the spring of,khattak decided to leave pakistan with his family and seek refuge in the united states on july,khattak,his wife,and their two younger children entered the united states on b visitor visas.the oldest of their three children,a son,is currently a student in england and did not accompany the family to the united states.on november,khattak,his wife,and their two younger children filed applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.khattak wife and children concede that they have presented no independent basis for removal and that their applications are dependent upon khattak.see a admission of asylee spouse and children see also id.f denial of principal applicant asylum claim also results in denial of asylum for dependents who have not submitted independent application.
taliban attacks against anp activists have continued since khattak and his family left pakistan.in december,an anp provincial assembly member was killed in a suicide bombing in swat,a district in the khyber pakhtunkhwa province north of nowshera.according to a state department report,dozens of anp activists were targeted for assassination across the province throughout.dep t of state,bureau of democracy,human rights labor,country reports on human rights practices pakistan.in april,at least people were killed in a suicide attack targeting an anp rally in the lower dir district,which is west of swat and also in khyber pakhtunkhwa.in may,the anp president was killed in swat,and the state department notes that anp elected officials and their families remain major targets of attack in khyber pakhtunkhwa.see dep t of state,bureau of democracy,human rights labor,country reports on human rights practices for pakistan,see also dep t of state,bureau of democracy,human rights labor,country reports on human rights practices pakistan.
meanwhile,the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against khattak and his family members in march.on may,an immigration judge in boston denied khattak and his family members applications for asylum,withholding of removal and cat relief and ordered them removed to pakistan the board of immigration appeals affirmed the ij order on december,and the khattaks filed a timely petition for review in this court.
although o rdinarily,we review the decision of the bia and not that of the ij,we examine the ij decision to the extent that the bia deferred to or adopted the ij reasoning.hasan holder,cir quoting bonilla mukasey,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.on issues of fact,we apply the substantial evidence standard and defer to those findings of fact that are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.perlera sola holder,cir quoting lobo holder,cir.on questions of law,our review is de novo but with appropriate deference to the agency interpretation of the underlying statute in accordance with administrative law principles.vásquez holder,cir quoting stroni gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.

where the applicant seeks asylum based on a fear of future persecution,he must show that he has a subjective fear of future persecution and that his fear is objectively reasonable.barsoum holder,cir.to meet this latter requirement,the applicant must either provide evidence that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled out individually for persecution or establish that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country of nationality of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant.b c iii see also sugiarto holder,cir.an applicant who seeks asylum based on a claim must show systematic or pervasive persecution of a particular group based on a protected ground,rather than generalized civil conflict or a pattern of discrimination.díaz garcía holder,cir quoting sugiarto,at internal quotation marks omitted.
even where an applicant shows an objectively reasonable fear of persecution,the asylum claim may be denied if the adjudicator finds that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of his country of nationality and that under all the circumstances,it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.b c ii see also castillo diaz,at.where the asylum applicant proves past persecution or shows a fear of future persecution,the applicant can rely on a rebuttable presumption that internal relocation would not be reasonable.b ii.by contrast,in cases such as this one where the asylum claim is based on fear of future persecution by actors albeit actors that the government allegedly can not control,the applicant bears the burden of showing that relocation would be unreasonable.id.b i.
before reaching a finding regarding the reasonableness of relocation,however,the adjudicator should consider a number of factors specified in the relevant regulation,including whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation any ongoing civil strife within the country administrative,economic,or judicial infrastructure geographical limitations and social and cultural constraints,such as age,gender,health,and social and familial ties.b.and the denial of an asylum claim can not rest on the possibility of internal relocation where n either the ij,nor the bia,explained how it would be possible for the applicant to safely relocate within his country of nationality.oryakhil mukasey,cir see also seck att y,cir case remanded where bia ignored substantial evidence indicating that internal relocation was unreasonable.
at this stage,khattak argues that he has a fear of future persecution based on his political opinions and anp activism he does not continue to press the argument that he suffered past persecution,nor does he continue to pursue asylum based on membership in a particular social group.the ij acknowledged that khattak has a subjectively genuine fear of returning to pakistan but held that khattak did not show his fear was objectively reasonable.
in explaining the reasons for her decision,the ij said that khattak appeared to have been targeted due to his work as a special police officer with the local peace committee,not due to his anp activism.the ij noted that khattak had been active in the anp for approximately years and that the taliban threats only began after he joined the local peace committee the ij seemed to believe that persecution on the basis of khattak special police officer status would not qualify as persecution on the basis of political opinion.matter of fuentes,d angers faced by policemen as a result of that status alone are not ones faced on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.the ij also said that khattak had not established the requisite connection to the pakistani government because the government was in fact taking on the taliban and mak ing inroads.finally,the ij said that even if khattak would be subject to persecution in the khyber pakhtunkhwa province,he and his family could safely relocate to islamabad.
the bia affirmed the ij decision,specifically stating that 
khattak had not shown that he and his family would be singled out for harm rising to the level of persecution if they returned to pakistan 
khattak had not demonstrated that there is a pattern or practice in pakistan of targeting political leaders 
khattak had not shown that the pakistani government is unwilling or unable to control the taliban,and the record reveals that the pakistani government has taken military action against taliban forces and 
khattak has not shown that internal relocation to islamabad would be unreasonable.
with regard to khattak claim that he would be singled out for harm on the basis of his political opinion the bia offered no analysis of its own,stating only that the ij properly determined that khattak has not met his burden.the ij finding that khattak would not be singled out on the basis of political opinion was premised on her belief that,under matter of fuentes,an applicant is not eligible for asylum if he is targeted due to his activities as a police officer.
this interpretation of matter of fuentes was squarely rejected in castañeda castillo holder,cir,which we decided ten months after the ij order in khattak case but nine months before the bia dismissed khattak appeal.matter of fuentes held only that police officers do not suffer persecution within the meaning of the asylum statute when they are attacked because they are or are viewed as extensions of the government military forces or simply because they are highly visible embodiments of the power of the state.at.but matter of fuentes did not hold that a police officer is ineligible for asylum if he is targeted due to the political views that he has expressed on the job or off.see castañeda castillo,at t he sheer fact of being on active duty is not dispositive under fuentes see also recinos castillo holder,app x,cir eligibility for asylum can be based on persecution that targeted an applicant personally even if originating out of actions undertaken while serving in a capacity quoting castañeda castillo,at cruz navarro ins,cir fuentes does not flatly preclude police officers from establishing claims of persecution or fear of persecution quoting velarde ins,cir.
matter of fuentes also did not address situations in which individuals may be labeled as police officers but perform police functions.see castañeda castillo,at the underlying concern in fuentes was that police officers can not be eligible for asylum simply because they were exposed to assault in the line of duty,as t hat is,after all,part of their job.here,while khattak was technically a special police officer,his primary duty on behalf of the peace committee was to persuade people to spurn the taliban,which is not a standard function.see shah holder,app x,cir fuentes does not apply to nepalese police officer who instructed villagers on human rights and antiterrorism concepts because u nlike a traditional police officer,he was targeted not merely as an enforcer of the government laws,but as an active political opponent of the maoists grava ins,cir fuentes does not disqualify asylum applicant who does not fear the usual job hazards of a law enforcement officer,but fears persecution on account of his political opinion.thus,the ij not only misconstrued the holding in matter of fuentes,but the holding in matter of fuentes does not even appear to apply to khattak case.
furthermore,in addition to his status as a special police officer,khattak was particularly prominent in his hometown as a member of the peace committee,a leader of a national human rights organization,a longtime anp activist and a former mayor.if khattak activities in one or more of these roles contributed to the taliban decision to target him,then the persecution the applicant fears is not a result simply of h is status as a police officer,but rather is a result occasioned by other factors more specific to the particular applicant.koudriachova gonzales,cir see also konan att y of the,cir distinguishing between police officers who are attacked because they are police officers and police officers who are attacked because they are loyalists.
to its credit,the bia correctly cited castañeda castillo and acknowledged that khattak status as a special police officer was not necessarily a bar to his asylum claim.but the board went on to say no more than that t he immigration judge properly determined that the lead respondent has not met his burden.despite the deference we give to the bia factual findings,we do not defer to cursory,summary or conclusory statements from the board.aponte holder,cir quoting onwuamaeqbu gonzales,cir internal quotation mark omitted.here,the ij only explanation for concluding that khattak fear of future persecution was not apart from the issues of government protection and internal relocation addressed below was that the taliban had targeted khattak due to his work as a special police officer rather than as an anp leader.yet even if that is true,it does not disqualify khattak from establishing eligibility for asylum.
the ij also did not offer any analysis of khattak claim,and the bia added nothing more on this issue beyond the statement that khattak had failed to meet the standard for asylum based on a pattern or practice of persecution against persons similarly situated to the applicant.rasiah holder,cir t he standard is demanding and in substance requires a showing of regular and widespread persecution creating a reasonable likelihood of persecution of all persons in the group.in light of our decision to send this case back to the bia so that the board can fully consider khattak claim that he will be singled out for persecution,we need not reach the question at this juncture.see avetova elisseva ins,cir regulation regarding eligibility for asylum brings the pattern or practice requirement into play only as an alternative to an applicant showing that he or she would be singled out individually for persecution quoting b.and where factual findings regarding a claim are insufficient,the better course is for us to remand th e petition to the bia rather than attempt to adjudicate the claim ourselves,as t he potential costs of a wrong decision on a pattern or practice claim are considerable.mufied mukasey,cir see also ahmed gonzales,cir o nce the court finds that a group was subject to a pattern or practice of persecution,every member of the group is eligible for asylum.
we must,however,address the ij finding affirmed by the bia that khattak has not met his burden of showing that the pakistani government is unable to protect him from taliban attacks,as khattak can not prevail on either his claim or his claim unless he establishes some connection to government action or inaction,perlera sola,at quoting harutyunyan,at internal quotation mark omitted.in support of this finding,the ij noted that there is a war going on involving the taliban,which she took to mean that the pakistani government is in fact taking on the taliban she added that the government continues to make inroads against the taliban,but she did not go on to explain what these inroads were.
yet although such military action indicates that the pakistani government is willing to take on the taliban,such action does not show that the pakistani government is able to protect its citizens from taliban attacks.see rehman att y of the,app x,cir ij finding that the pakistani government has been attempting to address the terrorist situation does not establish that pakistani government can control terrorist groups alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted see also lolong gonzales,cir e vidence of the government willingness to control the perpetrators of ethnic and religious violence in indonesia fails to rebut the overwhelming evidence of the government inability to control those forces.
the bia added little to the ij analysis beyond the statement that khattak did not present any corroborative evidence to demonstrate that the government of pakistan is unable or unwilling to protect him and his family from threats or harm by the taliban.but in fact khattak did provide an affidavit signed by people from the nowshera district attesting that they had advised khattak to leave the country for the safety and protection of his life which goes toward corroborating khattak claim that he would not remain safe if he stayed in his home region even if the affidavit does not go all the way to proving that claim.since the bia statement that khattak did not present any corroborative evidence is clearly contradicted by the record,we need not reach the question of whether khattak was entitled to notice of the need for corroborative evidence and,if so,whether such notice was given.see guta tolossa holder,cir reserving judgment on these questions so that bia may address them in the first instance.
finally,with regard to the reasonableness of internal relocation,the bia correctly concluded that khattak bore the burden of proving that relocation would not be reasonable it also appropriately noted that khattak owns a home in islamabad.the fact that an asylum applicant or an asylum applicant family member owns a home in another part of the country may support a finding that internal relocation is reasonable.see,wasef holder,app x,cir.the fact that the khattaks actually lived in islamabad for a time may also support a finding that they could relocate to the capital,although it is worth noting that the khattaks brief stay in islamabad occurred more than two decades ago.oryakhil,at fact that asylum applicant lived in northern afghanistan from to does not mean that relocation there would be safe decades later.and most importantly,the possibility of internal relocation will only defeat an asylum claim where the applicant could also avoid future persecution by relocating.b c ii see cendrawasih holder,cir.
here,neither the ij nor the bia addressed evidence in the record indicating that the taliban reach may extend as far as islamabad.and the state department country report for indicates that anp activists have been victims of targeted killings even outside the khyber pakhtunkhwa province.see dep t of state,country reports on human rights practices pakistan,supra noting that t here were targeted killings in karachi alone,and t hose killed included from the anp and other political parties.
moreover,while the relevant regulation sets out a nonexhaustive list of factors for adjudicators to consider when determining the reasonableness of internal relocation,b,neither the ij nor the bia made any mention of those factors.and while the ij and bia do not necessarily have to address each of the reasonableness factors explicitly,see.b noting that factors may,or may not,be relevant,depending on all the circumstances of the case,the agency must explain why the factors that cut against the asylum applicant outweigh the factors in his favor.see,kartasheva holder,cir w e may not affirm the bia decision when we can not conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial,when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes,including the body of evidence opposed to the board view.quoting gailius ins,cir second alteration in original see also aponte,at w e may not assume that the board considered factors that it failed to mention in its opinion.quoting daneshvar ashcroft,cir.
importantly,nothing that we have said so far should be interpreted as holding that khattak necessarily has met his burden of showing eligibility for asylum.the bia said that khattak did not meet his burden albeit without explaining why,and t o reverse the bia finding we must find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but compels it.ins elias zacarias,d accord jamal mukasey,cir.
elias zacarias sets a high bar for reversal as distinguished from remand in asylum cases,and we do not here hold that the evidence in support of khattak claim is so overwhelming as to meet that bar.for one thing,khattak testified that friends of his received similar threats in the weeks before the anonymous phone calls to his home,but it is not clear how many of these friends who received such threats ultimately suffered harm at the hands of the taliban.gilca holder,cir substantial evidence supported ij finding that vague threats addressed to the petitioner,virtually all of which were conveyed over the telephone by unknown persons,were nothing more than empty words.and while the record makes clear that the taliban have specifically targeted members of the anp including the president of the party,members of the provincial assembly in khattak province,and a senior minister in the provincial government,khattak is not himself an assembly member or a seni
